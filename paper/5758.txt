                                                         ABSTRACT




           Does   finance     affect    economic      growth?      A number       of studies     have identified         a positive


correlation     between     the level of development         of a country’s     financial    sector and the rate of growth


of its per capita income.           As has been noted elsewhere,          the observed   correlation       does not necessarily


imply     a causal      relationship.       This    paper   examines      whether    financial     development           facilitates


economic       growth     by scrutinizing       one rationale for such a relationship;          that financial        development


reduces      the costs of external finance to firms.            Specifically,   we ask whether           industrial    sectors that


are relatively     more in need of external finance             develop    disproportionately       faster in countries        with


more developed          financial    markets.      We find this to be true in a large sample of countries                  over the


1980s.       We show       this result is unlikely       to be driven      by omitted       variables,     outliers,    or reverse


causality,

    There is a large literature          - dating at le=t        ss far back = Schumpeter             (1911) - that empha-

sizes the links between           the state of development         of a country’s     financial sector and the level and

the rate of growth         of its per capita       income.      The argument        essentially     is that the services      the

financial    sector provides        – of reallocating     capital      to the highest     value use without        substantial

risk of loss through         moral     hazard,    adverse      selection,    or transactions       costs – are an essential

catalyst     of economic     growth.     The existence        of a correlation     between      financial    development     and

economic      growth has been documented              in a number of empirical            studies starting     with Cameron

(1967),     Goldsmith      (1969)     and McKinnon       (1973).       Economic     historians     have identified     spurts of

growth in certain countries            with the development           of specific financial institutions.        For example,

Cameron       (1961) and Gerschenkron             (1962) have associated          the economic      growth of France in the

middle of the nineteenth            century     with the est abolishment of the Credit             Mobilier. 1 Nevertheless,

some economists          have questioned         the interpretation         of these studies,      arguing    that correlation

does not imply causality.             Paraphrasing      North,     financial    development       does not cause economic

growth,     it is economic        growth.2

    In an important          recent    paper,     Levine and King (1993a)            investigate     the causality     problem

following     a post hoc, ergo pTopteT hoc approach.                  They show that the predetermined             component

of financial        development      is a good     predictor     of growth      over the next       10 to 30 years.        While

their paper does suggest that the observed                   correlation     is not spurious,     it does not lay to rest all

doubts      about    causality.     The sceptic    could still offer a number         of arguments.

    First, both financial development               and growth could be driven by a common                   omitted    variable

such as the propensity             of households      in the economy           to save.   Since endogenous         savings     (in

certain macroeconomic              models)    affects the long run growth rate of the economy,                  it may not be

surprising     that growth        and initial financial        development      are correlated.      This argument         is also

hard to refute with simple cross-country                 regressions.        In the absence       of a well accepted       theory


    1Adopting a diflerent tack, I{indleberger (1993) discusses the importance of finance to the outcome of wars
(for instance, Britain’s ability to mobilize financial resources after the Glorious Revolution of 1688 may explain
why, with one-third France’s manpower, it could defeat the French) and asks “Can Finance be relewnt to military
outcomes, as widely insisted on, but not to the course of economic development?”
    ‘The early studies have typically been cautious about their findings. For instance, Goldsmith (1969, p48)
writes “In most countries, a rough parallelism can be observed between economic and financial development if
periods of several decades are considered. There is no possibility, however, of establishing with confidence the
direction of the causal mechanism, i.e., of deciding whether financial factors were responsible for the acceleration
of economic development or whether financial development reflected economic growth whose mainsprings must
be sought elsewhere. ”


                                                                  1
of growth,        the list of potential      omitted    variables      that financial      sector development          might be a

proxy for is large, and the explanatory                 variables      to include   a matter       of conjecture       (on this see

Paxson,      1996).

    Second,        there    is a potential     problem       of anticipation.       Financial       development        - typically

messured      by the level of credit and the size of the stock m~ket                    (but see King and Levine (1993a)

for other proxies)          – may predict      economic       growth    simply because          financial    markets    anticipate

future    growth;      the stock market         capitalizes     the present       value of growth           opportunities,      while

financial    institutions      lend more if they think sectors will grow. Thus financial                       development       may

simply be a leading indicator             rather than a causal factor.

    To interpret        these correlations     in a more causal sense it is necessary              to identify the mechanism

through which financial development                  affects economic         growth and to document            its working.     Our

paper is an attempt           to do this.

    The fundamental            role played by the financial sector is to facilitate                 the reallocation         of funds

from agents (individuals)            with an excess of capital given their investment                  opportunities         towards

agents (firms)        with a shortage        of funds vis h vis their investment                opportunities.       This implies

that financial        development      has two effects.        First, by reducing         the transactions        costs of saving

and investing,         it lowers the overall cost of capital               in the economy        in general.      Second,      to the

extent      that finmcial      markets      and institutions        help firms overcome           problems      of moral hazard

and adverse selection,          it should reduce the costs of external              finance vis ~ vis the cost of internal

funds such as cash flows.

    Financial         development,     thus, should          reduce    both    the cost       of capital and the differential

cost of eztemal         finance.     Our paper focuses          on the second       effect.     If the financial     sector works

through      the cost of external         finance,     firms that are typically         short of funds given investment

opportunities         should do better in economies            with well developed         financial sectors.       The test then

is whether        firms (or industries)        dependent       on external       finance for their growth           are relatively

“better     off    in economies      with well developed          financial     markets.      A finding that they are could

be the ‘smoking            gun’ in the debate        about    causality.      There are two virtues to this simple               test.

First, it focuses on the details of a mechanism                   by which finance affects growth,               thus providing        a

stronger test of causality.          Second,    it can correct for fixed country              (and industry)     effects.    Though

its value depends           on how reasonable         our micro-economic          assumptions        are, it is less dependent



                                                                   2
on a specific       macroeconomic             model    of growth.

       Specifically,    we propose       the following      test. We identify an industry’s              need for external finance

(the difference        between      investments        and internal c=h           generated    from operations)         from data on

U.S. firms.         Under    the assumption             that capital      markets     in the United         States,     especially    for

the large listed firms we analyze,                are relatively      frictionless,    this method        allows us to identify an

industry’s        technological      demand      for external financing.           We then examine whether             the industries

that are more dependent                on external       financing     grow relatively        fsster in countries       that initially

have better        developed       financial    markets and institutions.

       We find evidence           consistent     with this. In a country            which is one standard            deviation    above

the mean of financial              development,        the difference       in growth    rates between            an industry     whose

financial     dependence          is one standard         deviation       above    the mean and the average               industry,     is

1% more        (annually,      and in real terms)           than in the average           country.       Moreover,      we find that

industries        that generate substantial            cash flow from operations          grow relatively         faster in countries

with underdeveloped               financial    systems.     The intensity         of investment       in industries    dependent       on

external finance is disproportionately                  higher in countries         with more developed            financial markets.

Finally, firms in financially            dependent        industries      are disproportionately          larger in countries        with

more developed          financial     markets.        Our results are robust to the introduction                   of various proxies

for a country’s        level of development            and human capital,           making it unlikely        that they are driven

by an omitted          variable.

       Let us be careful about            what we find, and about                 what we have little to say. Our findings

suggest that the ex ante development                    of financial markets facilitates          the ex post growth of sectors

dependent         on external       finance.     This implies that the link between                   financial    development        and

growth identified         elsewhere      may stem, at le=t             in part, from a channel identified              by the theory:

financial     markets     and institutions            reduce the cost of external           finance for firms.         Of course,     our

analysis suggests only that financial development                         liberates firms from the drudgery             of generating

funds internally.           It is ultimately          the availability      of profitable      investment         opportunities      that

drives growth,         and we have little to say about                where these come from.

       Clearly,    the plausibility      of our work depends              on how acceptable           its underlying     assumptions

are.     One of our assumptions                is that there is a technological               reuon     why some       industries     de-

penal more on external               finance     than others.        To the extent       that the initial project           scale,    the



                                                                      3
gestation      period,     the c=h     harvest period,         and the requirement           for continuing      investment     differ

substantially      between industries,         this is indeed plausible.          More debatable          is our assumption      that

these technological          differences    persist across countries          despite v=t differences         in local conditions.

However,       all we really need is that statements                     of the following      sort hold:     If pharmaceuticals

require a larger initial scale ad              have a higher gestation             period     before    cashflows    are harvested

than the textile           industry    in the U-S., it also requires             a larger initial scale and h=              a higher

gestation      period      in Korea.

    Furthermore,           for a country’s     financial development            to have any effect on industry            growth     in

that country       we have to assume that firms finance themselves                          largely in their own country.           In

other words,       only if world capital             markets    are not perfectly          integrated    can domestic      financial

development        tiect     a country’s     growth.      There is a wealth of evidence            documenting         the existence

of frictions     in international        capital markets:        the extremely          high correlation     between     a country’s

savings     and its investments            (Feldstein     and Horioka,         1980),     the strong     home     bias in portfolio

investments       (French      and Poterba          , 1991 ), and cross countries            differences     in expected      returns

(Bekaert       and Harvey,        1995).     We have little else to say about                  these two assumptions            other

than noting       that their failure would weaken the power of our tests but not necessarily                                  bias our

findings.

    Finally, we address concerns               about     the interpretation        of our findings.        As argued earlier, the

size of financial markets might reflect the extent to which growth is capitalized.                                  But this would

not explain why there is a differential                 effect of financial development           on the growth of industries

dependent       on external       finance,    nor why financial            development       continues     to matter     even when

we use other proxies for it such as a country’s                   accounting      standards.      A second possibility         is that

financial    markets        might develop          in anticipation       of the financing      needs of industry.        We regard

this as unlikely for a number of reasons.                  It is not clear that the state of development                 of markets

is the outcome           of a rational     plan.     In many fomer          colonies,     it is determined      by the identity      of

the colonial      power      and the legal and political             systems     they imposed           (see La Porta,     Lopez    de

Silmes,     Shleifer and Vishny            (1996) ).3     At best, markets         appear      to develop       in response     to the


   3For instance, India which has a common-law system introduced by the British has had a vibrant stock
exchange since the l=t century (La Porta et al. argue that common law systems are more conducive to the
development of equity markets). The stock exchange survived, albeit in a low energy state, even when many of
the activities requiring external finance such as infrastructure development were taken over by the government



                                                                     4
current      (and past ) needs of industry            (see Chandler         ( 1977)’s     discussion      of the development            of

public    corporate     debt markets        in the United          States in response          to the financing        needs of the

railroads)     rather than anticipated           needs.

    But this suggests          another    explanation          of our results,      Perhaps,        some factor     may have been

responsible     for the past growth          of financially        dependent       sectors.    This,     in turn, would         explain

the current     development          of financial    markets,      and the persistence              of the factor     would    explain

the growth of financially            dependent      sectors.     Thus the current development                  of financial markets

would be correlated          with the growth          of financially       dependent       sectors,      even absent        any of the

channels      we have discussed.         Indeed we find that a country’s                  financial     development         is strongly

correlated     with the ex ante proportion                of financially        dependent       industries       in that     economy.

Nevertheless,      we still find that the relative               growth    rate of financially          dependent         industries    is

higher    in more financially          developed      countries        even when we restrict             our analysis        to sectors

that are small at the beginning                of the period,          and hence        unlikely      to be responsible         for the

state of development         of the financial markets .4 Furthermore,                   the bmic correlation          persists when

we instrument         with more exogenous             measures      of the state of development                 of capital     markets

such as a country’s          accounting      standards,         and when we include                the interaction        between      an

industry’s     financial   dependence       and the ex ante proportion                  of financially        dependent      industries

in the economy         (which is a proxy for the omitted                factor).

    While     our interest      is primarily      in the macro-economic              link between         financial    development

and growth,      there are at least two re~ons                 why our work may also be of interest in the current

macroeconomic         debate    on whether          firms are “credit        rationed”.        First,    much     of the empirical

literature    on this issue has focused              on large, publicly         traded,      U.S.     (or Japanese)        companies.

The difference        in liquidity     constraints     between         such firms is likely to be small relative                 to the

differences     between     industries     across     different     financial      markets     which     is our focus.         Second,

following     the influential        work by Fazzari,           Hubbard     and Petersen            (1988),     the papers      in this

literature    have typically     sorted firms on some ex ante proxy                     (such as the payment           of dividends


after India got independence. With the gradual withdrawal of the government from industry in the 1980s, the
stock muket h= resumed its role as an important source of finance for young firms.
    ‘This is consistent with Chandler’s account of the financing of U.S. industries. Their growth was partly driven
by the atilability of finance in a system that had largely been developed to fund infr=tructure such as railroads
and CalldS.




                                                                   5
or the existence           of bank relationships)          for financial       constraints.        They     then argue      that the

higher     sensitivity      of investments        to cashflows         for firms that the ex ante proxy                suggests      are

more susceptible           to being     constrained      is evidence        of a differential      wedge between         the cost of

internal      and external      funds among         these firms.         A number        of questions       have been raised by

this methodology.            First,     is the proxy      really   exogenous?          Second,     could     cashflows     proxy     for

investment       opportunities,        thus driving      the correlation?        Final] y, as Kaplan         and Zingales        (1996)

point out, the validity         of such an approach          depends        on the monotonicity           of the investment-c=h

flow sensitivity      to the proxy for financial           constraints,       which – they show – does not necessarily

hold.    By contr=t,        they argue that a more appropriate                 test of the effects of financial          constraints

consists in analyzing          the differential     level of investments          (and, thus, growth)         across firms facing

a differential     wedge between          the cost of internal and external               funds.

    The approach            taken by our paper may deal with this criticism                        and suggest        a new way of

investigating      these issues.        For instance,     financial      development        may be thought           of as more ex-

ogenous       to a particular         industry   than its dividend          policy     or its banking      relationships      (we do

not imply that none of the proxies                in the literature         are exogenous).        Furthermore,        even if cash-

flows proxy for investment              opportunities,     it is the interaction         with financial development           that is

evidence      of financial     constraints.      Finally, our paper addresses              the Kaplan-Zingales           critique     by

testing for differences        in industry       growth across countries             with differentially     developed      financial

markets       and, thus, with a differential             wedge between          cost of external      and internal funds.             So

our evidence       could be thought           of M reaffirming         that financial     constraints      do fiect      investment,

while finessing the debate surrounding                   the previous       work.

    Finally,     Demirguc-Kunt            and Maksimovic           (1996)     also use micro        data to develop        a test of

the influence       of financial       development        on growth.         Using firm-level        data,    they     estimate      the

proportion       of firms whose rate of growth              exceeds      the growth        that could      have been supported

only by internal resources.            They then run a cross country regression and find that this proportion

is positively     related     to the stock market turnover               and to a measure          of law enforcement.           While

their paper is similar in spirit to ours, there are two essential differences.                              First, their estimate

of the internal       growth      rate of a firm is dependent                on the firm’s       characteristics.        While      it is

potentially     more accurate          than our measure of external dependence,                    it is also more endogenous.

Another       difference     is that in the spirit of traditional              cross-country       regressions,       they focus     on



                                                                   6
between-country         differences,      while our focus is on within-country,               between-industry         differences.

The latter is an important             innovation      in this paper.

     The rest of the paper             is =    follows.     We describe        our measure         of financial    dependency         in

section     1. In section      2, we present our data on financial                 development,        country     characteristics,

and industry       growth.      In section     3 we set up our main tests, we discuss the results in section                          4,

and explore      the robustness        of our findings in section             5. Section    6 concludes.




1      A Measure                 of External                Dependency

If the presence      of a well developed         financial market reduces the costs of external finance,                      it must

have a greater effect on the growth rate of firms that are more dependent                                on external funds.        To

investigate     this, we have to determine            a firm’s demand for external finance over a certain period.

Our earliest comprehensive                measure    of financial         market development         is for the year 1980, and

our last systematic          data on growth          is for 1990.         This then defines the period            of interest to be

1980-1990.

     We immediately           face some problems.             First,      a problem     of data availability;       the most      dis-

aggregated      comprehensive          data we have for countries              is at the industry       level (data at the firm

level, if available,       is typically    limited    to large listed firms).           Data on the actual use of external

financing     is typically    not available.        But even if it were, it would not be useable because                     it would

reflect the equilibrium          between      the demand        for external      funds and its supply.           Since the latter

is precisely     what we are attempting               to test for, this information               is contaminated.       A second

problem      is that we are not aware of any systematic                        study    of the external     financing        needs of

different    industries,     either cross-sectionally          or over time.          Empirical     work in corporate         finance

typically     focuses   on the choice between              debt and equity, and not on the use of external                     versus

internal funds. 5

     We, therefore,        start by studying          the external         financing    needs of U.S. companies              over the

1980s.      We use data from Compustat                    for this.       Compustat     does not contain          a representative

sample      of U.S. firms,      because       is limited     to publicly       traded    firms, which      are relatively      large.

Nevertheless,      we regard this = an advantage                 for two re~ons.         First, in a perfect       capital    market


    ‘Mayer (1990) and Demirguc-I{unt           and Maksimovic (1996) are exceptions.           Mayer uses country level data.



                                                                      7
the supply of funds to firms is perfectly             cl-tic     at the proper risk adjusted       rate. In such a mmket

the actual amount           of external funds raised by a firm equals its desired amount,                     In other words,

in such an idealized         setting,    the identification       problem      does not exist.    But capital      markets    in

the United      States are among          the most advanced          in the world,       and large publicly      traded   firms

typically    face the le=t        frictions   in accessing     finance.    Thus the amount       of external     finance used

by large firms in the United States is likely to be a relatively                       pure measure of their demand          for

external     finace.     Note that we are not assuming that the U.S. financial markets are perfect,                          but

only that they are among the least imperfect.

    A second       resson    for using a database         on listed firms is that disclosure          requirements        imply

that the data on financing            are comprehensive.         In the rest of the paper, we will take the amount

of external     finance used by U.S. firms in an industry                  ss a proxy for the desired amount           foreign

firms in the same industry              would    have liked to raise had their financial              markets      been more

developed.

    Next,     we have to define precisely           what we mean by external               and internal    finance.    We are

interested    in the amount of desired investment                that cannot be financed         through   internal sources,

i.e., the cash flow generated            by the same business.            Therefore,    a firm’s dependence       on external

finance is defined as the ratio of capital expenditures                     (Compustat     # 128) minus cash flow from

operations     divided      by capital expenditures.           Cash flow from operations         is broadly    defined ss the

sum of Compustat            c~h    flow from operations         (Compustat       # 110) plus decre=es          in inventories,

decre~es      in receivables,      and increases     in payables. 6 Note that this definition              includes   changes

in the non-financial        components        of net working capital = part of funds from operations.                  In fact,

in certain businesses         these represent major sources           (or uses) of funds, that help a firm avoid (or

force it to tap) external          sources of funds.7

    Similarly, the dependence            on external equity finance is defined m the ratio of the net amount

of equity issues (Compustat             # 108 minus # 115) to capital expenditures.               Finally, the investment


    ‘This item is only defined for cash flow statements with format codes 1, 2, or 3. For format code 7 we construct
it as the sum of items # 123, 125, 126, 106, 213, 217.
    71t could be argued that inter-firm trade credit should be viewed as a component of external financing. It
iG unclear how much of trade credit is used to reduce transactions costs and how much is used for financing.
Much trade credit is granted routinely and repaid promptly and typically, net trade credit for a firm (accounts
receivable less payables) is small (see Petersen and Rajan (1996)). This may be why trade credit is typically
treated m part of operations in capital budgeting exercises. We adhere to this tradition.




                                                                 8
intensity     is the ratio of capital        expenditure       to net property          plant and equipment           (Compustat

# 8).

    To make these measures comparable                      with the industry        level data we have for other countries,

we have to choose how to aggregate                  these ratios across compmies               and over time.      For each firm,

we sum the numerator              and denominator            over time before         dividing.    For instance,      we sum the

firm’s use of external          finance over the 1980s and then divide by the sum of capital                          expenditure

over the 1980s to get the firm’s dependence                      on external         finance    in the 1980s.      This smooths

temporal       fluctuations      and reduces       the effects    of outliers.         To summarize       ratios     across    firms,

however,      we use the industry          median.         We do this to prevent            large firms from swamping             the

information      from small firms; for instance,             we know that IBM’s free cash flow does not alleviate

possible     cash flow shortages       of small computer          firms.

    Finally,     we are concerned          about    the existence        of a life cycle of financing        – firms are more

dependent       on external      financing    early in their life than later – which is “common                       wisdom”      in

the corporate       finance literature       (though        we were hard-pressed            to find formal empirical          studies

of this phenomenon).

    Figure      1 shows such common            wisdom        to be true. It plots the median             financing     and invest-

ment needs across U.S. firms = a function                    of the number of years since the initial public offering

(IPO).      Not surprisingly,      in the year of the IPO,             firms raise a substantial          amount       of external

funds (especially      equity).     More interestingly,          this continues        – albeit on a smaller scale – up to

approximately        the 10th year.        After that period,          net equity      issues go to zero and the usage of

external     finance fluctuates       around       zero.    Although      this pattern         appears   to be fairly standard

across different     industries,     the level of external         financing,       both    at an early stage and at a later

stage    is quite different       across   industries.        For example,          in figure 2, we report         the pattern     of

investment      and financing      in two different industries.            Companies         in the computer       industry     show

an intensive use of external          funds in the first decade of their existence,                 with occasional      spurts of

external     and equity financing          later on.       By contr=t,     external        finance goes to zero very shortly

after the IPO in the steel industry,           but further substantial              needs of external     (and equity finance)

might arise later in life of a company.

    In Table 1, we look at these differences                   more systematically.            We tabulate    by International

Standard       Classification     Code     (ISIC)      the median        fraction     of investments      U.S. firms financed



                                                                  9
externally      (column      I) and financed      with equity     (column         II) during the 1980s. To highlight              the

need for investments,         in column 111we also report the level of capital expenditures                       divided by net

property       plant and equipment.          We restrict our attention            to those manufacturing            industries    for

which we have value-added             data from the United Nations Statistics.                  We report      these figures for

all firms, mature firms (firms that did an IPO at least 10 years ago), and young firms (firms that

went public       in the I=t     9 years).     Not surprisingly,         among      mature    firms, radio and computers

emerge     =    the two industries       with the largest need for external                  finance,     while tobacco       is the

industry       with the largest excess amount          of internal funds relative to capital               expenditures.         This

is also reflected      in its large equity        repurchases.        The clustering      of external       financing       in a few

sectors is even more pronounced               among young firms.

      Given     that the life-cycle     pattern    of external        financing     differs by industry,      the most appro-

priate me=ure         of external     financing    needs in other countries           is debatable.       The financing       needs

of mature companies            represent a better proxy for the financing                needs of existing        firms in other

countries.       However,     young    firms may make up a larger fraction                   of the industry,        especially    in

developing       countries,    than they do in the United States.                 In the absence    of more data on indus-

try composition,        we will use the median         across all firms in the industry                 in the U.S. to me=ure

dependence.        However,     we will examine       if the result is sensitive to using just young or old firms.



1.1      Is the     Financial         Dependence         of U.S.         Firms       a Good       Proxy?


Much of our analysis            rests on financial     dependence          of U.S. firms being           a good     proxy    for the

demand        for external    funds in other countries.          We think this is reasonable              for four re=ons.

      First, in a steady       state equilibrium      there will not be much need for external                    funds, as Fig-

ure 1 shows.        Therefore,      much of the demand            for external        funds is likely to arise as a result

of technological       shocks     that raise an industry’s            investment      opportunities        beyond     what     inter-

nal funds can support.            To the extent       these shocks        are worldwide,        U.S. firms’       need for funds

represents      a good proxy.8

      Second,     even if the new investment         opportunities        generated      by these worldwide          shocks differ


   ‘This amounts to saying that if the invention of persona] computers incre=ed the demand for external funds in
the U.S. computer industry, it is likely to incre=e the need for funds in the computer iudustry in other countries
as well.




                                                                 10
across countries,         the amount       of cash flow produced         by existing      firms in a certain         industry     is

likely to be similar across countries.            In fact, most of the determinants               of ratio of cash flow to

capital are likely to be similar worldwide:                the level of demand       for a certain product,          its stage in

the life cycle,      and its cash harvest period,           For this reason, we make sure that our results hold

even when we use the amount                of internally    generated       cash, rather than the difference            between

investments        and internally     generated    funds.

      Third,     one might argue that the stage of a product                 life cycle that U.S. firms are in is likely

to be different         from that of foreign firms.         Given that our sample            is biased    toward     developing

countries       one might      think that the U.S. industry             in the 1970s might         be a better        proxy     for

developing        countries’    position    in a product      life cycle.      For this remon,           we also explore        the

robustness       of our results to me=uring        the financial dependence           of U .S. firms in the 1970s rather

than in the 1980s.

      L=t      but not least, that we only have a noisy measure of the need for funds creates                             a bias

against finding any effect of financial           development          on growth.




2      Data.

2.1       Data     on    financial     development.


We start by describing          our data on financial development             contained    in Table 2. Ideally, we would

like a measure of a firm’s ability to raise money.                  This depends      on the variety of intermediaries

available,      and the efficiency     with which they perform            the evaluation,       monitoring,      certification,

communication           and distribution      functions.      Since    there is little agreement           on how these are

appropriately        measured,       and even less data available,            we will have to make do with crude

proxies     even though        they may miss many of the aspects               we think vital to a modern              financial

system.

      Turning     first to equity      markets,    one memure          of stock     market     development         may be the

amount of money raised through               initial public offerings and secondary             offerings.    Unfortunately,

this meuure         is not available       on a systematic      buis     for many countries.             Moreover,    it is well

documented        in the U.S. (see earlier) that mature firms are reluctant                   to issue stock, even though

they have the potential          to do so. It could then be argued that stock market capitalization                           is a


                                                               11
better measure of the availability         of finance.    Another virtue of this measure is that it is consistent

with the traditional       literature    (see Goldsmith       (1969) for example)          which h=      typically   used the

ratio of the size of the financial         sector to output        as a measure      of financial      sector development,

So the ratio of stock market capitalization              to Gross Domestic        Product      in 1980 is the measure of

stock market development             that we use. We obtain stock market capitalization                    for all countries

listed in the EmeTging Stock Mar-kets Factbook (which, interestingly,                       contains     data on developed

countries   also) published         by the International      Finance      Corporation.g

    A comparable        measure for the state of development               of credit markets is the ratio of domestic

credit   to Gross      Domestic      Product,    a measure      also used by King           and Levine       (1993a).      This

is obtained     from    the International        Financial    Statistics     (IFS)   published        by the International

Monet~        Fund. Specifically,       this measure is the ratio of IFS lines 32a through                32f and excluding

32e. Finally, we also compute            the fraction    of credit allocated      to the private sector, which is the

ratio of claims on the non-financial            private sector      (IFS line 32d) to total domestic            credit.

    There     are, of course,       elements    we do not capture.          For instance,      we do not have data on

corporate     bond     markets      for more    than a handful       of countries.      Except       for the United       States

which is not included        in our tests, and Japan, corporate              bond    markets        were typically    small in

the early 1980s (see Rajan and Zingales,             1995).    A potentially     more damaging           omission    is private

equity and private placement             of debt (not held by institutions).            While they may be correlated

with me=ures         of financial    market development,           there are certain       countries    where they clearly

are not.    For instance,     in Italy, most medium           sized companies        are privately       held (see Pagano,

Panetta,    and Zingales,        1995) while the stock market           is relatively      small.    The lack of this data

may not be a serious problem              because,      after all, we are interested          in how the availability         of

external funds affects firms; the amount             of private equity outstanding            is generally    a reflection    of

the amount      of internal finance privately        held companies         have secured in the past, and therefore

is not a measure of how developed               the financial markets are.


   gStock market capitalization is me=ured at the end of the year, while Gross Domestic Product may =Iue
flows through the year. This may be a problem in high inflation countries. We therefore measure GDP as the
GDP in constant prices multiplied by the producer price index where the base year for both series is five. years
before the year of interest.




                                                              12
2.2 -Data          on    countries.


The    Gross     Domestic       Product,     the Producer       Price    Index,     the exchange        rate,   and the Index

of Industrial      Production         are all obtained     from International         Financial      Statistics.     Whenever        a

pmticular      series is not available, we use close substitutes             – for instance,      the wholesale       price index

if the producer         price index is not available.         Data on a country’s         human capital            (average   years

of schooling      in population         over 25) and the share of investment              in GDP       in 1980 are obtained

from the Barre-Lee            files downloaded        from the NBER        web site (see Barro and Lee (1994)).



2.3       Data     on    industries.


Data on value added             and gross fixed capital        formation       for each industry        in each country         are

obtained     from       the General      Industrial    Statistics    (VOI 1) database      put together            by the United

Nations Statistics          Division.    We checked the data for inconsistencies,              changes in classification         of

sectors, and changes in units.             The U.N. data is classified by International                SIC code.      In order to

obtain the amount            of external    finance used by the industry           in the U. S., we matched           ISIC codes

with SIC codes.          Typically,     the three digit ISIC codes correspond             to two digit SIC codes,             while

the four digit ISIC code corresponds                to three digit SIC codes.         In order to reduce the dependence

on country       specific    factors like natural resources          we confine our analysis to manufacturing                 firms

(U.S. SIC 2000-3999).            Table 3 presents summary             statistics   for all these variables.

      We would like data on ~              many countries       as possible.       The binding       constraint      is the avail-

ability   of comparable         data on a country’s         equity markets.        We started      with 55 countries          from

the Emerging        Stock Markets          Factbook.     We dropped       countries     like Kuwait      that did not report

a stock market capitalization              till the latter half of the 1980s, We could not use Hong Kong and

Taiwan because          data on these countries          are not present in the International            Financial      Statistics

volumes.     We also dropped            countries     for which we did not have data from the G ,1.S. database

that is separated           by at Ie=t     five years (notably,        Switzerland).      Finally,     Thailand       is dropped

because     the U.N. notes that data from year to year are not comparable.                             The United        States is

excluded    from the analysis because               it is our benchmark.       This leaves us with the 43 countries              in

Table 2.




                                                                13
2.4      .Data description.

Our b=ic       measure       of financial       market       development        - which we term           ‘financial     development”

— is the sum of domestic               credit     and stock        market     capitalization      to Gross      Domestic          Product.

Table 2 lists this measure              and its components               for countries     in our final sample.           A number        of

patterns      we discernible         from an analysis of this table.                First, credit markets are more developed

in richer countries.         The correlation          of log per capita income in 1980 with financial                     development

is 0.43     (significant     at the l%          level)     the correlation      with the ratio of credit            market        to GDP

is 0.45 (significant         at the l%          level),    while the correlation          with equity       market       capitalization

to GDP        is 0.17      (though     significant        on] y at the 25V0 level).             The     weak correlation          between

stock     markets     and per capita            income      is consistent      with La Porta           et al,’s view that colonial

influences     and legal tradition,            rather than economic            conditions,      are a strong determinant             of the

development         of equity markets.          As an example,           Singapore     and Malaysia        (under British common

law influence)       have strong equity markets while Phillipines                        (under Spanish civil law) hss weaker

equity    markets.         Second,     there seems to be no relationship                     (if anything,      weak substitution)

between       the development          of credit markets and the development                      of stock markets         (correlation

=-0.08,     not significant),        a fact previously            noted by Demirguc-Kunt               and Levine       (1995).     Third,

the fraction       of domestic        credit    going to the private            sector    is strongly     correlated      with market

capitalization      to GDP (correlation=O.5,                 significant     at the l~o level).       Possible explanations         of this

correlation       are that government            involvement        in industry      crowds out the private sector,               that the

government        intervenes     to fill the cap created            by the absence of the market, or that respect                      and

enforcement        of private property            rights drives both variables.              Finally,    the fraction      of domestic

credit    going    to the private        sector     is correlated        with log per capita           income    (correlation=        O.27,

significant    at the 10% level).

      We want to see if financially                dependent        industries       are likely to be better           off in countries

with well developed          financial sectors.            The availability      of finance affects not just investment                but

also the ability        to finance     operations          and sales through          working     capi tal. Therefore,        the most

appropriate        me~ure      of an industry             being    “better    oR’    is the growth       in value added           for that

industry,     i.e., the change in the log of real value added in that industry                            between      1980 and 1990.

Real value added in 1990 is obtained                      by deflating     value added by the Producer              Price Index.       For

high inflation countries,             spurious differences        in value added may be obtained              simply because       the

UN data are measured                  at a different     point from the PPI index.         So, instead,          we determine      the

effective     deflator      by dividing      the growth      in nominal      value added        for the entire manufacturing

sector in the UN database                by the index of industrial       production     (which measures the real growth

rate in industrial           production)      obtained     from the IFS statistics.

      The raw correlation             between    financial   market development          and the growth           of the manufac-

turing sector         across     the 43 countries        is 0.27 (significant    at the 10% level).           This is consistent

with the results in King and Levine                    (1993a),      who show that the predetermined                component       of

market development               affects future growth.



3      Financial                dependence                and growth

3.1         The     basic      test


Our hypothesis              is that industries       that are more        dependent     on external        financing        will have

relatively        higher growth rates in countries           that have more developed             financial    markets.      In other

words, the explanatory                variable whose influence we are interested                in is the interaction        between

an indust ry’s dependence                 on external      finance    (as measured      in the U. S.) and local             financial

market development.

      Our study, therefore,            has one important         advantage    over recent cross-country            empirical    stud-

ies of growth         (e.g.,    Barro      (1991),   Kormendi        and Meguire      (1985),     King    and Levine         (1993a),

Levine      and Renelt         (1992),     Mankiw,     Romer,      and Weil (1992),       and Demirguc-Kunt               and Mak-

simovic      (1996)).        That     advantage      is simply     that we make predictions              about     within    country

differences        between     industries     based on an interaction         between    a country        and industry        charac-

teristic.    Therefore,        we can correct for country          and industry characteristics          in ways that previous

studies were unable to correct for, and will be less subject                     to criticism      about an omitted          variable

bias or model specification.

      The dependent            variable    is the average annual real growth             rate of value added           in industry

j in country         k over the period          1980-1990.10       The most effective      way of correcting           for country

    Iowe exclude the United Stat=            in all subsequent regressions. As noted earlier, for some countries data avail-
ability limits the period even further.          However, for no country do we have data separated by less than 5 years,



                                                                     15
and industry        characteristics      is to use indicator          variables,    one for each country          and industry.

The disadvantage         of such a “fixed effects”          regression     is that the determinants          of relative growth

other than the interaction            of interest become        less transparent.         So we start by including         country

characteristics     and industry characteristics            instead of indicator      variables.     The model we estimate

is then



     GT~thj,k         = PI..* . Countrykcharacteri              sties + fl~+ 1... , IndustryjCharacteTistics+

    Among        the country       characteristics    we include          are investment’s      share in GDP           in 1980, log

of per capita       income      in dollars     in 1980, the average years of schooling               in population         over age

25, and our measure             of financial    development       (which is the sum of domestic                credit    and stock

market capitalization           to Gross Domestic       Product).

    The industry        characteristic         we include     initially     is industry     j’s dependence       on external      fi-

nancing    in the U.S. Finally,          we include     two variables          that are characteristic         of both     country

and industry;       industry j’s share in country            k of total value added in manufacturing                    in 1980 and

the interact ion between           industry j’s dependence            on external    financing     in the U.S. and financial

market development           in country        k. We will then drop the country               specific   and industry       specific

characteristics,      and replace       them with indicators           for each country       and each industry.          This will

be the basic regression           in the rest of the paper.



4     Results           from the basic regression.

As can be seen in Table               4, the coefficient       estimate      for the interaction         term is positive       and

statistically     significant     at the l% level (throughout              the paper, the reported          standard      errors are

heteroskedasticity        corrected).        The interaction      term is akin to a second               derivative.     Using the


Dropping th-      countries does not qualitatively affect the results. We reduce the impact of outliers by constrain-
ing growth between -1 and +1, Three obserwtions are affected. The coefficient estimates for the interaction
coefficient are higher and still significant when we do not do this, though the explanatory power of the regression
is lower. We also rerun the same specification after winsorizing the l% and 5% tails of the growth rate distribution
obtaining virtually identicrd results (except that the explanatory power of the regression is still higher).
   A potential concern is that we measure growth in value added rather than growth in output. Unfortunately,
we do not have data for the latter. While we may not capture increases iu productivity fully, we see no obvious
way in which this should bias our results.


                                                                 16

dependence        is one standard          deviation       above      the mean and the average                industry,     is lin the

average country.          Is the effect large or small?            Note that this measures            the differential       impact    of

financial    development        on financially       dependent         industries,     rather than the overall relationship

between      financial     development       and growth.           Still, the effect is of the same order of magnitude

(see below)     ss the effect of variables such w investment’s                       share of GDP        and per capita         income

that populate       cross-country        growth regressions.

    The other explanatory             variables      are also of interest.         The following       numbers        in parentheses

indicate     the effect on industry         growth       of a one standard           deviation     increase in the explanatory

variable.     The higher investment’s              share of GDP            in 1980, the higher an industry’s               growth   rate

(1.6%).      Developed       countries     have lower growth               rates in manufacturing             as evidenced      by the

negative     coefficient    on the log of per capita             income       (-2.5Yo).    The number         of years of schooling

has a small and insignificantly                 negative      correlation      with growth        (-0.370),    while industries        in

countries     with more developed               credit   markets       have a higher growth            (0.570).     Industries      that

have a considerable          dependence         on external      finance have slower growth             (-lYo) though         this only

borderline     statistically      significant     at the 10% level, as do industries                 that account          for a larger

share of a country’s           manufacturing         sector     in 1980 (-1,370). 11 Thus the explanatory                     variables

have plausible      effects.

    Next, we include           indicator    variables      for all the countries           in the sample,      As seen in Table 4,

the coefficient      estimates      for the industry-specific                and interaction       variables      are stable.       The

explanatory       power of the regression           goes up substantially,           suggesting     that much of the variation

in growth      rates is because       of omitted         inter-country        differences.      We re-estimate        the regression

now including       indicators      for the industries.         The coefficients          for country-specific      and interaction

variables    are again surprisingly          stable.       Finally,    we estimate         the regression     including      indicators

for all countries        and industries.     This is the basic regression                 we use in the rest of the paper,            and

the coefficient     is positive     (@= O.069) and significant              at the l% level. It does not appear that one

single country      or industry        is responsible         for the results.       The fundamental             partial    correlation


  11A ~o~~jble ~xplmation for this ~Wficient estimate is measurement error. Those industries that are incorrectly
measured to be small in the beginning of the decade will be seen to have grown faster.

4.1       Influence      of composition              of markets.


Does the break-up         of the capital      market between           equity     and debt make a difference?             Does it

matter     how much credit         is channeled        to the government          sector     and how much to the private

sector?

      Some theoretical      studies have argued for a correlation                between      the existence    of stock markets

and growth       and there is some evidence              of this (King         and Levine,       1993 b).     As Levine      (1991)

argues,     capital    raised through       equity     issues is long term (for the firm),              while shares can be

liquidated     by the investor       at short notice without              impacting       the firm’s projects.     By contrast,

if the firm finances with non-tradeable,                finite maturity        debt held by institutions,          shocks to the

institutions     may be transmitted          on to the firm and force liquidation                 of long term projects.         To

the extent     that stock markets create a separation                  between     the liquidity     shocks of investors       and

the investment        needs of firms, the latter can take a longer term view and invest more efficiently.

Growth       should    be higher if equity       markets        account    for a larger proportion            of credit markets.

An alternative        view is that managers            who are constantly          evaluated      by the stock market tend

to take the short term view (see Stein (1989) for a theory)                           and therefore    it is better    that they

obtain finance for long term projects                from financial       institutions.     We do not have the space here

to review all the arguments              in the theoretical       literature     on the relative      merits of markets         and

institutions     (see Aoki and Patrick         (1994) for an extensive           discussion).      It suffices to say that the

predictions      are ambiguous.

      Since the relative        merits    are an empirical        matter,      we compute        the ratio of equity      market

capitalization        to GDP.    We then include         the interaction         between      this ratio and the industry’s

dependence       on external      Iinmce     in the b~ic        regression      (see Table 5). We find that a dollar of

market capitalization           is not the same as a dollar of credit;             it has only 40% of the effect on the

growth     of financially       dependent     firms.    Unfortunately,          this finding     that market      capitalization

has less effect than credit cannot             be *     e=ily     interpreted     as if it were the reverse finding.           The

reason we must be cautious               about interpreting        this to mean that institutions             are “better”     than

markets in channeling           funds to financially       dependent         firms is because,      unlike a dollar of credit,

a dollar of market          capi talizat ion does not necessarilyy mean that some firm obtained                           a dollar


                                                                  18
of finance.      The lower effect of market            capitalization      may simply         reflect the translation        ratio

between     market capitalization         and eventual      finance through          new share issues. 12

    While this test does not give unambiguous                results, it suggests a further way of testing whether

the form of finance matters.            We test whether,          correcting      for the other effects,      industries     that

are equity dependent         thrive better in a country           with a greater relative size of the stock market.

We therefore        include the ratio of equity to total external              finance used by U.S. firms in the s=e

industry    interacted    with the ratio of market capitalization                 to size of capital markets.     If the form

of finance matters,        the coefficient      of this term should be positive.              It turns out to be negative

and insignificantly       different    from zero.

    Put together,       the tests suggest that equity markets do not have disproportionately                           beneficial

effects on the relative growth           rate of financially         dependent     firms.   Nevertheless,     equity markets

are positively      correlated   with growth.        When we re-estimate           equation    (1) without    the interaction

term but with the market capitalization                 to GDP        included,    we find a positive       (though     insignif-

icant) relationship       between     market capitalization           and growth,      over and above its contribution

to the included       significant     measure    of financial     market development.            In summary;      our results

suggest growth may be positively             correlated     with the size of equity markets for reasons that are

unrelated     to the availability       of external    finance.       For example,      the better    risk sharing effected

through     equity markets       may reduce        the cost of capital      to all firms, not just the financial y de-

pendent     ones.     This would      imply higher growth            rates for countries       with well developed          stock

markets but not necessarily            differences    in growth rates between           its industries.

    The effect of channeling           funds to the public sector rather than the private sector is captured

in Table 5 by including          the interaction      between     an industry’s      need for external       funding     and the


  lZWe ~~e ~ountrie~ only in the Emerging Markets Factbook because otherwise we do not know the size of the
stock market. There is, however, a potential selectiou problem of look-back bias in these countries. The IFC
may only include countries that, ex post (i.e., in the latter half of the 1980s when the database was initiated),
have a reasonably sized stock market. This selection bias does not appear severe because the data set seems to
contain every country (we know of) that had a stock market at the beginning of the 1980s. Moreover, some of the
stock markets present in the datwet are miniscule in the late 1980s, suggesting that this may not have been an
important criterion, Nevertheless, ,we can think about the consequences of a potential selection bias. The bim
would be most important in the case of countries with small stock markets in 1980, that based on the hypothesized
selection criterion, would have grown the fastest. This would induce a negative correlation between the size of
the stock market and growth. While such a correlation is not borne out ill the data, and the selection bias does
not directly predict any correlation for the interaction term, this suggests further caution about comparing the
coefficients of credit and equity market capitalization.




                                                                19
ratio .of domestic           credit     to the public          sector     to GDP.      The    coefficient     is large and strongly

negative      (coefficient     estimate=      -O.16, t=-3.3)        ). This implies that the overall impact                   of a dollar

of extra credit, if directed            at the public sector, is to reduce the relative growth rate of financially

dependent        industries     by about half u much as a dollar of credit to the private sector incre~es

it. This evidence           can be interpreted           in a number           of ways.      It may indicate      that public        sector

credit    is not directed        at financially        dependent         segments,      and perhaps         is misallocated       to those

segments       that do not need it.              Alternatively,          it may be that involvement             by the deep pocket

government        has a disproportionate               crowding         out effect on the private sector           (and thus reduces

growth)     in industries       that are financially            dependent.



4.2      Decomposition                  of the       sources       of growth.


An industry        can grow because            new firms are added to the industry                    and because         existing    firms

grow in size.        Does     the interaction          term affect only one of these or both?                    The U.N. database

also reports       the number           of firms in an industry.                This   statistic    may often      be compiled         by a

different     body    in a country         from the one that produces                  the value-added         data.    The advantage

is that it provides          an independent           check on our results.            The disadvantage         is that the industry

clusification        used by the body             compiling        the number          of firms may differ from            the industry

classification       used by the body            compiling       value-added       data, resulting      in an increase in noise.

      The growth in the number                of firms is the difference            in the log of ending period           firms less the

log of firms in the beginning               of period.       The average size of firms in the industry                   is obtained     by

dividing    the value added in the industry by the number of firms, and the growth in average size

is obtained       again as a difference           in logs. We then estimate                the basic regression         with growth       in

number of firms and growth in average size as dependent                                variables.   The coefficient       (not reported

in table) of the InteractIon              term 1s almost equal in both cases (~~~mb~~ = .022, @aVgsize = .023),

while the coefficient           in the numbers            regression          is estimated     more   precisely        (t~v~b.~   = 2.06,

t..gsize= 1.73).            The coefficient          estimates     suggest       that the incremental          growth     of financially

dependent        firms in more developed               markets is almost equally driven by a growth in the number

of firms and by a growth                in average size.

      If the development              of financial     markets      affects both        the growth     in the number          of firms in

financially      dependent       industries       and their average size, it must be that the average size of firms


                                                                         20
in financially     dependent       industries     is larger in economies          with developed      markets.      This is indeed

the case. When        we estimate       the b~ic       regression     with the log of the average size of firms in an

industry      in a country     at the end of the 1980s M the dependent                  variable     (estimates     not reported),

the coefficient     of the interaction         term is positive       and highly significant.         It remains        so when the

dependent       variable     is the average size at the beginning                  of the 1980s.      So the scale of firms is.

related to the development            of financial     markets.



5       Robustness

There    are obviously         many differences       between        the same industry          in different     countries.      That

we find such a strong            interaction      effect between        an industry’s        financial     dependence         and the

country’s      financial   development          is surprising.    We, therefore,           perform   a number       of robustness

checks to rule out more mechanical                  explanations.       First, we check if the correlation               is sensitive

to redefining      financial    dependence        M the dependence             of young firms or old firms, or measuring

dependence        in the 1970s rather than the 1980s. If the correlation                      is not robust to these changes

in definition      of dependence,        it makes us less confidant                in the universality        of our memure           of

dependence.



5.1      Is the     correlation         robust        to   changes         in the      measure        of    financial        depen-

         dence?


We calculate       financial    dependence        restricting    the sample only to mature                 firms (listed for more

than 10 years)       in the United       States.      The coefficient          estimated     for the interaction        term, 0.05,

is statistically     significant     (see Table       6, column        (I)).    When    we estimate         the regression       with

dependence        defined = the dependence             of young firms in the United States on external                        finance,

the coefficient     on the interaction          term is similar (0.04) and still statistically                significant,    though

only at the 10% level (see Table 6, column                  (II)).

      Next,    we check whether         there is persistence          in the pattern.         If the pattern       of financing       in

the United        States   in the 1980s is very different              from       the pattern     in the 1970s, it would              be

unreasonable        to expect      it to carry any information                 for other countries       (especially     developing

countries     that may use older technologies).              Furthermore,          such a check would alleviate              concerns



                                                                 21
that aberrations         in a few industries        in the 1980s drive the results.

      The raw correlation           between     an industry’s          demand       for external    financing        in the 1980s and

its demand      in the 1970s is 0.63. When we include the demand                             for external financing         in the 1970s

in the basic regression        instead of demand in the 1980s, the coefficient                       is positive     and statistically

significant     (see Table 6, column           (III)).        The coefficient     is about     40% larger than that estimated

for the 1980s, Though               it is measured        less precisely,       it is still statistically     significant    at the 5%

level. 13



5.2      Is the       correlation        robust          to    changes      in the      measure        of financial          develop-

         ment     ?


As a measure          of the development           (and thus efficiency)              of capital    markets       we have used the

sum of domestic           credit     and equity      market         capitalization       to measure         financial    development.

Although       crude, this is the most common                    measure used in prior studies and captures                  fairly well

our priors.       There    are, however,        some aberrations            (see Table        2),   For instance,        Malaysia     h=

a very high level of financial               development,          driven Iargel y by its strong            equity      markets,    while

Belgium has a lower level of development,                       because its equity market is minuscule.                 La Porta et al.

(1996) attribute        this to differences       in legal systems that emerged                 as a result of foreign invwions

and colonial      domination.          The Malaysian             legal system      was influenced       by British        common      law

(which promotes          equity markets),         while the Rench           civil code (which does not) w=                  imposed     on

Belgium       by Napoleon.         Rather    than being a source of concern,                 the “aberrations”          are a source of

strength      for the study because           they enable us to tell the effect of financial                    development         apart

from economic          development.14

      The proxy for financial           development            we would really like to have is a direct me~ure                     of the

efficiency    of capital markets.           While the combined            size of the credit and equity market is likely to

be highly correlated         with this, it is incumbent               on us to see that the effect we me~ure                   is robust

to changes      in this measure.            An alternative          way to me~ure            the degree      of sophistication        and


 lQThe statistical significance of the coefficients for all the models in this subsection tends to increase substantially
when the dependent variable is trimmed at the l~o and 5% levels.
  lAwe do check however, that our results are not driven by “strange” outliers. In particular,            theresults   are
unchanged if we drop Jordan, which scores surprisingly high on our me~sure of financial development, from the
regression,



                                                                     22
efficiency     of a capital market is to look at its accounting                 standards.      The Center for International

Financial      Analysis      and Research        creates   an index for different            countries     by rating     the annual

reports      of at le=t    three firms in every country              on the inclusion         or omission     of 90 items.       Thus

each country       obtains       a score out of 90 with a higher number                     indicating     more disclosure.       The

greater the public information,             the lower should be the cost of external finance relative to internal

finance.     So this should be a proxy for financial development.                     15 While more developed             countries

have better       accounting        standards      (see Laporta,        et al.),   there are exceptions.              For instance,

Malaysia       scores     as high as the United            States,     Australia     or Canada           on this measure,        while

Belgium       and Germany         are in the same league = Korea, Phillipines,                    or Mexico.     The correlation

between       our capitalization       measure      of financial       development      and accounting          standards       is 0.39

(significant     at the 5% level for the 32 countries                for which we have this data).              When     we include

the interaction         between     financial    dependence     and accounting         standards         instead of our previous

measure       of financial       development       (see Table      6, column       (IV)),     the coefficient     is positive      and

highly statistically        significant    (p=     0.16, t=4.35).

      With    more confidence         in our me~ures          of financial      dependence        and financial       development,

we now turn to other concerns,



5.3        Focussing        on    substantial        industries


It may be argued           that differences       in other sources        of comparative          advantage      may dictate       the

presence,      absence,      or growth     of industries       in a country.        Even if this is the case, our results

cannot be explained          unless the dependence           of industries on this source of comparative                 advantage

is strongly     correlated       with their dependence         on external funding            and financial     development        is a

good proxy for the source of comparative                   advantage.         As an example,        the. availability    of natural

resources may drive the growth of the mining sector,                       If mining is dependent            on external finance,

and if resource         intensive    countries     developed      financial    markets        (either by chance,        by common

colonial     heritage,    or by design)         then the presence        or absence         of natural    resources     would    drive

the correlation.


   15Unfortunately, we do not have this measure for all the countries ill our sample. Also the Center for Interna-
tional Financird Analysis and Research which produces this data was set up only in 1984. So we do not have a
me=ure of the accounting standards at the beginning of the period. This may not be a big problem because the
stadards do not change dramatically in a short period.



                                                                  23
    In the ideal thought          experiment,      we should focus on industries           like cement that are present in

almost every country            and do not require special technology,               human capital,      or natural resources

(but do require finance).          We do not have data in such detail, nor are there enough such industries

to give us the cross-sectional          vaiation       to enable us to estimate          our coefficients       (even if the data

were available).        Nevertheless,     we can attempt        to minimize       the problem,        as well as see if it is a

source of concern.

    By restricting        the sample     to manufacturing         firms, we have already reduced                 the influence    of

availability     of natural      resources.     Also, if an industry       has a substantial        presence      in a particular

country,      it is logical    that country      h=    the necessary      resources     and talents for the industry.            So

by further restricting          the sample to industries        that are above the median size in the country                     in

1980, we reduce the problem              of differences     in growth stemming           from differences        in endowment.

When we estimate           the regression      with this smaller sample (Table 6, column                (V)),    the interaction

variable is still positive        and statistically      significant     (~ = 0.06, t=2.65).

    We can also test if either financial                 dependence       or financial     development          proxy     for some-

thing else.      Industries     that are highly dependent              on external    finance – for example,             drugs and

pharmaceuticals         – may also be highly dependent               on human capital inputs.          To the extent that fi-

nancial market development              and human capital are correlated,              the observed      interaction       between

financial     dependence        and financial     development        may proxy for the interaction              between     human

capital     dependence        and the availability       of trained human capital.           To check this, we include in

the basic regression          an interaction     between     the industry’s      dependence         on external      finance and

the measure        of the country’s      stock of human capital            (average    years of schooling         in population

over age 25).          As the coefficient       estimates    in Table      7, column      I show,     the coefficient        on the

human capital interaction            term is small and not statistically             significant,     while our fundamental

interaction      term is virtually      unchanged.       This suggests that financial          dependence         is not a proxy

for the industry’s        dependence      on human capital.

    Another       possibility     is that a lower dependence             on external      financing    in the United         States

simply      reflects   the greater    maturity        of the industry.      An influential      view of the development

process     is that ~ technologies        mature,       industries     using those technologies         migrate         from devel-

oped economies          to developing     economies       (see, for example,     Dornbusch,         Fischer,     and Samuelson

(1977)).      Since developing       countries     are more likely to have underdeveloped                   financial     markets,



                                                                24
the interaction       effect we document          may simply reflect the stronger growth of mature technologies

in underdeveloped           countries.

      We already      have results suggesting             this cunot       be the entire explanation.            The interaction

effect is present even when dependence                    is me=ured       only for young firms in the United                   States.

Financial       dependence       is unlikely    to proxy for technological           maturity     for these firms.

      Furthermore,      we can test if financial development                is really a proxy for economic             development

in the regression.          We include         in the b~ic      regression     the interaction       between       the industry’s

dependence        on external       finance     and the log per capita           GDP     for the country,          in addition       to

our usual interaction            term,     As seen in Table 7, column            (II), the coefficient        of the interaction

term falls to 0.05 (from            0.07 in the basic regression)            but is still statistically          significant.      The

interaction       between    financial       dependence       and log per capita       income      is positive     and borderline

statistically     significant     at the 10~0 level.        This may be because           log per capita         income    captures

some aspects of financial development                   that are not captured        by our proxy.        Of course, we cannot

rule out the possibility          that financial        development       is a better proxy       for economic         development

than log per capita          income.        Nevertheless,      taken together,       the above      tests do not offer strong

support     for financial     dependence        being a proxy for technological              maturity.



5.4       Other      explanations:             Reverse        Causality.


Thus far, we have taken the state of financial                     markets as predetermined           and exogenous.            An al-

ternative     explanation       of the development          of financial markets is that they arise to accommodate

the financing       needs of finance-hungry             industries.

      The argument       is as follows.        Suppose     there are some underlying            country     specific   factors that

favor certain       industries     that happen          to be finance hungry.        Then,      countries    abundant       in these

factors    should     experience         higher growth      rates in financially       dependent         industries     and - as a

result – should develop            a strong financial       market.      If these factors persist,        then growth       rates in

financially     dependent        sectors     will persist and we will observe           the significant       interaction       effect.

But here it will result from omitted                factors    than any beneficial       effect of finance.

      The l=k       of persistence         in country     growth      over periods    of decades      (see Easterly,        Kremer,

Pritchet t, and Summers              (1993))      and the low correlation            of sectoral      growth      across    decades

(Klenow,        1995) suggest       that this should          not be a major         concern.      Nevertheless,        we can in-


                                                                   25
vesti~te      the reverse causality          argument         more direct 1y.

    We construct          a messure       of the average financial             dependence       of a country’s         industrial    struc-

ture in 1980; we weight            the dependence             on external         finmcing      for m industry           by its relative

contribution     to value added in the manufacturing                       sector, ad        sum across industries          in the coun-

try. This gives US a meuure’               of the proportion           of financially        dependent       firms in that country.

When we sort countries            on this measure,            less developed       economies       like Sri Lanka and Indonesia

are low on this me~ure             while developed             economies        like Netherlands,        Japan and the U.K. are

high on this list. But there are exceptions.                      Singapore,       Israel and Malaysia          are high on the list

while Portugal,         Greece,   and Belgium           are below the median.

    A regression         with a country’s        financial       development        in 1980 M the dependent                 variable    and

the weighted      average financial          dependence          of its industries      in 1980 u      the explanatory           variable

results    in a strong       positive     coefficient     (~ = 2.89, t=2.51,            R square= O.19).           Interestingly,       the

correlation     is not statistically         significant      at conventional         levels when dependence                is measured

for young      firms.     A possible      explanation         is that it is the older           (and larger)      firms that largely

determine      the size of the financial            sector.       A similarly      strong     correlation      is observed      when we

regress market          capitalization      against weighted           average equity          dependence.        on     the one hand,

this lends credence         to our method        of extrapolating           the financial dependence             of industries       in the

Unit ed States to other           countries      – as might seem natural,                financial    markets          and institutions

develop    to meet the needs of financially                 dependent          industries.     On the other hand, this finding

suggests reverse causality          may indeed be an issue,

    If an omitted         factor explains      both the growth of industries                  and the development            of financial

markets, its influence should be especial] y felt for large industries in economies                                where the ex ante

weighted      average financial          dependence        is high.       These    industries     would      be largely      responsible

for the state of financial         markets       and their size is presumably                  driven by an abundance                of the

omitted     factor.      We include       an indicator           (multiplied      by the standard           interaction      term)     if an

industry is above median size and is in an economy                         with above median weighted               average financial

dependence.       If a persistent         omitted       factor     is responsible      for financially        dependent        industries

having become         large, and also consequently                for the size of the financial            markets,       the coefficient

of this term should be positive              (and absorb a lot of the interaction                 term).     In fact, the coefficient

is negative,    though       not significant      (see Table 7, column               (111)). The coefficient           of the standard



                                                                     26
inter~tion      term is unchanged.

    Again,     if a    omitted     factor    drives our results, the introduction                   of an interaction         between         a

proxy for the omitted           factor and financial dependence                 should weaken the coefficient              estimate      for

our fundamental         interaction.        Although      we cannot         measure this factor directly,           we can obtain             a

proxy for it. Under the alternative                 explanation        of reverse causality,         it is this unobserved          factor”

that is responsible       for the large past growth of financially                     dependent     industries    and, thus, for the

development       of the financial        sector.      As a result, the beginning-of-period                  relative importance          of

financially    dependent        sectors in each country            can be used as a proxy for such an omitted                       factor.

We re-estimate,        then, the b~ic         specification        after inserting = a regressor              the product      between

a country’s     weighted        average external         dependence          and an industry’s         financial    dependence         (see

Table 7, column         (V)).   The estimated          coefficient     of the interaction          between    financial    dependence

and financial     development           is virtually     unchanged         (even slightly     increued),

    The      two findings       above    – that the state of development                    of an economy’s          financial      sector

is explained      by the relative         weight       of industries       dependent       on external        finance     and that the

fundamental       interaction      does not simply reflect the continued                     growth     of financially      dependent

industries     that, in the past, were responsible                   for the development            of the financial       sector    – are

not in contradiction.           Taken together,           they suggest         the possibility       that financial       markets      and

institutions    may develop to meet the needs of one set of industries,                            but then facilitate      the growth

of another     smaller, younger,          group of industries.

    To investigate        this, we estimate          the effect of financial            development      only for industries           that

are small to start out with, and are unlikely to be responsible                            for the state of development              of the

financial markets.        So we estimate         the basic regression            for industries      that in 1980 were less than

the median      size in their respective            countries.       The coefficient       of the interaction        term is positive

and significant        (see Table 7, column             (IV))     even for these industries,           for whom         the economy’s

financial     development       is largely predetermined.

    Finally,    to address the reverse causality                  argument       we re-estimate        the basic specification           by

using instrumental         variables.       The proper          instruments      are variables       likely to affect the develop-

ment of financial markets,           but not to be affected by it, For this reason we resort to institutional

variables.     While    some legal traditions            may foster the development                 of capital     markets,      it is un-

likely that the relationship            runs in the opposite              direction.     La Porta et al. (1996)           suggest      that



                                                                     27
the origin of a country’s            legal system     has an effect on the development               of a domestic       capital

mmket.       Similarly,     the efficiency      and the integrity       of the legal system         are a precondition         for

a sophisticated        capital     mmket,     but the reverse is unlikely         to be true.       Therefore,      we use the

country     of origin of the legal system u classified by La Porta et al, (1996)                         and an index of the

eficiency     of the judicial      system produced       by Business      International     Co~oration       (a country-risk

rating agency)        as instruments        for financial   development.        As Table     7, column      (VI),    shows the

fundamental         correlation     persists even when we estimate          it using instrumental         variables.    All this

suggests that it is unlikely that reverse causality                  is the source of our results.



5.5       Other      Explanations:            Investment         and     Cost     of Capital.


Investment        opportunities      in different industries may be very different.             For instance,       the tobacco

industry     in the United         States uses negative       external     finance    (see Table     1) partly      because    in-

vestment      opportunities        in the Tobacco     industry      are small relative to the cashflows          the industry

generates,     It may be that our measure of dependence                    on external     finance proxies       primarily     for

the investment         intensity    of a particular     industry.      Furthermore,      the size of the financial        sector

may proxy         for the extent      of savings     in the country,      and hence for the cost of capital             in that

country.     The interaction         may simply represent        the fact that capital       intensive     firms grow faster

in an environment         with a lower cost of capital.          While this is certainly         a channel through        which

financial development             could affect growth,      it is not the channel we focus on.

      If investment     intensity were all that mattered,            and external finance and internal finance were

equally costly, the cash internally             generated    by industries      would be irrelevant        in countries       that

are more financially        developed.        All that mattered        would be the size of the required            investment

and the cost of capital.           By contrast,    if there is a wedge between         the cost of internal and external

finance     which decreases         in the state of development           of financial    markets,       the cash internally

generated     by industries        would have its own interaction           effect with financial        development.

      A first pass at this is to replace the interaction                between      dependence     and financial      develop-

ment by the interaction             between    the internal cash an industry            generates    in the United        States

(normalized         by property      plant and equipment)           and the country’s       financial     development.         In-

dustries     that    generate      more   internal    cash grow      disproportionately         faster   in economies         with

underdeveloped         financial markets       (~ = —.23, t=-2.4,        see Table 8, column        I). A second pass is to


                                                               28
also include the interaction               between     an industry’s            investment      intensity    (the ratio of investment

to property,      plant and equipment)               and the country’s             financial    development.         As Table 8 column

II shows, the coefficient             on the investment           interaction       is 0.09, approximately           half the size of the

coefficient     on internal cash (-O. 18), though only the latter is statistically                              significant.        Since the

two coefficients          are not statistically            different,   this supports          our use of the difference             between

investments       ad      csshflows      as our measure of dependence                     on external       financing       throughout    the

paper.      A final confirmation          is that when we include the interaction                    between investment             intensity

and financial       development          in our basic regression                (not reported),      only the interaction            between

financial     dependence           and financial     development             is significant,    and its coefficient         is close to that

estimated       in the basic regression            (~ = O.10).

    Finallyl the discussion              of investments         suggests        that instead of using the growth rate as the

dependent        variable,    we could use the investment                     intensity      of an industry      in other countries         u

the dependent          variable.      We obtain       investment        intensity      by dividing      the gross capital formation

in the industry          by value added in that industry                (using U.N. data).          The explanatory           variables are

taken from the basic regression.                  The coefficient        of the interaction         term is 0.10 and is significant

at the 5% level (estimates               not reported).         This    suggests      that     the higher     cost   of external      finance

in countries      with     poorly      developed      markets       results      in lower investment          intensities     in industries

heavily     dependent        on external        finance.

    In sum, we test a number                of alternative       explanations         of our results    and do not find compelling

evidence      in their    favor.     Instead,     the additional        tests     seem to add credence          to the argument          that

financially     dependent          industries     grow faster      in countries       with better      developed        financial    markets

because       the cost    of external      finance     is lower in such countries.




6     Conclusion

We develop a new methodology                    in this paper to investigate              whether financial sector development

has an influence on industrial              growth.         In doing so, we partially           circumvent      some of the problems

with the existing          cross-country        methodology         highlighted         by Mankiw       (1995).      First, it is difficult

to interpret      observed         correlations     in cross-country            regressions     in a causal sense. Here, we push

the causality       debate     one step further by finding evidence                       for a channel        through       which finance



                                                                        29
theoretically     influences      growth.      Also, since we have multiple               observations         per country,        we can

examine       situations     where      the direction      of causality       is least likely to be reversed.                 A second

problem       with the traditional         methodology       is that explanatory           variables     are multi-collinear           and

are me~ured        with error. The combination               of these two problems           may cause a variable to appear

significant     when it is merely a proxy for some other variable                         me~ured       with error.        As a result,

observed      correlations      can be misleading.           By looking        at interaction        effects     (with country         and

industry      indicators)     rather than direct effects, we reduce the number                         of variables       that we rely

on, as well M the range of possible                   alternative        explanations.      Third,     there is the problem              of

limited    degrees of freedom            - there are fewer than two hundred                  countries       on which the myriad

theories have to be tested.              Our approach       partially      alleviates    this problem        by exploiting         within-

country     vwiation        in the data.     Our methodology,             may have wider applications,                  such as testing

the existence      of channels       through       which human capital can affect growth.

    Apart from its methodological                  contribution,     this paper’s        findings may bear on four different

are=      of current    research.         First,   they suggest          that financial     development           h=     a substantial

supportive      influence on the rate of economic              growth and this works, at least partly, by reducing

the cost of external           finance     to financially     dependent        firms.      We should       add that there is no

cent radiction     when the lack of persistence               of economic        growth      (Easterly,        et al,    (1993))     is set

against the persistence           of financial      development.          Other factors      may cause (potentially                serially

uncorrelated)       changes      in a coutry’s         investment        opportunity       set.    Finance      may simply         enable

the pursuit of these opportunities,                and thereby       enhance     long run growth.

    Second,      in the context          of the literature     on financial       constraints,        this paper        provides     fresh

evidence      that financial     market imperfections              have an impact         on investment         and growth.

    Third,      our results may be relevant to the current debate                        about what form of social security

system a country           should have,       It has been argued that a private social security                         system fosters

the development            of capital    markets.      If this development          has beneficial        effects       on a country’s

growth,     then this might be counted               as an indirect        benefit of a private system.

    Finally,     in the context         of the trade literature,           the findings     suggest     a potential        explanation

for the pattern        of industry       specialization     across countries.           To the extent that financial               market

development        (or the lack thereof)            is determined         by historical     accident     or government             regula-

tion, the existence          of a well developed          market     in a certain        country    may represent           a source     of



                                                                    30
comparative       advantage    for that country   in industries   that are more dependent           on external   fi-

nance.      Similarly,   the costs imposed   by a lack of financial    development       may differentially   tiect

incumbent       firms and new entrants,      large firms versus small fires,      etc.    Therefore,   the level of

financial     development     may also be a factor   in determining      the size composition       of an industry

w well u       its concentration.   These issues are important        ~eas   for future research.

Pattern of external financing and investment across
       industries in the U.S. during the 1980s

    The table reports the median level of external financing, equity financing, and investments for ISIC industries
during the 1980s.      External    finance is the fraction of capital expenditures           not financed with cash flow from
operations.    Caah flow from operations is broadly defined as the sum of Compustat                   funds from operations (item
# 110), decreases in inventories, decreases in receivables,           and increaaes in payables.       Equity finance is the ratio
of the net amount      of equity   issues to capital expenditures.          Investment   is the ratio of capital   expenditures   to
net property    plan and equipment.      Mature firms are defined as firms that have been public for at lemt 10 years,
correspondingly     young firms are defined as firms that went public less than 10 years ago. The IPO year is defined
as the first year in which a company starts to be traded on the NYSE, AMEX, or NASDAQ.                        All the information
is obtained    from the flow of funds data in Compustat,        except for the SIC code which is obtained          from CRSP and
then matched      with the ISIC code.

               Financial              development                       across countries.

    The equity market capitalization     over GDP is the total value of publicly        traded equity at the end of 1980 as
reported by the IFC divided      by the Gross Domestic    Product     that year. The level of domestic       credit is the sum
of assets held by the monetary     authority   and depository    institutions   but excluding   interbank   deposits   (IFS line
92a-92f but not 32 e) divided by GDP. The ratio of priwte         credit to domestic    credit is the proportion   of domestic
credit represented   by claims against   the private sector (IFS line 92d).        The logarithm    of per capita income is
obtained   by dividing   the 1980 GDP in dollars by a country’s population         as reported by IFS. The exchange rates
are also from the IFS.

                                              Summary                     Statistics.

     Industry real growth is the annual compounded                  growth rate in real value added estimated                    for the period
 1980-1990 for @       ISIC industry in each country.           The growth in the number of firms is the difference                  in the log
of ending period firms less the log of firms in the beginning                 of period.      The average size of firms in the industry
is obtained    by dividing    the Aue         added in the industry       by the number Of firms, and the growth in average size
is obtained    again as a difference          in logs.   The industry’s     share of total due          added is computed         dividing     the
1980 due       added of the industry           by the total Aue         added in manufacturing           that year.     All these data come
from the United Nations         statistics.     External   finance is the median fraction of capital expenditures                 not financed
with cash flow from operations           for each industry.      Cash flow from operations             is broadly defined M the sum             of

Compustat      funds from operations          (item # 110), decremes        in inventories,      decre=es    in receinbles,      and incre=es
in payables.   Equity finance is the median ratio of the net amount of equity issues to capital expenditures.                                Both
these variables have been constructuted              by the authors using Gmpustat.              Investment’s      share of GDP in 1980 is
from Euro      and Lee (1994).      The log of the 1980 per capita income in U.S. dollars is from the IFS. The average
years of sdooling    in the population over 25 years is from B=ro and Lee (1994).                      Financial development is the sum
of the ratio of total market value of publicly traded equity to GDP and the ratio of domestic                           credit to GDP (from
IFS and IFC), The origin of the legal system has four indicator                  ~iables       from La Porta et al. (1996).          Efficiency
of the judicial system is an index from O to 10 developed                by Bwiness      International       Cor-pomtion      that assessm the
efficency and integrity      of the legal environment.        The accounting         standards      is an index developed       by the Center
Jor International   Financial     Analysis & Reseanh ranking the amount of disclosure                       of companies’       annual reports
in each country.    The last two miables            are taken from La Porta et al. 11996).

    The dependent wiable         is the annual compounded growth rate in real value added estimated for the period
1980-1990 for each ISIC industry in each country. Investment’s share of GDP in 1980 is from Barro and Lee
(1994). The log of the 1980 per capita income in U.S. dollars is from IFS. The average years of schooling                             in
the population     over 25 years is from Barro and Lee (1994).              Financial    development    is the sum of the ratio of
total market due       of publicly    traded equity      to GDP and the ratio of domestic           credit to GDP. The industry’s
share of total Aue      added is computed     dividing the 1980 value added of the industry            by the total due       added in
manufacturing      that year (both these data come from the United Nations statistics).                External   dependence      is the
fraction of capital expenditures       not financed   with internal funds by U.S. firms in the same industry                 during the
1980s. The interaction mriable is the product of external dependence and financial development. The coefficients
for the constant     terms and indicator     variables    are not reported.     Heterosced=ticity       robust standard      errors are

    The dependent variable is the annual compounded                  growth rate in real value added estimated                 for the
period   1980-1990    for each ISIC industry in ea~           country. The industry’s share of total value added is
computed dividing the 1980 value added of the industry by the total value added in manufacturing                                  that
year (bet h these data come from the United Nations                 statistics).    External    dependence       is the fraction     of
capital expenditures    not financed with internal funds by U.S. firms in the same industry                      during the 1980s.
In column     I this ratio is computed    only for companies           that have been public           for at le=t     10 years, in
column     II the ratio is computed   for companies     that have gone public in the l=t               9 years, in column        111 is
computed     for U.S. firms during the 1970s. In columns             IV and V external dependence              is computed      for all
companies     (as in the bmic specification),    but in columns          IV external      dependence        is interacted     with the
level of accounting    standard   of each country    (divided       by 100) and in column V the regression             is restricted
to industries   that had a share of total value added in manufacturing                    above the median.         All regressions

Is financial dependence                                                  a proxy for other variables?
    The dependent           -iable      is the annual compounded             growth rate in real value added estimated                 for the period
1980-1990 for each ISIC industry                in each country.    The industry’s share of total tiue added is computed dividing
the 1980 value added of the industry by the total due                        added in manufacturing            that year (both these data come
from the United Nations statistics).               External dependence           is the fraction of capital expenditures           not financed with
internal funds by U.S. firms in the same industry                   during the 1980s. Column I adds to the b=ic                     specification     the
interaction    between external dependence              and a country’s human capital.               Column II adds to the basic specification
the interaction      between         external    dependence     and a country’s             level of economic      development       (log per capita
income).      Column 111 adds to the basic specification                  a wriable        multiplying     our fundamental       interaction   ~=iable
and a dummy equal to one if an industry                  is above median size in a country with above median weighted                           average
financial dependence. Column IV adds to the basic specification the interaction between external dependence and
a country’s weighted average external dependence.                         The weighted average external dependence is the sum over
all industries in a country of each industry’s share of value added in 1980 weighted by the external dependence.
Column V estimates the basic specification                    for industries      that in 1980 were less than the median                   size in their
respective     countries.    Column VI estimates          the basic specification             using instrumental     wriables.      The instruments
are the origin of a country legal system and the efficiency level of a country’s judicial system. All regressions
contain fixed country and industry effects (not reported). Heteroscedasticity robust standard errors are reported
in brackets.

The graph plots the median                level of external financing,         equity financing,     and investments        in the
U.S. across 3-digit            SIC industries   as a function      of the number         of years since the IPO. External
finance     is the amount           of investments       (CAPEX)        not financed     with cash flow from operations,
reduction       in inventories,       or decreases   in trade credit.        Equity finance is the net amount            of funds
raised through             equity   issues divided   by the amount           of investments.    Investment         is the ratio of
CAPEX    to net property, plant and equipment. The IPO year is defined as the first year in
which a company stats to be traded on the NYSE, AMEX, or NASDAQ.       All the information
is obtained          from the flow of funds data in Compustat,                  except   for the SIC code which is from
