              MULTIPLE EQUILIBRIA AND PERSISTENCE IN
                      AGGREGATE FLUCTUATIONS

                             ABSTRACT


     This paper explores the impact of incomplete markets and
strong complementarities on the time series properties of
aggregate activity. We consider an economy which consists of a
large number of industries whose production functions both are
nonconvex and exhibit localized technological complementarities.

The productivity of each industry at t is determined by the

production decisions of technologically similar industries at t -

1.   No markets exist to coordinate production decisions. This
feature implies that aggregate output dynamics for the model are
quite different from those predicted by the associated

Arrow-Debreu economy. First, multiple stochastic equilibria
exist in aggregate activity. These equilibria are distinguished
by differences in the mean and the variance of output. Second,

output movements are persistent as aggregate productivity shocks
indefinitely affect real activity by shifting the economy across
equilibria. As a result, the model can exhibit periods of boom

and depression.

Introduction


        ReCCILt developments in theoretical macroeconomics have emphasized the
potential for multiple, Pareto-rankable equilibria to exist for economies where various
Arrow-Debreu assumptions are violated. Authors such as Diamond [1982] have
emphasized how incomplete markets can allow economies to become trapped in Pareto-
inferior equilibria; Helter [1986] has obtained similar results due to imperfect competition.
These different approaches share the idea that strong complementarities in behavior can
lead to multiplicity. Intuitively, when technological or demand spillovers make agents
sufficiently interdependent, high and low levels of activity can represent internally
consistent equilibria in the absence of complete, competitive markets. Most of these
models describe multiple steady states in economies rather than multiple nondegenerate
time series paths and consequently cannot address issues of aggregate fluctuations.
Further, this literature has not shown how economies can shift across equilibria, inducing
periods of boom and depression.
        An independent literature has argued that aggregate fluctuations are strongly
persistent. Researchers have concluded from a variety of perspectives that aggregate
output in advanced industrialized economies contains a unit root. Despite controversy
over the exact magnitude of the permanent component, the effects of current events on
real activity apparently persist over long horizons.
        The purpose of the current paper is to link the new multiplicity results in
macroeconomic theory with the evidence on output persistence. We do this by modelling
coordination problems in an explicitly stochastic framework. As developed in Durlauf
[1990,1991), the microeconomic specification of the economy is expressed as a set of
conditional probability measures describing how individual agents behave given the
economy's history. An aggregate equilibrium exists when one can find a joint probability
measure over all agents which is consistent with these conditional measures; multiplicity
occurs when several such measures exist. This approach permits one to directly describe


                                              1
the time series properties of aggregate fluctuations along different equilibrium paths.
        Specifically, we examine the capital accumulation problems of a set of infinitely-
lived industries. We deviate from standard analyses in two respects. First, each industry
faces a nonconvex production technology. Second, industries experience technological
complementarities as past high production decisions by each industry increase the current
productivity of several industries through dynamic learning-by-doing or other effects.
Industries do not coordinate production decisions because of incomplete markets. By
describing how output levels and productivity evolve as industries interact over time, the
model characterizes the impact of complementarities and incomplete markets on the
structure of aggregate fluctuations.
        Our basic results are twofold. First, we show that with strong complementarities
and incomplete markets, multiple stochastic equilibria exist in aggregate activity. These
equilibria are distinguished by differences in both the mean and the variance of output.
Second, we illustrate how aggregate output movements will be persistent as aggregate
productivity shocks indefinitely affect real activity by shifting the economy across
equilibria. Although the current model does not exhibit a unit root, one will emerge if
deterministic technical change is introduced.


I. A model of interacting industries


        Consider a countable infinity of industries indexed by i. Each industry consists
of many small, identical firms. All firms produce a homogeneous good; industries are
distinguished by distinct production functions rather than distinct outputs.              The
homogeneous final good may be consumed by the owners of the firms or converted to a
capital good which fully depreciates after one period.     Industry i's behavior is
proportional to the behavior of a representative firm which chooses a capital stock
sequence {K,1} to maximize the present discounted value of profits Jl

         1Durlauf [1990] derives a general equilibrium version of this economy.

                             = E(E fl'(Y1— K11) ff).                                     (1)


V11   equals the output of the i'th industry's representative firm at             equals all
available information at 2. Initial endowments V10 provide starting capital.
        Aggregate behavior is determined by the interactions of many heterogencous
industries employing nonconvex technologies. Production occurs with a one period lag;
firms at 1—I employ both one of two production techniques and a level of capital to
determine output at 1. Only one technique may be used at a time. Cooper [1987] and
Murphy, Shleifer, and Vishny [1989] exploit similar technologies to analyze multiple
equilibria; Milgrom and Roberts (1990] discuss how this type of nonconvexity can arise as
firms internally coordinate many complementary activities.            The technique-specific
production functions produce Y1 and          Y2
                                         through


                                   = 11(1(1,1_i— F1,(111_1,(...1)



                                 I, t   = f2(''I, t—1'1, —1'E—1)-                        (2)


      and q1 are industry-specific productivity shocks; ( is an aggregate productivity
shock and F1 is a fixed overhead capital cost. Cl.t_1, q111, and ( are elements of
        Recalling that firms within an industry are identical, we define 'H which equals 1
if technique 1 is used by industry i at 1, 0 otherwise and =
which equals the joint set of techniques employed at 2.
         We make the following assumptions.           First, each technique fulfills standard
curvature conditions.     Further, we associate technique 1 with high production.
Specifically, net capital NK, which equals K11—F1 for technique 1 and                     for

technique 2, has a strictly higher marginal (and by implication total) product when used
with technique 1 than technique 2. A firm chooses technique 1 if it is willing to pay fixed


                                                3
capital costs in exchange for higher output.


Assumption 1. Rtrictions on techniquc.-specific production functions


For all realizations   of(,               and NK,

     8fi(NK,c,.) > 8f2(NK,q,()
         0/1K                8/1K

        Both techniques are assumed to exhibit technological complementarities, as the
history of realized activity determines the parameters of the production function at t.
Romer's [1986] model of social increasing returns shares this feature.                    Our
complementarities differ from Romer's in two respects. First, all complementarities are
local as the production function of each firm is affected by the production decisions of a
finite number of industries. The index i           orders
                                                 industries by similarity in technology;
spillovers occur only between similar technologies. David [1988] describes the historical
importance of local complementarities in the evolution of technical innovations. Second,
our complementarities are explicitly dynamic. Past production decisions affect current
productivity, which captures the idea of learning-by-doing.
         Specifically, we model the complementarities through the dependence of the
productivity shocks ( and q on the history of technique choices (See Durlauf [1990]
for a justification). Complementarities are assumed to be the only source of dependence
across shocks. Prob(r I y) denotes the conditional probability measure of z given
information y x(y)        denotes   the random variable associated with this measure.
     = {i—k...i...i+l)   indexes the industries which affect industry i's productivity.

        No markets exist whereby individual firms can coordinate to exploit
complementarities.   Consequently, no industry may be compensated for choosing
technique 1 in order to expand the production sets of other industries; nor, given our
conceptualization of industries as aggregates of many small producers, can firms within
an industry strategically choose a technique in order to induce higher future productivity
through complementarities.        Market incompleteness combines with the production
nonconvexity to fundamentally affect aggregate dynamics.


II. Local complementaritics and multiple equilibria


        We initially analyze the economy without aggregate shocks, by setting = 0 V t.
From our assumptions, one may show that equilibrium industry technique choices obey
conditional probabilities of the form


                              I   a1_) = Prob(wj,t I w1,1_1   V .f   Ak,:).           (3)


Once technique choices are determined, one can solve for the optimal levels of capital and
output for each firm. In fact, a sufficient condition for the existence of equilibrium

                                                 5
capital and output sequences forall firms is the existence of a joint probability measure
over all technique choices which is consistent with the conditional measures (3). Durlauf
(1990] verifies that such a joint measure exists for any initial conditions tu0.
        We now restrict the conditional probabilities in order to discuss multiplicity and
dynamics. Past choices of technique 1 are assumed to improve the current relative
productivity of the technique. As a result, technique 1 choices will propagate over time.
Further, we assume that          is a steady state, which means that when all productivity
spillovers are active, the effects are so strong that high production is always optimal.


Assumption 3. Impact of past technique choices on current technique prohabilitics2


Let w and u/ denote two realizations of_. If w1               V j E Ak,, then


A. Prob(w1t = lj           = wV 5€ Ak,,) Frob(a1 =           i         =     V
                                                                                   l€Ak,,).

B. Proh(w111 =   i         = 1 Vjc ''k,t) = L

       Whenever some industry chooses L' = 0, a positive productivity feedback is lost.
Different configurations of choices at t — 1 determine different production sets and
conditional technique choice probabilities for each industry. We bound the technique
choice probabilities from below and above by O'r and ert respectively.


                rr      Proó(w1,1 =   ii       = 0 for some 5€ Ak,,)       rr                 (4)


        Sincew1=1 is an equilibrium, multiple equilibria exist if for some initial
conditions, w=1 fails to emerge as t grows. Notice that even if c' = 0, favorable

        2This assumption can be reformulated in terms of restrictions on the technique-
specific production functions.

                                               6
productivity shocks will periodically induceindustries to produce using technique 1. The
choice of technique 1 by one industry, through the complementaritics, increases the
probability that the technique is subsequently chosen in several industries. With strong
spillovers, these effects may build up, allowing g=1 to emerge from any initial
conditions. The model therefore allows us to analyze the stability of a high aggregate
output equilibrium from arbitrary initial conditions.
        In fact, the limiting behavior of the economy is determined by the bounds
and err. If the probability of high production by an industry is sufficiently large for
all production histories, then the spillover effects induced by spontaneous technique 1
choices cause the economy to iterate towards high production. Alternatively, if technique
1 probabilities are too low in the absence of active spillovers, spontaneous technique 1
choices will not generate sufficient momentum to achieve the w=1 equilibrium. er;8
and G' bound the degree of complementarity in the economy. Large values of
imply complementarities are weak as technique I is chosen relatively frequently regardless
of the past.  Conversely, small values of err imply strong complementarities; the
probability of current high production is very sensitive to past technique choices.
Theorem 1, proven in Durlauf (1990], shows how long run industry behavior is jointly
determined by initial conditions and conditional technique probabilities.

                                       Prob(w, = ii   = 9) <1.

If complementarities are sufficiently strong, no industry converges to the high production
technique almost sureig from economy-wide low production technique initial conditions.

If complementarities are sufficiently weak, each industry converges to the high production

        One can associate =J with the equilibrium which would emerge if all firms
chose their production levels cooperatively. If production through technique 1 is
sufficiently large for '=! versus any other configuration, then g= emerges as the
cooperative equilibrium after one period. Consequently, incompleteness of markets lowers
the mean and increases the variance of industry and aggregate output along the
inefficient equilibrium path, as technique choices fluctuate over time. When industries
fail to coordinate, production decisions become dependent on idiosyncratic productivity
shocks. Observe that the volatility associated with the inefficient equilibrium is caused
by fundamentals. Simulations in Durlauf [1990,1991] show that aggregate output can
obey a wide range of AR processes, depending on A.


ifi. Path dependence and aggregate shocks

         Now consider the role of the aggregate shocks . By affecting many industries
simultaneously, these shocks act in a way analogous to changing the initial conditions of
the economy. Path dependence occurs as one realization of       permanently changes the
equilibrium in the absence of future offsetting shocks. We assume that sufficiently
unfavorable aggregate productivity draws make technique 1 unlikely whereas sufficiently
favorable draws ensure the use of the technique.


Assumption 4. Impact of aggregate shocks on technique choice


There   exist numbers a and b, with Prob(e, a) and Prob( 6) both nonzero, such that


                                            8

B. Pro6(we =    ii t         Jj,t.-i = 0 V i€ A',,) = 1.


         When this assumption holds, aggregate shocks can have an indefinite effect on
real activity. Durlauf [1991] verifies

         This result shows how fluctuations can be persistent. For example, once many
sectors simultaneously decline due to an adverse aggregate shock, productivity enhancing
complementarities are lost until a subsequent favorable draw restores them. If                is
ergodic, then the economy will cycle between the equilibria.
       Several interpretations beyond productivity can be applied to the aggregate
shocks. Interpreting . as a proxy for the financial sector, the model indicates how the
breakdown of financial institutions, such as occurred during the Depression, can cause
indefinite output toss. Alternatively, Durlauf [1990] shows how           can represent the cost
of production inputs provided by leading sectors such as transportation or steel. In this
case, the growth of leading sectors improves the relative profitability of high production,
         3This bound is defined in Theorem I.

                                                 9
which can lead to a takeoff in growth as the economy shifts across equilibria.


IV. Summary and conclusions


        This paper has explored how economies can exhibit multiple equilibria and
output persistence as a consequence of dynamic coordination failure. These features arise
when strong technological complementarities interact with incomplete markets. Low
production initial conditions prevent an economy from realizing positive technological
complementarities. Further, aggregate shocks can generate indefinite movements in total
output as productivity feedbacks induced by complementarities emerge or disappear. The
model exhibits both persistence of shocks as well as a mechanism for reversals of booms
and downturns. One application of these ideas is to explore whether output behavior
during the Depression and World War IT can be interpreted along these lines.
