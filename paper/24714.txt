Global Effective Lower Bound and Unconventional Monetary Policy

                                         ABSTRACT

In a standard open-economy New Keynesian model, the effective lower bound causes anomalies:
output and terms of trade respond to a supply shock in the opposite direction compared to normal
times. We introduce a tractable framework to accommodate for unconventional monetary policy.
In our model, these anomalies disappear. We allow unconventional policy to be partially active
and asymmetric between countries. Empirically, we find the US, Euro area, and UK have
implemented a considerable amount of unconventional monetary policy: the US follows the
historical Taylor rule, whereas the others have done less compared to normal times.

1     Introduction

Since the Great Recession, many major central banks of developed economies have faced the
effective lower bound (ELB) for their policy interest rates and resorted to unconventional
monetary policy to provide further stimulus. In this extraordinary environment, how do we
evaluate the role of unconventional monetary policy theoretically and empirically?
    In a standard New Keynesian model (e.g., Eggertsson and Woodford (2003) for a closed
economy and Cook and Devereux (2013a) for an open economy), the ELB yields to the classic
liquidity trap. The central bank cannot further reduce the policy rate, and monetary policy
is completely absent. However, emerging empirical studies provide overwhelming evidence to
demonstrate the effectiveness of unconventional monetary policy; see, for example, Gagnon
et al. (2011), Hamilton and Wu (2012), Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen (2011), Bauer
and Rudebusch (2014), and Wu and Xia (2016) for its domestic impact, and Neely (2015),
Bauer and Neely (2014), Bowman et al. (2015), and Chen et al. (2016) for its global effects.
    We propose a tractable New Keynesian model that incorporates unconventional mone-
tary policy into an otherwise standard model to be consistent with empirical findings. We
propose a Taylor (1993)-type policy rule to conveniently summarize both conventional and
unconventional monetary policy; see Wu and Zhang (2017) for how to implement a nega-
tive interest rate via QE, for example. We extend the framework of Wu and Zhang (2017),
where unconventional monetary policy follows the historical Taylor rule by construction. In
this paper, we relax this assumption and allow unconventional policy to be potentially less
effective, and countries can implement them asymmetrically. Our new model nests the tra-
ditional model where monetary policy is absent at the ELB and the model in Wu and Zhang
(2017) with fully active unconventional monetary policy. We illustrate our new framework
with a two-country setup, similar to Clarida et al. (2002) and Cook and Devereux (2013a),
but it can be easily extended to the small-open economy.
    During normal times, a negative supply shock from the home country leads to lower home
output and terms of trade. In our model, if a sufficient amount of unconventional monetary

                                             2
policy is implemented, the same results apply for the ELB. On the contrary, the standard
model implies an opposite movement of output and terms of trade during a liquidity trap,
and we will refer to these movements as anomalies.
   The basic mechanism that leads to these anomalies consists of two channels. First, it
transmits through inflation and the real interest rate, which works the same way as in a
closed-economy macro model. A negative supply shock leads to higher inflation for home
goods. At the ELB, the nominal rate does not move, which lowers the real rate. The lower
real rate stimulates demand and hence the equilibrium output of the home country. In the
open economy with complete financial markets, international trade further amplifies this
effect through a depreciation in terms of trade.
   When we allow the two countries to implement their respective unconventional monetary
policy asymmetrically, we find different results for the home and foreign economies. For the
home country, its own policy matters the most, whereas the foreign economy relies on both
central banks. More active home or foreign policy is associated with higher welfare, and
the most efficient case is obtained when both countries’ unconventional policies follow their
historical policy rules.
   We explore alternative model and parameter specifications for robustness. The anomalies
are generally robust for alternative models with one exception: the anomaly for terms of
trade depends on whether the international financial markets are complete or not, whereas
the result for output is not sensitive. We also assess the robustness of these anomalies
across alternative parameter values. We find they are not sensitive to structural parameters,
including the Frisch elasticity of labor supply, elasticity of intertemporal substitution, and
home bias. Results vary more over parameters governing the preference shock, which creates
the ELB environment. We find as long as the ELB lasts for several quarters or longer, the
anomalies hold.
   Finally, we seek empirical evidence for unconventional monetary policy in the United
States, Euro area, and United Kingdom. First, we test model implications by comparing


                                              3
how output responds to a supply shock in a structural vector autoregression (VAR) between
normal times and the ELB. We find that for all three countries and regions, output decreases
with a negative shock to the growth rate of total-factor productivity (TFP) regardless of
normal times or the ELB. This result is in contrast to the anomaly presented in the standard
New Keynesian model. Our theoretical model suggests unconventional monetary policy as
one potential explanation for this result.1
      Next, we quantify unconventional monetary policy empirically. Specifically, we compare
what has been done with what should have been done according to the historical Taylor
rule. We find the US, Euro area, and UK have implemented a considerable amount of un-
conventional monetary policy, which explains why the anomaly does not appear in the data.
Moreover, the US operates its unconventional monetary policy similarly to the historical
Taylor rule, whereas the Euro area and UK have operated less unconventionally than what
they would normally have done.
      The rest of the paper after a brief literature review proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes
the theoretical model, and we discuss model implications with and without unconventional
monetary policy in Section 3. Section 4 assesses empirical evidence for unconventional mon-
etary policy, and Section 5 concludes.


Literature Our paper is related to several recent papers that investigate policy responses
in the global low interest rate environment. Cook and Devereux (2013a) analyze the inter-
action between monetary and fiscal policy in a global liquidity trap with a two-country New
Keynesian model. Cook and Devereux (2013b) compare a currency union with a system
with a flexible exchange rate. Fujiwara et al. (2013) focus on the optimal monetary policy.
Eggertsson et al. (2016) consider the effectiveness of monetary and fiscal policy during the
global secular stagnation, using an open-economy overlapping generations model. Different
from the existing literature, our model focuses on the role of unconventional monetary policy.
      Our empirical analysis of the Taylor rule is related to Hakkio and Kahn (2014). The
  1
      Debortoli et al. (2016) use a similar VAR result in the US to argue for unconventional monetary policy.

                                                      4
main difference is we propose alternative ways to compute the quantity for what should
have been done, and our methods are less subject to accumulating and compounding errors
and uncertainty over time. Our structural VAR results are consistent with Garı́n et al.
(forthcoming) and Debortoli et al. (2016). The difference is the literature has focused on the
US, and our analysis encompasses the US, Euro area, and UK.
    The literature has discussed alternative solutions for the ELB. For example, Boneva
et al. (2016) and Gust et al. (2017) propose using nonlinear methods, and Cochrane (2017)
recommends exploring alternative equilibria. We focus on unconventional monetary policy as
a plausible explanation, and a similar argument has been made to explain ELB with different
models. For example, Diba and Loisel (2017) model a liquidity premium as an instrument
for unconventional monetary policy. The benefit of our framework is its tractability: It is
a straightforward extension of the standard New Keynesian model, and can nest various
models proposed in the literature; see Wu and Zhang (2017) for details.
    The ELB environment is analogous to a currency union for country-specific shocks; see
Eggertsson et al. (2014) and Galı́ and Monacelli (2016). For a discussion of their slight dif-
ferences, see Erceg and Lindé (2012). Future work could explore how to carry our framework
into that environment.



2     Model

This section describes a two-country open-economy New Keynesian model. Many model in-
gredients are standard and similar to Clarida et al. (2002) and Cook and Devereux (2013a).
The main difference is we do not restrict our attention to the standard setup for the ELB,
that is, the nominal interest rate is zero and the monetary authority provides no additional
stimulus. Instead, we allow a potential role for unconventional monetary policy, which could
be completely inactive, fully active, and anywhere in between. See the setup in Subsec-
tion 2.5, and economic implications are discussed in Section 3.

      The two countries, home and foreign, are the same size and symmetric. Households
consume both home and foreign goods with some preference for the domestically produced
products. Firms hire labor to produce differentiated goods, and face Calvo (1983)-type price
rigidity. The wage paid to workers is determined in a perfectly competitive labor market
without any frictions. Complete financial markets allow perfect international risk sharing.2
Monetary policy follows a Taylor (1993) rule.
      For the most part, we describe the home economy, and the foreign optimization problems
are symmetric, which are denoted by an asterisk superscript ∗ . H stands for home-produced
goods, and F is foreign goods.

is the inverse of the Frisch elasticity of labor supply.

2.3       Firms

There is a continuum of firms, indexed by i ∈ [0, 1]. Each firm hires labor and produces
differentiated goods with the production function:


                                        Yt (i) = At Nt (i),                                (2.17)


where At is the exogenous technology process and it follows log(At )−log(A) = ρA [log(At−1 )−
log(A)] + εat , where log(A) is the steady-state value and εat ∼ N (0, σa2 ). Firms’ real marginal
cost is

                                             (1 − g)Wt
                                    M Ct =             ,                                   (2.18)

where g is the wage subsidy for firms to ensure the efficient output level at the steady state.
   Firms set prices for differentiated goods in the Calvo fashion. A firm can reset its price

The goods market-clearing condition is

The labor market clears when

Adding two countries together, the world welfare is


                                            W W = W + W ∗.                                        (2.23)



2.5     Monetary policy and the effective lower bound

The monetary policy follows a Taylor interest-rate rule:


                               ŝt = ρs ŝt−1 + (1 − ρs ) [φπ π̂Ht + φy xt ] ,                    (2.24)


where st is the desired interest rate, which is the interest rate implied by the Taylor rule.
Hatted variables are log deviations from the steady states ŝt = st − s and π̂Ht = πHt − π,
π = log(Π), and s and Π are the steady-state nominal interest rate and inflation. xt = yt −ytn
is the output gap, yt = log(Yt ), and ytn = log(Ytn ) is the natural level of output, or the
equilibrium output under flexible prices when ζ = 0; see more details in Appendix A.1. ρs
captures the persistence of the interest-rate rule, and φπ and φy are the sensitivities of the
nominal interest rate to inflation and output, respectively.


Effective lower bound and unconventional monetary policy During normal times,
the policy rate is


                                               rt = st .


When the ELB binds st < 0,3 the policy rate rt = 0. We conveniently summarize all
monetary policy actions with the shadow rate St :


                                              St = λst .                                          (2.25)
   3
    For simplicity, we take 0 as the lower bound, and hence the ELB becomes the zero lower bound. In
practice, the lower bound does not necessarily have to be zero (see Wu and Xia (2016)) or a constant (see
Wu and Xia (2017)).



                                                     11
      The case of λ = 0 and rtB = St = rt = 0 corresponds to the ELB in the standard New
Keynesian model. In the background of the New Keynesian model, money is an alternative
to bond. Hence, it is undesirable for an agent to hold a bond that pays a negative interest
rate. The standard model is mute about the central bank’s unconventional monetary policy.
      However, a growing literature argues that unconventional monetary policy has a stimu-
lative effect on the economy that is similar to the effect of conventional policy, which implies
λ = 1; for example, see Wu and Xia (2016), Wu and Zhang (2017), Mouabbi and Sahuc
(2017), and Debortoli et al. (2016).
      Note that, even when λ = 1, agents still do not hold a bond that pays a negative interest
rate, given money as an alternative. So how does a negative St enter the households’ problem?
Wu and Zhang (2017) argue that at the ELB, the relevant interest rate for economic agents
is not the constant policy rate rt = 0. Rather, it should be some private interest rate, rtB , in
our households’ problem. We can relate the private interest rate to the policy rate by


                                               rtB = rt + rpt ,


where rpt is the wedge between the two, which we call the risk premium. The risk premium
term could potentially capture the term premium for a long term bond, a corporate spread,
or a convenience yield. During normal times, monetary policy actions work through rt , and
rpt = rp is a constant; hence, rtB = rt + rp. When the ELB binds, unconventional monetary
policy, such as QE, lowers rpt to further provide stimulus.
      As a convenient shortcut, we write


                                               rtB = St + rp,                                        (2.26)


and use the shadow rate St as a summary statistic for all conventional and unconventional
monetary policy.4 Note, St = st = rt during normal times. Therefore, our model is the

      Wu and Zhang (2017) illustrated that the differences between various private interest rates and Wu and


                                                     12
same as the standard model, albeit the constant premium rp. However, our model differs
from the standard model at the ELB because St summarizes the time-varying part of rpt
and incorporates unconventional monetary policy. Although St < 0, rtB remains positive to
be consistent with the households’ optimizing behavior.5
    In this paper, we do not limit to λ = 0 or λ = 1. Rather, we explore all possibilities along
λ ∈ [0, 1]. Quantitative analyses of the theoretical model are in Section 3, and empirical
results follow in Section 4.



3     Anomalies at the ELB and unconventional monetary

      policy

This section first discusses analytically and quantitatively the anomalies at the ELB artifi-
cially created by the standard New Keynesian model, which does not capture any effort by
the central bank’s unconventional monetary policy; that is, λ = 0 in (2.25). By contrast, we
demonstrate these anomalies disappear once unconventional monetary policy is introduced
in our model. Next, we relax the model assumptions in two steps. First, we allow different
degrees of activeness for unconventional monetary policy λ ∈ [0, 1]. Second, we further relax
λ = λ∗ and allow the two countries to implement unconventional monetary policy differently,
and study their interactions. Finally, we consider several alternative model and parameter
specifications.


3.1     Anomalies at the ELB

This section presents the anomalies at the ELB: when a negative supply shock hits the
economy, output and terms of trade increase, which is the opposite direction from normal
times. These anomalies disappear when unconventional monetary policy is implemented.
Xia’s (2016) shadow rate appear to be constant.
   5
     Wu and Zhang (2017) demonstrated that various private interest rates in the United States are still
positive and not constraint during the ZLB era.


                                                  13
We first derive some analytical results in a simplified setting to gain some intuition, and
then relax the simplifying assumptions and present quantitative results.


3.1.1   Analytical results

In this section, we derive analytical properties to provide some intuition with the following
simplifying restrictions: ρs = 0 and ξt = 0 ∀t, so that for any variable zt , we can write
Et [zt+1 ] = ρa zt . The analytical analysis also imposes φy = 0 for simplicity. We create the
ELB environment with an interest-rate peg at the steady state Ŝt = 0. We find the solution
that solves for any generic λ first and then impose λ = 0 for the ELB, and ignore other
potential equilibria that only arise at the ELB. We will relax all these assumptions in the
quantitative Section 3.1.2.
   When a supply shock occurs, the inflation differential, output differential, and terms of
trade move with technology as follows:


                      π̂Ht − π̂F∗ t = −2Θ(1 + φ)(1 − ρa )σ0 Λa ât                                   (3.1)

                         ŷt − ŷt∗ = Θ(1 + φ)(λφπ − ρa )(D + 1)Λa ât                               (3.2)
                                                              σ(D + 1)
                               τ̂t = Θ(1 + φ)(λφπ − ρa )               Λa ât ,                      (3.3)
                                                                 D

where ât = log(At ) − log(A), ŷt = yt − y, τ̂t = τt − τ , and y = log(Y ) and τ = log(T )
                                    (1−βκ)(1−κ)                                   1
are the steady-state values. Θ =         κ
                                                  > 0, Λa =   Θ(σ/D+φ)(λφπ −ρa )(D+1)+2σ0 (1−ρa )(1−βρa )
                                                                                                          ,
D = [(ν − 1)2 + σν(2 − ν)] > 0, σ0 = σ − (1 − ν/2)(σ − 1)νσ/D = σ(D + 1)/(2D) > 0. These
equations lead to the following proposition:

Proposition 1 If φπ > 1 and Λa > 0, ât < 0 implies π̂Ht − π̂F∗ t > 0, and

   • ŷt − ŷt∗ < 0, τ̂t < 0 when λ = 1.

   • ŷt − ŷt∗ > 0, τ̂t > 0 when λ = 0.

Proof : See Appendix B.1.

                                                  14
   The contrast between the two cases in Proposition 1 illustrates the anomalies. To demon-
strate the intuition, we ignore the home supply shock’s foreign effect for now, which we will
see is small in the quantitative section. During normal times λ = 1, a negative home TPF
shock lowers the domestic output and terms of trade when the monetary policy obeys the
Taylor principal φπ > 1. By contrast, when the ELB binds and the central bank is com-
pletely out of the picture, the same shock stimulates its own economy by raising equilibrium
output, and increases the terms of trade. In our setting, unconventional monetary policy
in (2.24) and (2.25) works the same as the conventional Taylor rule when it is fully active
with λ = 1. Hence, results for unconventional monetary policy are identical to normal times.
Λa > 0 is imposed to guarantee inflation moves in the same direction whether λ = 0 or 1.
It is always satisfied for λ = 1, and when λ = 0, it is guaranteed by 0 < ρa < ρ̄a , where the
bound is defined in Appendix B.1.
   Proposition 1 makes statements about inflation and output differentials, which we then
interpret as home quantities by approximating changes to the foreign economy to zero. To
see how the home economy moves without approximation, we’ll study the special case of
σ = 1 or ν = 2, in which the home shock does not move across the border. The case ν = 2
corresponds to complete home bias and hence no trade, whereas when σ = 1, income and
substitution effects in the foreign economy are completely canceled out.

Corollary 1 If (σ − 1)(ν − 2) = 0, φπ > 1, and Λa > 0, ât < 0 implies π̂F∗ t = 0, ŷt∗ = 0,
π̂Ht > 0, and

   • ŷt < 0, τ̂t < 0 when λ = 1.

   • ŷt > 0, τ̂t > 0 when λ = 0.

Proof : See Appendix B.2.
   Corollary 1 illustrates similar anomalies to Proposition 1. The difference is when σ = 1
or ν = 2, the foreign economy does not move in response to the home TFP shock. Hence,
we can make precise statements about the home economy.

                                             15
    Next, we study how international trade contributes to the anomalies at the ELB in
Proposition 1. We compare the case with international trade ν < 2 with the no-trade case
ν = 2.


Proposition 2 If λ = 0, 1 < σ < φ and Λa > 0, ât < 0 implies ŷt − ŷt∗ ≥ (ŷt − ŷt∗ ) |ν=2 > 0,
and τ̂t ≥ τ̂t |ν=2 > 0.


Proof : See Appendix B.3.
    With some mild condition between σ and φ, international trade amplifies the impact
of the TFP shock on output and terms of trade, which makes the anomalies even more
prominent.


3.1.2    Quantitative illustration

Setup for quantitative analysis We set up a quantitative environment here that we
will use hereafter, where we relax all the assumptions imposed in Section 3.1.1. We study
economies’ responses to a negative home TFP shock, which serves as a supply shock. We
create the ELB environment with a sequence of preference shocks, and use the occasionally
binding method of Guerrieri and Iacoviello (2015) to solve the model. Model details are in
Appendix A, and details for calibration and the solution method are in Appendix C.


Results Figure 1 plots impulse response functions of economic quantities to a negative
TFP shock in the home country. Green dots are normal times. Red dashed lines represent
that the ELB prevails in both countries. The blue solid lines plot what happens when both
countries implement unconventional monetary policy following the historical Taylor rule,
that is, λ = λ∗ = 1. Note the blue solid lines and green dots always overlap each other.
    Figure 1 illustrates the same anomalies as we discussed in Section 3.1.1. In response to
the negative supply shock, output and terms of trade decrease during normal times or with
unconventional monetary policy, whereas they increase when the ELB is binding and central

     Notes: A negative technological shock of -0.5% (2 standard deviations) happens in the home country in period 12. To create the ELB environment in
     the blue solid and red dashed lines, a series of negative preference shocks occurs in both countries in periods 1 - 15, and the total shock size in each
     country is 23% (about 2/3 of a standard deviation in each period). We difference out the effect of preference shocks, and only plot the additional
     effect of the technological shock. The blue solid lines represent the case in which fully active unconventional monetary policy is implemented. The
     red dashed lines represent the case in which, when the policy rate is bounded by zero, no unconventional monetary policy is implemented. The green
     dotted lines represent normal times with the standard Taylor rule, and the only shock that hits the economy is the TFP shock. The shaded area
     marks periods 9 - 20, for which both countries stay at the ELB with only the preference shocks and without unconventional monetary policy. X-axis:
     time in quarters; Y-axis: annualized percentage changes for interest rates and inflation, percentage changes relative to the steady states for output
     and terms of trade.
banks are absent. Additionally, we also see a contrast for foreign output, albeit in a smaller
scale given the origin of the shock.
   Next, we calculate welfare, which, unlike variables in Figure 1, are non-linear objects.
We compute the total welfare in the presence of all the shocks. We find the case with ELB
and no policy intervention suffers from the largest welfare losses for both the home and
foreign economies. The losses become much smaller when unconventional monetary policy is
fully active. Note that normal times have slightly higher welfare compared to the case with
unconventional monetary policy, because the ELB is created by preference shocks, which
introduce some inefficiency.


3.1.3   Mechanism

The basic mechanism that leads to these results consists of two channels. First, it transmits
through inflation and the real interest rate, which works the same as in a closed-economy
macro model; see Wu and Zhang (2017), for example. A negative supply shock leads to
a higher inflation for home goods. During normal times or with unconventional monetary
policy, the nominal interest rate increases as a response, which leads to a higher real interest
rate. However, at the ELB, the nominal rate does not move, which lowers the real rate. The
lower real rate stimulates demand and hence equilibrium output in the home country.
   The open-economy model introduces an additional international channel. To illustrate
this channel, we plot in Figure 2 the ELB cases with and without international trade. The
red dashed lines are identical to the red dashed lines in Figure 1. The case without trade is
in black solid lines, where ν = 2.
   Without trade, the foreign economy does not react to the home shock, which is consistent
with Corollary 1. International trade brings this shock across the border into the foreign
economy, which in turn further amplifies its effect on the home output: the home country is
expected to have a lower real interest rate compared to the foreign country, which increases
the terms of trade through (2.13). Higher terms of trade imply a decrease in the relative

Notes: A negative technological shock of -0.5% happens in the home country in period 12. To create the
ELB environment, a series of negative preference shocks occurs in both countries in periods 1 - 15, and the
total shock size in each country is 23%. We difference out the effect of preference shocks, and only plot
the additional effect of the technological shock. The red dashed lines represent the case with trade, and the
black solid lines represent the case without trade ν = 2. In both cases, the policy rate is bounded by zero
and no unconventional monetary policy is implemented. The shaded area marks periods 9 - 20, for which
both countries stay at the ELB with only the preference shocks and without unconventional monetary policy.

price of home goods, and therefore households shift their demand toward home goods. Hence,
international trade reduces foreign output and further increases home production. This result
is consistent with Proposition 2.


Discussion The anomaly on output is robust across different parameter spaces and alter-
native model specifications; see Subsection 3.3 for robustness. Garı́n et al. (forthcoming)
and Wieland (2017) discussed a similar anomaly in closed-economy models. The result on
terms of trade depends on whether the international financial markets are complete; see
further discussion in Section 3.3.4. It is not sensitive to varying parameters or other model
specifications though.

3.2     Partially active unconventional monetary policy

We have studied the limiting cases in which unconventional monetary policy is either com-
pletely absent, λ = 0, or fully active, λ = 1. In this section, we explore all possibilities along
λ ∈ [0, 1] and allow unconventional monetary policy to be partially active. Section 3.2.1
imposes λ = λ∗ that both central banks’ interventions are equally active, and we turn to the
asymmetric case in Section 3.2.2.


3.2.1    Symmetric case

Figure 3 summarizes the response of each economic variable to the TFP shock to a one-
dimensional object and plots it as a function of λ, which is the same as λ∗ . For the first
seven variables, we plot the average impulse response during the ELB. For λ = 0 (λ = 1), they


                                                                                                     20
are equal to the average values of the red dashed (blue solid) lines from period 12 to 19 (20)
in Figure 1. Both the home output and terms of trade decrease from positive to negative as
unconventional monetary policy becomes more active, whereas the foreign output increases
from negative to positive. Lifetime welfare, W and W ∗ , increases when unconventional
monetary policy becomes more active, and fully active unconventional monetary policy is
the closest to being efficient.
   Interestingly, the home country’s nominal interest rate does not increase monotonically
with λ. Combining (2.24) - (2.26), the nominal rate depends on the products λπHt and λyt .
While λ increases, both inflation and output decrease. For small λ, when λ increases, rtB
increases. At some point, the rate of decrease in πHt and yt overweighs the increase of λ,
and hence rtB decreases.


3.2.2   Asymmetric case

Next, we further relax the assumption λ = λ∗ and allow two countries to operate their
unconventional monetary policy differently, and study their interactions. Figure 4 plots
summary responses to the TFP shock as functions of λ and λ∗ . Different colors represent
different values for economic quantities, where light green (dark blue) represents higher
(lower) values. The 45-degree lines correspond to the symmetric case λ = λ∗ in Figure 3.
   For the home country, mainly its own policy matters: the more active its central bank
is in implementing unconventional monetary policy, the lower its output and inflation. It is
similar for the terms of trade: a higher λ is associated with smaller terms of trade.
   The foreign economy, as well as welfare, relies on both central banks. A more active home
unconventional policy or a less active foreign policy is associated with higher foreign inflation
and output. For welfare, more active home or foreign policy is associated with higher welfare.
The most efficient case happens when both countries’ policies are fully active.

Notes: For all the variables but W and W , we plot the average impulse responses from period 12 to the end
of the ELB to the home country’s negative TFP shock of -0.5% in period 12. To create the ELB environment,
a series of negative preference shocks occurs in both countries in periods 1 - 15, and the total shock size in
each country is 23%. We difference out the effect of preference shocks and only plot the additional effect of
the technological shock. W and W ∗ are the discounted lifetime welfare. X-axis: λ; Y-axis: λ∗ . The color
from light green to dark blue corresponds to high to low values. The units are annualized percentage for
interest rates and inflation, percentage for output and terms of trade, and level for welfare. The 45-degree
lines represent the symmetric case λ = λ∗ . The dashed lines are the 0 contours.

3.3.1       Alternative parameter space

This section assesses the robustness of anomalies discussed in Subsection 3.1 across alterna-
tive parameter values, where we define anomalies when the maximum response of y and τ
are positive at the ELB.6
       Figure 5 illustrates the existence of anomalies when we vary the persistence of the TFP
dynamics ρa , the persistence of the preference shifter ρξ , the inverse of Frisch elasticity of
labor supply φ, elasticity of intertemporal substitution σ, home bias ν, and the length of
preference shocks Tξ , one at a time, and set other parameters as in the baseline calibration.
Gray areas mark that anomalies exist, whereas white areas correspond to the parameter
space where anomalies do not appear.
       The anomalies are not sensitive to structural parameters ρa , φ, σ, ν: they exist as long as
ρa < 0.98. This finding is consistent with the condition 0 < ρa < ρ̄a in Proposition 1 that
guarantees Λa > 0. They always exist for all φ ∈ [0.1, 5], σ ∈ [0.1, 3], and ν ∈ [1, 2].
       Results vary more over parameters related to the preference shock. The gray shades

       Results for an alternative definition, the average response of y or τ being positive, are very similar.

a series of negative preference shocks occurs in both countries in periods 1 - 15, and the total shock size in
each country is 23%. We difference out the effect of preference shocks and only plot the additional effect of
the technological shock. W and W ∗ are the discounted lifetime welfare. X-axis: λ = λ∗ .Y-axis: annualized

correspond to 0.86 ≤ ρξ ≤ 0.9650 or Tξ ≥ 12. Fundamentally, whether anomalies exist
depends on how long the ELB lasts7 , which varies substantially over ρξ and Tξ . When ρξ
is too small or too large or when Tξ is too small, the number of ELB periods is not large
enough to generate anomalies. In the case of ρξ (Tξ ), anomalies are supported if ELB lasts
six (three) quarters or longer.


3.3.2       CPI - based Taylor rule

Our baseline specification of the Taylor rule in (2.24) relies on the PPI inflation. A viable
alternative is to have the central bank respond to the CPI inflation instead:


                                                          ŝt = ρs ŝt−1 + (1 − ρs ) [φπ π̂t + φy xt ] .                                                                   (3.4)

Notes: For all the variables but W and W , we plot the average impulse responses from period 12 to the end

a series of negative preference shocks occurs in both countries in periods 1 - 15, and the total shock size in
each country is 23%. We difference out the effect of preference shocks and only plot the additional effect of
the technological shock. W and W ∗ are the discounted lifetime welfare. X-axis: λ; Y-axis: λ∗ . The color
from light green to dark blue corresponds to high to low values. The units are annualized percentage for
interest rates and inflation, percentage for output, and level for welfare. The 45-degree lines represent the
symmetric case λ = λ∗ . The dashed lines are the 0 contours. The no-trade case is created by ν = 2.


Figure 6 shows how economic quantities vary with λ = λ∗ when the central bank adopts the
alternative Taylor rule. The economies behave similarly to those with the PPI-based rule in
Figure 3. The impulse responses for the domestic economy and the terms of trade are lower
if the monetary policy is implemented based on the CPI inflation for most λ, whereas the
foreign quantities are higher in this case.

Notes: The international financial markets are incomplete. A negative technological shock of -0.5% happens
in the home country in period 12. To create the ELB environment, a series of negative preference shocks
occurs in both countries in periods 1 - 15, and the total shock size in each country is 23%. We difference
out the effect of preference shocks, and only plot the additional effect of the technological shock. The black
dashed line with circles represents the ELB case without trade, the red dashed lines represent the case with
trade, and the blue solid lines represent the case with trade and UMP, which is the same as in normal times.
The shaded area marks periods 9 - 20, for which both countries stay at the ELB with only the preference
shocks and without unconventional monetary policy. X-axis: time in quarters; Y-axis: percentage changes
relative to the steady states.


3.3.3    No-trade case

Figure 7 plots the summary responses to the TFP shock as functions of both λ and λ∗ for
the case with no international trade, which is instrumented by ν = 2. Unlike in Figure 4, the
home economic indicators only move with the home policy indicator λ. The foreign economy
in the second row does not move regardless of monetary policy. Welfare, on the other hand,
still depends on monetary policies of both countries.


3.3.4    Incomplete financial markets

The benchmark model in Section 2 and our analyses thus far assume international financial
markets are complete. This section examines incomplete markets. The contrast between the
red dashed line and blue solid line in the left panel of Figure 8 demonstrates the anomaly
discussed in Subsection 3.1 still exists for output. See details of the model in Appendix D.
    However, whether the financial markets are complete or not does affect trade-related
quantities. When the market is complete, terms of trade decrease normally in response to a
negative home TFP shock. However, they increase in the setting of incomplete financial mar-
kets, which is consistent with what Enders and Müller (2009) find. Moreover, international

trade lowers how much output increases at the ELB, mitigating the anomaly.



4         Empirical evidence on unconventional monetary pol-

          icy

This section empirically investigates unconventional monetary policies at the ELB in the
US, Euro area, and UK, and compares them with their corresponding conventional policies.
First, we test model implications by comparing impulse responses in a VAR between normal
times and the ELB. This exercise allows us to assess whether the anomaly exists in the data.
Next, to quantify unconventional monetary policy, we rely on the Taylor rule to compare
what has been done with what should have been done.


4.1         Vector autoregression

This section analyzes unconventional monetary policy in a VAR framework. We quantify
empirically how output responds to a TFP shock in the US, Euro area, and UK. Then we
compare our empirical results with implications from our theoretical model in Section 3 to
draw conclusions.
        Following Galı́ and Gambetti (2009), we measure TFP with labor productivity. Our
VAR has two variables: the growth rate of labor productivity8 , ∆(yt − nt ), and the log of
per-capita hours, nt . We use a first-order VAR due to the short sample in the quarterly
frequency. We identify TFP shocks through the Cholesky decomposition by ordering labor
productivity first, which assumes a shock to hours has no contemporaneous impact on labor
productivity growth.
        We estimate the VAR for the pre-ELB and ELB samples separately. The two samples
span from 1985Q2 - 2007Q49 and 2009Q1 - 2015Q4 for the US, 1999Q1 - 2011Q3 and 20011Q4
    8
        We use the growth rate for stationarity.

        We end the pre-ELB sample prior to the Great Recession.

- 2017Q4 for the Euro area, 1993Q1 - 2009Q1 and 2009Q2 - 2017Q4 for the UK. The detailed
data sources for the three countries and regions are in Appendix E.
       Figure 9 plots impulse responses of output to a -1% shock to labor productivity growth
for the three countries and regions.10 Blue solid lines represent normal times with medians
in the thick lines, and 90% confidence intervals in the thin lines. Red dashed lines represent
the central tendencies at the ELB. We find that for all three countries and regions, output
decreases with a negative TFP shock regardless of normal times or the ELB. This similarity
result is in contrast to the anomaly presented by the standard New Keynesian model in
Subsection 3.1, and is potential evidence for unconventional monetary policy.
       The left panel is for the US. We find the impulse response at the ELB is initially slightly
lower than normal times, and then the red dashed and blue thick solid lines track each other
closely after five quarters. Moreover, the red dashed line is within the confidence interval in
blue. In the case of the US, we do not find anomaly, and our result is consistent with Garı́n
et al. (forthcoming) and Debortoli et al. (2016).11
       The middle panel is for the Euro area, and the right panel is for the UK. Both of them
show that output decreases less at the ELB than in normal times. The differences between
normal times and the ELB are statistically significant in both cases, with the UK being more

      We find a similar comparison for Japan. Therefore, the anomaly does not exist in Japan either, which
is consistent with Wieland’s (2017) findings. The details of the VAR analysis for Japan are in Appendix F.

pronounced.
       These findings suggest the anomaly does not appear in the data for the three countries
and regions we examined. If unconventional monetary policy were the sole source that drives
the difference between the standard New Keynesian model and what we see in the data, we
would conclude that unconventional monetary policy is as active as usual in the US and is
less active for the Euro area and UK, or λU S ≈ 1 > λEuro > λU K > 0.


4.2       Taylor rule

In Subsection 4.1, the VAR qualitatively sorts the effectiveness of unconventional monetary
policy among the three regions and countries based on our theoretical model. In this section,
we quantify the amount of unconventional monetary policy implemented in each country or
region, and assess whether this amount we observe can explain the difference between the
standard New Keynesian model and what we find in our VAR.
       We quantify unconventional monetary policy by comparing what has been done at the
ELB, measured by the shadow rates of Wu and Xia (2016) and Wu and Xia (2017),12 with
the desired interest rates implied by the historical Taylor rule.
       We estimate the historical Taylor rule,


                               rt = β0 + β1 rt−1 + β2 πHt + β3 xt + εt ,                          (4.1)


which is the empirical version of (2.24), via ordinary least squares, using the pre-ELB sample,
and label the estimates β̃0 , β̃1 , β̃2 , β̃3 . When the ELB is binding, the desired interest rate
implied by the historical Taylor rule can be calculated as follows:


                                 s̃t = β̃0 + β̃1 st−1 + β̃2 πHt + β̃3 xt .                        (4.2)

   Shadow rates are available for the US, the Euro area, and UK, and they can be downloaded from Cynthia
Wu’s website: https://sites.google.com/view/jingcynthiawu/shadow-rates.




                                                    29
   Next, we calculate the activeness of unconventional monetary policy by comparing the
implemented monetary policy at the ELB and the desired interest rate. Specifically, we
regress the observed shadow rate St on the imputed s̃t to get λ̃ per (2.25).
   Now we turn our attention to st−1 in (4.2). We propose two methods below to proxy it.


Simple method The simple method uses the observed shadow rate St−1 as a proxy for
st−1 . Hence, (4.2) becomes


                               s̃t = β̃0 + β̃1 St−1 + β̃2 πHt + β̃3 xt .                    (4.3)


The benefit of the simple method is that the shadow rate is observable to us. Hence, the
calculation is simple and robust.


Iterative method To measure st−1 more accurately in the case of small λ, we leverage
the relationship in (2.25), and replace (4.2) with


                              s̃t = β̃0 + β̃1 St−1 /λ̃ + β̃2 πHt + β̃3 xt .                 (4.4)


Now we face a fixed-point problem: (4.4) relies on λ̃ to compute s̃t , whereas to obtain λ̃,
we regress St on s̃t . We propose an iterative procedure to solve this fixed-point problem.
First, we give an initial guess for λ: λ̃(0) . Then we iterate over the following two steps until
convergence:

                                  (i)
  1. Based on λ̃(i) , compute {s̃t }Tt=1 using (4.4).

                      (i)
  2. Regress St on s̃t and compute λ̃(i+1) .


Empirical results We begin with the US. We measure πHt with the inflation based on
the GDP price deflator, xt is the real GDP minus potential GDP, and rt corresponds to the
effective fed funds rate. The pre-ELB and ELB samples are the same as in Subsection 4.1.


                                                   30
The details of the data are in Appendix E. The estimate of the simple method is 1.02, and
is 1.12 from the iterative method. We conclude that the US unconventional monetary policy
is as active as, if not more active than, the historical Taylor rule.
    The Taylor rule is known to vary over different sample periods, and researchers’ choices
of sample periods in the literature are far from unanimous. We quantify the variation of our
estimates by varying the pre-ELB estimation sample: the beginning of the sample ranges
from t0 ∈ {1982Q1 : 1990Q1} and the end of the sample varies from t1 ∈ {2003Q1 : 2008Q4},
which covers the majority of popular choices. We compute a λ for each combination of t0
and t1 and plot its distribution across all possible combinations in Figure 10. The left panel
plots the distribution for the simple method, and the right panel uses the iterative method.
They both center around 1: the median for the simple method is 1.03, and is 1.19 for the
iterative method. The standard error for the simple method is 0.065, and is 0.45 for the
iterative method. The iterative method displays a larger variation across different sample
periods than the simple method. On the other hand, the results from the simple method
might be biased if λ is far from 1. This is the classic bias-variance tradeoff.

    For the Euro area and UK, quarterly real potential GDP is not available. Hence, we
replace xt in (4.1) with output growth ∆yt , measured by the growth rate of real GDP. The
rt for the Euro area is the 3-month Euro Interbank Offered Rate (Euribor), and it is the
Bank of England policy rate for the UK. The details of the data are in Appendix E. For the
Euro area, t0 ∈ {1998Q2 : 1999Q1} and t1 ∈ {2009Q1 : 2011Q3}. The ELB period is from
t1 + 1 to 2017Q4. The median estimate for the iterative (simple) method is 0.63 (0.985) with
a standard error of 1.07 (0.031). For the UK, t0 ∈ {1993Q1 : 2003Q1}, t1 = 2009Q1, and
the ELB period is from 2009Q2 to 2017Q4. The median from the iterative (simple) method
is 0.39 (0.98), with a standard error of 4.10 (0.10). Note the variations across samples are
larger for the Euro area - especially for the UK - than for the US, partly due to a shorter
sample.
    In summary, all three central banks have implemented a considerable amount of uncon-
ventional monetary policy: the US operates following the historical Taylor rule, the Euro area
and UK’s unconventional monetary policies are less active, or λU S ≈ 1 > λEuro > λU K > 0,
which is consistent with what we find in Subsection 4.1.



5     Conclusion

We have introduced a new open-economy New Keynesian model. Our model provides a
tractable framework that allows for unconventional monetary policy when the ELB is bind-
ing. We find when unconventional monetary policy operates following the historical Taylor
rule, the anomalies in a standard model, namely, that output and terms of trade increase in
response to a negative supply shock, disappear. Our model allows unconventional policy to
be partially active and potentially asymmetric between the two countries. Empirically, we
assess unconventional monetary policy across the US, Euro area, and UK. The VAR analysis
and the Taylor rule together point to the conclusion: The US has operated its unconventional
monetary policy following the historical Taylor rule. Although both the Euro area and UK



                                             32
have also implemented a considerable amount of unconventional policies, they have done less
than what they normally would have.

Combining (2.18) and the labor-supply decision (2.4) results in the real marginal costs:

where K = σ + φ − K1 . The foreign country’s counterpart is

Combining (B.12) and (B.13) with (A.23) and (A.24), the New Keynesian Phillips curves (NKPCs) are

                                    π̂Ht = βEt π̂H,t+1 + ΘK ŷt − Θ(1 + φ)ât + ΘK1 ŷt∗                               (B.14)

The difference is

   Next, we solve the system of equations in (B.11) and (B.16). When λφπ > 1, the Blanchard-Kahn
condition is satisfied, and the system has a unique solution, which is (3.1), (3.2). Next, (B.1) implies (3.3).

    • When λ = 0, the denominator of Λa is a convex quadratic function of ρa with one root between 0 and

First,

given σ > 1. Next, take the derivative of the coefficient in (B.20) with respect to D:

Note φ − σ/D2 is an increasing function of D and hence a decreasing function of ν. Therefore, φ − σ/D2 ≥
φ − σ/D2 |ν=2 = φ − σ > 0, and ∂[−ρa Θ(1+φ)(D+1)Λ

and negative. When ât < 0, ŷt − ŷt∗ ≥ ŷt − ŷt∗ |ν=2 > 0.

Appendix C                    Setup for quantitative analysis
Calibration We calibrate structural parameters according to the standard macro and international
literature. The discount factor is β = 0.99, so the steady-state quarterly risk-free nominal interest rate is
1%. The intertemporal elasticity of substitution is σ = 2, and the inverse of the Frisch elasticity of labor
supply is φ = 3. The elasticity of substitution among differentiated goods is θ = 6, implying the steady-state
price markup is 1.2. The price stickiness parameter is ζ = 0.75, meaning the average time between two price
adjustments is one year. The persistence of the Taylor rule is ρr = 0.8, and the sensitivities of the policy rate
to inflation and output are φπ = 1.5 and φy = 0.5/4. ν = 1.5 implies a significant home bias. The persistence
and standard deviation of the TFP shock are ρa = 0.9 and σa = 0.0025, according to Fernández-Villaverde
et al. (2015). The persistence and standard deviation of the preference shock are ρξ = 0.9 and σξ = 0.023,
according to Christiano et al. (2014).




                                                         42
ELB environment To create an ELB environment, we impose a series of negative preference shocks
on both countries. The shocks occur in periods 1-15, and the total shock size in each country is 23%. These
shocks push down the nominal interest rate to zero at period 9 and keep it there until period 20 when there
is no unconventional monetary policy.

Negative TFP shock In addition to the preference shocks, we hit the home country with a one-time
negative TFP shock with a size of -0.5% at period 12.

Solution method When λ = 1, the model is linear, so we use the standard method for solving the
rational expectations models. When λ < 1, we use the occasional binding method of Guerrieri and Iacoviello
(2015).


Appendix D                  Incomplete asset markets
Following Benigno (2009), there is no longer complete international risk sharing in the model with incomplete
asset markets, where only two nominal non-contingent bonds are traded. Then the international risk sharing
condition (2.16) no longer holds, and the household’s budget constraint (2.2) in the baseline model changes
to:

where BHt+1 is the debt issued in units of risk-free nominal bond denominated in H currency, and the nominal
interest rate on this bond is RtB . BF t+1 is the holding of risk-free nominal bond denominated in units of
foreign currency, and the nominal interest rate on this bond is RtB∗ . The assumption that households of the
home country hold assets denominated in foreign currency and issue debt in the home currency, reflects the
net international position of the US economy. We assume a quadratic transition cost when deviating the
real foreign bond position from a constant real value, denoted by ῑ; ` is nonnegative, measuring this cost in
terms of units of the consumption index, and is rescaled by the factor 1/RtB∗ for analytical convenience. The
quadratic cost serves for the purpose of determining the steady state and getting rid of the indeterminacy
problem. T Rt includes government transfer and the revenues obtained from the transaction costs paid by
households in the foreign country when trading home country bonds, and Dt is the profits from firms.
    The first-order conditions of home country households with respect to domestic and foreign bonds are:

    Utility maximization of households in the foreign country yields the counterparts of equation (D.2) and

Notes: Impulse responses of output to a -1% shock to labor productivity growth. The blue solid lines are
normal times, with thick lines being the median and thin lines representing 90% confidence intervals. The
red dashed line is the median impulse response at the ELB. X-axis: time in quarters; Y-axis: percentage
changes in output.


All series are downloaded from the FRED. Details of the VAR are in Subsection 4.1.
    The results are in Figure F.1. We find the impulse response at the ELB is slightly lower than normal
times, and the red dashed line is always within the confidence interval in blue. This result suggests that neg-
ative supply shocks, such as the Great East Japan earthquake and oil supply shocks, are still contractionary
at the ELB in Japan. We conclude the anomaly does not exist.
