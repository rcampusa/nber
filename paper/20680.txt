                                             ABSTRACT

This study investigates causal effects of changes in subjective probabilities of being pulled over and
involved in accidents if driving while intoxicated on individuals’ drinking and driving choices. We
also examine how hypothetical changes in perceptions of sanction severity affect drunk driving by
experiments randomizing the harshness of punishments. We find that higher perceived risks of being
pulled over and involved in accidents deter drinking and driving. However, deterrence is limited to
persons who are alcohol addicted, lack of self-control over drinking, and are more impulsive. No deterrent
effect of harsher legal punishments is found on individuals’ drunk driving choices.

Introduction

       Driving while intoxicated (DWI) is a serious problem in the United States. DWI caused
more than 10,000 deaths in 2010 (U.S. National Center for Statistics and Analysis, 2012).
Studies have documented that two percent of weekend nighttime drivers on U.S. roads had
illegal blood alcohol concentrations (BACs; Lacey et al., 2009), and more than 110 million
instances of alcohol-impaired driving occur in U.S. annually (Bergen et al., 2011). Legally
intoxicated drivers are 13 times more likely to cause fatal crashes than sober drivers are (Levitt
and Porter, 2001).

       A growing academic literature has analyzed individuals’ risk-taking behaviors using
subjective expectations of adverse consequences. Some contend that risk perceptions are even
better predictors of individuals’ behaviors than the actual outcomes (e.g., Delavande, 2008;
Wang, 2014), and public policies designed to reduce undesirable behaviors will not be effective
unless they can influence risk perceptions (e.g., Nagin, 1998; Lochner, 2007).

       The association between risk perceptions and behaviors has been well documented in a
number of contexts other than drinking and driving. Lochner (2007) found that a higher
perceived risks of arrest lowered criminal participation in theft. Using a random utility model,
Delavande (2008) concluded that subjective probabilities of outcomes of different contraceptive
methods, e.g., getting pregnant or contracting a sexually transmitted disease, have more power
than objective probabilities based on population actual outcomes in predicting individuals’
contraceptive choices. Evidence from bar owners/managers indicated that these persons with
higher perceived risks of being cited or sued if serving obviously intoxicated adults or minors
were more likely to take precautionary measures to avoid services to intoxicated and underage
patrons (Sloan et al., 2000).

       In the context of smoking, Wang (2014) showed that subjective probabilities of survival
probability explain individuals’ smoking decisions, and even exhibit more predictive power than
corresponding objective probabilities. Other studies have concluded that persons with lower
perceived risks of cigarettes’ harmful health consequences were more likely to smoke (e.g.,
Viscusi, 1990; Viscusi, 1991; Carbone, 2005), even though the subjective probabilities were
overestimated.
        However, there are few truly comparable studies relating individuals’ risk perceptions to
decisions in situations where individuals’ decision making capacities are likely to be impaired,
such as the choice to drive after having had too much to drink. Dionne et al. (2007) studied
impacts of the subjective probability of being arrested or involved in an accident when driving
while intoxicated on individuals’ drinking and driving behavior, finding sizable deterrence from
a higher perceived risk. However, the behavior was inferred from individuals’ traffic violation
records or involvement in accidents, both of which are subject to measurement errors since
adverse outcomes only result from a small minority of actual drinking and driving episodes.3
Other studies lack generalizability in relying on specific populations such as college students or
trauma patients (Yao et al., 2013; Ryb et al., 2006).

        This study consists of two parts. In the first part, we investigate causal effects of changes
in subjective probabilities of being pulled over and having accidents when driving under the
influence of alcohol on self-reported drinking and driving behaviors. In the second part, we
examine how hypothetical changes in perceptions of penalty severity following a conviction of
DWI affect the probability of driving after having had too much drink by experiments
randomizing the harshness of punishments.

        We improve upon past research linking risk perceptions to drunk driving in several ways.
First, we use an instrumental variable (IV) approach to deal with the potential endogeneity of
risk perceptions. Individuals’ risk perceptions are instrumented by their subjective probabilities
of the same adverse consequences for themselves and other persons reported in a follow-up
interview.4 We use different strategies to test the validity of our instruments. Second, rather than
focus on a specific population such as college students or trauma patients as earlier studies (e.g.,
Yao et al., 2013; Ryb et al., 2006), our sample comes from a more general adult driver
population in eight cities of varying population sizes and geographically distributed throughout
the U.S.. Third, our analysis allows for irrational as well as rational decision making about
drinking and driving. While in a standard economic model would have the individual weighing
benefits and costs of drinking and driving brought to present value, our data include measures
used in the behavioral economics literature. Fourth, we stratify the sample according to personal

  Arrests for DWI and accident involvement have been estimated to occur in a small proportion of actual drinking
and driving episodes (e.g., Schwartz and Rookey, 2008).

  Using lead value as instruments for endogenous variables has been used in a few other studies, e.g., Dahl and
DellaVigna (2009).
attributes that are associated with heavy drinking and drunk driving. We find that drinking and
driving behavior is only sensitive to risk perceptions of being pulled over and involved in
accidents among persons who are addicted to alcohol, lack self-control over drinking, and are
more impulsive, while drinking and driving behavior of persons who do not exhibit these
attributes is not affected by changes in risk perceptions. We examine channels through which
this pattern arises.

          Fifth, our data allow an assessment of effects of sanction severity of various types of
penalties for a DWI conviction on individuals’ drinking and driving choices. Despite widespread
interest among public officials in escalating punitive threats to reduce driving under the influence
of alcohol, our empirical evidence documents no deterrent effect of sanction severity for DWI in
terms of amount of fine, and length of jail sentence, driver license suspension, use of Secure
Continuous Remote Alcohol Monitoring (SCRAM) device, and mandatory alcohol counseling.
Some earlier studies (e.g., Benson et al., 1999; Sen, 2001; Levitt and Porter, 2001) used objective
changes in severity of legal consequences for DWI, i.e., actual changes in law enforcement and
statutory changes in laws, and found no deterrence of punishment severity on drinking and
driving. However, it is difficult to know whether the non-significant deterrent effects reported in
these studies reflect the fact that drunk drivers are undeterred by harsher penalties either because
the perceived chance of receiving punishments is low or the respondents are irrational, or just
because actual punishment changes have not been translated into subjective beliefs, the argument
being that policies designed to curtail crime are effective only if they can actually influence
beliefs (Nagin, 1998). We infer that lack of deterrence is most likely to reflect a low probability
of actually receiving these penalties.

          This paper proceeds as follows. Section I describes the data. Section II presents the
estimation method. Results are presented and discussed in in Section IV. Section V concludes the
paper.

I. Data

          Our survey, the Survey of Alcohol and Driving (SAD), is a longitudinal survey providing
detailed information on individuals’ risk perception of drinking and driving and individuals’
attributes such as self-control, impulsivity, cognition, risk tolerance, time preference,
involvement in risky behaviors and socio-demographic characteristics. The survey was
conducted by Battelle Memorial Institute in eight geographically dispersed U.S. cities across four
states during 2010-2012. The eight cities were: Raleigh, North Carolina (NC); Hickory, NC;
Seattle, Washington (WA); Yakima, WA; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (PA); Wilkes-Barre, PA;
Milwaukee, Wisconsin (WI); and La Crosse, WI. The states and cities were selected to yield a
broad geographic spread and variety of drinking and driving prevalence, DWI prevention laws
and demographic composition.

        The baseline interview was conducted in late 2010-early 2011 using Computer Assisted
Telephone Interview (CATI), resulting in a sample of 1,634. The follow-up interviews consisted
of two waves of web-based surveys conducted by Computer Assisted Self-Administered
Interview (CASI). The first wave (CASI-I) was administered one to two months after CATI,
consisting of a sample of 1,359 respondents. The second wave (CASI-II) was administered a
year after the CASI-I survey, with a sample of 1,187. The loss of sample is due to attrition.

        Eligible respondents were persons who had driven a car and consumed alcohol in the past
month before the screener interview, were aged 18+, and lived within the geographic boundaries
of one of the eight surveyed cities. The surveys oversampled persons who consumed large
amounts of alcohol and were prone to DWI to study decision-making behaviors of such
individuals in detail.

        We limit our sample to respondents with a positive self-reported probability of drinking
and driving next year in CASI-I (N=694) in this study. The rationale for this is that when the
probability of drinking and driving in the next year was stated by respondents to be zero given
existing penalties, the subjective probability of drinking and driving in response to harsher
punishments in the randomized experiments would also logically be zero, leading to
underestimated deterrent effects of sanction severity. Furthermore, it is the risk perceptions and
behaviors of these potential criminals that are more relevant to policies designed to decrease
drinking and driving and its associated harms, while respondents who think they have zero
probability of drinking and driving in the near future are less likely to actually drink and drive
(Sloan et al., 2013).

Dependent Variables

        The first part of our analysis focuses on the deterrent effects of risk perceptions, i.e.,
subjective probabilities of being pulled over by a police officer and increases in the chance of
being involved in a motor vehicle accident when driving while intoxicated compared to driving
when sober, on the number of times the person actually drinking and driving in the year after the
risk perceptions were elicited. Response categories to drinking and driving frequency in the year
are 0, 1, 2, 3-4, and >4 times. We code 3-4 as 3.5 and >4 as 7. The results are insensitive to the
precise algorithm for recoding the open-ended category.

       The second part analyzes deterrent effects of sanction severity on subjective probabilities
of drinking and driving. The CASI-I and CASI-II survey respondents were asked the percent
chance that they would drink and drive at least once during the following year, first in the “low
experiment,” if the legal penalties, e.g., length of jail sentence, were (1+(X+2)*0.1) times of his
or her baseline beliefs, where X was randomly selected in increments of 1 from interval of 1 to 7,
then in the “high experiment” where punishments were harsher, e.g., (1+(X+2)*0.3) times the
baseline beliefs. Such probabilistic questions are a standard elicitation method (Manski, 2004)
and are now used in a number of large household surveys such as Health and Retirement Study
(Hurd, 2009). Probabilistic expectations have been shown to be good predictors of actual
behaviors in situations in which individuals have considerable private information (Hurd, 2009).
For example, Finkelstein and McGarry (2006) found that the individual’s subjective probability
of nursing home entry is a good predictor of actual entry. Insler (2014) reported that workers’
self-reported probability of working past ages 62 and 65 predict actual retirement well.

       One potential deficiency of subjective probability questions (including the above
questions on drinking and driving probabilities in the next year given different sanction severities
and the questions about risks of being pulled over) is a possibly high frequency of focal
responses, e.g., responses of 0, 50 and 100 percent. However, in our survey, for the perceived
risks of being pulled over after having had too much to drink, fewer than 15 percent respondents
provided these focal values; rather interviewed individuals used the entire range of probabilities
from 0 to 100 percent, although the probabilities were frequently rounded to the nearest 5 percent.
A high frequency of focal responses is more of a problem in responses to questions regarding
subjective probabilities of drinking and driving in the next year under different hypothetical
sanction severities: 20 to 40 percent of respondents gave a response of 0 percent to most
questions, although fewer than five percent gave responses of 50 and 100 percent. Therefore, in
addition to treating subjective probabilities of drinking and driving in the next year as a
continuous variable in the regression, we also categorize them into groups (see details in Section
II.B). The findings are robust to this alternative specification.

Explanatory Variables

       To elicit the individual’s subjective beliefs of being pulled over after having had too
much drink, the CASI-I and CASI-II surveys asked respondents who reported a positive
probability of drinking and driving next year: “On a given occasion, when you drive after you
have had too much drink, what is the percent chance you will be pulled over?” For the risk
perceptions of being pulled over for the other persons, the surveys asked “On an average
weekend evening, what percent of drivers on the road who have had too much to drink will be
pulled over.”

       For the perception of increases in accident risk when driving intoxicated compared to
driving sober, the surveys asked: “If you drank 4 drinks and then go home, what would be the
odds (compared with not having had any alcohol at all) of getting into accident” with responses
choices being: no increase in odds, odds increase 25% or less, odds increase 26-50%, odds
increase 51-100%, and odds increase more than 100%. We used values of 0%, 12.5%, 38%,
75.5%, and 150%, respectively, for each of these response categories.

       We measured addiction to alcohol by the CAGE. The CAGE was based on affirmative
responses to these questions: “Did you more than once want to stop or cut down on your
drinking?” “Have people annoyed you by criticizing your drinking?” “Have you ever felt bad or
guilty about your drinking?” “Have you ever had a drink first thing in the morning to steady your
nerves or get rod or hangover (eye-opener)?” We specify binary variables for 0, 1, 2, and 3-4
affirmative responses to the CAGE questions. We also include binary variables for whether or
not the individual reported ever using licit psychotropic drugs without a prescription or illicit
drugs, currently smoked, and a measure of risk-taking in the driving domain-- being willing to
speed 15 mph over the speed limit in order to not be late for an important meeting with a 10
percent chance of being caught by the police.

       The SAD also included a question about the difficulty the individual experienced in
controlling his or her drinking. The question was: “If you have to drive home from some place
where drinks are being served, do you find it very easy, somewhat easy, somewhat difficult, or
very difficult to limit your drinking?” We specify a binary variable for “somewhat difficult” and
“very difficult” to control drinking as lack of self-control with the omitted reference group being
“very easy” and “somewhat easy.”

         Critics of neoclassical economic decision-making have suggested that rather than involve
a cold cost versus benefit calculation, many decisions are made in an emotionally changed
context. There are likely to be substantial interpersonal differences in the role of emotions in
decision making. Therefore, we include a covariate for impulsivity. We measure impulsivity
from responses to 12 statements on a five-point scale ranging from “strongly agree” to “strongly
disagree”. The 12 statements are: “I rarely make hasty decisions;” “I never seem to be able to get
organized;” “I fly off the handle;” “There are so many little jobs that need to be done that I
sometimes just ignore them all;” “I control my temper;” “I do things on impulse that I later
regret;” “I often worry about things that might go wrong;” “I always consider the consequences
before I take action;” “I am not a worrier;” “I plan for the future;” “I often do things on the spur
of the moment;” “I finish what I start;” and “I act on impulse.”5 The impulsivity index scale
varies from 12 to 60, with higher values indicating greater impulsivity.

         Cognitive ability has been shown to affect decision making in a variety of contexts,
ranging from decisions about portfolio choice (Christelis et al., 2010) to purchases of health
insurance (Fang et al., 2008). The cognition measure used in this study was measured by the
Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS), a brief standardized test of cognitive ability
and used in Health and Retirement Study (HRS), including questions on object naming and
current affair information. The TICS-based cognition scale ranges from 0 to 13, with higher
values indicating better cognitive functioning.

         Our measure of risk tolerance also comes from the HRS. A respondent’s risk tolerance is
measured by responses to questions posing a series of hypothetical gambles over lifetime income.
The SAD elicited respondents’ willingness to accept an equally good job as the current one, but
with equal chance, the new job would double income or cut income by a specific fraction 6. The
questions separated the respondents into four ordered risk tolerance categories. Barsky et al.

  We thank George Loewenstein for providing this set of questions to us. The properties of this impulsivity scale can
be found at Loewenstein et al. (2001).
6
  Although risk tolerance elicited from hypothetical gambles is subject to measurement error, a number of studies
have shown it to be a good predictor of actual risk-taking behaviors, for example, Barsky (1997) on smoking,
drinking and insurance purchase; Fang et al. (2008) on Medigap insurance purchase; Kimball et al. (2008) on
household asset allocation decisions, and Schmidt (2008) on the timing of marriage and childbearing.
(1997) constructed cardinal proxy values for each of these categories (see their Table I). Based
on their study, we used proxy values of 0.15, 0.28, 0.35 and 0.57 for each of the risk tolerance
category with higher values indicating more risk tolerant.

       We use financial planning horizon to proxy individuals’ time preference. The SAD asked,
“In planning your savings and spending, which of the following time periods is most important
to you and your household?” with responses choices: few months; year; few years; 5-10 years;
and longer than 10 years. We use values of 0.5, 1, 2.5, 7.5, and 10 for each of these response
categories to measure the financial planning horizon in years. The explanatory variables also
include demographic characteristics for age, gender, race, marital status, educational years and
household income.

II. Empirical Specification

A. Deterrent Effects of Perceptions of Pull Over and Accidents Risks

1. Baseline Model

       We begin by estimating the following ordinary least squares (OLS) specification:

                                                                              (1)

where i indexes individuals,      is the number of drinking and driving episodes in the year
between the CASI-I and CASI-II surveys;                           and                   represent
subjective probabilities of being pulled over and perceived increases in risk of being involved in
a motor vehicle accident for respondents themselves when drinking and driving, respectively,
reported in the CASI-I survey. X is a set of controls--age, gender, race, marital status, years of
education and household income.

       Ordinary least squares may yield biased estimates of effects of subjective beliefs about
adverse consequences of drinking and driving if subjective beliefs about being pulled over and
increases in the accident probability are associated with unobserved preferences for drinking and
driving. For example, hidden risk preferences tied to drinking and driving decisions may at the
same time affect risk perceptions. The error term    can be decomposed into two components.

                                                                                (2)
where       is unobserved individual heterogeneity, with cov(                                     ,    )    0 and
cov(                       ,    )    0.     is the random error term and uncorrelated with both
                     and                      . Then equation (1) can be written as

                                                                                               (3)

2. Instrumental Variable Approach and Instruments’ Validity

        To deal with potential endogeneity of risk perceptions, we use an IV approach. The IVs
are individuals’ risk perceptions of being pulled over and of increases in probabilities of being
involved in an accident when driving while intoxicated based on questions phrased in the second
person and in the third person elicited in the CASI-II survey.

        Two conditions must be satisfied for our instruments to be valid. First, the instruments
must be correlated with the endogenous variables. Although Bayesian updating makes
individuals incrementally adjust their perceived risks based on new information from personal
experience,7 individuals also base subjective probabilities on their prior beliefs (e.g., Lochner,
2007; Nagin, 2013, in the context of crime). This suggests an association between risk
perceptions reported in the CASI-I and CASI-II surveys. Appendix Table 1 shows that the IVs
are highly correlated with the subjective beliefs from CASI-I, with parameter estimates on CASI-
I subjective probabilities ranging from 0.4 to 0.6 with statistical significance at the one percent
level. Tests for weak instruments show our IVs are sufficiently strong using the rule of thumb for
the first-stage F-statistic of excluded instruments suggested by Staiger and Stock (1997), both
when errors are assumed to be independently and identically distributed (i.i.d., Cragg-Donald
Wald F-statistics, Cragg and Donald, 1993) and when the i.i.d. assumption is dropped
(Kleibergen-Paap rk F-statistic, Kleibergen and Paap, 2006).

        The second condition pertains to the overidentifying restriction, i.e., the IVs should be
uncorrelated with the unobserved determinants of drinking and driving choices. Although risk
perceptions reported in CASI-II survey should not have a direct effect on individuals’ drinking
and driving decisions in the past, there may be an indirect association between these two sets of
variables due to unobserved time-invariant preferences for risky behaviors.


7
 For example, individuals would lower their perceived risks if themselves or others known to them successfully
avoid being pulled over or having an accident when driving under the influence of alcohol, while increase their
subjective risks if fail to avoid such adverse outcomes.
       There are several options for evaluating this possibility; but no single option would be
fully convincing on its own. Therefore, we employ three different options. First, we control for a
set of proxies for a latent preference for risky behaviors--risk tolerance, time preference, alcohol
addiction level, impulsivity, cognitive ability and risky behaviors that may directly capture
unobserved preferences for risks, including smoking cigarettes, using hard drugs, and willingness
to speed to avoid being late for an appointment--to remove the potential correlation between the
instruments and the error term of the drinking and driving equation.

       Second, since we have more instruments than endogenous covariates, we test the
overidentifying restriction with the Sargan-Hansen test. In Table 2 we show that we cannot reject
the null hypothesis that the IVs are uncorrelated with unobserved determinants of drinking and
driving.

       Third, we regress the number of drinking and driving episodes during the year between
the CASI-I and CASI-II surveys on the predicted residuals from the first-stage regressions and
find no significant associations (Appendix Table 2). Taken as a whole these results support an
inference that our IVs are valid.

       Lead or lag values of the endogenous variables have been used as IVs in previous studies.
For example, Dahl and DellaVigna (2009) instrumented for movie attendance using the
following weekend’s attendance to investigate whether violence in movies increases violent
crime. Ham et al. (2013) concluded that the lagged value of eating disorder-bulimia nervosa
(ED-BN) index is a valid instrument for the current value of ED-BN.

B. Deterrent Effects of Sanction Severity on Drinking and Driving

       The second part of our empirical analysis examines the deterrent effects of sanction
severity on drinking and driving choices, using experiments conducted in both the CASI-I and
CASI-II surveys, which elicited individuals’ subjective probability of driving at least once next
year after having had too much drink under situations with different randomized penalty
severities. There is a concern that respondents may mechanically give a lower probability of
drinking and driving when a question on the subjective probability of drinking and driving with
higher sanction severity is asked immediately after the same question but with a lower penalty
severity. To avoid such bias, we select responses from the same individual from the CASI-I
survey for the low experiment and CASI-II survey for the high experiment, and, alternatively,
from the CASI-I high experiment and CASI-II low experiment, and examine how the difference
in sanction severity between low and high experiment explains differences in the individual’s
subjective probability of drinking and driving at least once in the following year. The premise
underlying this approach is that respondents are unlikely to remember their reported subjective
probabilities over a one-year period. The empirical specification is:

                                                                                                           (4)

where DD is the probability of drinking and driving at least once in the following year, I is a
individual respondent fixed effect. j=I or II, k=II or I, representing the CASI-I (I) or CASI-II
survey (II). The dependent variable is the difference in the subjective probabilities of drinking
and driving at least once in the following year in response to the high experiment and to the low
experiment. The key independent variable,                                                        , is the difference
in the multipliers of sanction severity in the high and low experiments, for example,
(1+(Xhigh+2)*0.3)-(1+(Xlow+2)*0.1). This difference excludes subjective probabilities of specific
adverse consequences that may be endogenous to drinking and driving decisions. Yet one
concern on this approach is that individuals’ baseline beliefs of penalty severity may differ
across waves, for example, due to Bayesian updating. However, our data suggest limited source
of Bayesian updating in sanction severity: only 9 of the 1,187 respondents in CASI-II reported
they had been arrested for DWI in the year between CASI-I and CASI-II. Moreover, as shown in
Appendix Table 3, no significant difference in the baseline beliefs of punishment harshness is
detected between the CASI-I and CASI-II surveys, although we do find significant differences across
surveys in perceived risks of being pulled over and involved in motor accidents if driving while
intoxicated.

         To address any remaining concerns about focal responses8 and also as robustness check,
in an additional specification, we categorize the difference in chance of drinking and driving
between the high and low experiments, i.e.,                                            , into five groups: -100 to
-50; -49 to -1; 0, 1 to 49, and 50-100 percent. We use the proxy values of -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2,
respectively, for each of the categories.

III. Results
8
  20 to 40 percent of respondents provide the answer of 0 percent in response to subjective probabilities of driving at
least once after having had too much drink next year in most hypothetical scenarios with different punishment
severity, about 30 percent of persons did not change their subjective probabilities from the low to high experiment.
A. Descriptive Statistics

       Descriptive statistics are presented in Table 1. Columns 1 and 2 show mean values for
respondents who reported a positive probability of having at least one drinking and driving
episode in the next year in the CASI-I survey, i.e., the “restricted sample.” Among these persons,
the mean number of self-reported drinking and driving episodes in the year between CASI-I and
CASI-II survey is 1.9. The mean subjective probability of being pulled over if driving after
having had too much drink is 17.0 percent, over twice the fraction of respondents actually pulled
over by police while driving for any reason. Compared to driving while sober, “driving after
having had too much drink” is believed to increase the motor vehicle accident probability by
43.5 percent on average. The CASI-II survey’s mean subjective probability of being pulled over
and the increase in accident risk when drinking and driving are 18.9 and 41.3 percent,
respectively. The mean subjective probability of being pulled over on other persons is 10.1
percent.

       Within the restricted sample, mean age is 41.7 years; slightly fewer than half of the
respondents are female (46.3%). 44.0 percent of respondents are currently married. Mean
household income is $79,392. Mean educational attainment is 15.7 years. Nearly a third of
persons in the restricted sample (31.1%) answered none of the CAGE questions affirmatively.
17.0 percent of the restricted sample reported ever having used hard drugs, 16.3 percent being
cigarette smokers, 27.4 percent willing to speed 15 mph over the speed limit in order to not be
late for an important meeting with a 0.10 probability of being caught by the police. The vast
majority (86.4%) of respondents reported it was very easy or somewhat easy to limit drinking if
they have to drive home from some place where drinks are being served. 54.4 percent of
respondents have a risk tolerance value of 0.28, which we classify as “medium risk tolerance.”
Such respondents have a mean financial planning horizon of 4.1 years. The mean impulsivity
index is 30.5, about in the middle of the possible values, 12-60. The respondents have mean
cognition index of 12.1, close to the highest possible value, 13.

       Comparing persons in the restricted sample with other respondents, persons in the
restricted sample tend to be younger, more likely to be male, hard drug users and willing to
speed 15 miles per hour over the speed limit, less likely to be black and married, more impulsive,
risk tolerant, and alcohol-addicted, have more difficulty in exercising self-control in their
drinking, and have higher cognitive ability on average.

B. Deterrent Effects of Perceptions of Pull Over and Accidents Risks

       Table 2 shows the deterrent effects of risk perceptions of being pulled over and increases
in accident risks on the number of drinking and driving episodes in one year. Results in the first
three columns are based on OLS, and those in the last column on IVs.

       The regression in column (4) has a lower number of observations than the regression in
column (1) for two reasons. First, the sample size declines due to missing values when we add
more covariates. Second, as we use subjective beliefs of being pulled over and accident risks
from the CASI-II survey as IVs for individuals’ corresponding beliefs in the CASI-I survey, we
lose observations due to sample attrition. In order to avoid the possibility that our results are
driven by the changing samples, we also run all our OLS regressions on the final sample
(N=559)--columns (2) and (3); the latter results are similar to those in column (1).

       Both IV and OLS results indicate that having higher subjective probabilities of being
pulled over and increases in probabilities of being involved in an accident after having had too
much to drink decrease the number of drinking and driving episodes. The IV estimates are more
negative than the corresponding OLS estimates, a result not new in studies using IVs (see e.g.,
Bedard and Dhuey, 2006; Dahl and DellaVigna, 2009; Moretti and Neidell, 2011). Possible
reasons for the lower OLS estimates (in absolute value) include: (a) risk perceptions are
measured with error; and (b) drinking and driving frequency is positively associated with some
unobserved individual attributes, which are also positively associated with perceived risks.

       The IV parameter estimates imply that on average, a one percent increase in the
subjective probability of being pulled over leads to a 0.016 reduction in number of drinking and
driving episodes in one year. A one percentage point perceived increase in the odds of having an
accident when driving intoxicated compared with sober decreases the number of drunk driving
episodes in one year by 0.010. The F-statistics and Hansen J-statistic suggest our instruments are
not weak and satisfy the overidentifying restriction.

       Persons who are more addicted to alcohol, smokers, and hard drug users, and who lack
self-control in drinking are more likely to engage in drinking and driving. By contrast, females
involve less often in drinking and driving. Risk tolerance, impulsivity, and cognition have no
impact on the number of drinking and driving episodes.

        Because of the stigma attached to driving under the influence of alcohol, one might
expect the number of drinking and driving episodes to be underreported. However, although we
cannot exclude this possibility, such under-reporting tendency appears to be limited: respondents
admit to having engaged in a high number of drinking and driving episodes, at an average of one
per person in the year between the CASI-I and CASI-II surveys, although only nine persons were
arrested for DWI during the same year.

        Since the restricted sample is limited to persons reporting a positive probability of at least
one drinking and driving episode next year, we use a Heckman correction procedure to account
for selection into the restricted sample (Appendix Table 4). The results are quite similar to those
reported in Table 2.

        Table 3 shows that only persons who are alcohol-addicted, lack self-control over drinking,
and are more impulsive9 reduce their number of drinking and driving episodes when perceived
risks of being pulled over and having accidents increase. By contrast, non-alcohol addicted, well
self-controlled, and less impulsive persons are not responsive to changes in these subjective
beliefs. An explanation for this pattern relates to differences in costs of being pulled over and
having an accident across groups. As shown in Table 4, persons who are alcohol addicted and
lack of self-control over alcohol consumption report higher subjective probabilities of being
convicted for DWI conditional on being pulled over. Moreover, alcohol-addicted and more
impulsive persons are substantially more likely to report that being arrested for DWI would
almost ruin their lives than their non-addicted and less impulsive counterparts. A plausible
conjecture is that given past encounters with the law, these persons are more sensitive to an
additional arrest for DWI, as criminal penalty severity tends to increase with past criminal
records, for example, punishments for DWI recidivism are harsher than first offenses. However,
few differences are detected for the perceived severity of legal punishments across these groups,
in terms of amount of fine, length of jail sentence, driver license suspension, SCRAM use, and
mandatory alcohol counseling.


9
 A respondent is grouped as more impulsive if his/her impulsivity index value is between 30-60, while less
impulsive if the impulsivity index value ranges from 12 to 30. .
           The non-significant differences in sanction severity among groups are consistent with
estimates in Table 5, which show no deterrent effect of harsher perceived punishments in the
form of amount of fine, and length of jail, license suspension, SCRAM use and alcohol
counseling time on drinking and driving probabilities.

C. Deterrent Effects of Increased Sanction Severity

           In the second part of our empirical analysis, we investigate how sanction severity for
DWI affects subjective probabilities of drinking and driving at least once during the following
year. In Panel A of Table 5, there are no deterrent effects of the severity of sanctions in terms of
amount of fine, and length of sentence, license suspension, SCRAM use and mandatory alcohol
counseling. Panel B categorizes the differences in DWI probability into five groups to deal with
high frequency of focal point responses. Results are similar to estimates in Panel A.

           Non-response to harsher sanction severity may reflect that the severity are not sufficiently
      10
high, but more likely in our survey, the probability of being detected or punished for DWI is
small enough such that the sanction threats generate no marginal effect on deterrence.
According the data from the SAD, the objective probability of a DWI conviction conditional on a
drinking and driving is only 0.006. Probabilities of receiving fine, jail time, license suspension,
SCRAM, and alcohol counseling given a DWI conviction were perceived to be, respectively,
0.88, 0.29, 0.71, 0.34, and 0.76. In general, an arrest on a charge of DWI is relatively unlikely
unless an accident actually happens (Benson, 2000). Drunk drivers are more likely to be escorted
or driven home than arrested by police. The non-response to the severity of these punishments is
unlikely to stem from irrationality or imperfect rationality, as respondents committed fewer DWI
violations in response to higher perceived risks of being pulled over and accidents.

           A possible limitation of our study is that the SAD did not observe respondents in actual
situations when they decide whether to drink and drive, where individuals are likely to be
intoxicated. However, if individuals cannot be deterred by harsher punishments when they are in
“cold” state, it seems implausible that they will be deterred when they are intoxicated, as



10
   Our data suggest this is not a plausible explanation. The mean amount of fine and length of jail sentence, driver
license suspension, SCRAM use and mandatory alcohol counseling time in the CASI-II survey high experiment are
$1,964, 78.4 days, 19.1 months, 38.1 months, and 12.7 months, respectively, and are $1,663, 44.7 days,
18.1months, 17.0 months, and 8.6 months, respectively, in the low experiment in CASI-I survey.
tolerance towards risks tends to increase with higher blood alcohol concentration (Lane et al.,
2004; Burghart et al., 2013).

        To address the concerns about individuals’ ability of predicting their own future behavior,
we examined the predictive power of subjective probability of drinking and driving or over-
speeding 15+ miles per hour at least once in the next year on the actual outcomes. As shown in
Table 6, a 10 percentage point increase in the subjective probability of drinking and driving and
over-speeding at least once next year would raise the actual involvement in these behaviors,
respectively, by 18.7 and 3.8 percent. Thus, consistent with earlier studies (e.g.,; Finkelstein and
McGarry, 2006; Hurd, 2009; Insler, 2014), these results imply that individuals’ subjective
probabilities can indeed predict future actual outcomes.

IV. Conclusion

         We find that risk perceptions of being pulled over and involved in accidents as a
consequence of driving under the influence of alcohol are deterrents of drinking and driving.
However, these deterrent effects are limited to persons who are alcohol addicted, lack self-
control over drinking, and are more impulsive in general. We provide a possible explanation for
this pattern of findings: the groups of individuals who are more responsive to changes in
subjective beliefs face higher costs of incurring the adverse outcomes of drinking and driving.
We find no deterrent effects of sanction severity in terms of amount of fine, and length of jail
sentence, license suspension, SCRAM use and mandatory alcohol counseling on frequency of
drinking and driving. The effectiveness of harsher punishments may be limited by their partial
coverage, i.e., low probability of receiving these sanctions if drinking and driving.

         Although our results suggest deterrent effects of risk perceptions of being pulled over and
being involved in an accident on drinking and driving behaviors, the perceived risks of being
pulled over are substantially higher than their objective counterparts. 11 Therefore, programs
designed to manipulate beliefs of being pulled over would seem to be an inappropriate way for
reducing driving under the influence of alcohol. However, being informed of the actual increase
in risk of having an accident may be a more promising approach. 92.84 percent of respondents
reported an increase in the accident probability of lower than 100 percent when driving

11

adverse health effects of chemicals.
intoxicated compared with driving while sober. Levitt and Porter (2001) concluded that drivers
with alcohol involvement but not necessarily legally drunk pose a risk of seven times greater
than sober drinkers to cause a fatal crash; drivers above the blood-alcohol limit of 0.10 are 13
times more likely to be the cause of fatal crashes. These results suggest that information
campaign may seek to influence drivers’ perceptions of accident risks to reduce DWI
violations.12

         Harsher sanctions to drinking and driving may generate no marginal deterrent effect if
drivers’ perceived risks of receiving the punishments are low. Therefore, rather than escalating
sanction severity, increasing the probability of detection and/or enforcement may be more
effective in reducing drinking and driving.
