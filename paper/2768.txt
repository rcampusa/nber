   UNEXPECTED INFLATION, REAL WAGES, AND EMPLOYMENT DETERMINATION
                         IN UNION CONTRACTS


                                ABSTRACT

    This paper presents new microeconometric evidence on the

relevance of nominal contracting for employment determination in the

unionized sector.   Real wages in long term union contracts contain an

                                                         in prices
unanticipated component that reflects unexpected changes

and the degree of indexation.   These unexpected wage components

provide a convenient tool for separating the causal effects of wages

on employment from other endogenous sources of employment and wage

variation.

    The empirical analysis of employment and wage outcomes among

collective agreements in the Canadian manufacturing sector reveals

that employment and wages are only weakly related.     When unexpected

                                                               the
changes in real wages are used as an instrumental variable for

contract wage, however, employment   is   consistently negatively related

to wages.    The results imply that the institutional structure of wage

determination has important effects on the cyclical characteristics

and persistence of employment changes.

    What role do nominal wage contracts play in the determination of

                                                                  An influential

series of papers by Fisher (1977), Phelps and Taylor (1977), and Taylor
                                                         feature of the
(1980) suggested that fixed wage contracts are a central

link between employment and demand shocks.       More recent models of macro

fluctuations,    however, have downplayed the role of nominal wage rigidities.

Real business cycle models (for example, Kydland and Prescott (1982))

assume that supply and demand in the labor market are equilibrated at

Walrasian levels, and ignore the institutional structure of wage

determination.     Recent business cycle models in the Keynesian tradition,          on

the other hand, have shifted attention from nominal wage rigidities           to real

wage rigidities (e.g. Blanchard and Summers (1986)) or nominal price

rigidities (e.g. Mankiw (1985), Blanchard and Kiyotaki (1987)).

    The shift in interest away from models of nominal wage rigidity can be

attributed to two complementary forces.        On the theoretical side, there are

as yet no convincing explanations for the existence of nominally-fixedwage

contracts.    Many of the contracting models developed over the past decade

predict constant real wages or constant real earnings.1 More generally,

the existence of long-term attachments       in the labor market calls into

question the assumption that employment is allocated on the basis of
                        2          .

                                                                       the
flexibility into the relation between employment and wages lies behind


         concise summary of the implications of these models is presented
by Fischer (1987, pp. 42-50).

              point was made by Barro (1977) in a comment on Fisher's (1977)
paper.     A similar argument is pursued by Hall (1980).

recent literature on efficient wage bargaining (McDonald and Solow (1981),

Brown and Ashenfelter (1986), MaCurdy and Pencavel (1986)).

    On the empirical side, the evidence in support of nominal contracting

models is also weak.    The simplest of these models assume that aggregate

demand shocks generate real wage changes that lead to movements along a

downward-slopingemployment demand schedule.      The weak aggregate

correlation between employment and real wages (Geary and Kennan (1982))

poses a serious threat to this chain of argument.    Even with micro-level

contract data, it has not been easy to establish a systematic negative

correlation between employment and real wages.    In fact, the absence of

such correlations was s major impetus to research on more sophisticated

implicit and/or efficient contracting models.3

    This paper presents new microeconometric evidence on the relevance of

nominal contracting models to employment determination   in the unionized

sector of Canadian manufacturing.    Using s large sample of fixed wage and

escalated contracts,    I find strong support for the implications of a naive

contracting model: unexpected changes in prices over the course of a

contract lead to unanticipated real wage changes that in turn generate

systematic employment responses.    Furthermore, real wage losses or gains in

one contract spill over to subsequent ones.    Thus, unanticipated price

changes generate persistent real wage changes and persistent employment

responses in the union sector.

    In fact, unanticipated real wage changes play a central role in the

empirical   analysis.   A difficulty that arises in any study of employment



     3See for example the papers by Hall and Lilien (1979) and McDonald and
Solow (1981).

and wages is the fact that the two    variables   are Jointly determined in the

labor market.4    With micro-level data the problem is particularly severe:

many components of employment variation that appear as random to an outside

observer are perfectly predictable to the parties involved.       To the extent

that these components also influence wage determination,      they impart a

simultaneity bias to the partial correlation of employment and wages.

Unanticipated real wage changes that occur during the term of fixed-wage or

partially indexed contracts provide a potential solution to this

simultaneity problem.    By construction,    these changes are correlated with

wages but uncorrelated with omitted variables that effect the expected

component   of real wages.   They therefore form an ideal instrumental

variable for a structural analysis of employment demand.

     The empirical analysis confirms the usefulness of this approach.

Controlling for industry demand conditions, employment is only weakly

correlated with the level of contract wages.      When unexpected teal wage

changes are used as an instrumental variable for contract wages, however,

employment is systematicallynegatively related to wages.        These findings

are consistent with a very simple structural model, in which nominal wages

are set in anticipation of future demand conditions,      and employment is

determined ex-post on the demand curve for labor.       While the theoretical

underpinnings of such a naive model are currently lacking, the evidence

suggests that they are a worthwhile topic of further research.




     4Kennan (1988) presents an illuminating analysis of the difficulties
that arise in the interpretationof aggregate employment and wage data when
these data are generated by even simple models of demand and supply.

I. Emolovment   and Wases in a   Sirnole   Model of Lona Term Contracts

a.   Interpreting the Correlation of Employment and Wases

     This section presents a simple model of long term contracting in which

nominal wages are pre-determined,      and employment is set unilaterally by the

firm after aggregate prices and firm-specific demand shocks are observed.

Even in this simple model, the interpretation of the partial correlation of

employment and real wages is clouded by the fact that the contracting

parties may have better information on future demand shocks than is

available   to an outside data analyst.       To develop this point more formally,

suppose that wages are negotiated in some base period (period 0) for a

contract of duration T.     Let n(t) and w(t) denote the logarithms of

employment and real wages in period t of the contract, respectively,        and

assume that hours per worker are fixed.          The notion of   "nominal

contracting" is captured by the assumption that the bargaining parties do

not set w(t) directly:     rather, they establish a series of nominal wage

increases   from the start of the contract, possibly in conjunction with an

indexation formula.5     Let w*(t) represent the parties' expectation of w(t),

conditional   on their information in the negotiating period, and let u(t)

represent   the forecast error w(t)   -
                                           w*(t).   The distribution of u(t) will

obviously   depend on the length of   the contract,    and on whether or not it

contains a cost-of-living escalation clause.6


     5The nature of typical indexation formulas in North American labor
contracts is described in Card (1983). The only case in which the real
wage is set directly by the parties is the case of a contract in which
nominal wages are indexed to the consumer price level with a formula that
increases the wage by one percent for each percent increase in prices.
Such formulas are extremely rare, particularly in the manufacturing sector
of the U.S. and Canada.

     6This point is made by Hendricks and Kahn (1987).

   Assume that n(t) is determined from an employment demand schedule of the

form

  (1)          n(t)    —   a   z(t)    +       $   w(t)     +        e(t),

where z(t) is a vector of observable variables shifting the demand for

labor, $    represents      the elasticity of labor demand ($                      <   0), and e(t) is an

unobservable component of employment variation.                              The precise specification

of z(t) and the corresponding interpretation of $ are discussed in the next

section.       Note that supply considerations are explicitly ignored: there are

assumed to be enough available workers to fill the firm's demand,

irrespective      of wages.          Implicitly then, the contractual wage is assumed to

be high enough to ensure a perfectly elastic supply of workers.

    This simple model is completed by a specification of the determinants

of w*(t).      Assume that the expected real wage rate in period t is

determined at the negotiation date by variables known at that time, say

x(0), and by the parties' expectations                          of z(t) and e(t),       Z*(t) and e*(t),

respectively:

   (2)         w*(t) —     a z*(t)         +       b x(O) + c e*(t).

The realized real wage rate in the                     th       period of the contract is therefore

               w(t)    —   a z*(t)         +       b x(O)       + c e*(t)      +   u(t).

The extent of simultaneity bias in ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates

of the employment determination equation (1) depends on the extent to which

the parties anticipate components of labor demand that are unobservable to

an outside observer or econometrician,                          and on the extent to which these

anticipated components affect the negotiated wage rate.                                 On one hand, if

e*(t) —    0   for all negotiations and all                     t,    then the parties have no

informational         advantage      and there is no simultaneity problem.                    On the other
hand,    if c   —   0, so that   expected real wages are unaffected by higher or

lower expected levels of employment, then again there is no simultaneity

problem.     If the parties are better able to forecast employment than an

outside observer,        however,   and if higher forecasted employment leads to an

increase in negotiated wage rates, then real wage rates will be positively

correlatedwith the econometric error e(t) in the employment equation, and

estimates of the partial correlation between wages and employmentwill be

positively biased.

        Irrespective of the parties' wage setting behavior,        the elasticity fi


may be consistently        estimated by considering the correlation between

unanticivated       wage rates and employment outcomes.      The forecast error u(t)

forms an ideal instrumental variable for w(t):            by definition, it is

correlated with the realization of wages and uncorrelated with information

svailsble       to the psrties at the time of their negotiations.      Additional

instrumental variables may also be available if there are determinants of

negotiated wages which may be legitimately excluded from the employment

determination equation (the variables denoted as x(O) in the wage

determination equation above).           Assuming that the forecast error u(t) is

always an appropriate instrument,          it   is possible to test the exclusion

restrictions        implicit in the use of other candidate instrumental variables

by conventional over-identificationtests.

     Even in the frsmework of this simple model, however, there are two

circumstances        in which the correlation between unexpected real wage changes

and employment levels may not provide useful information on the elasticity

of labor demand.         The first is the case in which the forecast error in real

wages is correlated with unobservable determinants of labor demand.              This
                                        7

may arise, for example, if aggregate price increases signal increases in

demand thet lead directly to increases in employment.     A   simple way to

control for this possibility is to include consumer price increases

directly in the employment equation, and to use variation across contracts

in the degree of wage indexation to separately identify the effects of

unanticipated wage changes and aggregate price changes.

     A second, potentially more serious difficulty may arise if employment

adjustment is costly, and if unexpected changes in real wages during the

term of a contract are immediately offset in subsequent negotiations.         In

this case, one would not expect to observe significant employment responses

to unexpected real wage changes occurring at the end of a contract,      since

these changes are inherently   short-lived.   In the empirical analysis

reported below, I examine this question and find that the negotiated wage

rates in the subsequent contract are positively correlated with the level

of real wages at the end of the previous contract.     Thus, unexpected

                                                     the cost of
changes in real wages generate persistent effects on

contractual labor, and should be expected to generate significant

employment effects if the demand elasticity is nonzero.



1.   Specification of the Employment Demand Function

     This section discusses the specification of the employment demand

function (1) introduced above.     An important limitation of the contract-

based data set used in the empirical analysis is the absence of firm-

specific price or   output data.   Selling prices, intermediate input prices,

and output indexes are available at the three-digit industry level.       Under

certain conditions, these industry-level data may be used as proxies for
                                                          B

the underlying firm-specific variables.                       To derive an interpretation of the

resulting empiricsl specification,                    suppose that output is produced from

three factors:        labor, capital, and intermediate inputs (raw materials                         and

energy).      Ignoring firm-specific constants, assume that the logarithm of

employment in a given firm in a particular industry in period                             t, n(t),    ia

related to the logarithm of firm-specific output, y(t), the logarithm of

firm-specific       wages, w(t),         the logarithm of firm-specific             non-labor input

prices, v(t),        the user cost of capital in period t, r(t), (assumed to be

constant across firms and industries), and an error term q(t):

                               +
          n(t) —                                  (fl1+fl2)r(t) +
                                              -
(3)                 $1w(t)         fl2v(t)                          ay(t) + 1(t).

This equation can be interpreted as either a log-linear approximation                                to an

arbitrary employment demand equation, or alternatively as an exact

employment        demand function arising from an underlying Cobb-Douglas

production function.            The restriction that the elasticities                 of employment

demand with respect to the three factor prices sum to zero is a consequence

of the homogeneity of the cost function.                      This restriction implies that the

equation is invariant to the deflator used to index wages and other factor

prices. The magnitude           of the coefficient a reflects the extent of returns

to scale: the assumption of constant returns to scale, for exsmple, implies

a—l.

       Let   (t)   represent the logarithmof industry level output in period                          t,

and let       (t) and         (t) represent weighted averages of wages and

intermediate input prices in the industry.                      Ignoring constants, assume thst

the    fin's relative share of               overall industry output can be written as

(4)    y(t)   -
                  j'(t)   —
                              1('ti(t)   -
                                              i(t))   +
                                                          2(v(t)
                                                                    -
                                                                        v(t))   + e(t).
                                                           9

This equation can be derived by assuming that firms with identical Cobb-

Douglas production functions act as price takers with respect to firm-

specific selling prices.7 Alternatively, equation (4) can be interpreted

as an approximation to the output share equation arising from a simple

differentiated product oligopoly model.                          In either case, the error

component e(t) represents a combination of firm-specific relative demand

shocks and firm-specific productivity shocks.

      The combination of equations                (3)    and (4) leads to an expression for

firm-specific employment in terms of firm-specific wages, industry level

output and intermediate input prices, the cost of capital, end industry

wages:

        n(t) —                       +              -                    + 1-(t)    -
(5)                                      2(t)            (fi1-4-2)r(t)                  ci-y11(t)
                 (fl1+a71)w(t)
                  + (fl2+c72)(v(t)-(t))                 ÷ aE(t) + i(t).

Under the assumption that increases in                         the marginal   cost of production at

the ith firm lead to decreases                   in its relative share of industry output,

the coefficients                                                         the elasticity of
                        l     and        are negative.           Thus,

employment with respect to firm-specific wages, holding constant industry

output, is larger in absolute value than the elasticity holding constant

firm-specific        output.        In fact, under         the    assumption of price taking



        7Specifically,        the
                        bb-Douglas                        assumptions implies that the output
supply equation of the i  firm can be written as

          y(t)   —             +             +                                     ÷ 9(t),
                     71w(t)         12v(t)       -y3r(t)       -(-y1+-y2+3)q(t)

where q(t) is the selling price for the output of the firm and 9(t)
represents a total factor productivity shock. Define industry output as a
geometric weighted average of the outputs of the individual firms in the
industry.  Then aggregate output follows a similar equation, and equation
(4) can be derived directly, with


          €(t) —     8(t)-9(t)       -
                                         (1+-y2+y3)(q(t)-q(t).
                                            10

behavior,    the implied elasticity is an estimate of the unconditional

elasticity of employment with respect to wages, allowing for the effect of

changes in wages on the output supply decision of the firm.               On the other

hand, the predicted elasticity of employment with respect to industry wages

is positive.     This reflects the assumption that as wages increase in the

industry as a whole, holding constant firm-specific wages, the firm's share

of industry output will rise.

    Oespite the fact that industry-level output and intermediate input

prices are imperfect measures of        the corresponding     firm-specific   data,

equation (5) suggests that the estimated coefficients of these variables

are unbiased estimates      of the underlying elasticities of employment with

respect to output and intermediate        input prices.      The reasoning behind this

result is that the measurement errors that arise from using industry-level

data in place of firm-specific data are uncorrelated with the levels of the

industry variables.      For example,    deviations of firm-specific      output from

industry-level    output depend on firm-specific demand and cost shocks.

These shocks are in principle uncorrelatedwith the industry-averagelevel

of output.     Thus,   the implied regression coefficient of firm-specific

output on industry-level output in equation          (4)   is unity.   It follows

directly that the regression coefficient of firm-specific              employment on

industry output in equation      (5)   is the output elasticity a.

    The specification of equation        (5) leads   to a direct interpretation of

the error component in employment demand e(t) introduced in the previous

section.     According to (5), the stochastic component of employment demand

consists of 3 terms: one term reflecting the deviation of firm-specific

from industry-averageintermediate input prices; one term reflecting the
                                           11

combination of relative demand shocks and relative productivity shocks in

the output share equation (4); and a third term reflecting firm-specific

employment productivity shocks.        (The second and third terms therefore

share firm-specific    productivity shocks).      It seems quite likely that a

significant    fraction of this econometric error is predictable to the

parties involved in the contract.        The potential for simultaneity bias in

the estimated    elasticity of employment demand is therefore accentuated by

the lack of firm-specific       output and price data.



c.   Allowing for the Presence of Efficient Contracting

     The specification of equation (3) reflects the assumption that intra-

contract employment levels are determined by the firm, taking the wage rate

as given.     Except under very special circumstances, however, unilateral

employment determination by the firm does not generate an optimal
allocation of employmentbetween contractual and extra-contractual

opportunities.8     For this reason, the empirical relevance of simple nominal

contracting models has been sharply questioned         (see Sarro (1977) for

example).     The optimal determination of contractual employment is formally

addressed in the implicit contracting literature (see the survey by Rosen

(1985)) and, under somewhat different       guise, in the more recent efficient

contracting literature.9        The basic point of both literatures   is that a

jointly optimal employment contract       (i.e.   one that maximizes profit subject


       8As noted by Hall and Lilien (1979), these circumstances are
essentially   that the wage rate equals the marginal product on extra-
contrsctual    opportunities.

     9See McDonald and Solow (1981) for a theoretical statement and Brown
and Ashenfelter (1986) for a concise summary of the empirical implications
of simple efficient contracting models.
                                            12

to a utility constraint for workers) will determine employment on the basis

of a shadow wage that differs from the contractual wage.        The very simplest

contractual modal with homogeneous workers and unrestricted transfer

payments between employed and unemployed workers implies that the

appropriate    shadow wage is simply the marginal productivity of workers in

their best alternative job.       Brown and Ashenfelter   (1986) refer to this as

the "strong form" efficient contracting hypothesisJ°

    In view of the ad hoc nature of simple contracting models with

unilateral    employment determination, it is important to verify that the

assumptions underlying such a model are valid.        Any test against the

alternative hypothesis of efficient contracting, however,       requires a

specification   of the appropriate shadow wage for the allocation of

employment.     A   simple hypothesis   is that the shadow wage is a weighted

average of the observed contract wage and some measured alternative wage.

This hypothesis     can be motivated formally by assuming that employees'

preferences are represented by a Cobb-Douglas utility function defined over

employment and the difference between the contractual wage and the

alternative   waga)1       Alternatively,   it can be viewed as a convenient

statistical    framework for nesting the alternatives of the unilateral

employment determinationmodel imbedded in equation (3) and the strong form

efficient    contracting model.    It is important to keep in mind, however,

that this simple procedure cannot provide a definitive test of efficient

versus "inefficient" contracting, since some specifications       of an efficient

market data on negotiating firms.

contracting model    imply that    the shadow wage is simply a constant fraction

of the contract wage,'2 and in any case the appropriate definition of the

alternative wage is open to interpretation.            Nevertheless,     it can provide

useful evidence for or against a specification such as            (3),   when the

alternative    is an empirically    testable version of the efficient contracting


hypothesis.



II. Data DescriDtion and Measurement       Framework

    The empirical    analysis of employment and wages in this paper is based

on a sample of 1293 contracts negotiated by 280 firm and union bargaining

pairs in the Canadian manufacturing       sector.13      The available information

for each contract includes its starting (or effective)            date, its ending (or

expiration)     date, and the base wage rate in each month of the contract.14

Unfortunately,     the number of employees covered by the agreement           is only

available     at renegotiation dates.    I associate this level of employment

with the expiring agreement.        Thus, each sample point consists of an end-

of-contract     employment observation and      a   series of wages, including the

beginning-of-contractand end-of-contract wage rates.              To this set of



     12See MaCurdy and Pencavel       (1986, page Sl3).

     13chistofides and Oswald's (1987) analysis is based on a sample
derived from the same source.  A complete description of the sample and its
derivation is presented in the Data Appendix.

     14The base wage rate is typically the wage paid to the lowest-skill
                                                       In some contracts,
group covered by the collective bargaining agreement.
the base rate refers to the rate for a more highly skilled occupation group
(such as assemblers in the automobile industry). An important assumption
for the analysis in this paper is that variation over time in intra-
contract wage differentials is small enough to be safely ignored.
                                        14

contract observations    I have merged a variety of aggregate,      industry-

specific, and regional data.

    Some summary characteristics    of the data set are presented in Table       1.


The sample spans a 16 year period between 1968 and 1983, with a fairly even

distribution of contracta over years after 1970.       The average duration of

the contracts   is 26 months, although durations vary somewhat by year, with

relatively short contracts in the mid-1970's.       The fraction of contracts

with escalation clauses shows a steadily increasing trend until the mid-

1970's and then varies erratically, with an overall average of 33 percent.

Some indication of the trends in employment and wages in the sample is
                                                                    15
provided by the indexes in columns    (4) and (5)   of the table.        Real wages

among expiring contracts show significant growth until 1977, then remain

relatively constant.    Average employment shows no secular trend, but

reflects cyclical downturns    in 1971, 1975, and 1983.

    The available employment measure is a crude one.       Nevertheless,

contract-to-contract    changes in employment are significantly correlated

with industry-level changes in real output over the same period (the simple

correlation coefficient over 1293 observations is .18).       This correlation

suggests that at least a fraction of the rather large variation in

contract-to-contractemployment changes consists of signal, rather than

noise.

    The empirical strategy in this paper is to fit employment equations

based on equation (5) to end-of-contract observations on employment and



     15The wage and employment indexes represent year-effects from
regression equations for contract-to-contract changes in end-of-contract
wages and employment. These indexes therefore control for the composition
of the set of expiring contracts in each year.
                                                    15


wages for each contract.           Assuming that the employment demand function             is


homogeneous    of degree zero in factor pricea, the empirical analyais is

invariant to the choice of deflators             for wagea and intermediate input

prices.     As the discussion in Section Ia suggests, however, it is

particularly convenient to work with wages in real terms, deflated by the

consumer price index.         In the remainder of the paper, wages and industry

prices are therefore expressed in real terms.

    The real wage rate at the end of each contract (including any

contingent payments generated by a cost-of-living                   escalator)   is measured


directlyJ6      As pointed out in the previous section, this rate will

generally differ from its expectation as of the negotiation date of the

contract by a component that depends on the indexation provisions of the

contract and the deviation between actual and expected prices at the end of

the contract.        Let w*(T) represent the expected value of the logarithm of

the real wage at the end of the contract.                In a nonindexed contract,      the

logarithm    of the actual real wage rate at the end of the contract, w(T), is

related to w*(T) by

     (6)      w(T)     —   w*(T)    -
                                        (p(T)   -
                                                    p*(T)),
where p(T) represents the logarithm of the consumer price index at the end

of the contract, and p*(T) represents                the parties'    expectation of p(T),

formed T months ago during negotiations over the current contract.

   In an indexed contract, unexpected changes in prices generate unexpected

changes in real wage rates          if and only if the degree of indexation is

incomplete.     For example, if an escalation clause increases nominal wages


     16The wage data used in this paper has been carefully checked for
changes in base rate definitions and misreporting of cost-of-living
payments.  See the Data Appendix.
                                                    16

by e percent for each one-percent increase in the consumer price index,

then w(T) and w*(T) are related by

    (7)    w(T)      — w*(T)      -
                                          (l-e)(p(T)     -
                                                             p*(T)).
Most escalated contracts         in North American labor agreements do not specify

a fixed elasticity of indexation)7 Instead, they specify a fixed absolute

wage increase per absolute point increase in consumer prices.                Some

agreements also specify a minimum price increase that must occur before

indexation begins, and/or a maximum wage increase that can be generated by

the escalation clause.          In such contracts, the elasticity of indexation

varies over the term of the contract, and may be zero for some range of

price increases.      Nevertheless,          equation (7) is approximately   correct for

an interval of prices around p*(T), where e is defined as the marginal

elasticity of indexation evaluated at the expected level of prices at the
end of the contract.

    Given an estimate of the elasticity of indexation, &,               and an estimate

of the parties' expected price level at the end of the contract, (T), it

is possible to decompose the actual real wage rate at the end of a contract

into an estimate of its expected component, 4(T), and an estimate of its

unexpected component:

          ü(T)   —   w(T)   -
                                 4(T),
where

          4(T)   —   w(T)   -
                                 (1   -
                                          a)(p(T)   -

                                                         p*(T))   +   (1   -

                                                                                              p*(T)).
This estimate differs from the true value u(T) by two terms:                            one of whith

depends on the differente between the actual and measured elasticity of

indexation (and is therefore identically zero in a non-indexed contract);

the other of which depends on the difference between measured price

expectations and the parties' true expectations.                      Provided that these terms

are orthogonal to any factors that might otherwise                     induce a correlation

between employment and real wages, however, the estimated forecast error

11(T)   may be used as a legitimate instrumental variable for the level of

wages at the end of the contract.

        In this paper   I   use a naive forecasting model to form estimates                     of the

expected price level at the end of the contract, based on the average rate

of inflation over the 12 months prior to the negotiation date.18                              I have

experimented with other forecasting equations, including one that uses

estimated     coefficients based on the 10 most recent years of data prior to

the contract negotiation,             and found little difference between them.

Column 6 of Table 1 reports average forecasting errors in the end-of-

contract price level.             The average forecast error is 1.2 percent,                  but

varies considerably by year, ranging from 7.0 percent for contracts

expiring in 1974 and 1975, to -4.5 percent for contracts expiring in 1971.

        The other ingredient in the calculation of unexpected real wage changes

is the elasticity of indexation               e.     In the absence of precise information

on the actual indexation formulas in the sample, I use the ratio of total


     18The forecasting equation predicts the one-year ahead inflation rate
at the negotiation date t as .0144 + .7858 DP(t-12), where DP(t-l2) is the
actual percentage change in prices over the preceding 12 months. The two
and three-year ahead inflation rate forecasts generated by this equation
are .021 + .693 DP(t-12), and .026 + .6135 DP(t-12), respectively.
                                            18

escalated increases over the life of the contract to the total increase in

consumer prices over the life of      the   contract as an estimate of e.       This

measure is reasonably accurate for contracts with no restrictions on the

escalation formula.       For contracts   that restrict the escalation clause by

specifying a minimum price increase before the start of indexation, or a

delay in the start of indexation until the second or third year of the

contract,    or a maximum allowable escalated increase, this measure

introduces    some noise into the calculation of 11(T).

    As the formulas in equations      (6)   and (7) imply, forecasting errors in

end-of-contract    real wage rates are strongly negatively correlated with

forecast errors in prices.       The annual averages of the forecast errors in

real wages in column 7 of Table 1 are close to mirror images of the

associated price forecasting errors.        The forecasting errors in real wages

are dampened,    however, by the indexation provisions of the escalated

contracts.     The average estimated elasticity of indexation among indexed

contracts    is .50, implying that the forecast errors in real wages among

these contracts are about one-half as large as the corresponding             forecast
                    19
errors in prices.

        Interestingly,   the average forecast error in end-of-contract        real

wages    is strongly negatively correlated with the employment index in column

(5) (the correlation coefficient      over 16 annual observations   is   -
                                                                             .54;    the

implied regression coefficient of employment on unanticipated        real wage

changes is -.70, with a standard error of .27).        This provides some


     19The forecast error in end-of-contract real wages is -(l-e)p, where p
is the forecast error in end-of-contract prices, and e is the elasticity of
indexation.  The average forecast error in real wages is therefore
-(l-e)p + covarisnce(e,p), where e is the average elasticity of indexation
and p is the average forecast error in prices.

evidence that contractual employment outcomes are negatively related to

unexpected changes in real wages. By comparison, employment is poaltively

correlated with the level of real wages as measured by the index in column

(4).

       Contract-specific     correlations between employment and wages are

reported in Table    2.     The data are measured as first differences over

consecutive    contracts    for the same sample of negotiations   used in Table 1.

Also presented in the table are correlations of contract-specific

employment and wage outcomes with two meaaures of outside wages: the
                                                       measured in the
average real wage rate in the same (2-digit) industry,

expiration month of the contract; and the average real wage for unskilled

non-production laborers in the same province, measured in the expiration

year of the contract2°

       The simple correlations in Table 2 reveal several important features of

the contract-level data.        First, changes in employment are only weakly

negatively correlated with changes in end-of-contract real wage rates.

Second, the correlations between employment and outside wages are of

similar magnitude to the correlations        between employment   and contract


wages.     Third, changes in employment are more strongly negatively

correlated with changes in the unexpected component of real wages.           Thus,

                                             the corresponding instrumental

error of    .18.   As will be seen below, this pattern continues to hold when

other covariates are added to the employment determination               equation.




III. The Effect of Previous Wage Rates on Subsequent Wage Determination

   As a preliminary step in the analysis of employment determination,                 this

section presents a brief summary of estimated wage determination equations

for the ssmple of collective bargaining contracts introduced above.                  The

main purpose of this analysis is to identify the effect that the level of

reel wages at the end of the preceding contract exerts on subsequent wage

determination.      A finding of significant spillover effects between

contracts    implies that unexpected changes in real wages have persistent

effects on the costs of contractual labor.         A finding of insignificant

spillover effects, on the other hand, implies that these changes are short-

lived.   The degree of persistence in unexpected wage changes, in turn, is

important    for assessing   the magnitude of the effect that these changes will

exert on employment determination.

    The analysis is based on two alternative measures of negotiated wages:

the real wage at the start of the contract; and the expected average real

wage over the term of the entire contract.         In the presence of adjustment

costs, the wage at the start of the next contract is particularly relevant

for employment setting behavior in the last few months of an existing

agreement.     By comparison, the expected average real wage over the next

contract gives a longer-term measure of the costs of contractual

employment.

    Estimation results for the first-differenced wage determination

equation     (9)   are reported in Table 3.     The first 4 columns of the table

report estimates using the real wage at the start of the contract as the

measure of wage outcomes, while the next 4 columns report estimates using

the first difference of the expected average real wage rate over the life

of the contract as the dependent variable.22              The components of           include
                                                                               xii
the regional unemployment rate (measured in the effective month of the

contract),     the real wage rate in aggregate manufacturing         (measured in the

effective    month of the contract), the province-specificreal wage rate for

unskilled workers (measured in the effective year of the contract), and a

set of unrestricted year effects for the effective             date of the contract.

The addition of these year effects results in a significant improvement in

the fit of the wage equations,       although it does not alter the inferences

concerning the effect of previous wages. I have also estimated wage

equations    that include industry-level output and price variables.                 These

variables    are only weakly related to negotiated wages, however,             and their

inclusion leads to very similar estimates for the other variables.

   Columns (1) and (5) of Table 3 report OLS estimates             of equation       (9)   for

the two alternative       dependent variables, while columns       (2)   and   (6)   report

instrumental variables       (IV) estimates.        These various specifications all



     22The expected average real wage in each month in the contract is
estimated by formulas analogous to equations (6) and (7), using estimates
of the expected price level in that month and estimates of the elasticity
of indexation as described above. The expected average real wage is an
unweighted average of expected monthly rates sampled at 6-month intervals
throughout the contract period, starting in the first month of the contract.
                                           23

suggest that negotiated wagea are significantlypoaitively related to the

level of wages at the end of the preceding contract.           The OLS estimates    of

the coefficient A (in row 6.) differ somewhat for the two alternative

measures of the dependent variable, although the IV estimates are closer

together.     The last row of the table reports overidentificationtest

statistics for the instrumental variables        estimators.       There is no evidence

against the exclusion restrictions       implicit in the IV procedure for the

specification    in column   (2).   The test statistic for the specification in

column (6), on the other hand, presents mild evidence against these

restrictions.

    In columns    (3)   and (7) the change in prices over the preceding contract

is introduced directly into the wage determination equation.             This addition

permits a test of the hypothesis that aggregate price increases            effect

future wage determination only to the extent that they affect the level of

real wages at the end of the preceding contract.         The estimated

coefficients in row 8. of the table provide no evidence against this

hypothesis.     Finally,   the specifications   in columns   (4)   and (8) relax the

assumption that the expected and unexpected components of the

end-of-contractwage                 have the same effect on subsequent wages.23
                           w(T)11
Perhaps surprisingly,      there is no evidence against the restricted

specification:    the t-statistics for the hypothesis of equal coefficients

for the expected and unexpected components are 1.32 in column (4), and 1.22

in column (8).


     23These equations are estimated using the change in prices over the
previous contract, the manufacturing wage at the effective date of the
previous contract, and year effects for the effective date of the previous
contract as instrumental variables for the expected and unexpected
components of real wages at the end of the previous contract.

    In summary,       these    results suggest thst unexpected changes in wages have

I)LThe Determinants of           Contractual       Employment

    This section turns to eatimates of the contractual employment

determination equation (5).              The framework for the empirical analysis is a

components-of-variancemodel for the logarithm of end-of-contract

employment in the ith contract of the                th   firm
                                                                  (n):

            nij                                     w(T)i
In this equation,              represents       a permanent   firm-specific    effect,
                                                                                         zij

                  wij(T)
contract,   and            is a contract-specific         disturbance.   Assuming that
                  cii
industry output and prices are used as proxies for firm-specific                     output and

price data, the elasticity fi            of     equation (10) is related to the underlying

parameters of the employment demand schedule (3) and the relative output

equation (4) by       fi

       Again, a convenient method for handling the pair-specific                        effects is to

take first-differences        across consecutive contracts, yielding

In many previous studies,          employment outcomes have been found to follow a

partial adjustment equation of the form                    —   (l   -
                                                                           n*ij
                                                                                   ÷
                                                                                        '-l
                                                                                               where

        represents the optimal level of employment in the absence of
n*ij

adjustment costs, as given by an equation such as (5).                       Partial adjustment

is readily accommodated within the framework of equation (11) by the

addition of a lagged dependent variable.                In the present context, however,

the interval of observation on employment               outcomes is typically 24-36

months.       Thus, the extent of incomplete adjustment                 is likely to be much

smaller than that observed in quarterly or annual data.                       This issue is

addressed more thoroughly below.

       Estimation results for the first-differenced employment equation are

presented in Tables 6 and          5.   Following     the discussion in section Ib, the

determinants of employment include the 3-digit industry input price

(deflated by the consumer price index), industry-level                      real output, and the

end-of-contract      real wage rate.         Measures of the industry-level real wage

rate as well as a regional measure of workers' alternative wage rate are

included in the regressions in Table             5.   In addition, a lagged dependent

variable is included several of the specifications                      in Table   5.    I have not

made any attempt to directly measure the user cost of capital.                           Assuming

that capital costs are constant across manufacturing                      industries, however,

variation in the user cost of capital is absorbed by the trends and/or time

effects in the empirical specification.
                                            26

      In order to capture partial adjustment phenomena,      and also to control

in part for the fact that industry output is measured annually,           the


employment equations in Tables 4 and 5 include industry output in both the

expirationyear of the agreement and the previous year.           I have


experimentedwith specifications      that also include wage rates and input

prices in the year prior to the expiration date, but the effects of these

variables are always poorly determined and small in magnitude.

      The first two columns of Table 4 present OLS estimatea of the

employment equation with and without year effects for the expiration year

of the contract.      Employment is positively related to intermediate input

prices and positively related to both current and last year's level of

output.    The estimate of the elasticity of employment with respect to

output (the sum of the coefficients of the current and previous years'

output)    is substantially   less than unity, implying increasing returns to

scale in the framework      of equation   (3).   The addition of year effects

results in only a relatively small improvement in the fit of the employment

equations:    the probability value of an exclusion test for the year effects

is reported in row 8. of the table.        The addition of the year effects,

however,   substantially reduces the estimated effect of wages on employment.

Controlling    for year effects, employment      is virtually uncorrelated with

contract wages.

      The point estimates of the elasticity of employment demand are

significantly    larger (in absolute value) when the end-of-contract        wage rate

is instrumentedby the unanticipated change in real wages over the term of

the contract.       The results of this exercise are reported in columns        (3) and

(4)   of Table 4.    Without year effects, the estimated elasticity rises from
                                                             27

-   .15 to   -
                 .28, although the estimated standard error                 rises proportionately.

With year effects, the change in the point estimate is even more

remarkable:        from   -   .02   to   -   .45.       A Hausman test of the difference between

the OLS and IV estimates                 is not significant at conventional         levels,

however, mainly as a consequence                         of the imprecision of the IV estimator

when year effects are included in the employment equation.24

       The IV estimators in columns (5) and (6) attempt to address this

imprecisionby expanding the list of instrumental variables for the end-of-

contract real wage rate to include year effects for the signing date of the

contract and the aggregate real wage in manufacturing in the starting month

of the contract.           The addition of the extra instruments increases the

magnitude of the point estimates of the elasticity of demand slightly, and

results in some improvement                    in the precision of the estimates.       The

overidentificationtests for the consistency of the instrument sets are

well below conventional significance levels: the probabilityvalues of

these teats are reported in row 9. of the table.                          Even with the addition of

these extra instrumental variables,                        however,   the estimated elasticity of

labor demand from the equation with year effects is only marginally

significant.         Nevertheless,            a Hausman test of the difference between the

estimated        demand elasticities in columns 1 and 5 is significant at the 1

percent level, while a test of the difference between the estimated

elasticities        in columns 2 and                6   is significant at the 10 percent level.




         simple Hausman test procedure cannot be applied to the estimates
in Table 4 because the OLS estimates are not fully efficient under the null
hypothesis of no simultaneity bias, given the serial correlation and
heteroskedasticityof the residuals.
                                           28

These findings suggest that the OLS estimates of the elasticity of

employment demand are significantly positivelybiased.

   The final columns of Table 4 present estimated employment equations that

include the change in aggregate    consumer prices over the term of the

contract as an additional explanatory variable.             These equations    are

included as a check that the IV estimates are not biased by a direct

correlation between inflation rates and employment growth rates.

Controlling for end-of-contract    real wage rates, there ia no evidence of

such a correlation.   The contract data are therefore            consistent with a

simple structural model in which aggregate price changes lead to real wage

changes that lead to employment changes.

    The effects of outside wage rates on contractual             employment

determination are addressed in Table 5.          The analysis     in section I

identified two alternative routes for this effect.             First, average wages in

the industry are expected to have a nositive effect on employment, as a

consequence of the fact that output is measured at the industry rather than

the firm level.   Second, wages representing            the alternative wage available

to employees are expected to have a negative effect on employment, if

employment is influenced by efficient contracting considerations.                 In an

effort to distinguish between these hypotheses, I have included the

industry wage in columns   (1)   and (3) of the table, and a province-specific

                                                      and (4) of the table.     Both wage
wage for unskilled laborers in columns          (2)


measures are included in column     (5).

    The OLS estimates in columns (1) and          (2)    show no evidence of a role for

either outside wage measure.      When the contract wage is instrumented,

however, the point estimate of the effect of industry-specific                wages riaea
                                                       29

substantially while the estimated effect of the regional wage measure

remains close to zero.                   A similar pattern emerges in column           (5)   when both

outside wage measures are included.                   Given the imprecision of the estimated

elasticities,             it   is difficult    to draw strong conclusions from these

results.           However,      the point estimates lend much stronger support to the

view that outside wages belong in the employment equation as a proxy for

the level of competitor's                  relative costs than to the view that outside

wages belong in the employment equation as a proxy for the shadow value of

employees'             time.   If the former view is taken literally, the point

estimates in column               (3)    suggest that the output-constant           elasticity of

employment demand with respect to wages is                      -
                                                                    .33, while    the elasticity   of

output supply with respect to an increase in wages is                         -   .70.25 The implied

estimate of the output-constant                  demand elasticity is consistent with the

-   .2   to   -   .4 range of estimates generally obtained in the literature on

static employment demand (see Hamermesh (1986, pp. 451-454).

         The question of whether these estimated employment equations are robust

to the inclusion               of lagged employment is explored in the last two columns

of Table          5.     Since the employment equations             are estimated    in first

differences,             and the correlation of consecutive first differences                 of the

change in employment is biased downward by any measurement error in

employment,            the lagged value of industry output is added to the list of

instrumental variables                  and lagged employment and real wages at the end of

the contract are treated as jointly endogenous.       The results show no

evidence of a direct role for lagged employment, once industry output,

input prices, and contract wages are included in the employment equation.

As mentioned earlier, this is perhaps unsurprising,      since the time lag

between consecutive observations     in this contract-baseddata set is on the

order of 2-3 years.      Over such an interval, the effects of partial

adjustment are likely to be smaller than over an interval of a quarter or
     26
year.

    The empirical results in Tables 4 and 5 lead to two main conclusions.

First, there is consistent     evidence that contractual employment outcomes

are negatively related to contractual wage rates.       Although the raw

correlationbetween end-of-contract      employment   and wages is small and

statistically insignificant, this is apparently a consequence of

simultaneity bias.      When unanticipated real wage changes and/or other

exogenous   variables   are used as instrumental variables for the end-of-

contract wage, the estimated employment elasticities are consistently

negative and stable in magnitude across alternative specifications.

Second, there is no evidence that contractual employment is related to

outside wage rates in a manner consistent with simple models of efficient

contracting.    While employment is uncorrelated with region-specific       wage

measures,   however,    it is weakly positively correlated with industry average

wages.    This positive correlation is consistentwith the hypothesis that




     261n principle, the coefficient of the lagged dependent variable will
differ, depending on the duration of the previous contract.  In view of the
imprecision of the estimated effects in columns (7) and (8) of Table 5,
however, I have not attempted to address this issue.
                                      31

higher average industry wages lead to improvements in the firm's

competitive position and increases in employment.27



Conclusions

    This paper studies the nature of employment determination   in long-term

union contracts.   A key aspect of these contracts, much emphasized in the

macroeconomics literature, is the fact that nominal wages are partly or

wholly pre-determined.   Real wage rates at the end of a contract therefore

contain unanticipated components that reflect unexpected changes in

consumer prices over the life of the contract and the degree of indexation

in the contract.   These unanticipated real wage changes provide a

convenient tool for separating the causal effect of wages on employment

determination from other ertdogenous sources of employment and wage

variation.

    The empirical analysis is based on a large panel of collective

bargaining agreements from Canadian manufacturing.    In this sample,

contract-to-contractchanges in employment are only weakly related to

corresponding changes in contractual wages.   When unexpected changes in

real wages are used as an instnimental variable for wages, however,

employment is consistently negatively related to contract wages.        This

finding suggests that the characteristicallyweak correlations between

employment and wages reported in many previous studies may be due in part
to the endogenous determination of wages in the labor market.    Once this

endogeneity is taken into account, the results from this study suggest that



     27The finding that firm-level employment is positively related to
industry average wages is also reported by Nickell and Wadhwani (1987).
                                          32

employment and wages at the firm level are significantly negatively

related.

    Two other findings emerge from the empirical analysis.        First,

unanticipated changes in prices generate changes in real wages not only

during the term of existing contracts, but also in subsequent agreements.

Second,    there is no evidence that contractual   employment   determination is

related to outside wage rates in a manner consistent with simple models of

efficient    contracting.   Rather, the empirical results suggest that

employment outcomes in union contracts are determined on a conventional

downward-slopingdemand schedule, taking the prevailing contract wage as

given.     These findings underscore   the importance of the institutional

structure of wage determination for the cyclical properties and persistence

of employment changes.

1.   Contract Samole

     The contract sample is derived from the December 1985 version of Labour

Canada's Wage Tape.     This Tape contains information on collective

bargaining agreements covering more than 500 employees in Canada.       Starting
from the 2868 manufacturing contracts on the tape, I merged together

contract chronologies between the same firm and union covering different

establishments,    and eliminated contracts   from bargaining pairs with fewer

than four contracts.     These procedures yield a sample of 2258 contracts

negotiated by 299 firm and union pairs.       Further information on the merging

process and the characteristics    of the resulting sample are presented in

the Data Appendix to Card (1988) and in Tables 1 and 2 of that paper.

        The employment data for this sample were then checked in two stages.

First, the number of workers covered in each contract was compared to the

number covered in the preceding and subsequent agreements.       Second, in

cases where the number of workers changed dramatically between contracts,

the contract summaries    in Labour Canada's Collective Bargaining Review

(Ottawa: Labour Canada Collective    Bargaining   Division) were consulted.   In

238 contracts, the employment counts recorded on the Wage Tape were found

to be in disagreement with the counts reported in the Collective      Bargaining

Review.     In these cases, counts from the published contract summaries were

used.     In caaes for which the set of establishments   covered by the contract

changed over time, contracts with inconsistent coverage were deleted from

the sample.     Of the 2258 contracts in the subsample of merged contracts,

valid coverage data are available for 1813 contracts      (80.3 percent).

Checking    of the   employment   data   was   performed by   Thomas Lemieux.   I   am

extremely    greteful to him   for providing me with these data.

      In this paper, employment at the end of a contract is measured by the

number of workers covered by the subsequent agreement. Furthermore,                 the


estimation procedures require informationon employment and wage outcomes

in the previous agreement, and on various industry and aggregate data which

are only available between 1966 and 1983.              The sample of contracts used in

this paper therefore consists of the subset of contracts in the initial

2258 contract merged subsample that satisfy the following criteria:

    -(a)   information on at least one previous contracts           is available in the

           sample.

    (b) -information     on at least one subsequent contract is available in the

           sample.
                                                                      after
    (c) the expiration dates of the current and previous contract are

           January 1966 and before December 1983.

     (d)   valid employment data are available for both the current and

           preceding contract (i.e. valid counts of workers covered are

           available for both the current and subsequent contracts).




2 Aesregate and Industry-levelData
    The following       aggregate and industry-level      data were merged to the

contract sample.

     (a) Consumer price index, all items, 1981—100.              January 1961 to

           November 1985: Cansim D484000, from the 1985 Cansim University Base

           Tape.     December 1985 to June 1986:       from the Bank of Canada Review,

           November 1986.
                                         35


(b) Average hourly earnings in manufacturing.          January 1961 to March

   1983:    Cansim D1518, from the 1983 Cansim University Base Tape.

   April 1983 to June 1986:    Cansim L5607, from the Bank of Canada

   Review, various issues.     Data from April 1983 and later are

   multiplied by 1.04035 to correct for the revision in the estab-

   lishment survey.

(c) Average hourly earnings of nonproduction production laborers,                 by

   province.     Annual data on hourly earnings for selected occupations

   are available for major cities.            I matched data for the following


   cities to their respective provinces: Halifax, St. John, Montreal,

   Toronto, Winnipeg, Regina, Edmonton, Vancouver.           The wage rates

   used are listed as rates for "male general laborers" between 1966

    and 1977, for "general laborers in service occupations" between

    1978 and 1981, and for "nonproduction laborers" between 1982 and

    1985.    Data for 1966-72 are from Wage Rates. Salaries, and Hours of

    Labour (Ottawa: Canada Department of Labour), 1966-1972 editions.

    Data for 1973-1986 are from Canada Year Book (Ottawa: Statistics

    Canada), various editions.          For contracts that cover two or more

                                                              and
    provinces I used a weighted average of Montreal, Toronto,

    Vancouver rates with weights of .35, .55, and .10, respectively.

(d) Unemployment rates, seasonally adjusted.           For contracts in Quebec,

    Ontario, and British Columbia I used the province-specific

                                                  For contracts in other
    unemployment rates for all workers.

    provinces I used the national average unemployment rate.                The

    series used were: Quebec    -       Cansim D768478; Ontario   -   Cansim

    D768648; British Columbia       -    Cansim D769233; all others     -   Cansim
                                    36

   D767611.   Data for January 1966-November 1983 were obtained from

   the 1983 Cansim University Base.      Data for December 1983-December

   1985 were taken from the Bank of Canada Review November 1986.

(e) Industry selling prices, input prices, and output.     Three-digit

    industry level annual data for 1961-71 were taken from Statistics

   Canada's Real Domestic Product By Industry 1961-71 (Ottawa,

    Statistics Canada).    These data are classified by 1960 standard

    industrial codes (SIC's).    Data on a 1971 SIC basis for 1971-83

   were taken from the 1978 and 1984 issues of Gross Domestic Product

   By Industry (Ottawa: Statistics Canada).      The 1960 and 1971 SIC

    codes were then matched, and the price and output indexes spliced

   using the 1971 observations from the two sources.      Of 65 3-digit

    industries represented in the contract sample, there were a total

    of 31 for which 3-digit level data was not available on    a

    consistent basis.     For these industries, 2-digit level data was

    used.   The publications report the value of gross output and

    implicit price indexes for gross output and intermediate inputs.

    These data were used to construct the value of real gross output

    (the measure of "output" used in this paper).     Implicit price

    indexes for gross output and intermediate inputs were deflated

    by the annual average consumer price index to obtain real

    selling prices and input prices used in the paper.

(f) Industry average hourly earnings.     Monthly two-digit industry-level

    average hourly earnings data for the period January 1961 to March

    1983 were taken from the 1983 Cansim University Base.     Earnings

    data are unavailable for two industries: knitting mills, and
                                37

miscellaneous manufacturing.     For the former I used earnings in

clothing industries.     For the latter, I used average earnings in

all manufacturing.     Wage rates for April-December 1983 were

constructed by   index-linking wage rates from the new establishment

survey to the rates in the old survey using their values in March

1983.   Earnings data from the new survey for March-December 1983

were taken from Statistics Canada Emoloyment. Earnings, and Hours.
