Nomadic Pastoralism, Climate Change, and Conflict in Africa

                                           ABSTRACT

Arid regions of Africa are expanding by thousands of square kilometers a year, potentially
disturbing pastoral routes that have been forged over a long period of time. This disturbance is
often said to explain why "herder-farmer" conflicts have erupted in recent years, as pastoralists
and agriculturalists compete for increasingly scarce resources. We examine this hypothesis by
combining ecological and ethnographic data on the location of pastoral ethnic groups with grid-
cell level data on violent conflict in Africa from 1989 to 2018. First, using ecological data, (i) we
confirm that areas suited to both agriculture and pastoralism are particularly prone to conflict
relative to either agricultural or pastoral areas alone; and (ii) we find that the effect of
precipitation shocks on conflict in these agro-pastoral zones is negative at the country-level, but
not at the cell-level. To explain this pattern, we compile data on the historical location of borders
between both types of ethnic groups. We find that droughts in pastoral areas lead to conflict in
neighboring agricultural areas. This spillover mechanism appears to explain much of the negative
overall relationship between precipitation and conflict in the sample. It implies that agro-pastoral
conflict is caused by the displacement of pastoral groups due to low precipitation in their
homelands. This finding establishes one mechanism through which climate change can lead to
more conflict in agro-pastoral zones.

1. Introduction
Civil conflict deters private investment, undermines state capacity, and destroys physical and
human capital. As of 2020, there were an estimated 79.5 million forcibly displaced people
worldwide. In Africa alone, 1.23 million people were killed in civil conflict events during the
thirty years from 1989 to 2018.1
   Conflict has also become more widespread in Africa during this period. In Figure 1, we show
that the share of 0.5 degree cells (around 55km × 55km at the equator) in which at least one
violent conflict event occurred in the calendar year has increased from just over 3% in 1989 to
almost 6% in 2018. In the same figure, we also show that droughts have become more severe over
the same period. The average duration of droughts has increased from around 5% of months
per year to around 10%. These trends are consistent with a growing literature that links hot and
dry weather to violence at both the interpersonal and intergroup levels (Miguel, Satyanath and
Sergenti, 2004, Burke, Miguel, Satyanath, Dykema and Lobell, 2009, Hsiang, Burke and Miguel,
2013, Harari and Ferrara, 2018, Fetzer, 2020).
   Due to a relative dearth of evidence on specific casual mechanisms, questions remain about the
future impact of climate change on conflict (Burke, Hsiang and Miguel, 2015, Solow, 2013, Mach,
Kraan, Adger, Buhaug, Burke, Fearon, Field, Hendrix, Maystadt, O'Loughlin, Roessler, Scheffran,
Schultz and von Uexkull, 2019). In this paper, we propose and test a mechanism linking weather
shocks to violent conflict between agricultural and pastoral ethnic groups in Africa. Agricultural
groups are those who practice crop agriculture in sedentary settlements. Pastoral groups are
those who practice animal husbandry as nomadic or semi-nomadic herders. In typical years,
agricultural and pastoral neighbors coexist in a symbiotic relationship due to seasonal migration
(Moritz, 2010). In the rainy season, pastoralists exploit marginal lands that produce sufficient
biomass for their livestock while agriculturalists farm more productive lands. Pastoralists then
migrate along well-established corridors to arrive at agricultural farmlands after the final harvest,
where they remain for the dry season. These journeys can range from hundreds of meters to
hundreds of kilometers (Kitchell, Turner and McPeak, 2014). In low precipitation years, there is
not enough rainfall to produce the biomass required to sustain livestock during the rainy season.
As a result, pastoralists are forced to migrate early to agricultural farmlands, where conflict can
emerge due to damaged crops and competition for resources such as water and pasture (Brottem,
2016).
   This mechanism generates a clear hypothesis: droughts in pastoral lands lead to conflict in
nearby agricultural lands. Since the hypothesis is that weather events in one area cause conflict
in another, testing it requires a spillover design. Failing to correctly model the spillover effects
could lead researchers to underestimate the true impact of droughts on conflict. The extent of
such a bias will depends on the level of analysis. When using low-resolution (e.g, country-level)
data, it is plausible that both the weather event and the conflict event occur within the same unit
of analysis and the spillover effects will be captured. However, when analyzing high-resolution

fatalities comes from the Uppsala Conflict Data Program version 19.1 (Sundberg and Melander, 2013).

Note: The red line depicts the annual the share of drought months per year in Africa, averaged over 0.5 degree cells.
It is based on the Standardized Precipitation and Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI-1) from the SPEI Global Drought

measured by the Uppsala Conflict Data Program version 19.1 (Sundberg and Melander, 2013).



(e.g., cell-level) data, empirical designs that do not explicitly model the spillover effects will fail
to capture the potential impact of weather events that are experienced outside of the cell.
   To illustrate this problem, we estimate the country-level and cell-level effects of local precipi-
tation shocks on conflict in areas suited to both agriculture and nomadic pastoralism, which we
call `agro-pastoral' areas. We combine high-resolution data on land-use suitability from Beck and
Sieber (2010) with two sets of geocoded conflict measures that vary at the level of a cell-year,
one collected by the Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP) (Sundberg and Melander, 2013)
and another by the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data project (ACLED) (Raleigh, Linke,
Hegre and Karlsen, 2010). Consistent with the importance of spillover effects, we come to very
different conclusions when we vary our level of analysis. When we aggregate data to the level
of a country-year, we find that lower rainfall is associated with more conflict in areas that are
suited to both agriculture and pastoralism, but not in areas that are suited to either agriculture
or pastoralism alone. When we analyze the data at the subnational cell-year level, the estimated
effect is zero.
   Motivated by the importance of spillover effects, we examine the effect of precipitation shocks
in pastoral territories on conflict in nearby agricultural cells. Our design allows us to test the
hypothesis while still maintaining the precision present in the cell-level data. To determine the


                                                                               2
identity of pastoral groups, we use data from the Ethnographic Atlas (Murdock, 1967), which
contains information on the economic and cultural practices of precolonial ethnic societies world-
wide. We construct two ethnicity-level variables that measure nomadic pastoralism. The first is
an indicator variable that equals one if the group is historically nomadic. The second is an index
taken from Becker (2019) that measures the historical importance of animal herding in the society.
Next, we assign these values to grid cells in Africa using a digitized version of George Peter
Murdock's map of precolonial ethnic societies (Murdock, 1959). We develop a new technique that
allows us to match around 96% of societies, representing a sizeable improvement on previous
efforts in the literature.2
   We find that, relative to the same shock in neighboring agricultural societies, a one standard
deviation decrease in precipitation in a neighboring pastoral societies raises the risk of conflict in
a grid-cell by 29.6%. The estimates are statistically significant and economically meaningful using
any of the four combinations of outcome and pastoral variables. In addition, the spillover effects
are much greater than the direct own-cell effects of precipitation. Consistent with on-the-ground
accounts, we also find that the spillover effect from weather shocks felt in neighboring pastoral
territories is only observed for grid-cells that are agricultural. Overall, the findings are consistent
with periods of low precipitation inducing pastoralists to migrate early to agricultural farmlands,
which results in damaged crops, competition for water and pasture, and conflict.
   The conflict datasets allow us to analyze the various conflict types and actors that contribute
to the main overall result. Our results suggest that most agro-pastoral conflict involves either
state forces (such as police or army units) battling against internal forces (such as rebel groups)
or external forces (such as ethnic militia from neighboring countries). This is consistent with
several media accounts in which state forces represent agricultural landowners and non-state
forces represent pastoral groups, depending on their origin.3
   The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the data used in the main analysis.
We also present maps displaying the spatial distribution of our main variables. We note that (i)
the distribution of pastoral groups from the Ethnographic Atlas aligns well with the distribution of
land-use suitability for nomadic pastoralism from Beck and Sieber (2010); and (ii) the distribution
of conflict events from UCDP aligns well with the overlap in land suitability for agriculture and
nomadic pastoralism.
   In Section 3, we present cross-sectional evidence on the prevalence of conflict in agro-pastoral
areas. Using ecological data, we show that violent conflict is significantly and substantially more
likely to emerge in cells that are suited to both agriculture and nomadic pastoralism relative to
areas that are suited to either type alone. For example, in cells with no pastoral suitability, a
one standard deviation rise in agricultural suitability is associated with a 15.8% decrease in the

risk of conflict. However, in cells with the median level of pastoral suitability, the same rise in
agricultural suitability is associated with a 11.7% increase in the risk of conflict. We note a similar
pattern using the ethnographic data. Agricultural ethnic societies are 11.34 percentage points
more likely to experience conflict if one of their bordering societies is pastoral. This magnitude
translates to almost two-thirds of the sample average of conflict incidence across all societies in
the sample.
   In Section 4, we estimate the impact of local precipitation shocks on conflict in agro-pastoral
areas. First, using ecological data aggregated at the country-level, we show that precipitation
significantly reduces conflict in countries that are more suited to both agriculture and pastoralism;
that is, we estimate a negative coefficient on a triple interaction between rainfall, suitability for
agriculture and suitability for nomadic pastoralism. On average, we find no significant effect
for either the rainfall-agriculture or rainfall-pastoral double interactions, which suggests that
the effect of droughts on conflict in Africa is primarily explained by conflict between nomadic
pastoralists and sedentary agriculturalists. In an attempt to assess the importance of spillovers,
we then move to a finer level of disaggregation and repeat the exercise using 0.5-degree cell-level
variation in conflict, precipitation, and land suitability. At this level of granularity, we find no
evidence of the same patterns found at the country level. This is consistent with the spillover
effects of interest occurring within countries but not with 0.5-degree cells.
   In Section 5, we provide an explicit structure for spillovers in our cell-level analysis. The
analysis assumes that a cell is potentially influenced by the precipitation of the nearest neigh-
boring ethnic group. All specifications include cell fixed effects and either climate-zone-by-year
fixed effects or country-by-year fixed effects, which account for time-invariant factors, as well as
common shocks within a country in a year. We find clear evidence that higher precipitation in the
nearest neighbor reduces conflict in a given cell, but only if the neighbor is pastoral. The estimated
effects are sizeable and significant and are found whether we measure pastoralism using a binary
variable indicating that a group is historically nomadic, or whether we measure pastoralism
using a continuous variable capturing the intensity of pastoralism based on the group's historical
dependance on animal husbandry. In these specifications, our estimated average local (i.e.,
within-cell) effect of precipitation on conflict is not significant.
   Our findings add to the existing ethnographic literature on the relationship between sedentary
farmers and nomadic herders in Africa, historically and in the post-colonial period (Lewis, 1961,
Jacobs, 1965, Konczacki, 1978, Dyson-Hudson and Dyson-Hudson, 1980). We also contribute to
our existing understanding of how African pastoral groups are affected by climate shocks (Little,
Smith, Cellarius, Coppock and Barrett, 2001, McPeak and Barrett, 2001, Maystadt and Ecker, 2004,
Bollig, 2006).
   We also contribute directly to the literature on climate and conflict (see Burke et al., 2015) and
to a broad literature on the determinants of conflict within Africa, including studies that explore
the importance of historical factors (e.g., Besley and Reynal-Querol, 2014, Depetris-Chauvin, 2015,
Michalopoulos and Papaioannou, 2016); ethnic or social factors (Montalvo and Reynal-Querol,
2005, Esteban, Mayoral and Ray, 2012, Rohner, Thoenig and Zilibotti, 2013); and economic factors,
especially shocks to the opportunity cost of conflict (McGuirk and Burke, 2020), which can be


                                                    4
challenging to distinguish empirically from shocks that affect other drivers of conflict (Blattman
and Miguel, 2010, Dube and Vargas, 2013, Dal Bó and Dal Bó, 2011). We overcome this issue
with our spillover design, which traces the effect of an adverse economic shock that occurs in one
ethnic territory on conflict that occurs in a neighboring ethnic territory.
   Our study identifies a specific mechanism through which climate change can affect violent
conflict in areas where pastoralists and agriculturalists come into contact.                         This mechanism
appears to explain most of the overall relationship between precipitation and conflict in Africa.
It implies that sufficiently adverse weather shocks can reduce the opportunity cost of conflict
for pastoral groups to the extent that it is worth bearing the risk of violence in order to access
water and pasture. It points ultimately to the importance of establishing seasonal grazing rights
for pastoral groups that can obviate the emergence of destructive conflict. Finally, our analysis
highlights the pitfalls of using granular data in the presence of spillover effects.


2. Data
A. Definitions and Sources

Structure      While we undertake analyses at different levels of observation, our most granular
estimates rely on an annual panel at the level of 0.5 degree (approx. 55km) grid cells. The sample
comprises 9,691 cells nested in 798 precolonial ethnic territories located on the African mainland.4
The location of the ethnic territories is taken from a digitized version of the map from George
Peter Murdock's book Africa: Its Peoples and their Culture History. The data run from 1989­2018,
depending on the datasets in operation.
   A sample of data, located in Western Africa, is shown in Figure 2. The map shows the
gridded 0.5-degree cells and the traditional boundaries of the ethnic groups in the region (Zenega,
Soninke, Masina, etc), as well as conflicts in the UCDP data.


Nearest Neighbors           For each cell, we determine the identity of the nearest ethnic group that is
contiguous to the ethnicity to which the cell belongs. This is our definition of a Neighbor. As an
illustration of this, consider Figure 2. For the cells in the northern portion of the Soninke ethnic
territory, the Neighbor is Zenega. For those that are in the southern portion, the Neighbor is either
Kasonke, Kagoro or Bambara depending on the east-west location of the cell.


Conflict: Baseline Measures using UCDP                    Our baseline set of geocoded conflict variables is
from the Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP). Conflict events are two-sided battles or one-
sided attacks that produce at least one fatality. In order to be included, all conflict dyads must
have engaged in a large-scale conflict battle in which at least 25 people were killed. There are
two mutually exclusive categories of conflict Actors: State implies that the state was involved in
the event; Non-State implies that only non-state actors, such as rebel groups or militias, were
involved. There are also two mutually exclusive types of Event: Battle implies a two-sided battle;
  4 We   do not consider islands given their limited size and our focus on inter-society conflict.

Attack implies a one-sided attack. UCDP conflict data run from 1989 to 2018. In keeping with
the literature, we code all conflict variables as cell-year measures of conflict incidence in our
regressions: 1(Conf lict).


Conflict: Auxiliary Measures using ACLED                 We also use an alternative set of geocoded conflict
variables taken from the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data project (ACLED), which run
from 1997­2020. Because the ACLED data are available for a shorter time period, we use the
UCDP data for our baseline estimates and check the robustness of our findings to the use of the
ACLED data. We consider only violent conflict events, namely two-sided battles and one-sided
attacks. There is no equivalent criteria for inclusion to the ACLED dataset, which is perhaps
why the unconditional probability of ACLED conflict incidence is 8% while the figure for UCDP
is 3% (see Table 1). One advantage of ACLED is the richness of information for each conflict
event. This allows us to generate three (overlapping) subcategories of actors: State Forces implies
that state forces (such as police or army units) were involved in at least one conflict event in a
cell-year; Internal Forces implies that internal forces (such as rebel groups or ethnic militia) were
involved in at least one conflict event in a cell-year; and External Forces implies that external
forces (foreign-based groups, including mercenaries) were involved in at least one conflict event
in a cell-year. Again, all variables are measured as conflict incidence at the level of a cell-year:
1(Conf lict).


Pastoralism: Ecological Data We employ land suitability data computed by Beck and Sieber
(2010), who use ecological niche modeling to derive spatial predictions of land use types based
on climactic and soil input data. We use their measure of the suitability of land for agriculture and
for nomadic pastoralism.5 These variables cover 100% of the African mainland. As there are large
regions suited to both land types, this data does not indicate the precise location of pastoral and
agricultural groups.


Nomadic Pastoralism: Ethnographic Atlas In order to identify the location of nomadic pastoral
societies, use information from the Ethnographic Atlas, a database of 1,265 ethnic groups assembled
and published by Murdock from 1962­1980. We construct two variables to identify nomadic
pastoral groups. The first focuses on the key aspect of nomadic pastoralism, which is that the
group is mobile. Using variable v30 from the Ethnographic Atlas, we create an indicator variable
that equals one if the group is described as having a settlement pattern that is either fully nomadic
or semi-nomadic. It is equal to zero for six remaining settlement types, which range from semi-
sedentary to complex settlements. We call this variable Nomade . This coding is indicated in
Figure 2 by the shading of the ethnic groups. As shown, Zenega and Berabish are semi-nomadic
and fully nomadic, respectively, and so for both groups Nomade = 1. All of the groups to the
south are sedentary, and so neither semi or fully-nomadic; therefore Nomade = 0.
   The second variable that we use explicitly accounts for a measure of pastoralism. We build on
a measure developed by Becker (2019), which combines information on the fraction of subsistence
  5 The   other land use types computed by Beck and Sieber are hunting-and-gathering and sedentary animal husbandry.


                                                           7
that is from animal husbandry (measured on a 0-1 scale and from v4 in the EA) with an indicator
variable that equals one if the primary large animal is suitable for herding (from variable v40 of
the EA).6 Becker's variable, which is constructed as an interaction between these two measures,
ranges from 0-1. We combine Becker's 0-1 index of pastoralism with our 0/1 indicator of a group
being nomadic by interacting the two measures. We call this variable Herdere . A value of 0
implies that the group either does not engage in animal herding or that the group is not (at least
partially) nomadic. A positive value implies that the group is dependent on herding animals for
subsistence to some extent and that they are also nomadic.
   While the two measures are highly correlated ( = 0.89), conceptually they are different. The
first measures only whether a group is mobile and the second measures whether they are mobile
and engage in herding.
   In order to assign these variables to spacial units, we match the Ethnographic Atlas societies
to the Murdock map territories. A crude match by name only returns a match rate of around
50.4%. This is because some of the groups named in the ethnographic dataset are subgroups of
those named on the map and vice versa. Some reachers have improved significantly on the crude
match rate; for example, Michalopoulos and Papaioannou (2013) assign Ethnographic Atlas values
to 58.1% of the map territories. Using a variety of sources, documented in Kincaide et al. (2020),
we achieve a match rate of 96%.


Precipitation     Pastoral groups reply on precipitation to produce the biomass needed to sustain
their livestock. Our shock variable is a 0.5 degree cell-year measure of precipitation calculated
by the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre. It measures land-surface precipitation from rain
gauges built on Global Telecommunications System (GTS)-based data.7


B. Summary of the Raw Data

In the upper left panel of Figure 3, we display the spatial distribution of land suitability for no-
madic pastoralism, with dark blue representing the cells with higher shares of suitable land. The
upper right figure displays the spatial distribution of land suitability for sedentary agriculture.
The data are from Beck and Sieber (2010). Also shown in the figures are the boundaries of ethnic
groups from the Murdock map that are either fully nomadic or semi-nomadic as reported in the
matched Ethnographic Atlas. (The two categories define the Nomad indicator.) It is clear that the
underlying suitability data from Beck and Sieber (2010) is highly correlated with the traditional
degree of mobility reported in the Ethnographic Atlas.
   The figures also show that there exists substantial overlap in land-suitability for agriculture
and nomadic pastoralism. In the lower left panel, we display the Index of Shared Suitability,
which measures the extent to which a cell is jointly suitable for both agriculture and nomadic
  6 This
       includes sheep, goats, equine animals, camels, and bovine animals, but not pigs.

and numerical weather prediction centers. The URL for their website is www.wmo.int.

pastoralism.8 It is equal to 0 if the cell is not at all suited to one of the land-use types and equal
to 1 if it is fully suited to both. In the lower right panel, we overlay this map with the presence
of UCDP conflict events from 1989­2018. A higher number of events per cell is represented by
larger and darker points. Visually, conflicts appear to be clustered in areas that are suitable for
both agriculture and pastoralism. We formally estimate this cross-sectional relationship in the
next section.
   We next turn to Figure 4, which displays evidence in support of our main hypothesis. The
upper panel presents annual precipitation averaged over cells for all of Africa. The lower panel
presents the annual prevalence of conflict in agro-pastoral cells--that is, cells that are suited
to both agriculture and pastoralism--relative to agricultural or pastoral cells alone during the
same period. We plot, for each year, the coefficients from a regression of conflict incidence on
agricultural and pastoral suitability as well as their interaction. The interaction effect is positive
and significant for most of the series, indicating that violence is especially high in areas where
farmers and herders come into contact.9 The peak of this interaction effect appears to coincide
with an extremely low average precipitation value in the mid 2000s.
   The descriptive statistics for our main variables are reported in Table 1. The tables include two
additional variables from the Ethnographic Atlas. One representing an ethnic group's traditional
dependence on crop agriculture for subsistence. The variable, which we denote Farmere , is an
index that ranges from 0-1. The other variable measures the levels of jurisdictional hierarchy
beyond the local community.                The variable, Jurisdictional Hierarchye , takes on integer values
ranging from 1-5. We also report statistics for measures of cell-level temperature, nighttime
lights, gross cell product, the log of population and infant mortality. These are all gathered from
version 2 of the PRIO-GRID dataset (Tollefsen, Strand and Buhaug, 2012).
   Using our N omade variable, the share of cells that belong to ethnic groups that are historically
nomadic pastoral is 41%. The sample mean of our Herdere variable is 26%. Using the Beck-Sieber
ecological data, the share of land suited to nomadic pastoralism is 32%.
   In Table 2, we report summary statistics separately for cells for which N omade = 0 and cells
for which N omade = 1. The share of land suited to agriculture is 8% in pastoral cells and 35% in
non-pastoral cells. Pastoral cells have lower precipitation, fewer night lights, lower populations
and less conflict than non-pastoral cells.


3. Agro-Pastoral Conflict in the Cross-Section
We begin our analysis by first presenting cross-sectional evidence on the prevalence of conflict in
locations suitable for both agriculture and nomadic pastoralism.

nomadic pastoralism respectively

   9 For   the remainder of this study, farmers practice sedentary agriculture and herders practice nomadic pastoralism.

Note: The upper left figure displays the spatial distribution of land suitability for nomadic pastoralism, with dark blue
representing the cells with higher shares of suitable land. The upper right figure displays the spatial distribution of
land suitability for sedentary agriculture. These variables are from Beck and Sieber (2010). Overlying both figures is
the outline of fully nomadic and seminomadic territories from the Ethnographic Atlas. The bottom left figure displays
the spatial distribution of "shared suitability", which is equal to 1 if land is perfectly suited to both agriculture and
pastoralism, and zero if it is not suited to either. The lower right hand side figure overlays this distribution with
markers representing the number of violent conflict events in each cell from 1989­2018, as measured by UCDP.

Note: The upper figure presents ground precipitation in cm, averaged over cells. The lower figure depicts, for each
year, the coefficients and 90% confidence intervals from a regression of conflict incidence on land suitability variables
for sedentary agriculture, nomadic pastoralism, and their interaction (from Beck and Sieber (2010)). These regressions
are at the level of a 0.5 cell. Estimates are smoothed using a ±2 year moving average.

Ecological data We first estimate the cell-level relationship between conflict and the joint pres-
ence of land suitability for agriculture and pastoralism, measured using the Beck-Sieber ecological
data described above. We propose the following specification:

                                                          p             p
                            1(conf lictit ) = t + 1 La           a
                                                     i × Li + 2 Li + 3 Li + 4 ln(popi ) +                                               it ,                       (1)

where i indexes 9,691 0.5-degree grid-cells and t years (1989­2018). The dependent variable,
1(conf lictit ), is the incidence of conflict in cell i in year t; t denote year fixed effects, which
account for time-varying factors that affect all cells similarly; La
                                                                   i is the average index of suitability
for agriculture of land within cell i; and Lp
                                            i is the index of suitability of cell i for nomadic
pastoralism. 1 represents the interaction effect of interest. A positive estimate indicates that
conflict is significantly higher in cells suited to both types relative to cells suited to either type.
   We also control for the natural log of the average population across cells between 1990­2010,
ln(popi ). Population is potentially correlated with subsistence activities and is expected to affect
conflict incidence. Standard errors are clustered at the level of a cell (to account for serial
correlation) and climate zone-year (to account for spatial correlation). There are 14 climate zones
in the sample that are based on the Köppen-Geiger climate classification (Rubel and Kottek, 2010).
   In Table 3, we present estimates of equation (1) with UCDP conflict variables as the outcome.
In column 1, we estimate a large, positive and significant interaction effect. In column 2, we add
ln(population) as a control variable, as settlements are likely to be more dense in agricultural
and agro-pastoral areas, and conflict is likely a function of population. This addition accounts
entirely for the positive coefficient on agriculture in the first column, but the interaction effect

                                                                                      12

Note: All outcome variables measure conflict incidence at the level of a cell-year. UCDP 1(Conflict) indicates at least one violent conflict event in a cell-year. The two Actor outcomes
  are mutually exclusive subcategories: State indicates at least one conflict event involving the state; Non-State indicates at least one conflict event not involving the state. The two Event
  outcomes are also mutually exclusive subcategories: Battle indicates at least one two-sided conflict event; Attack indicates at least one one-sided conflict event. Agriculture and Nomadic
  Pastoralism are cell-level variables measuring the share of land suitable for each land use type; ln(Population) is the natural log of average cell-level population measured in five-year
  intervals from 1990 to 2010. Standard errors (in parentheses) are adjusted for serial correlation at the level of a cell and spatial correlation at the level of a climate zone. * p < 0.1, ** p <
  0.05, *** p < 0.01.




  is unchanged. We see similar results for all conflict actors and event types from the UCDP data
  (columns 3­10). We also check the robustness of our estimates to the use of ACLED conflict data.
  The estimates, which are reported in Appendix Table A1, show that we find the same general
  pattern is found.


  Ethnographic data: group level                                        We now turn to a preliminary exploration of the presence of
  spatial spillovers. As noted, accounts of conflicts with nomadic pastoralists indicate that conflicts
  typically occur outside of the territories of pastoralists and in the territories of neighboring
  groups.            Motivated by this, we examine cross-ethnicity variation and ask whether nomadic
  pastoralism is associated with greater conflict in neighboring ethnic groups. Our estimating
  equation is given by:

                                      n                                       n
      1(conf lictet ) = t + 1 pastorale + 2 pastorale + 3 pastorale × pastorale + 4 ln(pope ) + et (2)

  where e indexes ethnic groups and t years (1989­2018); 1(conf lictet ) is a conflict incidence
                                                                            n is either an indicator
  indicator for ethnicity e at time t; t denote year fixed effects; pastorale
  that equals one if group e has at least one contiguous neighbor for which N omade = 1 or it is
  the average value of Herdere among all neighbors of an ethnic group; pastorale is either N omade
  or Herdere . The parameter of interest, 1 , describes the effect of having at least one pastoral
  neighbor for a non-pastoral group. Standard errors are clustered at the level of an ethnic society
  (to account for serial correlation) and climate zone-year (to account for spatial correlation).
        Estimates of equation (2) are reported in Table 4. The estimate of 1 is reported in the first row
               n is measured as having at least one nomadic neighbor, and in the fourth row when
  when pastorale
  it is measured as the average value of Herder for all neighbors. In almost every specification, the
  estimates are positive and significant. This is also the case when we use ACLED conflict data
  rather than the UCDP conflict data (see Appendix Table A2).

Note: All outcome variables measure conflict incidence at the level of an ethnic society-year. UCDP 1(Conflict) indicates at least one violent conflict event in a society-year. The two
  Actor outcomes are mutually exclusive subcategories: State indicates at least one conflict event involving the state; Non-State indicates at least one conflict event not involving the
  state. The two Event outcomes are also mutually exclusive subcategories: Battle indicates at least one two-sided conflict event; Attack indicates at least one one-sided conflict event.
  Nomad indicates that the ethnic society is nomadic; Any Neighbor Nomad indicates that any neighboring ethnic society is nomadic; Herder measures the intensity of nomadic pastoralism
  from 0-1; Avg. Neighbor Herder is the average Herder value over all neighboring ethnic societies; ln(Population) is the natural log of average cell-level population measured in five-year
  intervals from 1990 to 2010. Standard errors (in parentheses) are adjusted for serial correlation at the level of a cell and spatial correlation at the level of a climate zone. * p < 0.1, ** p <
  0.05, *** p < 0.01.




  Ethnographic data: nearest neighbor Lastly, we use the granularity of the conflict data to check
  for the presence of spillover effects from having neighboring ethnic groups who are nomadic-
  pastoralists. Rather than looking for spillovers from all neighboring ethnic groups, we examine
  variation across cells and look for spillovers from the neighboring ethnic group that is closest to
  the cell centroid. We estimate the following equation:

                                     n                                       n
    1(conf lictiet ) = t + 1 pastorali + 2 pastorale + 3 pastorale × pastorali + 4 ln(popi ) + iet , (3)

  where i indexes 0.5-degree grid-cells, e ethnic groups, and t years (1989­2018). The dependent
                                                                                                     n
  variable, 1(conf lictiet ), is conflict incidence in cell i in ethnic society e at time t; pastorali
  is a measure of whether the neighboring ethnic group that is geographically closest to cell i
  traditionally engages in nomadic pastoralism, measured either using either the indicator variable
  N omad or the index Herder. The variable pastorale is either of these two measures, but measured
  for the ethnicity in which the cell is located; ln(popi ) is the natural log of the average population
  of cell i from 1990­2010.
        The parameter of interest, 1 , represents the effect of neighboring nomadic pastoralists on
  conflict in the cells of non-pastoral groups. Standard errors are adjusted for two-way clustering
  at the level of a cell and a climate zone-year.
        Estimates of equation (3) using the UCDP data are presented in Table 5, while estimates using
  the ACLED data are presented in Appendix Table A3. The estimate of interest, ^1 , is reported in
  the first row using the N omad indicator and in the fourth row using the Herder index. The
  interpretation is again clear: having a nomadic pastoral nearest neighbor is associated with

                                                                                                   14

significantly more conflict in almost every specification. Focusing on columns 1 and 2 in each
table, the effect is positive and significant in both pastoral and non-pastoral cells.
    Whether we use ecological or ethnographic data, and whether we use cell- or group-level
variation, we see clear evidence that violent conflict is prevalent in agro-pastoral areas. It appears
to be driven mostly by the presence of a pastoral neighbor in non-pastoral areas.




                                                                                            15
4. Local Precipitation Shocks and Agro-Pastoral Conflict: Scale Matters
We next examine whether changes in precipitation affect agro-pastoral conflict.               To further
motivate the importance of modeling spillover effects, we show in this section that the estimated
direct effects are very different depending on the granularity of the analysis.
     To do this, we estimate the following equation at different levels of spatial aggregation:

                           s          s
 1(conf lictit ) = i + t + 0 rainit + 1 rainit × La    p   s           a   s           p
                                                  c × Lc + 2 rainit × Lc + 3 rainit × Lc +
                                                                                                   s
                                                                                                   it ,   (4)

where i indexes geographic units (either cells or countries), t indexes years. 1(conf lictit ) is conflict
incidence in location i in year t; i denote location fixed effects; t denote year fixed effects;
                                                                           p
rainit measures average precipitation in location i in year t; and La
                                                                    i and Li are averages of the
Beck-Sieber land suitability measures for agriculture and nomadic pastoralism respectively. The
          s describes the additional effect of precipitation in locations suited to both agriculture
parameter 1
and pastoralism relative to the effect in countries suited to either agriculture or pastoralism alone.


Country-level      We first estimate equation (4) when i is measured at the country level. For these
estimates, we cluster the standard errors at the country-level. The estimates are presented in
Table 6 (UCDP) and Appendix Table A4 (ACLED). They indicate that precipitation lowers conflict
significantly more in agro-pastoral areas (or, alternatively, that droughts induce more conflict in
agro-pastoral areas). This is true for all types of conflict examined. The effects are very different
when areas are only agricultural or only pastoral: we find that the two double interaction effects,
^ s and 
        ^ s , are positive, in contrast to ^ s , which is negative. They are also significant in some
 2         3                                1
specifications, but not all.


Cell-level     We turn next to estimates, where i in equation (4) is measured at the cell level.
Differences in the estimates at the different levels of analysis provide insights into the potential
importance of spillovers in our setting. More aggregate estimates, like the country-level estimates,
are expected to capture many of the spillover effects, while more micor-level estimates, like the
0.5-degree cell-level estimates, which are less likely to capture important spillover effects.
     The cell-level estimates of equation 4 are reported in Table 7 (UCDP) and Appendix Table A5
(ACLED). Due to the potential of spatial correlation across fine grid cells, we cluster standard
errors at the level of a cell and at the level of a climate zone-year. We find that, in contrast to
the country-level estimates, the cell-level estimates are not significant. We no longer observe a
negative differential effect of precipitation on conflict in agro-pastoral areas. These results indicate
that the country-level effect of precipitation on conflict does not operate through a local channel
that occurs within 0.5 degree (55km) cells. Instead, it is likely that a spillover mechanism is at
play. We now turn to an explicit examination of this mechanism.

5. Spillover Precipitation Shocks and Agro-Pastoral Conflict
To explicitly examine spillovers between pastoral and agricultural areas, we combine information
on the precise location of conflicts relative to the traditional borders between ethnic groups with
information on each group's traditional subsistence activities; namely agriculture and nomadic-
pastoralism.
   We exploit cell-level variation in the identity of the nearest neighboring ethnic group to each
cell's centroid. We estimate the following equation:

                             s   s        s            s     n    s     n            n

                                                      + 2 rainet + 3 rainet × pastorale

territories causes additional conflict in neighboring cells. The inclusion of cell fixed effects controls
flexibly for all time-invariant characteristics that vary at the level of a 0.5 degree cell or higher.
The inclusion of climate-zone × year fixed effects controls flexibly for all common shocks and
trends that vary at the level of a climate zone, of which there are 14 in the sample.
   We also estimate an even more stringent version of equation (5) where the climate-zone-by-year
year fixed effects and the country-specific time trend are replaced by country-by-year fixed effects.


Results    In Table 8, we present results from our estimation of equation (5) using Nomad as the
measure of nomadic pastoralism and UCDP to measure conflict. In column 1, the outcome
variable is 1(Conf lict), which is equal to 1 if UCDP records any violent two-sided or one-sided
event. We estimate no significant effects of own-cell or own-group precipitation shocks; nor do we
estimate significant effects of non-pastoral nearest neighbor shocks. The only significant estimate
is ^s , which is negative in each of the ten specifications and generally significant.

  In the middle panel, we show that the total effect of a neighboring pastoral shock is negative
and significant (p = 0.02). In the lower panel, we translate the ^s estimate into the equivalent of a
                                                                       1
temporal (i.e., within-cell) standard deviation shock on conflict incidence in terms of the depen-
dent variable mean (henceforth "SD impact"). A one standard deviation increase in precipitation
in neighboring pastoral societies reduces conflict by 22.5% of the mean. In the second column, we
reduce the sample to non-pastoral (i.e. agricultural) cells alone. The same shock reduces conflict


                                                     18
by 40.6% in agricultural cells. In Appendix Table A6, we reduce the sample to pastoral cells alone
and find no significant effect. This implies that the overall effect of neighboring pastoral shocks
in column 1 is explained entirely by conflict in agricultural cells.
   In the remaining columns, we note that the main finding is driven predominantly by two-sided
battles involving the state. The interaction effect on state-based conflict in column 4 has an SD
impact of -43.9% (p < 0.01). The effect on two-sided battles is -51.2% (p < 0.01).
   In Table 9, we include country-year fixed effects (CYFE). This controls flexibly for factors that
vary at the country level over time, including macroeconomic shocks and events in national
politics. The main disadvantage of including these fixed effects is that our main estimates are
computed using only the residualized variation that exists after we partial out these factors.
Despite this, we report statistically significant estimates with broadly similar coefficients and
only marginally larger standard errors. This stands in contrast to Table 7, where we do not model
the spillover effects.
   In Table 10, we see similar effects using the Herder pastoral variable. The first column presents
the effect on overall violence. Our main estimate is again negative (SD impact = -36.3%) and
significant (p < 0.01). Again, the effect is explained entirely by conflict in non-pastoral cells
(SD impact = -63.8%, p < 0.01) rather than pastoral cells (Table A6), and is driven mainly by
state-based two-sided battles. We find similar results when we include CYFEs (Table 11 and
Appendix Table A7).
   In Appendix Tables A8 to A11, we check the robustness of our findings to using the ACLED
conflict data. Despite the shorter length of the ACLED panel, we still find quantitatively and
statistically similar results. The overall SD impact on conflict using the Nomad indicator is -8%
(p < 0.05) in the main specification and -10.1% (p < 0.01) in the CYFE specification, all of which
is explained by conflict in non-pastoral cells (Appendix Table A12 and Table A13). This is driven
mainly by two-sided battles that involve both domestic and external non-state forces. The results
are similar when we use the Herder measure.


Additional Robustness We now turn to an examination of the sensitivity of our estimates. First,
while we assume that the timing of precipitation shocks are random conditional on cell fixed
effects, we test the sensitivity of our estimates to the inclusion of a linear time trend that varies
           n . This accounts for factors that trend differentially at the level of nearest neighboring
by pastorali
groups that are pastoral or not.
   Second, we might be concerned about the role of other factors that are correlated with
pastoralism. If any of these interact with rainfall shocks in a way that affects spillover conflict,
they may explain some or all of our ^s estimate. One potential factor is related to a "culture of
                                        1
honor," which tends to be present in pastoral groups (Nisbett and Cohen, 1996). However, were
this driving our results, we would expect to also estimate large (or even larger) pastoral-pastoral
effects rather than (or in addition to) agro-pastoral effects. Our results very clearly indicate that
pastoral shocks lead to conflict in neighboring agricultural cells and not in pastoral cells.
   A closely related concern is that pastoral groups do not have high levels of state centralization,
which could also manifest itself in spillover violence of the type that we identify.            This is

Note: All outcome variables measure conflict incidence at the level of a cell-year. UCDP 1(Conflict) indicates at least one violent conflict event in a cell-year. The two Actor outcomes
  are mutually exclusive subcategories: State indicates at least one conflict event involving the state; Non-State indicates at least one conflict event not involving the state. The two Event
  outcomes are also mutually exclusive subcategories: Battle indicates at least one two-sided conflict event; Attack indicates at least one one-sided conflict event. Own Group refers to the
  ethnic society that contains cell i. Nearest Neighbor refers to the nearest neighboring ethnic society to cell i. Nomad indicates that an ethnic society is nomadic. Precipitation is annual
  ground precipitation measured in centimeters. Standard errors (in parentheses) are adjusted for serial correlation at the level of a cell and spatial correlation at the level of a climate
  zone. * p < 0.1, ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01.




  particularly important given the previously documented importance of precolonial state central-
  ization for contemporary development outcomes (Gennaioli and Rainer, 2007, Michalopoulos and
                                                                                                    n
  Papaioannou, 2013). To gauge this possibility, we also include a rainn
                                                                       it × Jurisdictional Hierarchye
  interaction variable, where the n superscript again indicates that the variable measures jurisdic-
  tional hierarchy in the nearest neighboring ethnic society.
       To check the robustness of our estimates to the inclusion of these covariates, we add them to
  the more stringent specification that includes country-year fixed effects. The estimates, which
  are reported in Tables 12 and 13, show that the inclusion of these additional variables makes
  little difference to our main estimates. In fact, they are slightly larger in magnitude and more
  statistically significant in most cases. The stability of our estimates is reassuring in this regard.
  The estimates are similarly robust if we estimate the same specification but use the ACLED
  conflict data. Th estimates are reported in Appendix Tables A14 and A15.

Note: All outcome variables measure conflict incidence at the level of a cell-year. UCDP 1(Conflict) indicates at least one violent conflict event in a cell-year. The two Actor outcomes
  are mutually exclusive subcategories: State indicates at least one conflict event involving the state; Non-State indicates at least one conflict event not involving the state. The two Event
  outcomes are also mutually exclusive subcategories: Battle indicates at least one two-sided conflict event; Attack indicates at least one one-sided conflict event. Own Group refers to the
  ethnic society that contains cell i. Nearest Neighbor refers to the nearest neighboring ethnic society to cell i. Herder measures the intensity of nomadic pastoralism in an ethnic group from
  0-1. Precipitation is annual ground precipitation measured in centimeters. Standard errors (in parentheses) are adjusted for serial correlation at the level of a cell and spatial correlation at
  the level of a climate zone. * p < 0.1, ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01.

6. Conclusions
In this paper, we have combined ethnographic data and ecological data on pastoralism with
cell-year level data on conflict to examine the origins of agro-pastoral conflict in Africa. Using
several combinations of data sources, we found evidence that low precipitation in pastoral areas
leads to more violent conflict in agro-pastoral zones.
   This spillover mechanism appears to explain most of the country-level association between
precipitation and conflict in Africa, and it accounts for the differences between country-level and
cell-level estimates of local shocks on conflict.
   Our findings point to the significant efficiency costs of incomplete property rights for both
farmers and herders in Africa. Institutions that enforce the right balance of grazing and cultivat-

Note: All outcome variables measure conflict incidence at the level of a cell-year. ACLED 1(Conflict) indicates at least one violent conflict event in a cell-year. The two Event outcomes are mutually exclusive
  subcategories: Battle indicates at least one two-sided conflict event; Attack indicates at least one one-sided conflict event. The following three outcomes are not mutually exclusive. They indicate respectively
  conflict incidence involving State Forces, Internal Forces not including the state, and External Forces involving state and non-state forces acting outside of their main country of operation, including mercenaries.
  Agriculture and Nomadic Pastoralism are cell-level variables measuring the share of land suitable for each land use type; ln(Population) is the natural log of average cell-level population measured in five-year
  intervals from 1990 to 2010. Standard errors (in parentheses) are adjusted for serial correlation at the level of a cell and spatial correlation at the level of a climate zone. * p < 0.1, ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01.

Note: All outcome variables measure conflict incidence at the level of an ethnic society-year. ACLED 1(Conflict) indicates at least one violent conflict event in a society-year. The two Event outcomes are mutually
  exclusive subcategories: Battle indicates at least one two-sided conflict event; Attack indicates at least one one-sided conflict event. The following three outcomes are not mutually exclusive. They indicate
  respectively conflict incidence involving State Forces, Internal Forces not including the state, and External Forces involving state and non-state forces acting outside of their main country of operation, including
  mercenaries. Nomad indicates that the ethnic society is nomadic; Any Neighbor Nomad indicates that any contiguous ethnic society is nomadic; Herder measures the intensity of nomadic pastoralism from 0-1; Avg.
  Neighbor Herder is the average Herder value over all neighboring ethnic societies; ln(Population) is the natural log of average cell-level population measured in five-year intervals from 1990 to 2010. Standard errors
  (in parentheses) are adjusted for serial correlation at the level of a cell and spatial correlation at the level of a climate zone. * p < 0.1, ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01.

Note: All outcome variables measure conflict incidence at the level of a cell-year. ACLED 1(Conflict) indicates at least one violent conflict event in a cell-year. The two Event outcomes are mutually exclusive
 subcategories: Battle indicates at least one two-sided conflict event; Attack indicates at least one one-sided conflict event. The following three outcomes are not mutually exclusive. They indicate respectively conflict
 incidence involving State Forces, Internal Forces not including the state, and External Forces involving state and non-state forces acting outside of their main country of operation, including mercenaries. Nomad indicates
 that the ethnic society containing cell i is nomadic; Neighbor Nomad indicates that the nearest neighboring ethnic society to cell i is nomadic; ln(Population) is the natural log of average cell-level population measured
 in five-year intervals from 1990 to 2010. Standard errors (in parentheses) are adjusted for serial correlation at the level of a cell and spatial correlation at the level of a climate zone. * p < 0.1, ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01.

Note: All outcome variables measure conflict incidence at the level of a cell-year. UCDP 1(Conflict) indicates at least one violent conflict event in a cell-year. The two Actor
  outcomes are mutually exclusive subcategories: State indicates at least one conflict event involving the state; Non-State indicates at least one conflict event not involving
  the state. The two Event outcomes are also mutually exclusive subcategories: Battle indicates at least one two-sided conflict event; Attack indicates at least one one-sided
  conflict event. Own Group refers to the ethnic society that contains cell i. Nearest Neighbor refers to the nearest neighboring ethnic society to cell i. Nomad indicates that an
  ethnic society is nomadic. Precipitation is annual ground precipitation measured in centimeters. Standard errors (in parentheses) are adjusted for serial correlation at the
  level of a cell and spatial correlation at the level of a climate zone. * p < 0.1, ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01.

Note: All outcome variables measure conflict incidence at the level of a cell-year. ACLED 1(Conflict) indicates at least one violent conflict event in a cell-year. The two Event outcomes are mutually exclusive
  subcategories: Battle indicates at least one two-sided conflict event; Attack indicates at least one one-sided conflict event. The following three outcomes are not mutually exclusive. They indicate respectively
  conflict incidence involving State Forces, Internal Forces not including the state, and External Forces involving state and non-state forces acting outside of their main country of operation, including mercenaries.
  Own Group refers to the ethnic society that contains cell i. Nearest Neighbor refers to the nearest neighboring ethnic society to cell i. Nomad indicates that an ethnic society is nomadic. Precipitation is annual
  ground precipitation measured in centimeters. Standard errors (in parentheses) are adjusted for serial correlation at the level of a cell and spatial correlation at the level of a climate zone. * p < 0.1, ** p < 0.05,

 Note: All outcome variables measure conflict incidence at the level of a cell-year. ACLED 1(Conflict) indicates at least one violent conflict event in a cell-year. The two Event outcomes are mutually
  exclusive subcategories: Battle indicates at least one two-sided conflict event; Attack indicates at least one one-sided conflict event. The following three outcomes are not mutually exclusive. They indicate
  respectively conflict incidence involving State Forces, Internal Forces not including the state, and External Forces involving state and non-state forces acting outside of their main country of operation,
  including mercenaries. Own Group refers to the ethnic society that contains cell i. Nearest Neighbor refers to the nearest neighboring ethnic society to cell i. Nomad indicates that an ethnic society is nomadic.
  Precipitation is annual ground precipitation measured in centimeters. Standard errors (in parentheses) are adjusted for serial correlation at the level of a cell and spatial correlation at the level of a climate
  zone. * p < 0.1, ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01.

Note: All outcome variables measure conflict incidence at the level of a cell-year. ACLED 1(Conflict) indicates at least one violent conflict event in a cell-year. The two Event outcomes are mutually exclusive subcategories:
  Battle indicates at least one two-sided conflict event; Attack indicates at least one one-sided conflict event. The following three outcomes are not mutually exclusive. They indicate respectively conflict incidence involving
  State Forces, Internal Forces not including the state, and External Forces involving state and non-state forces acting outside of their main country of operation, including mercenaries. Own Group refers to the ethnic society
  that contains cell i. Nearest Neighbor refers to the nearest neighboring ethnic society to cell i. Herder measures the intensity of nomadic pastoralism in an ethnic group from 0-1. Precipitation is annual ground precipitation
  measured in centimeters. Standard errors (in parentheses) are adjusted for serial correlation at the level of a cell and spatial correlation at the level of a climate zone. * p < 0.1, ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01.
