Systematic Managed Floating

                                          ABSTRACT

A majority of countries neither freely float their currencies nor firmly peg. But most of the
remainder in practice also don’t obey such well-defined intermediate exchange rate regimes as
target zones. This paper proposes to define an intermediate regime, to be called “systematic
managed floating,” as an arrangement where the central bank regularly responds to changes in
total exchange market pressure by allowing some fraction to be reflected as a change in the
exchange rate and the remaining fraction to be absorbed as a change in foreign exchange
reserves. An operational criterion for judging systematic managed floaters is a high correlation
between exchange rate changes and reserve changes. The paper rejects the view that exchange
rate regimes make no difference. In regressions to test effects on real exchange rates, we find that
positive external shocks tend to cause real appreciation for most systematic managed-floaters;
more strongly so for pure floaters; and not at all for most firm peggers. Two measures of
exogenous external shocks are used: (i) for commodity-exporters, a country-specific index of
global prices of the export commodities and (ii) for other Asian emerging market economies, the
VIX.

Introduction

    According to textbook theory, when countries choose their exchange rate regime they are
choosing the extent to which they will be able to run an independent monetary policy despite
external shocks. On the one hand, a firmly fixed exchange rate gives up the ability to set an
independent monetary policy, unless capital controls or other impediments are used to break
the link between domestic and foreign interest rates. On the other hand, a free-floating
exchange rate maximizes insulation of the domestic real economy: an adverse foreign shock
causes a nominal and real depreciation of the domestic currency, which works to moderate
what would otherwise be negative real effects on the domestic trade balance, output and
employment. In response to a positive foreign shock, currency appreciation dampens its real
effects as well.

    There are also intermediate regimes that lie at various points along the spectrum between
fixed and floating exchange rates. These intermediate regimes include managed floats, bands,
basket pegs, crawls, and other arrangements.1 The argument for the intermediate regimes is
that they allow an intermediate degree of monetary independence in return for an
intermediate degree of exchange rate flexibility.

    For concreteness, consider the history of emerging market economies (EMs) since the turn
of the century. As an aggregate class they have, broadly speaking, experienced four periods of
big alternating shifts in the external environment for their balance of payments. In the first
period from 2003 to mid-2008, the external environment was positive, as US monetary policy
was easy, commodity prices were rising, and international investors were not especially
concerned about risk as they reached for any EM returns that were even a little higher than
those on offer in the advanced countries. The second period was the Global Financial Crisis that
began in mid-2008 and eased a year later. This was a negative shock for EM economies: risk
perceptions leapt and commodity prices plummeted. The third period, in 2010-11, was
essentially a repeat of the first, with a favorable financial environment and a recovery in
commodity prices leading to substantial EM inflows. Fourth was the period that began with
the Taper Tantrum of May 2013 and continued at least through the China Tantrum of the
second half of 2015: the first stages of a reversal in US monetary policy and a new fall in
commodity prices led to EM outflows.

        Central banks in different Emerging Market countries responded differently to these
external shocks. Figure 1 (adapted from Goldman Sachs) shows responses of Asian central
banks to the positive shock of 2010. Reserve accumulation is on the vertical axis and currency
appreciation on the horizontal axis. On the one hand, Korea and Singapore appear as relatively
more-managed floaters, intervening in the foreign exchange market somewhat more and
appreciating less. On the other hand, India, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines, took the
positive shock mostly in the form of increases in the value of their currencies and not primarily
as increased reserves.




                  Figure 1: Reactions of Asian central banks to 2010 inflows



    Figure 2 shows responses to the “taper tantrum” of May-August 2013, when Federal
Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke announced the intention to begin phasing down US
quantitative easing by the end of the year, which produced an immediate rise in US interest
rates and a reversal of EM capital flows. Again, Singapore mostly intervened while India and
the Philippines mostly took the adverse shock as a change in the exchange rate, that is, a
depreciation.




                                                                                                3
       Figure 2: Reactions of central banks to outflows of May-Aug., 2013, taper tantrum


    Finally, Figure 3 shows responses to the “China tantrum” of May-August 2013. Once again,
Singapore intervened in the foreign exchange market, while the Philippines took the negative
shock more in the form of a depreciation of its currency.

                                                                                               4
     These are just three episodes. But they illustrate how some countries choose to
manage their floats more heavily and others less.

        One supposes that the countries that allowed greater movements in their nominal
exchange rates in response to these positive and negative external shocks also achieved greater
movements in their real exchange rates and may have done so with the intention of mitigating
the effects of the shocks on their balance of payments and real economies. Hong Kong in this
sample is the one economy that is committed to intervening heavily enough to keep its
exchange rate fixed against the dollar, and is willing to give up its monetary independence for
the other advantages that this stability brings (reducing costs to international trade and
investment and providing a credible anchor for monetary policy). So far, so consistent with the
conventional textbook framework.

        But the textbook framework has been challenged. The paper reviews the challenges in
Part 1. Part 2 reviews some of the problems with identifying what exchange rate regime a
country follows in practice and offers some evidence on a set of Asian and other currencies.
Part 3 seeks to determine whether the regime makes a difference for the real exchange rate.
The focus is on three regimes: firm fixing, free floating and, especially, systematically managed
floating.


   1. Four challenges to the conventional wisdom

       The conventional wisdom about the role of regime choices has been assaulted from
several directions. Many of the assaults fall under four rubrics: (a) “the corners hypothesis,” (b)
“dilemma vs. trilemma,” (c) “intervention ineffectiveness” and (d) “exchange rate disconnect.”
We review these four challenges, as a prelude for defending the conventional view.

       a. The corners hypothesis

        Sometimes known as the vanishing intermediate regime, the corners hypothesis is the
claim that in a modern world of high capital mobility, the intermediate regimes are no longer
viable. Countries are forced to choose between free floating, on the one hand, and hard pegs
on the other hand. Hard pegs are exchange rates that are firmly fixed through such institutions
as currency boards, official dollarization or monetary union.

        What are the origins of the corners hypothesis? A precursor is Friedman (1953, p.164):
“In short, the system of occasional changes in temporarily rigid exchange rates seems to me the
worst of two worlds: it provides neither the stability of expectations that a genuinely rigid and
stable exchange rate could provide in a world of unrestricted trade…nor the continuous
sensitivity of a flexible exchange rate.”

                                                                                                    5
        Such intermediate regimes as target zones or bands became popular in the 1980s. The
earliest known reference rejecting them in favor of the firm-fixing and free-floating corners is
by Eichengreen (1994). The context was not emerging markets, but rather the European
exchange rate mechanism (ERM). In the ERM crisis of 1992-1993, Italy, the United Kingdom,
and others were forced to devalue or drop out altogether, and the bands were subsequently
widened substantially so that France could stay in. This crisis suggested to some that the
strategy that had been planned previously—a gradual transition to the EMU, where the width
of the target zone was narrowed in a few steps—might not be the best way to proceed after all.
Crockett (1994) made the same point. Obstfeld and Rogoff (1995) concluded, “A careful
examination of the genesis of speculative attacks suggests that even broad-band systems in the
current EMS style pose difficulties, and that there is little, if any, comfortable middle ground
between floating rates and the adoption by countries of a common currency.” The lesson that
“the best way to cross a chasm is in a single jump” was seemingly borne out subsequently,
when the leap from wide bands to EMU proved successful in 1998–1999.

        In the aftermath of the East Asia crises of 1997–1998, the hypothesis was applied to
emerging markets and was rapidly adopted by the financial establishment as the new
conventional wisdom. Four prominent examples were Council on Foreign Relations (1999),
Fischer (2001), Summers (1999), and Meltzer (2000).2

        But there never was a good theoretical rationale for the corners hypothesis and recent
empirical results have re-asserted the viability of intermediate regimes.
        On the theoretical side, nothing has changed the traditional logic that intermediate
exchange rate regimes deliver an intermediate degree of insulation from foreign shocks in
return for an intermediate degree of nominal exchange rate stability. One example of such an
intermediate regime is the band, which was well-modeled in the target zone literature initiated
by Krugman (1991). Another example is the adjustable peg, which can be modeled as an
escape clause invoked in the event of a sufficiently big shock, as modeled by Obstfeld (1997).
        Or consider a systematically managed float: If the central bank responds to potentially
large inflows by intervening in the foreign exchange market to buy up half of the increased
supply of foreign exchange, allowing the other half of the shock to show up as an increase in
the value of its currency, then it gets half of the exchange rate stability and half of the impact of
the shocks. (It is perhaps surprising that the systematic management has seldom been
formalized. To operationalize “systematically managed floating,” Part 2(b) of this paper
identifies it simply by the condition that there is a high positive correlation between the change
in foreign exchange reserves and the change in the foreign exchange value of the currency.)
These are all counter-examples to the corners hypothesis.

2   Ghosh, Ostry, and Qureshi (2015) offer a more recent empirical evaluation.
                                                                                                    6
       Beyond the normative question as to whether intermediate regimes are advisable is the
evidence from classification schemes on what countries are actually doing. A large and growing
percentage of IMF members continue to choose managed floats and other intermediate
regimes.3 To the author, it seems that the corners hypothesis is dead.4


       b. The challenge to the trilemma

       Traditional textbook theory says that floating exchange rates help insulate small
countries against global financial factors such as foreign monetary conditions, each country
choosing the monetary policy that suits its own economic conditions. “Dilemma, not trilemma”
represents the claim that floating exchange rates do not in fact insulate countries from foreign
shocks and that only capital controls can do that.

     The textbook theory is part of the long-standing principle in international macroeconomics
(often associated with Robert Mundell) that goes by the name of “the Impossible Trinity.” Also
called the “trilemma,” the proposition states that even though a country might wish to have a
fixed exchange rate, highly integrated financial markets, and the ability to set its own monetary
policy, it cannot have all three of these things. The logic is simple. If there are no differences
between the domestic currency and foreign currencies and no barriers to the cross-border
movement of capital, then the domestic interest rate is tied to the world interest rate. The
domestic country loses the ability to set its own interest rate.

      One familiar graphical interpretation of the Impossible Trinity or Trilemma shows the
three desirable characteristics as three sides of a triangle: exchange rate stability, financial
market integration, and monetary independence. Now consider challenges (a) and (b). The
corners hypothesis is the claim that financial integration forces a country to choose between
the firmly-fixed vertex and the free-floating vertex, while the contrary position is that nothing
stops a country from choosing an intermediate point anywhere along the side of the triangle.
The “dilemma” view is very different: the triangle collapses into a single line segment, running

3 E.g., Ghosh, Ostry, and Qureshi (2015). Their “managed float” category has grown to be the
largest category of exchange rate regime, with the proviso: “‘Managed floating’, however, is a
nebulous concept.” (The proviso suggests the utility of defining a regime that we can call
systematically managed floating.) The most recent classification scheme, by Ilzetzki,
Reinhart, Rogoff (2017) again does not support a trend to the corners. The classification
studies are discussed in Part 2 of the paper.
4 The author conducted an unscientific poll of annual samples of IMF staff from 2000 to 2010.

At the start, a substantial majority of participants reported the perception that a belief in the
corners hypothesis was in effect IMF policy. Subsequently the percentage declined and
eventually hit zero.
                                                                                                    7
from “monetary independence via capital controls” to “open capital markets,” with the choice
of exchange rate regime not relevant for monetary independence.5

   This area of research is of particular interest in 2017, a time when the Fed is expected to
continue to pursue a series of increases in US interest rates, which might lead international
investors to pull funds out of emerging countries and trigger new crises as sometimes in the
past.

    Do floating rates in fact insulate countries from foreign interest rates as the traditional
textbook view advertises? Rey (2014) has led a new wave of skepticism on this score.6
She finds that one global factor explains an important part of the variance of a large cross
section of returns of risky assets around the world. This time-varying global factor can be
interpreted as the perceived importance of risk, as reflected in a measure such as the VIX. US
monetary policy is, in turn, a driver of this global factor and of international credit flows and
leverage.

   It is possible that transmission of liquidity and risk effects may invalidate the insulation
proposition. Some say that the power to set independent monetary policy was compromised
when interest rates hit the zero lower bound after 2008. After all, many countries with floating
exchange rates suffered effects of the US-originated Global Financial Crisis. Farhi and Werning
(2014) find theoretically that capital market imperfections may prevent floating rates from
performing the shock absorption role claimed in traditional macroeconomic analysis and that in
such circumstances taxation of capital flows can be welfare-improving.
   To argue that floating rates do not automatically insulate against foreign disturbances is to
take on a straw man, however. Given the importance of international capital flows and other
transmission mechanisms, the claim in favor of floating is not that it automatically gives
complete insulation even when domestic monetary policy remains passive. The claim is, rather,
that it allows the freedom to respond to shocks so as to achieve the desired level of domestic
demand. Indeed there is no shortage of empirical studies finding that floating does help
countries retain an important degree of monetary autonomy.7

5 Complicating matters, some graphical interpretations depict capital controls, firm fixes, and
floating as the three sides of the triangle instead of the three corners. In this case an
intermediate regime, such as half-floating and half-independence, cannot be represented by
identifying a point along the side of the triangle, but is instead described as “rounding the
corners.” (Klein and Shambaugh, 2015.)

            c. The challenge to intervention effectiveness

         Another challenge is the claim that foreign exchange intervention is powerless to affect
nominal exchange rates (unless it is non-sterilized, in which case it is just another kind of
monetary policy), let alone real exchange rates. This view was originally rooted in models in
which the exchange rate was determined by the supply and demand for money; if intervention
was sterilized so as to leave the money supply unchanged, then it had no effect. It was thought
that non-monetary claims against the government did not have an effect on market interest
rates and exchange rates. This was because among advanced countries (the only ones that
floated at the time), financial markets were highly liquid, international capital flows
unencumbered, default risk a non-issue, and government debt perhaps considered rendered
irrelevant by Ricardian equivalence. Uncovered interest parity held because investors were
able to arbitrage away international differences in expected returns. If a European or Japanese
central bank bought dollar bonds, but then sold an equal number of domestic bonds so as to
leave the monetary base unchanged, it was thought to have no effect. The ineffectiveness of
sterilized intervention was accepted not just among most academics but also among many
central bankers.8

       There have long been good arguments on the other side of the debate, including
theories that go back to portfolio balance models, as well as empirical results.9 Foreign
exchange intervention could be effective regardless whether it changed the monetary base.10

         Given experience since the 2008 global financial crisis, it is perhaps puzzling that
sterilized intervention is still often presumed ineffective. Among advanced countries that
experience includes: quantitative easing, where the composition of assets underlying a given
monetary base is thought to make a difference; a surprising relapse to imperfect international
integration of financial markets illustrated by a new failure of covered interest parity, let alone

(2005), Shambaugh (2004), and Frankel, Schmukler and Servén (2004). Han and Wei (2017) find
that flexible exchange rates offer more autonomy when the center country raises interest rates
than when it lowers rates.
8 E.g., Truman (2003).

9  Some studies of the effectiveness of intervention by advanced-country central banks include
Beine, Bénassy-Quéré, and Lecourt (2002), Dominguez (2006), Dominguez, Fatum, and Vacek
(2013), Dominguez and Frankel (1993a,b), Fatum and Hutchison (2003, 2010), Humpage (1999)
Ito (2003), Kearns and Rigobon (2005), and Obstfeld (1990). Surveys include Edison (1993),
Menkhoff (2010), and Sarno and Taylor (2001).
10
    I see the venerable “signaling hypothesis” (Mussa, 1981) as largely a red herring. Why would
a central bank choose such an opaque way of signaling its intentions? What practical difference
does it make whether or not sterilized intervention implies that money supplies will change
some day, if it is in the distant future?
                                                                                                      9
uncovered interest parity; a reversal in the previous trend of diminishing home bias; and the
unexpected loss of full creditworthiness represented by triple-A ratings by the US and some
other major high-income (but high-debt) countries. More than just money matters.

        In any case, if one considers the effectiveness of intervention and managed floating
these days, one is usually looking at Emerging Markets, since far more of them are managed
floaters than was the case before the turn of the century, when they targeted exchange rates,
while the largest industrialized countries have recently ceased foreign exchange intervention
altogether.11 Among Emerging Market countries the failure of interest parity and the impact of
outstanding stocks of government debt are nothing new. Hence the notion that sterilized
intervention can have effects comes more naturally in the case of EM economies.

        Of the recent studies of foreign exchange intervention in EM currencies, most focus on
just one or two countries.12 Fratzscher, Gloede, Menkhoff, Sarno, and Stöhr (2016) manages to
marshal data from an impressive sample of 33 countries. Its conclusions are broadly similar to
those regarding intervention by major central banks in an earlier era. First, intervention can be
effective. Second it tends to be more effective when seeking to move the exchange rate in the
direction of longer-term equilibrium. Third, operations are more likely to be effective when
orally communicated.


            d. Exchange rate disconnect

    The fourth challenge to the conventional view is the “exchange rate disconnect,” which says
that the nominal exchange rate has no implications for real economic factors such as the real
exchange rate, trade, or output. This covers a broad range of papers, from empirical studies to
theoretical models. The empirical studies fail to find correlations between nominal exchange
rates and real variables.13 The theoretical models (including Real Business Cycle models) have
the property that shocks have the same effect on the real exchange rate regardless whether the
currency floats, in which case the shock appears in the nominal exchange rate, or is fixed, in
which case the same shock shows up in price levels instead. The strong claim in this case is
that it doesn’t matter whether foreign exchange intervention is sterilized or not, nor whether it
affects the nominal exchange rate or not: the same real exchange rate emerges regardless.

11 Frankel (2016) relates the G7’s post-millennium renunciation of foreign exchange
intervention.

and Mano (2015), Adler and Tovar (2011), Blanchard, Adler, and de Carvalho Filho (2015),
Daude, Levy-Yeyati and Nagengast (2014), Disyatat and Galati (2007) and the collection
introduced by Mohanty (2013). Menkhoff (2013) surveys the earlier ones.

     2. What countries actually do

  This section of the paper considers the exchange rate regimes that countries follow. Our
empirical focus will ultimately fall on three: firm fixing, free floating, and systematically-
managed floating.


            a. Classification systems

                    i.         De facto vs. de jure

        It is well-established that de facto regimes need not correspond to de jure, that what a
country does in practice often differs from what it says it does officially. To take three cases:
countries that say they fix their exchange rate often in practice adjust it at the first serious sign
of trouble14; countries that say they float often can’t refrain from intervening in the market15;
and countries that say they follow a basket peg often keep the weights secret so that they can
depart from the basket without immediate detection.16 The rampant discrepancies have led to
a collection of studies that attempt to estimate and report the true de facto regimes. 17

         The IMF discontinued reporting the regime claims of its members at face value and
began to offer its own de facto schemes.18 It seems likely, however, that they are still heavily
influenced by the claims of member governments, whereas academic researchers are more
likely to go wherever the data lead them (which is not always the right way, it must be
admitted).

                   ii. Disagreement among de facto classification schemes

        It has become evident that the various de facto classification schemes, though designed
to get at the “true answer,” disagree widely among themselves.19 A table in Frankel (2004)

Mignon (2004), and Levy-Yeyati and Sturzenegger (2001, 2003, 2005). Surveys of the literature

classification only 50.4% of the time, averaging across the three. But they coincided with each
other even less, only 38.6% of the time!20 Similarly, a table in Bénassy-Quéré, et al (2004)
showed three de facto schemes on average correlated .69 with the IMF de jure scheme, but
only .63 with each other. A table in Shambaugh (2007) reported for three de facto schemes an
average of 80 percent agreement with the de jure listings, but only 78 per cent among
themselves. Finally, a table in Klein and Shambaugh (2011) showed that three de facto
schemes coincided with the IMF classification 62 per cent of the time, and coincided with each
other also 62 per cent of the time. All-in-all, the evidence is clear that the evidence of the
classification schemes is not clear.21


                  iii. Reasons for disagreement

        There are three reasons why the classification schemes give such different answers:
differences in estimation techniques or other methodology; murkiness of true regimes; and
frequent changes.

        1. Differences in methodology. Some schemes work off of the official classifications, re-
classifying countries when necessary.22 Other approaches estimate de facto regimes from
observed data alone. Among the latter, some look simply at the volatility of the exchange rate,
without comparing it to the variability of reserves.23 Admittedly, if the variance of the currency
vis-à-vis the dollar or other major currency is essentially zero, that is clear evidence of a fixed
exchange rate. But it does not follow that the flexibility of exchange rate regimes can be
ranked according to the variability of the exchange rate. One should compare the variance of
the exchange rate changes to the variance of reserve changes. Only if the latter is large relative
to the former can the regime be pronounced highly flexible. Otherwise a large exchange rate
variance might in truth be due to large external shocks. Conversely an exchange rate may show
relatively low variability, but this might be due to small shocks rather than a heavily managed
exchange rate. That is the proper inference if foreign exchange reserves are even more stable

20 Correlation of the flexibility rankings of the regimes shows an average of .40 between the
three de facto schemes and the IMF de jure scheme, but a correlation of only .88 among the
three themselves.
21 In all four studies, one of the de facto classification schemes considered is Levy-Yeyati and

Sturzenegger (2001). In Frankel (2004) the other two are Reinhart and Rogoff (2004) and
Ghosh, Gulde and Wolf (2000). In Bénassy-Quéré et al (2004) the other two are their own and
Bubula and Ötker-Robe (2002). In Shambaugh (2007) and Klein and Shambaugh (2011) they
are his own and Reinhart and Rogoff (2004).

or if there is direct evidence of little or no foreign exchange intervention. To take the example
of Figure 1, the Singapore dollar appreciated more in 2010 than the Indian rupee, but this was
apparently because it experienced a bigger shock (measured by total exchange market
pressure), perhaps because it is a smaller more open economy, and not because its regime has
higher flexibility.

        Reinhart (2000) and Calvo and Reinhart (2002) compared exchange rate variability with
reserve variability to show how de facto exchange rate regimes differed from de jure
characterizations. The classification scheme of Levy-Yeyati and Sturzenegger (2001, 2003) is
entirely based on a comparison of the variance of exchange rate changes versus the variance of
reserve changes.

        2. Murky regimes. Relatively few countries follow a single clean regime. Reinhart and
Rogoff (2004), for example, argue that there should be a category of free-falling currencies and
point out that it is misleading to characterize them as floating merely because the changes are
so large. Rose (2011) more generally calls many countries’ regimes neither fixed nor floating,
but “flaky.”

        3. Changeability. For many countries, if they do follow a peg or other clear regime, it is
often not for very long. They tend every few years to change parameters (devaluing, widening
a band, changing weights in a basket, etc.) or to switch regimes altogether. One can cope with
frequent changes by estimating equations for short sub-periods or using the Bai-Perron
econometric technique which allows for endogenous estimation of structural breaks. A country
that follows no systematic regime for longer than a year or two at a time should perhaps be
treated as having no systematic regime at all, joining those in the murky category.




            b. Identifying countries that are systematic managed floaters

         Within the large set of countries that are neither firm fixers nor free floaters, we would
like to try to identify the subset that systematically manage their floats. We are not interested
in the murky regimes. We have no particular hypothesis in their case. By contrast, in the last
part of the paper we have a hypothesis that we want to test for the managed floaters: that
they experience external shocks as accommodating movements in their real exchange rate, to a
greater extent than the firm fixers do, but to a lesser extent than the free floaters.

        How do we identify the systematic managed floaters? We take as a starting point those
that are identified as managed floaters by the IMF or by one of the other classification schemes
such as Ilzetzki, Reinhart and Rogoff (2017). But we have something more specific in mind,
represented by the word “systematic.” We mean that when faced with Exchange Market
                                                                                                13
Pressure, they tend generally to take a particular portion of it in the form of currency
appreciation and the remainder in the form of higher foreign exchange reserves, where the
portion lies somewhere between all (which would be free floating) and nothing (which would
be firm fixing).

        One way to approach the problem is to run a regression of changes in the exchange rate
against Exchange Market Pressure. A coefficient that is significantly greater than zero and
significantly less than one indicates a systematic managed float. We elaborate below, with
updated estimates of the regimes followed by a number of Asian countries.

        A second way to approach the problem is to treat reserve changes rather than exchange
rate changes as the dependent variable. One estimates a central bank reaction function by
running a regression of foreign exchange intervention against the exchange rate. A significant
coefficient implies that the country is a systematic managed floater. We do that for the case of
Turkey (with a focus on two alternative measures of intervention) in the section that follows
the next.

        But there is a problem. Why should intervention be considered the dependent variable
and the exchange rate the independent variable? Or why, on the other hand, should the
exchange rate be considered the independent variable? In truth, aren’t they both endogenous
in the case of a managed float? We also offer a new, third, approach, which makes no
presumption as to causality.




                    i. A simple-minded criterion for systematic managed floaters

        We here propose an amazingly simple-minded test to identify systematic managed
floaters. Whether its crudeness is considered a vice or its elegance is considered a virtue, it at
least has the desirable property of making no presumption about direction of causality.

         The test is to compute for each country the correlation of the change in the foreign
exchange value of the currency (in percent) with the change in reserves (as a percentage of the
monetary base). If the correlation is positive and high enough to clear some threshold, it is
judged a systematic managed floater. At one extreme, a truly fixed exchange rate will show a
correlation of zero, because the exchange rate by definition never changes. At the other
extreme, a purely floating exchange rate will again show a coefficient of zero, because reserves
by definition never change. But it is not just the residents of fixed and floating corners that will
fail to meet this criterion. Most countries that are normally classified as intermediate regimes


                                                                                                  14
will fail the criterion as well, their intervention being much more episodic than that. Only those
that respond to exchange market pressure systematically will show a high positive correlation.24

         A correlation coefficient of 1, hypothetically, would mean that the management of the
float is perfectly systematic. A separate question is how aggressive the management is.
Assume a constant of proportionality φ between percentage exchange rate changes and
percentage reserve changes:
                                         Δs = φ (ΔRes)/MB,                                    (1)
where Δs ≡ the change in the log of the foreign exchange value of the domestic currency;
ΔRes ≡ the change in the central bank’s holdings of foreign exchange reserves;
MB ≡ monetary base; and
φ ≡ the parameter that captures how flexible is the exchange rate regime.
         At one extreme, if the constant φ is zero then the regime in the limit is so heavily
managed that it once again collapses into a peg. At the far extreme, as the constant goes to
infinity, the currency is so lightly managed that in the limit becomes a float. In between, a
finite φ implies an intermediate degree of management, which is what we have in mind. But,
again, the question whether the intervention is systematic (high correlation coefficient) is
independent of the question whether the intervention is aggressive (low φ).

        There is one dimension on which the correlation test may lose its claim to elegance.
That is the question of what is the numeraire currency in which the exchange rate and value of
foreign exchange reserves is measured. We start by using the dollar, which will give the right
answer for many countries. But some countries gauge the value of their currency in terms of
other major countries or a weighted average of trading partners. This obviously needs to be
considered for those that formally declare a role for a basket in their regime, but it is likely true
at an implicit level of others too.

        We can address this problem with alternative approaches such as using the SDR as the
numeraire or experimenting on a case-by-case basis. A well-specified way to estimate the
implicit weights in a currency basket is described in the following section. For the moment we
will be content with the dollar numeraire.

       Table 1 reports the coefficient of correlation between the percentage change in the
foreign exchange value of the domestic currency and the change in foreign exchange reserves,
scaled by the monetary base. The countries with the highest correlation, strongly suggesting

24 We compute the correlation on changes rather than levels, in part to avoid non-stationarity.
One property of working with first differences is that the criterion will not be impaired by a
long-term trend in reserves, if the central bank seeks to build them up, nor by a long-term trend
in the exchange rate. (Such a trend is to be expected under a crawling peg – the “C” in BBC or
Band-Basket-Crawl).
                                                                                                   15
systematic management of their floating currencies, are Singapore, Korea and India. Others
that are also above a threshold of 0.25, and which are thereby also judged to have
systematically managed floats, are Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, Turkey, South Africa, Peru
and Russia. As expected, countries known to have firm pegs have coefficients well below the
threshold, close to or equal to zero: Hong Kong, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, the
United Arab Emirates, and Brunei. Also below the threshold are countries that are thought to
float freely: Australia, Canada, Chile, and New Zealand. In Part 3 of the paper we see whether
these categories make a difference for insulation from external shocks.

                    ii. Estimates of de facto exchange rate regimes for some Asian countries

        Frankel and Wei (1994) ran regressions to estimate weights on the dollar, yen and other
major currencies in the implicit baskets guiding the exchange rates of smaller Asian countries.
At a time when many saw the yen as becoming increasingly important in East Asia, the finding
was that the dollar was still by far the dominant currency in most cases.25 The exercise is a rare
case in which, under the null hypothesis of a true basket peg, the estimation should produce,
not just statistically significant coefficients, but an R2 close to 1.0 . But few countries in Asia or
elsewhere claim to peg to a basket and fewer still actually follow through de facto. At most, a
regression of the local currency value against other major currencies tells us the weights in a
loose anchor around which the exchange rate is allowed to vary.

        Frankel and Wei (2008) synthesized (i) the weight-estimation methodology with (ii) a
technique to estimate the degree of systematic intervention to dampen fluctuations relative to
the basket. This was achieved by adding Exchange Market Pressure (EMP) as another right-
hand side variable along with the values of the major foreign currency. The change in Exchange
Market Pressure is defined as the percentage increase in the foreign exchange value of the
currency plus the increase in foreign exchange reserves (over some denominator such as the
monetary base).26 If β, the coefficient on EMP, is estimated to be close to zero, the regime is a
peg (to the basket, whatever its component or components may be). If β is estimated to be
close to 1, it is a pure float. For most countries, it is in between, suggesting an intermediate
exchange rate regime.
                                 Δ log Ht = c + ∑𝑘𝑗=1(𝑤𝑗 ΔlogXj,t ) + β ΔEMPt + ut              (2)

where H is the value of the home currency i (measured in terms of a numeraire unit, in this case the
SDR); Xj is the value of the dollar, euro, yen, or other foreign currencies j that are candidates for
components of the basket, measured in terms of the same numeraire; and ΔEMP t is Exchange Market

25 Among other similar papers estimating weights were Bénassy-Quéré (1999) and Bénassy-
Quéré, Coeuré, and Mignon (2004). Ogawa (2006) and Frankel and Wei (2009) are among
those who applied the technique to discern China’s exchange rate policy when it moved away
from a dollar peg after 2005. More recently, China’s yuan has itself joined the list of candidate
units in the regression to determine the regimes followed by other Asian countries. E.g.,
Subramanian (2011a, 2011b) claims a rising share for the yuan.
26 Exchange Market Pressure was originally introduced by Girton and Roper (1977). Here we

impose the a priori constraint that a one percentage increase in the foreign exchange value of
the currency and a one percentage increase in the supply of the currency (the change in
reserves as a share of the monetary base) have equal weights, whereas Girton and Roper and
others have normalized by standard deviations.
                                                                                                        17
Pressure ≡ Δlog Ht + (ΔRes)/MB t . The flexibility parameter in equation (2) is directly related to the
lexibility parameter in equation (1):
                                         β = φ / (1+ φ ).

        Frankel and Xie (2010) further refined the Frankel-Wei methodology by adapting the
econometric technique of Bai and Perron (2003) to allow endogenous estimation of structural
break points, so that parameters could change. Appendix Tables 2 and 3 apply the technique to
weekly data from the period 1999-2009 for India and Thailand, which have been candidates for
a basket-basket-crawl (BBC) at some parts of their recent history. The equations are estimated
in rate of change form, to eliminate non-stationarity. Both for Thailand and for India the
estimate for β, the coefficient on EMP, was significant greater than zero but significantly less
than 1, suggesting systematic managed floating. For Thailand, the weight on the dollar moved
in the range .6 to .8, with the remaining weight falling on the euro and yen. For India, the
weight on the dollar went as high as .9 in the early 2000s.

        Even though we label them “systematic,” it is noteworthy that there are several
structural breaks in the parameters. For Thailand the flexibility parameter β is significantly
greater than zero and less than 1 for all four time sub-periods within 1999-2009, suggesting
relatively consistent behavior. For India, the same is true of the parameter in four out of six
sub-periods, but it is insignificantly different from zero in two out of six.

        Similar estimates from the period 1999-2009 for seven other Asian currencies are
reported in an on-line Appendix, with structural breaks again identified by the week. Singapore,
the Philippines, and South Korea show managed floats throughout the period. The technique
shows China starting to qualify as a managed float in 2006. For Malaysia we cannot reject free
floating in 1999 or fixing in 2000-05 and 2008-09, but the ringgit shows a managed float in
between. For Indonesia we cannot reject free floating in 2001-02, but the rupiah shows
managed floating thereafter. Turkey shows variable behavior during 1999-2000 but managed
floating starts in 2001.

        Next we update the estimates to 2017, for four of the Asian currencies that are of most
interest. Again, the technique allows estimation of the weights in the implicit basket that the
authorities treat as the anchor or reference rate (as in Frankel and Wei, 1994), while also
estimating the parameter that calibrates the degree of exchange rate flexibility relative to that
basket (as in Frankel and Wei, 2008) and estimating endogenously possible structural breaks in
any of these parameters (as in Frankel and Xie, 2010). The data set runs from 1999 to 2017.
The exchange rate observations are daily, which requires interpolation of the components of
monthly reserve data to compute the EMP variable.




                                                                                                          18
    The updated results are shown in Tables 2.1-2.4. All four currencies qualify for systematic
managed floats, if one overlooks the many small structural breaks in the parameters. (We use a
.01 significance level for defining a structural break.) For Singapore the flexibility parameter
appears higher during March 2013 – February 2017 than it did before, above .7. For Korea, the
estimated flexibility parameter has risen over time, from 0.7 to 0.9. For India, the flexibility
parameter appears higher during November 2008 – February 2017 than earlier, well above .9.

    For China the managed float starts in July 2005. In recent years the estimated weight on
the dollar has declined from 0.9 to 0.5. The flexibility parameter appears quite high during the
period August 2010-April 2017: above 0.9. One might suspect that this is a sign of asymmetric
response by the Chinese authorities to recent outflows and depreciation, as compared to the
earlier period of inflows and appreciation. But in fact the parameter changes on the post-2014
downside do not particularly run in that direction. The value of the RMB in terms of dollars
peaked in January 2014. Since that date, net capital outflows have mostly been pushing in the
opposite direction from the preceding 10 years. Holdings of foreign exchange reserves by the
People’s Bank of China peaked in June 2014, at $4.0 trillion, and went down by almost a trillion
dollars subsequently.

   Singapore’s basket has allotted a significant weight to China’s RMB during the period since
January 2008, at the expense of the US dollar. The heavy weight on the euro and the smaller
weight on the yen both remain undiminished.

    The Korean won also has put significant weight on the RMB since August 2005. There is no
sign of RMB influence for India, where the weights have been roughly steady: 0.5 on the dollar,
0.3 on the euro, and weights of 0.1 on both the Japanese yen and the British pound.

               We hope to extend this research further -- Frankel and Xie (2017) -- by incorporating
       estimation of a possible target zone, appropriate for a country that might be following a band
       or target zone, perhaps together with a basket. The target zone is incorporated into the
       equation by means of the Threshold Autoregression Technique.

            c. How do these analyses depend on the use of intervention data versus reserve
               changes? The case of Turkey

       It is easy enough to write down in theory that the magnitude of foreign exchange
intervention equals the change in reserves. Many central banks do not report data on foreign
exchange intervention operations, as opposed to data on reserves. For this reason, although
empirical research on foreign exchange intervention per se usually focuses on the few countries
and time samples where the data are available, the literature on exchange rate regimes often
uses data on monthly changes in reserves, which are reported by almost all countries.

        In practice, data on intervention, even when explicitly reported, tend to look very
different from data on changes in foreign exchange reserves. In this section we seek to shed
light on the question how much difference it makes whether one uses data on intervention or
foreign exchange intervention, when assessing whether a country follows a systematically
managed float.

         There are two obvious reasons to expect the data on foreign exchange intervention to
differ from the data on changes in foreign exchange reserves, reasons why reserves will change
even if there has been no intervention. The first is that interest accrues on the central bank’s
holdings of US treasury bills and other assets held as foreign exchange reserves. The second is
the valuation effect: If the value of reserves is measured in terms of domestic currency, it will
change every time the exchange rate changes.

        Even when the monetary authority does not report the value of reserves in terms of
foreign currency, if all the reserves are known to be held in US treasury bills the researcher can
use the monthly exchange rate to infer how much of a reported change in reserves is due to the
pure valuation effect. But most central banks hold at least some of their reserves in other
assets and few if any accommodate researchers by reporting the currency composition.
Furthermore it has become more common in recent years for central banks to diversify out of
US treasury bills, not just into other non-US currencies but also into other securities, such as
longer-term bonds and even equities in some cases. This exacerbates each of the two
measurement problems: earnings on the reserves are generally higher on these alternate
assets than on US treasury bills, and valuation effects now include capital gains and losses on
securities beyond just exchange rate changes.

        When one looks into the data one always finds a variety of further complications, some
of which suggest that what counts as intervention is not just an issue of having access to the
right data, but can be an issue of conceptual interpretation too. To take an example, some
developing countries have official agencies that sell the country’s commodity exports for

                                                                                               25
dollars. If the agency chooses to hold the dollars (e.g., in a sovereign wealth fund), rather than
exchange them for the local currency, does that count as foreign exchange intervention or as
the absence of foreign exchange intervention? Something analogous apparently holds in the
case of Turkey, a country to which we are about to turn: an official agency holds dollars for the
purpose of importing oil.

       We turn to Turkey because it is one of the only managed floaters that also regularly
makes public its data on foreign exchange intervention. Most countries only publish monthly
data on foreign exchange reserves.

        We want to see how much difference it makes when studying the central bank’s
behavior with respect to the foreign exchange market whether one uses intervention data or
reserve changes. We know that the two series will differ. But, in the context of classifying
countries by exchange rate regime, we want to be able to distinguish within the broad class of
floaters those that systematically manage their floats, versus those that float freely or only
intervene unsystematically. To do that, we want to get an idea whether it makes a difference
whether one uses the reserve data versus the intervention data.

        It might be natural to think of the exercise as seeing whether the commonly available
reserve data give the “right answer” represented by the more rarely available intervention
data. But one could argue, in the context of classifying exchange rate regimes, that the foreign
exchange reserves have at least as much a claim to being the right measure as intervention
data. Recall the framework for thinking about the continuum of fixed versus flexible exchange
rates that goes under the name of Exchange Market Pressure. Exchange Market Pressure
(EMP) is defined as a weighted average of the percentage change in the foreign exchange value
of the currency and the change in foreign exchange reserves (where the weight on foreign
exchange reserves might variously be defined as the inverse of the monetary base, as the
inverse relative standard deviation, or as an endogenously estimated parameter). EMP
represents the increase in demand for domestic currency versus foreign currency. It is up to
the central bank whether to allow exchange market pressure (EMP) to show up entirely in the
form an appreciation of the currency, which is floating; or entirely as an increase in foreign
exchange reserves, which is fixing; or somewhere in between. If it consistently acts to absorb
some share between zero and one in the exchange rate and the remainder in reserves, then we
deem it to be a systematically-managed floater. For this purpose, it is the change in reserves
that matters, not intervention normally defined. Again, if reserves rise because of interest
earned on US Treasury bills, that is not considered foreign exchange intervention, but may be
relevant nonetheless.

        Others have studied the Turkish intervention data. Basu and Varoudakis (2013) find a
clear reaction function that shows systematic management of the floating lira: Turkish

                                                                                                 26
intervention responds to the level of the exchange rate (nominal effective), as is visible in Figure
4, borrowed from their paper. Frömmel and Midiliç (2016) similarly find statistically significant
reaction of intervention to the level of the exchange rate relative to a trend (medium run
moving average), but no reaction to the recent rate of change of the exchange rate. Their main
focus is on an additional variable, the level of foreign exchange reserves relative to GDP. They
find that it is a significant determinant of Turkish intervention. They also identify several
significant structural breaks in the reaction function.

       As they explain, the monetary authority, the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey,
undertakes two different modes of foreign exchange intervention: occasional auctions and
regular market operations. On many days, the number for the auction is zero. We add the two
together to get the measure of intervention. The series is still jagged because of the auctions.
Thus we smooth out the data a bit, by looking at monthly averages or other moving averages,
as other studies have done.




       Figure 4: Turkey’s systematic management of its float (from Basu and Varoudakis, 2013)


        Figure 5 graphs the two different measures of intervention, along with various measures
of the exchange rate. The two measures look quite different, as expected, but are highly
correlated.



                                                                                                  27
         Figure 5: Foreign Exchange Actions by Turkey: Intervention Data vs. Reserve Changes


        Several hypotheses are tested for the central bank reaction function. A particular sort
of systematic behavior is flow intervention that seeks to drive the exchange rate in the
direction of its long run equilibrium. This means buying foreign currency when the price of
foreign currency, which is the exchange rate, is low (the value of the domestic currency is high),
measured relative to either a long-run average or a long-run trend, and selling foreign currency
when the price of foreign currency is high (the value of the domestic currency is low). But an
alternative is “leaning against the wind,” which is usually interpreted as intervention that
opposes the most recent direction of movement of the exchange rate, as opposed to its level.
A third relevant variable is the level of reserves. Research on reserve holdings features the
hypothesis that central banks have a target level of reserves28, held for precautionary purposes,
and that the motivation for intervention behavior is not just to affect the exchange rate but also
to move reserves in the direction of the target level. There has been some evidence in favor of
this hypothesis, particularly since the currency crises of the 1990s and particularly in the case of
Turkey (Frömmel and Midiliç, 2016, as noted). A fourth relevant variable is the inflation rate,
under the hypothesis that, in an inflation targeting country, central bank operations in the
foreign exchange market are among the tools that are motivated by an effort to push the
inflation rate in the direction of its target.




28References on central bank’s desired reserve holdings include Jeanne and Rancière (2011)
and Rodrik (2006),
                                                                                                 28
       The full equation is thus:

FX acquisition = γ + α (s t – strend) + ß (s t – s t-1) + δ (Res /GDP)t + ψ (inflation – target)

The dependent variable, “Acquisition of foreign exchange,” is measured either by the data on
foreign exchange intervention or by changes in foreign exchange reserves.

        Regression results are reported in Table 3. Several conclusions emerge. When the rate
of change variable is included on its own (Table 3.1), to test for “leaning against the wind,” it is
highly significant regardless whether the dependent variable is measured by intervention or
changes in reserves. When the level of the exchange rate is included on its own (Table 3.2), it is
highly significant for explaining Intervention and borderline-significant for explaining reserve
changes. When both variables are included at the same time, there is evidence in favor of both
(Table 3.3). When the central bank’s behavior is judged by the intervention data, both the level
and rate of change variables are significant. When it is judged by reserve changes, the rate of
change variable is highly significant but the level variable is at best borderline-significant.

        When the ratio of reserves/GDP is included to test the hypothesis of a target level (Table
3.3), the intervention data give strong support: the effect is negative and significant, thus
suggesting that the authorities are more likely to add to their reserves when the level is low.
The effect is not evident when central bank behavior is measured by the change in reserves,
rather than the intervention data. Estimates for sub-periods are reported in the on-line
appendix table (Sheets 7 and 8).

        We find no evidence for the inflation targeting hypothesis: Neither intervention nor
changes in reserves appear to respond significantly to the level of inflation measured relative to
its target. This finding is of interest since Turkey is supposedly an inflation-targeter. We
omitted the inflation results from the equation estimates reported in table 3, but they are
included in the on-line appendix (Sheet 10).

        To conclude, we get slightly different answers when we use intervention data to
investigate the reaction function of the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey from the
answers when we use data on reserve changes. But in both cases, qualitatively, we find
evidence of a systematic effort to dampen volatility of the exchange rate.




     3. Effects of external shocks

    Do countries that systematically and aggressively manage their floats succeed in dampening
fluctuations in the real exchange rate? Or is the exchange rate regime a mirage, as some claim?

    Of course there is already quite a lot of evidence that exchange rate regimes make a
difference, that a regime that allows bigger changes in the nominal exchange rate will thereby
allow bigger changes to the real exchange rate.29

    A number of recent papers look at capital inflows to emerging markets, often gross capital
inflows, and study the response of the local monetary authorities, including with respect to
exchange rate flexibility.30 We focus on the overall balance of payments instead of gross capital
inflows. For one thing, the distinction between an increase in foreign assets in the domestic
country and a decrease in foreign liabilities can be arbitrary, not just in an accounting sense but
even conceptually, especially when it comes to banking flows. For another thing, a positive
external commodity shock is often reflected in both a trade surplus and a capital account
surplus.

    The only way to solve the endogeneity problem is to use a truly exogenous variable like US
interest rates, the VIX, or dollar commodity prices. The severely endogenous nature of the
capital inflows or overall balance of payments is widely recognized: If the authorities choose to
respond to a positive shock by allowing the currency to appreciate, that may operate to shut off
the inflow. If one has such an exogenous variable, there is a strong case for putting it directly
on the right-hand side of an OLS equation. This is especially clear when the country is a pure
floater, as Australia and New Zealand in our sample, in which case the comprehensive
aggregate measure of inflows, i.e., the balance of payments, should be zero by definition of
floating.


29Convincing empirical results from different approaches include Mussa (1986), Taylor (2002),
and Bahmani-Oskooee, Hegerty and Kutan (2008). The reasons why the exchange rate regime
makes a difference can come from imperfect goods markets.

Adler, and de Carvalho Filho (2015), and Blanchard, Ostry, Ghosh, and Chamon (2016).
                                                                                                31
             a. Effects on the real exchange rate

         The core exercise of the paper is to test the effects of exogenous external shocks on the
     real exchange rate, using time series for a select set of countries, and then to see if the
     sensitivity to shocks is different according to the country’s exchange rate regime. The null
     hypothesis is that the regime makes no difference: that a shock will have the same effect on
     the real exchange rate regardless whether the nominal exchange rate is fixed, in which case
     it must show up in the price level, or floating, in which case it shows up directly in the
     nominal exchange rate. The alternative hypothesis is that shocks have a bigger effect on
     the real exchange rate under floating than under managed floating and a bigger effect
     under managed floating than under fixing.

          It is crucial for this exercise that the measured shocks are truly and credibly exogenous
     on their face. We focus on two measures: dollar commodity prices and the VIX.31 The VIX
     is a measure of market perceptions of near-term volatility extracted from put and call
     options on the US S&P 200 stock index and traded on the Chicago Board of Exchange.

          For the tests where commodity prices are taken to be the main exogenous variable, we
     restrict the sample to countries where a high percentage of exports is concentrated in a
     small number of commodities (energy, mineral or agricultural). For some, particularly oil
     exporters, that is a single commodity; for others it is several commodities. We construct a
     tailor-made monthly price index for each country by computing weights as the average
     commodity shares in exports during the sample period and then multiplying them by
     monthly dollar prices of the corresponding commodities. (The data appendix gives details.)

         We do not want to attempt a comprehensive study of all countries.32 For one thing, we
     seek only those with compelling measures of exogenous external shocks [to be used either
     as instrumental variables or directly as independent variables In the real exchange rate
     regressions]. That narrows down the set of countries. We have good reason to think that
     commodity prices are important to commodity producing countries. Beyond the simple
     evidence of the share of the commodities in the countries’ output, a number of empirical

31
   Other possible measures of exogenous shocks include a broader measure of financial risk
perceptions, US interest rates, and (for some countries) natural disasters. We tried the Global
Economic Policy Uncertainty, but it did not add any explanatory power beyond the VIX. We use
dollar prices of the country’s export commodities rather than a more comprehensive measure
of its terms of trade because the former is plausibly exogenous (except perhaps for Saudi
Arabia) as in the small open economy model, whereas measures of the terms of trade are in
practice likely to be endogenous with respect to the nominal exchange rate.
32
   We may eventually try a panel study within our set of countries.
                                                                                                 32
     papers have confirmed that when the currencies of commodity-producing countries are
     allowed to float, they tend to rise and fall with the global prices of the commodities. 33

         A number of other studies have found that countries that export volatile-price
     commodities perform better with floating or managed floating exchange rates than with
     fixed rates,34 which leads us to anticipate that the exchange rate regime will indeed make a
     difference.

         Commodities are not as important for most Asian countries as for most in Latin America,
     Africa or the Middle East. (Commodities used to be very important in Southeast Asia, but
     have been somewhat displaced by manufactures in most of the region.) For Asian countries
     we can use the VIX. Many studies have found that the VIX, reflecting the risk-sensitivity of
     global investors along the “risk-on” vs. “risk-off” spectrum, is an important determinant of
     EM capital flows and, especially, of Emerging Market exchange rates and securities prices. 35

         Another dimension along which we seek deliberately to narrow down the set of
     countries is by the clarity of the exchange rate regime and the length of time that the
     country has maintained it. We are especially interested in those that have firm pegs and
     those that are good candidates for either systematically managed floating or free floating.
     (We recognize that very few fall in the latter category, among developing countries.) To
     make the first cut -- identifying firm pegs and a group of floaters broadly defined -- we rely
     on standard classification schemes, particularly the most recent from Ilzetzki, Reinhart and
     Rogoff (2017). We deliberately drop those countries that change regimes every couple of
     years or have no clear regime at all, such as the free-fallers of Reinhart and Rogoff. But we
     wish to use our own criteria to distinguish countries that float freely (or virtually freely),
     such as New Zealand, and those that systematically manage their floats, such as Turkey. We
     want to omit those that intervene irregularly and unsystematically.

and Rey (2015) trace these fluctuations in the global financial environment to changes in US
monetary policy. Chari, Stedman and Lundblad (2017) find that the shocks do not show up in
the quantity of capital flow so much as they drive EM asset prices.

                                                                                                  33
            b. Estimates for some Asian countries

        We start with a set of eight Asian economies that are not primarily commodity-
exporters for the period January 1997-December 2015. Regression results are reported in
Appendix A. A few Asia/Pacific countries that are commodity producers will be considered
below, where the sample will also have the advantage of several pure floaters and a number of
firm fixers.

         We start in Table A1 with an OLS regression of the real exchange rate directly against
our external shock measure for the non-commodity countries: log (VIX). Because of the highly
autoregressive nature of the real exchange rate, we include a lagged endogenous variable,
without which apparent significant levels would be spuriously high.36 Even so, the VIX is
statistically significant, with the hypothesized negative effect on the real exchange rate, defined
here as the value of the local currency: An adverse shock in global financial market conditions
causes a real depreciation. That is, we get the hypothesized negative effect for these 7
countries, all of which can be classified as systematic managed floaters: India, Korea, Malaysia,
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Turkey. (The strongest effects are shown for Korea,
followed by the Philippines, Thailand and Turkey.)

        The one economy for which the coefficient is neither negative nor significant is precisely
the one economy for which that is the hypothesis. Hong Kong, which has a firm peg to the
dollar, shows no effect. To find no effect on the nominal exchange rate would tell us little.
Finding zero effect on the real exchange rate confirms that regimes do matter for real variables,
and that a peg prevents the real depreciation that the seven flexible-rate currencies experience.

     Table A2 regresses the Real Exchange Rate for the Asian countries against the balance of
payments (measured as the change in foreign exchange reserves) as a ratio to GDP (expressed


36 The estimated coefficients on the lagged Real Exchange Rate are all high, as expected. Some
appear statistically less than 1.0, some do not. A statistical failure to reject 1 is usually
considered evidence of a unit root in the real exchange rate. If the real exchange rate truly has
a unit root, then the equation should be estimated in first differences, or using more
sophisticated time series techniques. Many studies have documented on long time samples
that real exchange rates in truth have a tendency to regress slowly to an equilibrium level
(represented by an average or trend), but that 20 years of data nevertheless do not have
enough statistical power to reject a random walk. There is a trade-off between the danger of
spurious results on the one hand and the danger of throwing out perfectly good information on
the other hand. Standard practice is that one should err on the side of rooting out unit roots
(though the author is not aware of what research supports the general presumption that this is
the greater danger). We hope in the future to refine the results in this paper with a more
sophisticated time series approach.
                                                                                                34
in common currency units).37 We still think of log (VIX) as the driving exogenous shock, but now
it is the instrumental variable for the balance of payments. The estimated coefficients are now
positive in every case, as they should be: a balance of payments surplus (resulting from a fall in
the VIX) shows up in part as an appreciation of the local currency. However most of the
coefficients now lose their statistical significance. Only in Korea and Turkey are the effects on
the real exchange rate still highly significant statistically. The problem may lie in a weak first-
stage instrument (especially in cases such as the Philippines and Thailand, judging by first-stage
F-statistics.)


            c.   Estimates for commodity-exporting countries

       Next we turn to estimates for a set of 21 commodity-exporting countries, reported in
Appendix Table B. We have reason to hope that the exogenous variable will be a stronger
instrument here, especially since we compute for each country an index of international
commodity prices that is tailor-made to correspond to the commodity composition of its
exports.

        Table B1 reports the OLS regressions of the real exchange rate against the individual
commodity price indices. The set of 21 includes three pure floaters: Australia, Canada and New
Zealand. All three show highly significant effects on their real exchange rates, confirming their
role as “commodity currencies.” Chile also floated during much of this period, but not all,
which may explain why its coefficient is only of borderline significance.

        Of the countries that show no significant effect, four are firm fixers as one would
expect: Ecuador, the UAE, Bahrain and Qatar (all pegged to the dollar). But South Africa also
shows no significant effects here even though it is a systematic managed floaters by our
criteria, while Brunei and Saudi Arabia show significant effects even though they are firm
peggers (to the Singapore dollar and the US dollar, respectively).38

         For Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and the rest of the 8 countries
with managed floats or other intermediate regimes, the effect of the commodity price is
statistically significant and positive.




37 Now the lagged Real Exchange Rate shows estimated coefficients that are very close to 1.0.
Thus one might think of the equation as essentially regressing the change in the real exchange
rate against the change in reserves.
38
   Brunei sometimes shows a significant positive effect, contrary to the hypothesis for a pegger.
But this is probably because it is pegged to Singapore, which is a sort of managed floater.
                                                                                                35
        Since many of these countries not only export commodities but also participate in
international financial markets and thus qualify as emerging markets, Table B2 adds the VIX as
an additional regressor. The results for the commodity price coefficient are similar. The VIX
shows up with a significant RER effect for a few countries, all of them floaters. It is (just)
significant for Colombia, one of the commodity-exporting intermediate-regime countries that
did not show a significant responsiveness of the real exchange rate in Table B1.

        Next we consider the regressions of the real exchange rate against the balance of
payments, with both the country-specific commodity price index and the VIX as instrumental
variables. We need a denominator for the balance of payments. We start with GDP in Table
B3, which is perhaps the most obvious scale variable. But in Tables B4 and B5 we use M1 and
the monetary base, respectively, as the denominator for the change in reserves, thereby linking
up with the idea of Exchange Market Pressure.39

        We want to distinguish the results for managed floaters as compared to firm fixers. The
three free floaters (Australia, Canada and New Zealand) have been discarded, since floating
implies by definition that the balance of payments is zero. Five managed floaters show
significant effects on the real exchange rate in these three tables: Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Russia
and South Africa. Two firm fixers show insignificant effects, again as hypothesized: Brunei and
Ecuador.

      Some show the anomalous result of a significant negative coefficient. In the case of a
systematic managed floater like Peru, the result is indeed anomalous

       An explanation is available why the coefficient estimates are negative for many of the
Gulf countries and significantly so in the case of Saudi Arabia. 40 For these countries, the export
commodity basket index consists simply of the dollar price of oil (or oil and natural gas). Even
though oil and gas are priced and invoiced in dollars, the dollar price of oil falls quickly after an
appreciation of the dollar against the euro, yen and other major currencies – as one would
expect since Europe and Japan are major buyers of oil and gas. Bahrain, Qatar, the UAE and
Saudi Arabia are all pegged specifically to the dollar. When the dollar appreciates against the
euro, yen and other currencies, so do the dinar, dirham, and riyal. The implication is a negative
correlation between the trade-weighted exchange rate, which is the one that goes into the

39 When a country is missing from a table, it is due to data availability. See on-line data
appendix.
40
   There is a second possible explanation for anomalous results in the case of Saudi Arabia. It
alone among all the commodity producers is large enough in the world market for its export
commodity, oil, that we might want to question the assumption that the world price is
exogenous. But the first reason seems a good enough explanation.

                                                                                                  36
regressions, and the dollar price of oil. This suggests that the dollar peg does worse than fail to
accommodate terms of trade shocks; it actually tends to move in the wrong direction. (The Gulf
countries might be better off pegging to a more sophisticated basket.)41

        Perhaps something like this explanation also applies to Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, since
both are oil exporters. But these two are neither firm fixers nor managed floaters. Both of
them have in recent years repeatedly tried to target their exchange rates and then been forced
belatedly into large devaluations by alarming reserve losses. In this paper we are concerned
with the three special categories of firm fixers, free floaters and systematically-managed
floaters. We have no hypothesis regarding those that fall outside these three categories.


              d. Summary of conclusions

        A majority of countries follow exchange rate policies that can be designated as
“intermediate,” in that they are neither firm-fixers nor free-floaters. But this paper proposes
the designation “systematically managed floater” only for those countries where the monetary
authorities tend consistently to react to exchange market pressure with some proportion of
change in the exchange rate and some proportion of change in foreign exchange reserves. A
sub-set of the intermediate regimes can be identified as meeting statistical criteria along the
lines of this definition (Part 2 of the paper).

        In some theories, shocks will have the same effect on the real exchange rate regardless
of regime, showing up in the exchange rate under floating but showing up in the price level if
the exchange rate is fixed. A hypothesis of the paper is that exchange rate regimes do make a
difference for the behavior of the real exchange rate. Specifically, an exogenous positive shock
does not affect the real exchange rate in the short run if the nominal exchange rate is fixed, but
will cause a real appreciation under a systematic managed float, with the magnitude of the real
appreciation depending on how heavily managed is the float.

       Our empirical tests focus on two kinds of shocks, measured by the VIX and export
commodity prices. We have not attempted a comprehensive panel study. There are many
reasons to view the various statistical results of this paper as rudimentary, particularly with
respect to the familiar problems of causality and non-stationarity.

          But some of the results in Part 3 of the paper tend to support the hypothesis:

     Most EM economies with firmly fixed exchange rates do not experience real appreciation
      during periods of inflow arising from positive external shocks, such as 2003-08 or 2010-11,


41   Frankel (2017).
                                                                                                  37
    nor do they experience real depreciation during periods of outflow arising from negative
    external shocks such as 2008-09 or 2014-15. Of the firm-fixers, the case where the primary
    exogenous variable is the VIX is Hong Kong. The firm-fixers where it is the export
    commodity price include Ecuador and the Gulf countries.
   For our free-floating commodity exporters – Australia, Canada and New Zealand – positive
    shocks in their country-specific export commodity price index cause real appreciation of
    their currencies.
   For our systematic managed floaters in Asia, particularly Korea and Turkey, a fall in the VIX
    leads to real appreciation, regardless of whether observed directly (OLS) or indirectly via the
    balance of payments surplus (IV). For the others -- India, Malaysia, the Philippines,
    Singapore and Thailand -- -- the effect is statistically significant only when observed directly.
   For our commodity exporting managed floaters, the effects vary, but are significantly
    greater than zero more often than among the firm fixers and less often than the free
    floaters.

    In short, we reject the view that exchange rate regimes make no difference. We find that
positive external shocks tend to cause real appreciation for most systematic managed-floaters;
more strongly so for pure floaters; and not at all for most firm peggers.
