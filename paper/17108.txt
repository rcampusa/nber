                                           ABSTRACT

We examine financial literacy in the United States using the new National Financial Capability Study,
wherein we demonstrate that financial literacy is particularly low among the young, women, and the
less-educated. Moreover, Hispanics and African-Americans score the least well on financial literacy
concepts. Interestingly, all groups rate themselves as rather well-informed about financial matters,
notwithstanding their actual performance on the key literacy questions. Finally, we show that people
who score higher on the financial literacy questions are also much more likely to plan for retirement,
which is likely to leave them better positioned for old-age. Our results will inform those seeking to
target financial literacy programs to those in most need.

Introduction

       Individuals and their families are increasingly taking on responsibility for securing their

own financial wellbeing in retirement in the United States and around the world. Prior to the

1980s, many U.S. workers relied mainly on Social Security and employer-sponsored defined

benefit (DB) pension plans. Today, by contrast, Baby Boomers are increasingly turning to

defined contribution (DC) plans and Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) to help finance their

golden years. Indeed, in 1980, about 40% of private-sector pension contributions went to DC

plans; 20 years later, almost 90% of such contributions went to personal accounts (mostly 401(k)

plans; Poterba, Venti and Wise, 2008). The transition to the DC retirement saving model has the

advantage of permitting more worker flexibility and labor mobility than in the past, yet it also

imposes on employees a greater responsibility to save, invest, and decumulate their retirement

wealth sensibly. Furthermore, the spread of DC plans means that workers today are directly and

immediately exposed to financial market risks, a reality that was less evident in the old DB

system. And as many DB plans have been frozen or terminated, the individually-managed model

will increasingly become the mainstay of retirement.

       For this reason, individuals will increasingly be called to “roll their own” retirement

saving and decumulation plans, and their retirement security will depend ever more on individual

decisions. This paper investigates the extent to which Americans are equipped to make decisions

in this new pension and financial landscape, and in particular, whether they are sufficiently

knowledgeable about economics and finance to plan for retirement. Our goal is to focus on

financial literacy, by which we mean the ability to do some simple calculations and knowledge
                                                                                                                      2




of some fundamental financial concepts. 1 The analysis is facilitated by a new U.S. dataset

known as the 2009 National Survey of 1,488 American adults collected as part of the National

Financial Capability Study (described in more detail below). 2 We show that a large majority of

Americans fails to understand critical financial concepts including interest compounding,

inflation, and risk diversification, and these shortcomings are most acute for women, the less-

educated, and older individuals. Moreover, many people have failed to plan for retirement, even

when this life event looms only five to ten years off. This is critical since, as we have shown

elsewhere, lack of retirement planning translates into low levels of retirement wealth

accumulation (Lusardi and Mitchell 2007a, 2008a, 2009, 2011). As the National Commission on

Fiscal Responsibility and Reform (2010: 53) recently argued, it is key to provide “better

information to the public on the full implications of various retirement decisions, with an eye

toward encouraging delayed retirement and enhanced levels of retirement savings.” Yet if people

are unable to make sense of this information when provided, the messages may fall on deaf ears.3

         In what follows, we first offer an overview of the new dataset used in the analysis. We

then describe the key questions on financial literacy and retirement planning and provide a

multivariate analysis linking these two. A final section concludes.

Data Overview and Summary Statistics

         The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) Investor Education Foundation,

undertook a detailed telephone survey in 2009 known as the National Financial Capability Study,

1
  See Behrman et al. (2010) and Lusardi (2010). The alternative term financial capability is often used by U.K.
regulators (c.f. Atkinson et al. 2007).
2
  The FINRA Investor Education Foundation collaborated with the U.S. Department of the Treasury to design and
field the survey, described at http://www.finrafoundation.org/resources/research/p120478; see also Lusardi (2010).
3
  The problem of financial illiteracy and lack of retirement planning is now salient in several other countries as well,
and the awareness has driven data collection efforts in at least 20 nations. The United Kingdom fielded a survey on
financial capability in 2005, and similar efforts have underway in New Zealand, Australia, Ireland, Canada, and the
Netherlands (Atkinson et al. 2006, 2007). New Zealand, about which more is provided in Crossan et al. (2011), is
one of the few countries to have a panel survey affording new information over a three-year span.
                                                                                                                    3




with the purpose of benchmarking key indicators of financial capability and linking these

indicators to demographic, behavioral, attitudinal, and financial literacy characteristics. About

1,500 American adults were contacted by telephone; the primary sample of 1,200 respondents

was constructed to be representative of the general adult U.S. population. 4 Since financial

capability is multidimensional, several indicators were collected. Consistent with surveys from

other countries, the National Survey explored how people manage their resources and make

financial decisions, what skill sets they use in making such decisions, and how they search for

and glean information when making those decisions. In the present paper, we focus on two main

areas of financial capability, namely financial literacy and self-assessed skills, and retirement

planning. We outline key findings next.

Findings Regarding Financial Literacy.                   To evaluate Americans’ financial knowledge,

respondents were asked three questions covering fundamental concepts of economics and

finance, expressed as they would be in everyday transactions, such as simple calculations about

interest rates and inflation and the workings of risk diversification. 5 The exact wording of

questions is as follows:

1) Suppose you had $100 in a savings account and the interest rate was 2% per year. After 5
years, how much do you think you would have in the account if you left the money to grow?
           More than $102
           Exactly $102
           Less than $102
           Do not know
           Refuse to answer

 2) Imagine that the interest rate on your savings account was 1% per year and inflation was 2%
per year. After 1 year, how much would you be able to buy with the money in this account?
           More than today
           Exactly the same

4
  To ensure representativeness, African-Americans, Hispanics, Asian-Americans, and adults with less than a high
school education were oversampled.
5
  These questions were first used by Lusardi and Mitchell (2011) in their analysis of older Americans in the 2004
Health and Retirement Study.
                                                                                                                     4




             Less than today
             Do not know
             Refuse to answer

3) Please tell me whether this statement is true or false. “Buying a single company’s stock
usually provides a safer return than a stock mutual fund.”
       True
       False
       Do not know
       Refuse to answer

The first two questions indicate whether respondents have command of the economic concepts

most fundamentally related to saving. The third question evaluates knowledge of risk

diversification, crucial to the making of informed investment decisions.6

         Summary statistics to these questions appear in Table 1. Panel A shows that some 65

percent of the respondents can correctly answer the question about interest rates. This is a

discouragingly low number, given the question’s simplicity and the fact that respondents did not

have to make a calculation but could merely select from a set of answers. The proportion rises a

bit for respondents age 25-65, but not much. Only 64 percent of respondents get the inflation

question right. Around 20 percent of respondents gets this question wrong, and another 14

percent cannot answer the question (Panel B). While more of the 25-65 age bracket get the

answers right, still over 20 percent are incorrect and 12 percent state they do not know. The third

question, on risk diversification, gives respondents the most difficulty: only about half of this

representative sample of the US population gets it right, while around a third cannot answer

(Panel C). Even among the prime age group (25-65), almost a third (31 percent) cannot provide

an answer.

Table 1 here

  The National Survey also asks questions on financial literacy related to bond pricing and mortgages; see Lusardi
(2010) for detail. Since these questions are not available in the surveys conducted in other countries, we do not
report them here.
                                                                                                 5




        Responses to these three literacy questions are also positively correlated, meaning that

those who answer one question correctly are also likely to get the other two right. Nevertheless,

the correlation is not particularly high which suggests that each question measures a different

aspect of financial knowledge. Across all age groups, under half (46 percent) can correctly

answer both the interest rate and inflation questions, and fewer than a third (30 percent) get all

three questions correct in Table 1 (Panel D). Among those age 25-65, half (51 percent) get the

first two questions right, and a third (35 percent) handles all three accurately. In view of the

complex financial decisions that individuals confront in the current economic environment, these

are discouragingly low success rates. Moreover, many respondents (40 percent in some cases)

indicate they “do not know” how to answer; this is important since such response characterize

those who know the least (Lusardi and Mitchell 2011).

       Our findings using the National Capability Survey reinforce reports from past studies of

the US population as a whole (Bernheim 1995, 1998; Hilgert, Hogarth and Beverly 2003; Moore

2003); surveys on the over-50 group in the Health and Retirement Study (Lusardi and Mitchell,

2007a); and recent work with all ages in the American Life Panel (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2009).

Who Is Financially Illiterate?      We also find that specific socio-demographic groups are

particularly vulnerable, as indicated in Table 2. Here financial literacy is lowest among younger

persons (under age 35) as well as the group older than age 65. While we cannot differentiate age

from cohort effects in a cross-section, it is striking that so many of the young are poorly

informed about risk diversification and inflation. Fewer than half (46 percent) of young

respondents answer the inflation question correctly, and fewer still (43 percent) understand risk

diversification. This confirms recent reports of low financial literacy among young adults (age

23-28) in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (Lusardi, Mitchell, and Curto, 2010) and
                                                                                                    6




high school students (NCEE 2005; Mandell 2008). Shortfalls in financial literacy at older ages

are confirmed by Lusardi and Mitchell (2011) and Lusardi and Tufano (2009a, b).

Table 2 here

       Table 2 also shows that women are less financially literate than men, and these

differences are statistically significant, particularly for the interest rate and inflation questions.

Women are also much more likely to state that they cannot answer a question, indicative of very

low levels of knowledge; this is the most pronounced for the risk diversification question, where

41 percent cannot answer. Moreover, women are less likely to answer all questions correctly.

These findings underscore sex differences in literacy detected among the young and the older

population (Lusardi, Mitchell, and Curto, 2010; Lusardi and Mitchell, 2008a), and in the

American Life Panel and TNS surveys (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2009; Lusardi and Tufano, 2009a,

b). Table 2 also shows that financial literacy is positively correlated with schooling attainment.

The least financially literate are those who lack a high school degree; only about half of such

respondents can answer the interest rate question right (and another quarter cannot answer). The

prevalence of correct answers to the interest rate question rises with education, while the

proportion of both incorrect and “don’t know” answers (DKs) falls. A similar pattern

characterizes the inflation question: those without a high school degree are more often incorrect

or unable to answer. The risk diversification question is clearly more difficult, since only those

with at least a college degree can answer accurately; even here, however, about one-fifth cannot

supply an answer. Conversely, half of those lacking a high school degree indicate they cannot

answer the diversification question. And scores also differ by employment status, as indicated in

Table 2: those not employed do much worse on the three questions than do workers or the self-

employed (and differences are statistically significant). Nonworkers are also much more likely to
                                                                                                                 7




respond DK, with the proportion as high as 42 percent.7 It is noteworthy that the retired are

much more likely to answer correctly the question about inflation, perhaps because they have

experience with it.

Racial/Ethnic Differences in Actual and Self-assessed Financial Literacy. It is also

instructive to compare financial literacy differences by racial/ethnic groups, and the National

Survey oversampled these groups so as to be able to study them in more detail. Prior research has

found quite different patterns of wealth and retirement saving (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2007a;

Lusardi and Beeler, 2007; Ariel Investment 2010), which may be in part the result of differential

patterns displayed in Table 3 which tallies the results for Whites, African-Americans, Hispanics,

Asians, and others, and it shows that both African-American and Hispanic respondents display

lower levels of financial knowledge than do White/Asian respondents.

Table 3 here

        Specifically, only 56 percent of Hispanics correctly answer the interest rate question, and

a sizable fraction (19 percent) does not know the answer. This is a potentially important result in

view of the fact that many Hispanics tend to be unbanked and do not hold checking accounts

(Hogarth, Anguelov, and Lee, 2004). A similar pattern emerges with regard to the inflation

question: Hispanic respondents are least likely to answer correctly (42 percent). African-

American respondents also have a low fraction of correct responses to this question (56 percent).

As far as knowledge of risk diversification, Hispanic and African-American respondents both

have difficulty: only one-third (38 percent) of Hispanics and 42 percent of African-Americans

respond correctly, and many cannot answer the question at all. These figures confirm other

reports of U.S. racial/ethnic differences in financial literacy (Lusardi and Tufano, 2009a).

7
 Response patterns between self-employed and wage workers are not significantly different, perhaps because the
self-employed group is heterogenous (it does not include only business owners or entrepreneurs; c.f. Hurst and
Lusardi, 2004).
                                                                                                  8




       To complement the questions measuring actual financial literacy, the National Survey

also asks respondents about how they self-assess their own financial knowledge. This is useful to

identify if there is any mismatch between perceived versus actual knowledge. To this end,

survey respondents are asked:

On a scale from 1 to 7, where 1 means very low and 7 means very high, how would you assess
your overall financial knowledge?

While we have seen that many respondents actually fare poorly on the three financial concepts

questions, results in Table 4 indicate that they believe that they do rather well. Around two-fifths

(38 percent) award themselves the top knowledge scores (6-7), and only 13 percent give

themselves failing marks (1-3). Overall, almost 70 percent of respondents believe they are

above-median with regard to financial knowledge, a figure that greatly exceeds what is revealed

from our review of actual knowledge.

Table 4 here

       We can determine whether sub-groups are aware of their lack of financial knowledge by

comparing Tables 2 and 4. The young seem aware of their lack of financial knowledge and give

themselves relatively low scores (the lowest score of any age subgroup), but the opposite is true

among the older group where actual knowledge is low but self-rated scores are high. As many as

27 percent of older respondents grant themselves the highest self-rated score (7), and on average

they score themselves a mark of 5.2, higher than other age subgroups. The extent of the

mismatch between actual and self-assessed knowledge may explain why older people often are

offered less financially attractive deals than other groups (Agarwal et al., 2009); this also

corroborates Lusardi and Tufano (2009a) who show that older persons display the largest gap

between actual and self-assessed financial knowledge related to debt.
                                                                                                 9




         Patterns for other factors are also of interest. While women are less financially literate

than men by actual metrics, they also score themselves more conservatively. The less educated

know they are uninformed and grade themselves low; even among the least educated, however,

over half (57 percent) score themselves as fairly well-informed (5-7). Looking across

racial/ethnic groups, Whites score themselves the highest which correlates with their higher

actual knowledge, whereas the relationship is weaker for other racial groups. Interestingly, some

40 percent of Whites bestow on themselves top self-assessment scores (6-7), though earlier we

showed that many could not answer simple financial questions. Hispanics and African-

Americans give themselves lower scores than Whites, but differences in self-assessed knowledge

are narrower than the patterns of correct responses to the three financial literacy questions.

Overall, while self-assessments and actual knowledge are positively correlated, the relationship

is only loose. Few respondents self-assess themselves as having low financial knowledge, though

they may be unable to address basic financial concepts.

Planning for Retirement. Another measure of financial capability we can investigate using the

National Survey has to do with whether respondents look ahead and plan for the future. Our

particular focus is on retirement planning, so we pose the following question (also asked in the

2004 HRS):

         Have you ever tried to figure out how much you need to save for retirement?

This is important since prior research has established that planners also accumulate far more

retirement wealth (Lusardi, 1999; Lusardi and Beeler, 2007; Lusardi and Mitchell 2007a, 2007b,

2011).

         Unfortunately, and despite the need for self-reliance in retirement saving, the data show

that most Americans do not engage in retirement planning (see Table 5). For instance, only about
                                                                                                 10




two-fifths of our respondents (43 percent) say they ever even tried to figure out how much they

should save for retirement, and this pattern is pervasive across all groups examined. Younger

respondents are least likely to plan, perhaps feeling they have a longer time horizon; more

worrisome is the fact that only 57 percent of respondents age 50–65 have attempted to figure out

how much they need to save for retirement (and the proportion is only slightly higher for those

who have not yet retired.) While the prevalence of planning does rise with age, there is a sizable

share of people near retirement that has never attempted to figure out how much they need.

These results underscore findings from the Health and Retirement Study and the Retirement

Confidence Survey (Lusardi 1999, 2005, 2009; Lusardi and Mitchell, 2007a; Yakoboski and

Dickemper, 1997).

Table 5 here

       We also examine whether financial literacy and retirement planning are correlated,

because lack of planning may be perhaps due to lack of financial knowledge. Table 5 confirms

that retirement planning and financial literacy are, in fact, strongly positively associated in this

dataset. For instance, those who get all three financial literacy questions correct are much more

likely to have tried to figure out how much they need to save for retirement, and the positive

relationship is particularly sharp for those that understand risk diversification. To explore these

topics in more detail, in the next section we employ a multivariate model to examine the links

between financial literacy and planning.




A Multivariate Model of Planning and Financial Literacy
                                                                                                  11




       Previous work has demonstrated that financial literacy is an essential tool for informed

consumer choice in a variety of settings. For example, the less financially literate participate less

in the stock market (van Rooij et al. 2011); choose mutual funds with higher fees (Hastings and

Tejeda-Ashton, 2008); select higher-cost pension managers (Hastings and Mitchell 2010); and

amass less retirement wealth (Behrman et al. 2010). There is also evidence that financial literacy

affects borrowing behavior; for instance, the less literate are more likely to have costly

mortgages (Moore 2003) and more likely to engage in high-cost borrowing (Lusardi and Tufano

2009a). Moreover, people with characteristics linked to low literacy, including low pay and little

education, tend not to refinance their mortgages when interest rates are falling (Campbell 2006).

There is also research linking financial literacy and retirement planning for a range of population

subgroups (Lusardi, 2008, Lusardi and Mitchell 2007a, 2008a, 2009, 2011).

       Our new dataset is useful in determining whether this finding is robust and whether it

holds true in the aftermath of the unusually severe financial crisis of 2008-09. To do so, we use

multivariate regression analysis to relate the determinants of retirement planning to financial

literacy, controlling for variables reflective of differences in preferences, lifetime income, and

macroeconomic shocks. The sample is restricted to non-retired respondents younger than age 65,

to exclude those in the decumulation phase of the lifecycle. We also omit those younger than age

25, to eliminate those in school or not yet working. The list of controls includes age (and age

squared to test for a hump-shaped profile), as well as sex, race/ethnicity, and marital status; other

controls include income levels, region of residence, and educational attainment. We also add an

indicator for the self-employed, as they are very different from the rest of the population both in

terms of lifetime income and wealth (Hurst et al. 2010). To proxy for household shocks and

liquidity constraints, we add an indicator for having a large and unexpected drop in income
                                                                                                                12




during the past year, for non-working which includes the unemployed, and for the number of

children financially dependent on the respondent. Two different measures of financial literacy

are used, one an indicator equal to 1 if the respondent answers all three questions correctly (and 0

otherwise), and a second which sums each respondent’s number of correct answers to the

financial literacy questions (0-3).

        Table 6 reports results using OLS regression with our two different financial literacy

measures. In both cases, the coefficient on the literacy term is positive and statistically

significant. In other words, financial literacy is positively linked to retirement planning, even

after accounting for a rather complete set of control variables. In column 1, for instance, those

who answer all three questions correctly are almost 10 percentage points more likely to plan for

retirement; in column 2, those who answer one more financial literacy questions correctly are

four percentage points more likely to be planners. We also note that the effect of financial

literacy is smaller than but similar to the effect of having some college or a college degree;

furthermore, financial literacy has an independent and statistically significant effect even after

controlling for educational attainment. In other words, education alone does not account for the

effect of having financial knowledge.8 We also call attention to an interesting effect resulting

from the financial crisis. Those who suffered a large decrease in income are more likely to plan

for retirement afterwards, suggesting that negative shocks of the last few years have motivated

people to think more about the future.9 Other factors important to planning include income

levels, race/ethnicity, and having many children.

  This confirms findings in the developing country context reported by Behrman et al. (2010) and Hastings and
Mitchell (2010).

  A related finding is reported by Lusardi (2005).
                                                                                                                     13




           These findings are consistent with evidence on subgroups of Americans reported in other

studies. For example, among the older Health and Retirement Study population, as well the

broader age group in the American Life Panel, we have shown that more financial knowledge

increases people’s likelihood of planning for retirement (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2008a, 2009,

2011). Inasmuch as the National Survey questions closely track questions used in these other

surveys, we believe that the relationship between financial literacy and retirement planning is a

robust finding.

           In Table 7, we take up the ancillary question of whether financial literacy may itself be

endogenous. That is, financial literacy might be the result of choice, so for example some who will

plan for retirement may invest in financial education that in turns boosts their financial literacy

levels. For this reason, a positive relationship between planning and financial literacy could be

contaminated due to reverse causality. Additionally, financial literacy could be measured with

error which could yield downward biased estimates. And finally, respondents might be sensitive

to how questions are asked, and there is at least the possibility of some amount of guessing (van

Rooij et al. 2011 ; Lusardi and Mitchell 2009).

Table 7 here

           To address these issues, it is useful to re-estimate the impact of financial literacy on

planning controlling for possible causality with an Instrumental Variables (IV) approach.10 To

do so in the U.S. context, we take advantage of the fact that several states mandated high school

financial education in the past (mostly for political reasons rather than to stimulate retirement

planning; see Bernheim et al., 2001). Accordingly we can estimate a first-stage regression of

financial literacy on exposure to the mandate, to account for exogenous variation in financial

literacy. The National Survey asks respondents to indicate the state in which they lived in their
10
     This approach was first proposed by Bernheim et al. (2001) and later extended by Lusardi and Mitchell (2009).
                                                                                                                         14




senior year of high school, which permits us to compute the number of years the mandate was in

effect relevant to the respondent. This approach accounts not only for whether a state

implemented the mandate, but also for the length of time that mandated benefits were in effect.

For example, if a respondent was a high school Senior in 1980 and his home state had

implemented a mandate in 1970, the instrument would take the value of 10. 11 We then re-

estimate the planning model given the instrumented financial literacy variable.

         Results in Table 7 use an enlarged sample to increase the strength of our instrument;

specifically we include respondents younger than 25. Because the instrument only predicts one

measure of financial literacy (correct number of answers) significantly, we focus mainly on that

measure. Our results indicate that the impact of financial literacy on planning is still positive and

statistically significant. Moreover, the estimated financial literacy coefficient is larger than the

OLS estimate. For this reason, it appears that financial literacy does drive retirement planning,

even after accounting for endogeneity and possible error in the financial literacy measures. This

finding underscores the importance of enhancing financial literacy for retirement wellbeing,

particularly building on prior studies showing evidence of similar causality.




Discussion and Conclusions

         Our findings from the National Financial Capability Survey paint a troubling picture of

the current state of financial knowledge in the United States. Many respondents lack key

knowledge of financial concepts and fail to plan for retirement, even when retirement is close at

hand, only 5-10 years off.            This is important since being able to develop and implement


11
  Because the mandate may have been in place a long time before younger respondents went to high school, the
sign of this term in the first stage regression could be positive or negative. Table 6 shows the first stage estimates
and indicates that the number of years the mandate has been in effects has a negative sign.

retirement plans is key to retirement security: those who do not plan reach retirement with half

the wealth of those who do. Perhaps part of the explanation is debt illiteracy; people lack

knowledge about the workings of credit cards and interest compounding (Lusardi and Tufano

2009a), which might explain why financial illiteracy correlates with lower retirement wealth

accumulation. It is also worrisome that the low-paid and less educated persons know less, as they

are most vulnerable to bad financial decisions. Indeed financial illiteracy may place great strain

on families and personal finance, leading to suboptimal decisions regarding investment,

retirement, and spending. Moreover, when people make poor financial decisions, the cost of

those decisions may be passed on to others when they rely on social safety nets requiring

consequent tax increases.

       Clearly the cost of financial illiteracy is a social problem which is likely to devolve not

only to the least capable individuals, but to society as a whole. As the President Obama’s

Advisory Council on Financial Literacy recently stated (PACFL, 2008, np): "While the crisis

has many causes, it is undeniable that financial illiteracy is one of the root causes... Sadly, far too

many Americans do not have the basic financial skills necessary to develop and maintain a

budget, to understand credit, to understand investment vehicles, or to take advantage of our

banking system. It is essential to provide basic financial education that allows people to better

navigate an economic crisis such as this one.” Enhancing financial literacy is critical to

successful retirement, particularly among the most financially vulnerable.

Data Appendix

       In consultation with the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the President’s Advisory

Council on Financial Literacy, the FINRA Investor Education Foundation supported a national

study of the financial capability of American adults. The overarching research objectives were to

benchmark key indicators of financial capability and evaluate how these indicators vary with

underlying demographic, behavioral, attitudinal, and financial literacy characteristics.

       The National Financial Capability Study consists of three linked surveys:

   National Survey: A nationally-projectable telephone survey of 1,488 American adults;

   State-By-State Survey: A state-by-state online survey of approximately 28,000 American

adults (roughly 500 per state, plus the District of Columbia);

   Military Survey: An online survey of 800 military service members and spouses.

The survey instruments were designed by a multi-disciplinary team including Dr. Annamaria

Lusardi, the Applied Research & Consulting LLC (ARC), the FINRA Investor Education

Foundation, and the Office of Financial Education of the U.S. Treasury Department. Additional

input was provided by Craig Copeland of the Employee Benefit Research Institute (EBRI), the

American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) and Robert Willis of the University

of Michigan, among others. The National Survey was administered to respondents between May

and July of 2009 on a primary sample of 1,200 respondents constructed to be representative of

the general adult U.S. population. To ensure a sufficient number of respondents for the analysis,

African-Americans, Hispanics, Asian Americans and adults with less than a high school

education were oversampled. The total number of respondents in the sample was 1,488. The

results of the State-by-State Survey and the Military Survey were released in December 2010.
