                  "The Estimation of Labor Supply Over       itinked   Budget

                    Constraints: Some New Econometric Methodology"


                                             ABSTRACT


       Most   programs   of taxation   and   income maintenance imply that      the   tax

rate faced by an individual changes at different levels of laborsupply. As a

result, the individual's budget constraint is kinked which presents problems

for the empirical study of labor supply. This paper developes econometric

methodology for estimating labor supply in the presence of taxes. Equations

for   market wage and shadow price are used to describe labor supply choices
over a kinked     budget coastraint This approach makes         a distinction between
the discrete choice of which segment or corner of the kinked constraint to work
on and the selection of the actual number of hours of work along linear segments.
A consistent procedure is derived that uses all the tax rates faced by the mdi—
vidual and relies on no more structure thanhas been used in the previous litera-
ture on labor force participation. This procedure summarizes the individual's

kinked   budget   constraint by calculating the expected value of variables that

assume different valueson thesections of the constraint. Techniques for Estima-

ting the model based on a pxobit analysis of the decision to work above or below

certain corners of the budget constraint are presented. Maximum likelihood

estimation is also discussed.

       The purpose of this study is to develop econometric methodology for

 estimating labor supply inthe presence of taxes. Government programs' of income

maintenance and taxation imply'that the net wage faced.by an individual changes

at different levels of labor supply. Consequently, to the extent that 'an indi-

vidual chooses his labor supply, he also chooses his tax rate. This selection

of taxes by the individual presents problems for empirical tax analysis. It is

incorrect to use the selected. tax rate as àn'explanato'ry variable for
                                                                          measuring
tax effects in a labor supply model. This specification is subject to simul-

tane.ity bias because labor supply and the tax rate are jointly' determined. The

problem is that labor supply is a function of all the tax rates faced by the

individual. Although some: progress has been"mad'e'in implementing such a function

empirically, it has been made by bringing a considerable amount of structure

into the model.1

       This study developes a consistent method for estimating labor supply that uses

all the tax rates faced by'an individual and relies on no more structure than

has   been used in. the previous. literature on the subject. Other methods of
estimation are presented as steps in this development. These methods constitute
an empirical examination of labor, supply in which it is possible to test whether
individuals respond to taxes and achieve an equilibrium. It is also possible
to examine whether models based on strong assumptions and a considerable amount

of structure are justified. Such an examination is an. important part of

empirical tax analysis.                               -




      This study is based on the realization of a connection between two different

areas of research on labor supply. One area has to do with tax analysis and

the other with sample selection. The first is best represented in a study'by

Rosen (1976) which examined the   effect   of income taxes on the labor supply of

married woemn. The budget constraint of these women is kinked because their
                                                                               2


net    wage makes abrupt changes as they move into different tax brackets. Rosen

summarized the kinked budget constraint by computing the effect of taxes on

earnings at a standard number of hours of wOrk. Essentially the constraint was

summarized by the average tax rate at a point. Other studies2 of labor supply

and taxes have taken similar approaches by focusing on different points or

constructing linear approximations of the budget constraint. These studies did

not represent the entire budget constraint in any detail. Nonetheless, Rosen

does    remark that "ideally we want to represent the whole opportunity locus"
and    this task is taken up here.
        Another   group of labor supply studies that is not concerned about taxes

focuses on decisions made at a     particular corner of the, budget constraint.    The'.


choice of whether or not to     work - the participation decision - 'is used. in   these

studies to analyze issues of bias in wage comparisons and sample selection. The

analysis takes place at the corner of the budget constraint where hours of

work equal zero. The comparison, of market wage and reservation wage at this

corner has important implications for the, estimation of wages and labor supply'.

This analysis is extended in this study by carrying out the same comparison at

other corners along the taxed budget. constraint in order to develop methods

for estimating labor supply'in the presence of taxes. Thus, the analysis of

sample selection is used to address the tax selection problem discussed in the

first paragraph. Also, it is the basis for finding a way "to represent the whole

opportunity locus" as Rosen suggested..

       Section II sets up a two-equation model of labor supply that serves as the

foundation for the methodology developed in this study. This section presents

techniques for estimating the model based on a probit analysis of the decision

to work above or below certain corners of the budget constraint. This section also
                                                                                 3




spells out. under what condition these techni4ues can be applied to a nonconvex

budget constraint. While showing that the model can be estimated by looking

at discrete choices, the 'probit'results are also needed It the methodology

developed later on.

     Section III brings hours of work into the estimation of the model and

develops a consistent procedure for kinked budget constraints using ordinary

least squares. The procedure summarizes the budget constraint in an intuitively

appealing way by calculating the expected value of variables that assume

different values on the sections of the constraint. The weights in this expected

value equal the probabilities of choosing to work on these sections; the probit

results of Section II are used to compute these probabilities. Because these

probabilities depend on the parameters of thle tax program, it is. possible to

simulate behavioral responses to tax changes. Maximum, likelihood estimation fol.

lows naturally from the consistent procedure 'and is presented in Section IV.

Likelihood   maximization can be used to examine the source of information in model

estimates. Section V discusses the problem posed by the nonconvex budget con-

straint for the consistent and 'maximum likelihood methods and proposes adjustments

for each. The methodology presented here describes a process of defining

a labor supply model for empirical study that brings in as much structure as is'

justified by the data. A summary and conclusion are given in Section vi.



TI. A Two-Equation Model of Labor Supply and Its Estimation Based' on
           Probit Analysis

     A person decides to work based on the value of his time in market and

nonmarket activities. In the    market,   his time is valued at his market   wage.
Outside   the market the price that an individual attaches to his time is his shadow
                                                                               4




price. A person's shadow price when. he does not work is defined to be his

reservation wage. By definition, the reservation wage of a nOnworker exceeds

his market wage. When a person's reservation wage is less than his wage, he will

work, i.e., he supplies labor in the market at his wage. rate. As he increases.

his labor supply, a rise in his shadow price is predicted on the usual assumption

that leisure is a normal good. A person supplies labor to the point where his

shadow price equals his market wage. However, in the presence of income taxes or

other income related programs, labor supply is no longer determined by equating

shadow price and market wage. The process by which a labor supply equilibrium.

is achieved underlies the methods for estimating labor supply that are developed

in this study.   .   The discussion turns to a formal description of this
                                                                          process.
      The traditional analysis. of labor force participation4 is the foundation of

the methodology for .eflimatiñg labor supply developed, here. The analysis. uses

equations to estimate an individual's market wage and shadow price. A person's

potential wage, w; is related to a set of variables, X, and an error term
                                                                               e1.
This relationship is specified in the following semi-logarithmic form5:




(1)     .               lnw=   Xct+




The X variables consist of schooling and age as well as other determinants of

wage. The error term, e1, is assumed to be random and uncorrelated with the X's.

      The decision to work also depends on an individual's shadow price, denoted

s. This is influenced by: time spent working, h; a set of observed variables,

Y; and an error term, e2. The general form of the shadow price equation is adopted

from the wage equation as follows:
                                                                          S



 (2)                  ln5Y+Xh÷e


The Y vector includes, schooling and age, as does X, and other variables that

influence shadow price alone. Labor supply is assumed to have a single time

dimension measured by the scalar variable h.6 The error term is a random

variable distributed independently, of h and Y by assumption:

        A person will work when his reservation wage, i.e., s at h0, is less

than h.is wage. Using. eqs. (1) and (2) this means;




(3)                       -          X—
                     e2       e1.<



Let DP be a binary variable that indicates whether a person works (DP=l) or
is    not working (DPO). The probability of'working P(DP=l), equals the

probability that eq. (3) holds. Letting.F denote the distribution function

of e2-e1 and a denote the standard deviation of e2-e1, the probability of

working becomes:




                     P(DP = 1)       F[(X - Y)/a]


The argument   of P will be called the "participation index" because it determine's

labor force participation; it is denoted J.
                                                                                     6



            The discussion turns to an analysis of labor force participation because

    it illustrates some points of technique that will be used again. The participa—

    tion decision is thenatural starting point for estimating labor supply. Estimates

    of a and S up to the scale factor a are obtained from a participation analysis.

    This is done by dividing the sample into subsamples of individuals who are working,

    DP=l, and those who are not working, DP=O, and then maximizing the likelihood of

    observing this behavior in the        sample.   The likelihood function following from

    eq. (4) to be maximized is:




                           L=             F(J )
    (S)                          II

              1                                                      -
    for   the variables. Maximum likelihood estimates of a/a and /a follow from the

    maximization of I...    If a variable appears in both X and Y, thenonly the difference

    between its coefficients in equations (1) and (2) relative to          can be identified.

          When F is the normal distribution function then eq. (5) is the standard

    probit model. Although the analysis is amenable to whatever distribution function

    is assumed for F,the.probit specification is adopted because this has been the

-   choice   in the labor force participation literature.

          A two-step procedure permits estimating all coefficients separately without

    any scale factor. In the first step, an estimate of a is obtained directly by

    estimating the wage equation alone. These results are used to impute the log

    of an individual's market wage based on X.         In the second step, this imputed log

    of wage is used in a probit analysis of participation. The inverse of the estimated
                                                                             7




coefficient on the imputed log of wage is an estiniateof the standard deviation

in the denominator of the participation indey. Multiplying the coefficient esti-

mates for Y variables by this estimate of the standard deviation yields maximum

likelihood estimates of the s.

      This two-step procedure will be described explicitly. The first step produces

an estimate of eq. (1) which is given as follows7:




(6)                lnw=X;+e1 = lnw÷e1


The decision to work now implies:




(7)                e2 -         < 1nw -    .                           -




Let e' equal e2 -      and have standard deviation a'. The probability of working
                  e1
becomes:




(8)                P(DP = 1) =     F[(lnw- YS)Ja']


Let    denote the argument of F; the likelihood function based on eq. (8) is8;


(9)                L=      Ii     F(J0i)          It [1 -
                          ie{DP=l}             ic(L1P=O}
                                                            F(J'0 iI
                                                                                 8



This is the same as eq. (5) except that mw, the imputed log of wage, replaces

Ltand a' replaces a.

     An important feature of the two-step procedure is that a.single wage effect

on participation is conveniently summarized by the coefficient estimate of lnw.

An estimate of a' is given by the inverse of the estimated coefficient of lnw.

An estimate of 5 is obtained by multiplying the estimated coefficients of the Y
                                      9
variables    by the estimte of a'.

     It is possible    to estimate S using    the probit analysis based on X and Y'

                                          •
                                                    :
(eq. (5)) and the wage regression without carrying out the second probit step.

Poing this require that a variable be in N but npt in Y; let x, denote such a
variable. The wage regression provides an estimate of x1's coefficient iii

eq. (1) -    a1.   The probit analysis yields an estimate of x11s coefficient in the

participation index -                 Thus, an estimate of a is given by
                         (a1/a)   .




If there are two (or more) variables in X but not in Y, there would be two (or mOre)

such estimates and a would be overidentified. A solution to this problem of over-

identification is embedded in the two-step procedure. The inverse of coefficient

estimate of 1n'w in this procedure can be interpreted as a weighted average of the

estimates    of a in the overidéntified casej°
     Once a person has decided to work, the decision on how much labor to supply      -


over a kinked budget constraint follows from a comparison of market wage and shadow
price at points other than the corner of zero hours. The details of tins approach
are presented using..the   budget constraint illustrated in Figure 1. As shown,, earn-

ings are   untaxed up to the level M at which point a tax rate of t is applied to
further    earnings. Hours   of work at this kink point will be denoted by k. Thus,
a person   earns his full wage, w, for hours worked up to k and earns his taxed wage,

(l-t)w,    for hours worked above k.

Va are obtained by maximizing L with respect to thes.e parameters.. The Same

problem in estimating the separate coefficients of variables in both X and 1

arises as it did before. The same two-step procedure can be applied as before

in order to estimate a, S and y    separately.
     The probit analysis at the corner of zero hours and at the kink point

may yield different estimates of the same coefficient and as a result provide.

a.richer description of labor supply. For example, children can have opposite

effects on the labor supply of women at. these points)1 The presence of young

children is expected to lower the probability of. working. However, having decided

to work, a woman's labor might be increased by the presence of children. in order

to cover the cost of childcare. In other words, children become a fixed cost in.

labor supply decisions. Consequently, the coefficient of a variable, measuring

the effect of children can have a different sign in estimates of the model. at zero

hours and the kink point. The probit methods described above provide a direct

examination of whether labor supply is influenced by fixed costs or other factors.

     Although the above methods for estimating the models using prob'it analysis

were constructed based on a convex budget, they can. also be'applied when the bud-

get constraint is' noncorivex subject to a certain condition. This condition is best

illustrated with the aid of Figure 2. Three kinked nonconvex 'budget constraints,

ABCD1, ABCD2 and ABCD.,, are shown in tins figure. 1'he extension of the common

initial   segment of all of these constraints is given by the dashed line BE.
The probit methods for estimating the' model presented in this section are valid
on the condition that BE lies above the rest of the constraint. This condition

is satisfied by ABCD1 and ABCD2. Even when the slope of a segment of the budget

constraint exceeds the slope of its initial segment, as in the case of
                                                                         ABCD2,
this condition is still sufficient for the validity of the above methods.

     If the above condition is not met, an individual could havehis shadow

price equal the slope of the budget constraint when. it is above the extension of

its initial segment and also satisfy the equilibrium condition for working

below k.   In other words, equilibrium conditions for working above and below k can

be met. This situation is illustrated by the, budget constraint ABCD3 in Figure 2.

When such budget constraints prevail, a utility function must be employed for

estimating labor supply. As iHeckman (1974b) says "the essence of the problem

involyes utility comparisons between two or more discrete alternatives."

     Individuals •face kinked nonconvex budget constraints under programs •of

income maintenance such as welfare assistance, negative income tax plans' and the

social security earnings test. The essential idea of these programs is to offer.

a grant as income support and reduce (tax). it as a person's earnings go up. The

nonconvexity arises because an individual's wage is taxed in the range where'his

earnings reduce the grant (segment (b) in Fig. 2) and then is not taxed when the

grant is reduced to,zero (segment (c) in Fig. 2).   If there is an initial range

over which an individual can work without reducing his grant then the methods pre-

sented above can probably be applied. The condition for using these methods

is likely to hold because the net wage after the grant is reduced. to zero is not

likely to exceed the slope of the initial segment. The examination of whether

this condition holds is important because it determines whether a labor supply

model can be estimated using the methods developed here for which computational

procedures already exist or the model requires more complicated analysis.

         This section applied the analysis of discrete chOices to estimate the

labor supply model. The following sections bring hours of wdrk into the estimation

of the model.




III. Consistent Estimation Using Ordinary Least Squares

         A technique for obtaining cOnsistent estimates of the labor supply model

using ordinary least squares is derived in this section. The technique is based

on using the distribution of the disturbances in eqs. (1) and (2) for computing

the probabilities of working on each segment and corner of the budget constraint.

Therefore, the discussion on how choices are Eade on the kinked convex budget

constraint must be taken up again.

         The probability that a person works at a level less than k, be., along

segment (a) in Figure 1, is given by eqs. (3) and (10) toije:




(13)                   P(Q < h c k) = P(X1   —
                                                 Y -•-k <         -        c       —
                                                                                       Ys)
                                                             e2       e1




Using     the same notation from the last section to.describe the distribution of
     -
e2       e1, this probability is expressed as follows:



(14)                   P(0 < Ii <   k)   F[(X - YB)/a]   —
                                                             F[(X -            —




         The wage that a person faces at k is taxed at the rate t.                 A person may

be willing to work more than Ic at his full wage but not at his taxed wage. In
                                                                                                                                 15


other    words, the market wage can exceed his shadow price at kbut his taxed

wage does    not.     For this reason there is a nonzero probability that an individual

works k exactly. Working at least k requires that:




 (15)
                         e2- e1<Xa—Y8-yk


A person works no more than k when (1 -                                  t)w   <   s   at   k        By taking the log of this

inequality, it is expressed using eqs. (1) and (2) as follows:




(l6)                    e2 — e1 >           ln(1         —    t)     +   Xa-       YS —     yk



Based on eqs. (15) and (16) the probability of working at the corner on the

budget constraint where h = k becomes:




(17)         P(h = k)   +   P(ln(l      -   t)       +       Xcz -   Y5 -      yk Ce2 - e1             < Xci   -,
                                                                                                                    Y5 -   yk)



This    probability   is further expressed as follows:




(18)         P(h = k)       F[(Xa   -            -                       - F[(ln(l          -   t)   + Xci - Y5      -
                                                                                                                         yk)/a]
                                                                                    if,




 A concentration of individuals working k may          appear   because some individuals

 work as much as possible at their full wage but will not work any more at their
                                              H
 taxed wage.12

         Finally,   a person will work along the taxed segment of the budget constraint

 when his net wage exceeds his shadow price at k so that:




 (19)




The probability of working more than k is given by:




 (20)                   P(h>lc) =   F[(ln(l   —
                                                  t)+ Xa —      — yk)/a]



        The labor supply choices over the budget constraint illustrated inFigure 1

and the probabilities ofinaking these choices are suinniarizedin Table 1. The

indexes derived in this section to describe these choices are given in the table

also.

        The technique for consistently estimating the model is based on the probabili-

ties in Table 1 and an equation for the specific amount of labor supplied.

Consequently, the focus of attention turns to the labor supply equation that

follows from eqs. (1) and (2). This equation is derived by equating shadow price

and market wage and solving for h. Far the moment, the problems posed by the

kinked budget constraint are ignored so that this equation is:

This equation shows that labor supply is a linear multiple (1/',') of the difference

between market wage and reservation wage. Therefore, this difference determines

whethera person works and how much time he spends working. Even without the

complication of a kinked budget constraint, the participatioh and labor supply

decisions may not be so strictly related. The coefficients of some of the K

and Y variables in the participation step may differ from the corresponding

coefficients in the labor supply equation. The point made in the discussion on

the fixed cost of children in the last section applies here as well. To allow

for this possibility and to simplify the expressions in subsequent calculations,

the labor supply equation will be specified in the following general way:




(22)                hWd+u

       N is just the set of all variables in X andY; it is doubtful that a

variable in either the wage or shadow price equation would not appear in the

labor supply equation and vice versa. The difference between eqs. (21) and (22)

is in the vector of coefficients. The essential point is that the strict deriva-

tion of labor supply from the market wage and shadow price equations can be

examined empirically by testing whether the coefficients in eq. (22) are different

from those in eq. (21). This point is made by Haitoch (1976, p. 13). To estimate

eq. (22) the problems posed by the kinked budget constraint must be handled.
                                                                                 '9




        The technique for consistent estimation of eq. (22) using OLS follows

from calculating the expected value of h over the kinked budget constraint.

To illustrate this, let q index the types of labor supply choices where.q equals

1 for not working, 2 for working along segment (a), 3 for working at k, and

4 for working along segment (b). The expected. value of h conditional on W is:



                                   4
(23)                   E(hW)' =        P(q   =
                                                 i)[W+
                                                     q   E(uSV, q)]
                                  in




where P(q =    i)   equals the, probability of making choice q =      1; these prob3bili-
ties are .given.in Table 1. Estimates of these probabilities fellow from the

probit analysis of OK presented in Section II.

       The q subscript for W indicates that the value of some variables in IV

depend on the labor supply choice. For example, the value of the tax rate

depends on labor supply.' The problem posed by this' dependency was referred

to in the introduction as the tax selection problem. The source of this problem

is shown explicitly, in eq. (23): the error term depends on q and hence is

potentially correlated with the choice-dependent value of a variables However,

thi.s problem does not arise with the specification given by eq. (23) because

the    variables are not defined by the value of q that is chosen. Instead, the
value of a variable equals the probability weighted average of its values for
all possible choices.
       An important result of the above expected value calculation is that the

expected   value of the error ten equals zero. This can be shown by writing out
the summation in eq. (23) in full. The values of the probability weights,
P(q = i), are given in Table 1. The expected value of u for a given value of
                                                                                                               20



q,    E(uW, q)J, is nonzero because u is potentially correlated with                                        e -
and e2 -    has been shown to be truncated for any particular choice. Letting

0ue denote this potential correlation and f denote the.standard normal density

function, and using the formulas for the means of truncated normal variables13,

The    probability   weighted      average of the expected value of u, as                             shown,   equals
zero. There is       no    selection problem because                      the actual labor supply choice

was    not used to calculate the conditioned mean of h. Therefore, neither
the expected value of the error nor an explanatory variable depend on this choice.

           The only conditioning variables in eq. (24) are the exogenous variables

    given by W. The fact that some variables, in partiéular the tax rate, differ

    in value over the budget constraint is handled by taking their expected value

    over the constraint. In other words, the kinked budget constraint is summarized

    in an expected-value calculation. This summary of the budget constraint answers

    Rosen!s (1976) request for away to represent the wole opportunity locus.

           An important variable in N is the net wage and the way it is treated in

    eq. (25) illustrates some important features of the procedure. The coefficient

    of this variable will be denoted d-1 .              For the moment, eachindividual's market

    wage, w, is assumed to be constant and observed. The net wage varies over- the

    budget constraint because the tax rate changes; for example, in Fig. 1, •the

    tax rate for 4 =   1   and 2 is zero and for q = 3 and 4 it is t In general, lOt

where     expresses summation over q.

       The first ten shows that a variable which is constant over the budget

constraint assumes its constant value in the specification given by eq. (25)

since the probabilities sum to- one. The second term shows that labor supply

is a function of all tile tax rates as mentioned in the introduction, and eq. (26)

offers a convenient way to express this. A further ithplication is that the coef—

ficients of ln w and the expected tax rate should be equal. This equality -
                                                                                  /
suggests a simple test of tax perception of the type carried out by Rosen-(1976).
   -   An important feature of eq. (26) is- that it is po.sible to- simulate responses

to changes in the tax program based on the specification of- the equation-. The

breakpoints and tax rates of the program are used to define the J indexes and

the probability weights follow directly from estimates: of these indexes-. Con-

sequently, when the breakpoints or tax rates are changed, the probability weights

change which results in a potential change in the expected value of hours of

work for each individual as Eiven by eq. (26).

       If each individual's wage rate is not observed then there are alternative

ways to estimate eq. (25). One way is to substitute the equation for w intO            -




eq. (26) so that the X's appear as explanatory variables with d1a as the vector

of their coefficients. The estimate of eq-. (26) based on the X's and the-wage

regression can be used to estimate d1. This procedure is identical to what was

done in Section II to estimate     based on a probit analysis and the wage regression.

Again, Let x1 denote a variable in X and not in '1.   The wage regression yields

an estimate of x1's coefficient in the wage equation-;1 .       The estimate of eq. (26)

gives an estimate of x1Ts coefficient in the labor supply equation —                  An
                                                                         d1   l
estimate of d1 is given by d1u1/1 .     Overidentification   of d1 follows when more

than one variable appears in X but not in Y. Another way to- estimate eq. (26)
                                                                            23



solves this problem of overidentification. The solution is analogous to what

was done before: the wage regression is used to impute a log of wage to everyone

based on their X values and the imputed log of wage is used in eq. (26) as an

explanatory variable. The coefficient of the imputed log of wage provides an

estimate of d1. Again, the equality of the wage and tax coefficient can be

tested as a way to test tax perception.

      The main result of this section is expressed byleq. (26). Ordinary least

squares estimation of the labor supply model based on this specification yields

a consistent estimate of the model in the presence of a convex kinked budget

constraint. The way in which this specification sunurarizes the budget constraint

in an expçcted value has a certain intuitive appeal. Although the procedure for

implementing this specification re4uires probit analysis as a first step and the

calculation of estimates •of the probabilities given in Table 1 from the probit

results, it is not computationally burdensome. More importantly, the steps in the

procedure build on themselves and constitute a thorough empirical examination

of labor supply. In the process it is possible to test tax perception as well

as measure tax effects.

      The model is developed to the point where maximum likelihood estimation is

easy to discuss. The value of this discussion lies in presenting a way to test

the source of information in the estimates of the model.




IV. Maximum Likelihood Estimation

      This section will describe ways to estimate the labor supply model based

on   likelihood   maximization. Most of the derivations and formulas needed to

define the likelihood function have been presented in the previous sections.

However, the specific amount of labor supplied by individuals who work on a linear
                                                                                                         24



segment of the budget constraint gives additional information on the
probability of their choice, which is put to use here. To be specific, a
person   who chooses to work an amount h* along segment (a), i.e. 0 <                            h   <

is   considered. Based on the assumptions that individuals can work

any amount they want and that they choose their labor supply so as tO equate

shadow price and net wage, it follows that:




(27)
                      e2_e1=XaYS_?h*


Based on this equality and eq. (14) and lettingfdenote the density function

for e2 -
           e1, the probability of working along segment (a) at h* becomes:



(28)                  P(h :h*I0 < h              <    k) =



This   probability and the probability for working along segment (b) will be

expressed more conveniently by defining the following 3 indexes:




                            = (Xa -          - yh*)/ci           for choices along segment (a),

                                                                                 i.e., 0 <   h   < k




                      or,



                            =   (ln(l   -   t)       + Xa    -    - yh*)/a   ,    for   choices along

                                                                                 segment (b), i.e., h* >      k
                                                                                                       25



       In order to define the likelihood of observing the behavior in a sample,

individuals are grouped by the labor supply choice they actually make. Thus,

the sample is partitioned as follows: D0 for ndnworkers.;                                 for persons workin.g

along segment (a); P2 for persons working at the kink point; and D3. for per-

sons working more than k. Given this partition and the probabilities, of making.

these choices, the likelihood of observing this behavior is given by:

Asympotically   efficient, consisteflt estimates of the coefficients in the model

are obtained by maximizing the likelihood function with respect to these

coefficients.14

       The above likelihood function was based, in part, on the assumption that

individuals equate shadow price and net wage in determining their labor supply.

However,   individuals may   not be able to choose their hours of work..freely because

employers offer jobs for specific amounts of work. As a result, work choices
along linear segments do not follow              from tangencies of indifference curves with

budget   constraints. By dropping            this tangency assumption the likelihood function

becomes:




(30)                  L= IT [l—F(J0) H [F(Jo)_F(Jk)}

                              ii                 -             II
                                     [F(J )          F(J i )3 icfl         F(J )
                             ieD             i                                i
                                                                            26




This adjustment for dropping the tangency assumption is identical to what

Rosett and Nelson (1975) do in the two-limit probit model when nonliinit values

of the dependent variable are not known.

     The maximization of the likelihood functions given by eqs. (29) and (30)

permits testing the source of information in the coefficient estimates. If

the value of the likelihood function given by eq. (29) is significantly higher

than that based on eq. (30) than additional information is gaIned by assuming

that individuals equate shadow price and net wage. This result would support

the usual description of labor supply as an equilibrium that follows from a

tangency of an indifference curve with the budget line.

     If the maximum likelihood estimates from eqs. (29) and (30) are not signi-

ficantly different then the assumption that shadow price equals net wage along

linear segments of the budget constraint does not add much information empirically.

In other words, most of the information for labor supply estimation is captured

by the comparison of shadow price and net wage that determines which linear seg-

ment or corner of the budget constraint is chosen; variation in labor supply

along linear segments does not add much precision to the estimate of the model.

     This section presented maximum likelihood methods estimation that followed

naturally from the consistent methods developed in the previous section. A

test of the source of information in model estimates was also presented. Both

the consistent and maximum likelihood methods were given for a convex budget

constraint. The probleim posed by a nonconvex constraint and the accompanying

adjustments to each method are presented in the next section.
                                                                                              27



V.   Adjustments   for the Nonconvex Budget Constraints

      The purpose of this section is to point out precisely what problem arises

for the estimation procedures giveft in Sections III and I'! when they are

applied to a nonconvex kinked budget constraint, and what adjustments have to

be made. For maximum likelihood methods the adjustment is one of interpreta-

.tion; the likelihood function is. defined in the sane way as before but the

predictive power of the estimates is limited. An adjustment in the probability

weights used in the consistent procedure is suggested as a practical solution

to the nonconvexity problem.

     The nonconvexity problem is best illustrated with thebudget constraint

shown in Figure 3. This budget constraint describes a program of inëome suppot

in which individuals receive a grantor benefit that is reduced by $t for every

dollar of earnings above a certain amount (bc on the vertical axis). Th budget

constraint becomes nonconvex at point D where the grant is reduced to zero and

earnings can no longer be taxed. At this point, where labor supply equals n,

net wage rises from its taxed value, (1 -              t)w,      to the market wage rate, w.

The shadow price at n can exceed the taxed wage implying that labor supply is

less than n. At the same time, this shadow price can be less than the market

wage implying. that labor supply is greater than n.

     The following indexes are used to express the nonconvexity problem explicitly:




           =   ((       -   t)   + Xci   -   - yn)/a   ,   the    index for working up to n



               (Xci -   Y   -
                                 yn)/o , the   index for working beyond n.

Since ln(l -       t)       C       0, then   <   J   .   Therefore,   it is possible that

   <         -          <       J     where e1 and e2 are the error terms in the wage and shadow
       (e2       e1)
price equations respectively. The first inequality says that the shadow price

at n exceeds the taxed wage and the second inequality, that this shadow price

is less than the market wage. Thus, conditions fOr working below and above

n are both satisfied implying that there are two potential equilibrium points.

       One solution to this problem would be to introduce a utility function into

the model either by prior specification or through a derivation based on the

labor supply equation. With this function, the ambiguity posed by two potential

equilibrium points can be resolved by choosing the one yielding higher utility.

This solution is based on the assumption that labor supply is determined by

tangencies between indifference curves and budget constraints, i.e., individuals

adjust their hours of work freely in order to equate shadow price and net wage.

HOwever, individual.s may not be able to choose their hours so freely. A

utility function based on an assumption that is not.suppQrted empirically will

not describe labor supply choices accurately.

       The tangency assumption is not used in the procedures developed here for

estimating labor supply based on probit analysis and likelihood maximization.

It is not important for theconsistent method because the coefficients in the

labor supply equation are allowed to differ from those in the indexes for the

probabilities of choices. More importantly, the methodology developed here re-

lies on the data to indicate what steps in the labor supply decision convey

the most information for estimation purposes. The methods will be adjusted for

the nonconvexity problem in ways that should not cause significant problems

empirically. The limitations of these adjustments must be weighted against the

potential inaccuracies o a more complicated functional analysis.

This function does not take into account the possibility that individuals on

segment (b) could have chosen segment (c) and vice versa. Consequently, the

model cannot be used to predict jumps between segments (b) and (c) in response

to tax changes. This limitation in the predictive power of the model may be

less problematic than the restrictions imposed by a utility function.

       The probabilities used for the consistent procedure can be adjusted for the

problem posed by the n.onconvexity. The                    probability    for working at the nonconvexity

point, D in Figure 3 where h =       n,           equals .F(Jn) -   F(Jt) which         is negative. Since

all the probabiities sum to one, this negative probability at 0 implies that the

sum of the probabilities for the other choices exceeds one by the magnitude of
                                                                             31



this negative amount which is F(Jt) -           This   should be interpreted as

showing that the comparison of shadow price and net wage gives the expected

result that an equilibrium should not occur around the nonconvexity point.

The proposed adjustment conforms with this result. The adjustment is to sub-

tract [F(J) -   F(J)]/2   from the probabilities for working along segments (b)

arid (c). As a result, the probability of working in an interval around the

nonconvexity point equalszero as expected)5

     In this section, the maximum likelihood and consistent methods were adjusted

for the problem posed by a noncanvex budget constraint. The belief is that these

adjustments are empirically sound and are superior to making additional assump-

tions that may only constrain the data to fit a particular functional form.




VI. Summary and Conclusion

     This study develops econometric techniques for estimating labor sujply when

individuals face a net wage that varies as a result of a program of income

maintenance or taxation. The methodology is. based on the traditional a.halysis of

labor force participation. Equations for market wage and shadow price are used

to describe labor supply choices over a kinked budget constraint. This approach

makes a distinction between the discrete choice of which segment or corner of the

kinked constraint to work on and the selection of the actual number of hours of

work along linear segments. As a result, the methodology can be used to test

whether information in an estimate of the model comes from discrete chOices or

the selection of a specific number of hours. Such an examination of the source

of information in model estimates is important because it determines what assump-

tions about labor supply are appropriate empirically.
                                                                           32




     Methods of estimating all the coefficients in the model by the application

of probit analysis at certain corners of the budget constraint have been

presented. Under a certain condition these methods can be applied to rionconvex

constraints.

     Comparisons of net wage and shadow price along the budget constraint are

used to derive a procedure for consistently estimating the model based on- ordi-

nary least squares. An expected value calculation summarizes a variable that

changes- value over the convex kinked constraint in an intuitively appealing way.

Such a variable equals a weighted average of its values on the corners and seg-

ments of the constraint. The weights equal the probabilities of choosing to

work on each corner and-segment. Theseprobabilities vary with thevalües of the

exogenous variables for each individual and with the parameters of the tax

program under study. Consequently, an estimate of the model can be used to

simulate individual responses to changes in the tax program. An- important step

in this procedure that precedes the measurement of tax effects is a test of

tax perception.

     Maximum likelihood estimation of the model follows naturally from consistent

procedure. The likelihood approach makes it possible to test -the assumption that

shadow price and net wage are equal along linear segments of the-budget constraint.

Adjustments to the maximum likelihood and consistent methods for nonconvex budget

constraints were also presented.

     There   are two points to be made in conclusion that serve as both caveats
and defenses for this study. First, individuals may not know exactly-what their
budget   constraints look like, especially when these constraints are complicated.

Consequently, they may make their labor supply decisions based on considering only
                                                                                      -



a few discrete choices as being relevant. 16           -

                                               Alternatively, they may make their
                                                                                  .
                                                                            33




decisions basedon a subjective expectation of theirtreatment under a tax system.

The methods presented here may go too far because they rely on modelling the entire

budget   constraint.   However, behavioral responses based on subj ective expectations
may be suitably captured by the way in which the budget constraint is summarized
here in an expected value calculation. A Second point is that variables      that are

crucial for the classification of individual choices over kinked budget constraints

e.g. hours and earnings -   are   subject to errors in measurement.17 As a result,.

this study may assume too much precision in the. enipiridalmeasurement of the

budget constraint. However, the development from probit to consistent to maximum

likelihood estimation follows a. progression in the use of the budget constraint.

How much of the budget constraint is needed for estimation is left to the actual

empirical analysis.

     I believe this study is useful because it emphasizes an empirical development

of a labor supply model, The potential gains from this approach are a realistic

description of labor supply decisions,. an insight into the amount of information

in a dataset, and a robust specification of a labor supply model based on this

desription and information.

                                        Notes


1.   Burtless and Hausman (1978) and Hausman (1979) develop a labor supply model

     in which they use Roy's identity to derive a utility function from a labor

     supply equation. The problem presented by double tangencies between indiffer-

     ence curves and nonconvex budget constraints is resolved by bringing individual

     tastes into the model. The coefficient.for nonlabor income is assumed to vary

     with individual tastes. These unobservable tastes are related to observed

     variables that appear elsewhere in the model. Whenever the same variables are

     used to serve more than one purpose, misspecification is a serious potential

     probieth. A more fundamental problem is raised in an excellent study by Hall

     (1975) in which the approach of deriving a utility function from Roy's identity

     was first taken. Hall shows that empirical results are sensitive to the way
     in which individual tastes are brought into a labor supply model. This issue
     of robustness in the specification of individual tastes poses serious questions
     about Burtless and Hausnian's assumption of a random coefficients model applied

     to one particular coefficient in a model already based on strong assumptions.

     The motivation of this study is that the empirical development of a labor

     supply model wil,l yield a robust specification.

     (1973, 1975)

5.   This specification of the wage equation is generally accepted in the labor
     supply literature; see I-{eckman and Polachek (1974), Griliches   (1977) and

     Chamberlain    (1977).
 6. Hanoch (1976) develops a model in which labor supply is measured by two

      distinct variables that are jointly determined. Although this description

      of. labor supply has an important bearing on the issues raised hdre the main

      points of this, study can be made using 'a single time dimension.

 7.   If the wage equation can only be estimated over a sample of workers, then

      the regression must be corrected for potential sample selection bias. Hano'ch

      (1976) and Heckman (1979) have analyzed this problem and show. that' potential

      sample selection bias can be eliminated by adding a variable to the wage regres-

      sion. 'This variable is the'inverse'of Mill'à ratio and equal
                                                                             f(J0)/F.(J0)
      where f and F are, respectively, the density and distribution functions of

      e2 -.   e1.     The probit analysis based ,on eq. (5) yields an estimate of this

      variable.

 8. Because            ='(I -   X(X'X) 1X')e1, the validity of.the'. specification in e. (9)
                                                                    -


      depends on theasymptotic normality of e.

 9.   There is an important statistical requirement in this two-step proc'edure. The

      requirement is that Y.be included in the wage regression so that it will be

      orthogonal to e'. Otherwise, the estimate of            in the second step is

      potentially biased.

10. This interpretation is not entirely accurate because the standard deviation

      (&)     of    the error term is not the same as that (a) in the probit analysis based

      on eq. (5)

11. This example was first discussed by Gronau (1973).

12. An example of such a concentration appears in my study (1979) of the social

      security earnings test..

14. A two-step procedure idential to those described above can be used to

     estimate all the coefficients separately. As before the procedure is based

     on using an imputed log of wage from the wage regression. Further, the hypo-

    thesis that individuals perceive taxes dan be tested by testing theequality

    of the coefficients for the wage and tax variables.

15. A utility function may imply that this interval is slightly different, but this

    is spurious accuracy given the informational limits of data.

    studies based on two and three choices respectively.

    earnings and 17.4 percent. of the observed variation in annual hours of work

    are accounted for by measurement error.
