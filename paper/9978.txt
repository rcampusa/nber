                                           ABSTRACT

When studying solutions to long-term environmental problems such as climate change, it is
important to consider the role that technological change may play. Nonetheless, to date few
economic models of climate change explicitly model the link between policy and technological
change. There is a growing body of evidence that the incentives offered by prices and environmental
regulations have a strong influence on both the creation and adoption of new technologies. In several
recent papers, I have used patent data to examine the links between environmental policy and
technological change. In addition, I have used the results of this research to calibrate the ENTICE
model (for ENdogenous Technological change) of climate change, which links energy-related R&D
to changes in the price of carbon. Drawing on my experiences from empirical studies on innovation
and from modeling the climate change problem, in this paper I review some of the key lessons from
recent empirical work using patents to study environmental innovation and diffusion, and discuss
its implications for modeling climate change policy. I conclude by offering suggestions for future
research.

         Debates about the sustainability of environmental policy (or the lack thereof) often revolve

around the potential effects that technological change may have. Nonetheless, most economic models of

long-term environmental policies such as climate change treat technology as exogenous. Since these

policies are likely to have a large impact on the pace and direction of technological change, such models

miss the important link between policy and innovation. One reason for this omission is that, until recently,

few empirical studies of innovation and environmental policy existed.1

         My own research has focused on filling this gap. In several recent papers (Popp 2001, 2002,

2003a), I use patent data to examine the links between environmental policy and technological change.

Patent data offer several advantages when studying environmentally-friendly technological change.

Detailed patent classification systems make identifying advances in narrowly-defined technological fields

straightforward. Furthermore, since inventors can apply for patents in multiple countries, patents can also

be used to track the diffusion of technologies across countries. I have used the results of this research to

calibrate the ENTICE model (for ENdogenous Technological change) of climate change. The ENTICE

model is a variant of the well-known DICE model of climate change (Nordhaus 1994) that links energy-

related R&D to changes in the price of carbon. Drawing on my experiences from empirical studies on

innovation and from modeling the climate change problem, in this paper I review some of the key lessons

from recent empirical work using patents to study environmental innovation. Using the ENTICE model

as a an application of these lessons, I discuss the implications for modeling long-run environmental

problems, and how ignoring the lessons learned from empirical work helps explain differences found in

various papers. I conclude by offering suggestions for future research.



I. Theoretical Background

         The process of technological change proceeds in stages (Schumpeter 1942). First, an idea must

be born. This stage is known as invention. New ideas are then developed into commercially viable


1
  Although recent models, such as those presented in this special issue, help to fill this gap in the research, the wide
range of results presented in these models suggest there is still much work to be done.

products. This stage is innovation. Typically, these two stages of technological change are studied

together. Finally, to have an effect on the economy, individuals must choose to make use of the new

innovation. This adoption process is known as diffusion. At each stage, incentives, either in the form of

prices or regulations, will affect the development and adoption of new technologies. This section reviews

the theoretical literature linking economic incentives to the process of technological change.



A. Induced Innovation

        The idea that the creation of ideas through invention and innovation will be influenced by

economic incentives is not new. The concept of induced innovation was first introduced by John Hicks

(1932), who noted that changes in factor prices would lead to innovation to economize on usage of the

more expensive factor.     Theoretical papers by Ahmad (1966), Kamien and Schwartz (1968), and

Binswanger (1974, 1978a, 1978b) formalized Hicks’ notion and established the theory of induced

innovation. Binswanger notes that not only will an increase in the cost of a factor of production lead to an

increase in R&D focused on reducing use of that factor, but also that changes in the productivity of such

R&D will affect inducement. This suggests the importance of considering the marginal productivity of

research. As I will discuss later, there is evidence that, within a given field, the productivity of research

declines over time. As a result, an increase in energy prices should lead to an immediate increase in R&D

on energy conservation, but this increase need not be long-lived.

        In the environmental literature, the relationship between innovation and policy has been explored

under two broad themes.2 Papers such as Magat (1978), Milliman and Prince (1989), and Fisher et al.

(1998) use theoretical models to compare the effects of various environmental policy mechanisms (e.g.

command and control regulation, emissions taxes, or tradable permits) on environmentally-friendly

innovation. In general, these papers predict that market-based policies, such as a tax or tradable permit,

will induce more environmentally-friendly innovation than a command and control policy.

2
  A comprehensive survey of the literature on technological change and the environment may be found in Jaffe,
Newell, and Stavins (2003). Jaffe, Newell, and Stavins (1999) discuss the implications of energy-efficiency
technologies on climate policy.
Lessons From Patents: Using Patents To Measure Technological Change in Environmental Models                3


        Although economists readily recognized the potential importance of linking technological change

to climate policy, modeling such links was made difficult by the lack of empirical studies on the

magnitude of such induced innovation effects. Recently, as measures of innovative activity such as

patents have become more readily available, empirical economists have begun to estimate the effects that

prices and environmental policies have on environmentally-friendly innovation. Using international

patent data, Lanjouw and Mody (1996) find a correlation across nations between patenting in

environmental fields and pollution abatement expenditures. Jaffe and Palmer (1997) look at the same

relationship across US industries. Comparing pollution abatement data and innovation data across these

industries, they estimate a positive elasticity of pollution control R&D with respect to pollution control

expenditures of 0.15. However, they do not find evidence of a relationship between patenting and

pollution abatement expenditures.

        In each of these studies, pollution abatement expenditures serve as a proxy for the stringency of

environmental regulation. Other papers use energy prices and related regulations as the mechanism that

induces innovation. Although the observed price changes might not be policy-related, the results can also

be applied to situations where policy affects prices, such as a carbon tax. Newell et al. (1999) use an

approach closely related to hedonic techniques to study the effect of both energy prices and energy

efficiency regulations on technological advances in energy efficiency for air conditioners and natural gas

water heaters. They find that energy prices have the largest inducement effect, although they do not

estimate a price elasticity. In a series of studies (Popp 2001, 2002), I use patent data to estimate both the

relationship between energy prices and innovative activity and the effect that this induced knowledge has

on energy consumption. The results of these papers are discussed in greater detail in the subsequent

sections.



B. Diffusion

        Of course, induced invention and innovation is only half the story. Technological advances are of

little use unless society makes use of the innovation. Thus, diffusion is also important. Diffusion is likely
Lessons From Patents: Using Patents To Measure Technological Change in Environmental Models              4


to play a particularly important role for problems dealing with long-term consequences, such as climate

change. Most innovation takes place in highly industrialized countries. In 1998, 85 percent of all R&D

done in the OECD countries was done in just 7 countries. In fact, roughly 44 percent of all OECD R&D

was done in the United States alone. (National Science Board, 2002) For example, as policymakers pay

increased attention to potential increases in fossil fuel consumption for fast-growing countries such as

China, it is important to not only pay attention to how policy will help induce the development of new

technologies, but how policy can help encourage the adoption of these technologies in developing

countries.

        Studies of the diffusion of individual technologies consistently find that diffusion is a gradual

process. Typically, the rate of diffusion can be represented by a sigmoid, or “S-shaped” curve over time:

the rate of adoption rises slowly at first, speeds up, and then levels off as market saturation approaches.

Figure 1 illustrates such a curve, with market penetration plotted on the y-axis, and the passage of time

plotted on the x-axis.

        Traditionally, researchers have used one of two approaches to modeling diffusion of a new

technology. The epidemic model of diffusion proposes that information is the primary factor limiting

diffusion. Adoption is slow at first, as few people (or firms) know about the technology. However, as

more people adopt the technology, knowledge of the technology spreads quickly, leading to a period of

rapid adoption. Economists often use the analogy of a contagious disease to describe this period of

adoption – the more people “infected” by the technology, the more likely that others will also be

“infected”. Eventually, few potential adopters remain, as nearly everyone has adopted the technology, so

that the rate of adoption levels off again. Using this framework, Griliches (1957) noted that the rate of

diffusion is at least partially determined by economic factors, such as the expected rate of return for

adoption. Other work using the epidemic model, such as Mansfield (1968), Davies (1979), and Oster

(1982), typically focus on firm characteristics, such as firm size, to explain variations in the rate of

diffusion. In this framework, environmental policy enters as one of the economic factors affecting

adoption.
Lessons From Patents: Using Patents To Measure Technological Change in Environmental Models                     5


        The second approach to studying diffusion focuses is the probit model (David 1969). The probit

model focuses on heterogeneity among firms. In this model, firm heterogeneity leads to a distribution of

expected return from adopting the new technology. Since adoption is costly, only firms above a threshold

great enough to justify the costs of adoption will choose to adopt the technology at any given time. Over

time, the technology gets cheaper, and its quality improves, so that more firms cross the adoption

threshold.3 In this framework, environmental policy enters by increasing the expected returns from

adopting environmentally-friendly technology, and thus increasing the likelihood that firms will cross the

threshold.

        Although there is a broad economics literature on diffusion, both at the national and international

level, few articles link diffusion and environmental policy. Rose and Joskow (1990) find that the

adoption of fuel-saving technology by U.S. electric utilities is positively correlated with fuel prices. Jaffe

and Stavins (1995) find that higher energy prices lead to greater use of insulation in new home

construction, but that the costs of installation are a more important consideration. Both Gray and

Shadbegian (1998) and Kerr and Newell (2001) show that environmental regulations increase the

probability of adopting environmentally-friendly technologies, and that the response varies by firm

characteristics.

        Similarly, at the international level, there is a large body of research on technological diffusion in

general (surveyed by Keller 2001), but little work focusing specifically on environmental technologies.

One exception is Lanjouw and Mody (1996). Using patent data from the US, Japan, Germany, and 14

low-and middle-income countries, they find that environmentally-friendly innovation increases as

pollution abatement cost expenditures in the country increase. For the US, Japan, and Germany, the

majority of these patents are typically domestic patents. For the developing countries, the majority of

these patents come from foreign countries, highlighting the importance of diffusion. Given the importance


3
  Note that the two models suggest different interpretations of the gradual rate of diffusion. The epidemic model
suggests that adoption generates positive externalities, and is thus slower than would be optimal. Conversely, the
probit model suggests that gradual diffusion is optimal, as differences in adoption decisions simply result from
profit-maximizing decisions by heterogeneous firms.
Lessons From Patents: Using Patents To Measure Technological Change in Environmental Models                      6


of diffusion for bringing new environmental technologies to developing countries, understanding the

general lessons from empirical work on international diffusion is important. These lessons are discussed

in Section V.



II. Using Patent Data to Study Environmental Technological Change

        Several possible data sources exist for studying technological change and the environment. R&D

data offer a straightforward measure of innovative activity. Diffusion studies often make use of adoption

data for specific technologies. In comparison, patent data are not as straightforward. Patent counts

should be expected to increase as R&D activity increases, but the correlation need not be exact.

Furthermore, the existence of a patent does not mean that the technology has been adopted. Indeed,

studies of the economic value of patents find that most patents have little commercial value, suggesting

that adoption of most patented inventions is not widespread (see, for example, Lanjouw et al. 1998).

Nonetheless, patent data offer several advantages when studying technological change and its effect on

the environment.

        Unlike more aggregate data such as R&D expenditures, patents provide a detailed record of each

invention. From the bibliographic data on a patent, the researcher can learn the identity and home country

of the inventor, read a description of the invention, and see references to earlier patents. Using this data,

it is possible for researchers to collect data in highly disaggregated forms. Whereas R&D data are

typically available only for specific industries or general applications,4 patent classifications can be used

to distinguish between different types of R&D at great detail, such as air pollution control devices

designed to reduce NOX emissions versus devices designed to control SO2 emissions.5 In addition,

economists have found that patents, sorted by their date of application, provide a good indicator of R&D



4
  For example, in the US, R&D data is available from 1972-1994 for air pollution control, but it is not broken down
by pollutant.
5
  For example, US patent classes 423/235-423/239 pertain to control of “nitrogen or (a) nitrogenous component”,
and patent classes 423/242 – 423/244 and 423/569 – 423/570 pertain to control of sulfur compounds. Using patent
databases, it is possible to download all patents in these classes.
Lessons From Patents: Using Patents To Measure Technological Change in Environmental Models                       7


activity (see, for example, Griliches 1990). As a result, patent counts not only serve as a measure of

innovative output, but are indicative of the level of innovative activity itself.

        Furthermore, patent data are available from many different countries.               Sources such as the

European Patent Office make available data from virtually every country.6 Of course, such data can be

used to examine levels of innovative activity across countries. In addition, unlike R&D data, international

patent data can be used to track patterns of diffusion. The legal protections granted by a patent only apply

in the country in which the patent has been granted. Thus, inventors who intend to market a product in

several countries may choose to patent in each potential market. Economists have used patent families –

sets of patents related to the same invention that have been filed in various countries – to track diffusion

of knowledge across countries (e.g. Lanjouw and Mody 1996).

        Finally, when a patent is granted, it contains citations to earlier patents that are related to the

current invention. The citations are placed in the patent after consultations among the applicant, his or

her patent attorney, and the patent examiner. It is the applicant’s responsibility to list any related previous

patents of which he or she is aware. In addition, the examiner, who specializes in just a few patent

classifications, will add other patents to the citations, as well as subtracting any irrelevant patents cited by

the inventor. Patent citations narrow the reach of the new patent by placing the patents cited outside the

realm of the current patent, so it is important that all relevant patents be included in the citations.7 For the

same reason, inventors have an incentive to make sure that no unnecessary patents are cited. As a result,

the previous patents cited by a new patent should be a good indicator of previous knowledge that was

utilized by the inventor.8

  Details about the data available through the esp@cnet, the European Patent Office’s interface for world patent
data, can be found at http://ep.espacenet.com/.
7
    “Outside the realm” means that the patent holder cannot file an infringement suit against someone whose
invention infringes on qualities of the patented invention that were also included in patents cited by the patent
holder.
8
  The key assumption here is that a citation made to a previous patent indicates a flow of knowledge from the cited
patent to the citing patent, so that patents cited more frequently are considered more valuable to future inventors.
Jaffe, Fogarty, and Banks (1998) investigate the validity of this assumption, using evidence from citations made to
NASA patents. They conclude that, although there is noise in the citation process, aggregate citation patterns
represent knowledge spillovers, although the spillover may be indirect.
Lessons From Patents: Using Patents To Measure Technological Change in Environmental Models                      8


        In recent years, several economists have used patent citations as a measure of knowledge flows.

Papers using citation data to capture the flows of knowledge across inventors (such as across institutions

or across nations) include Jaffe, Fogarty, and Banks (1998), Jaffe and Trajtenberg (1996), Caballero and

Jaffe (1993), Jaffe, Henderson, and Trajtenberg (1993), and Johnson and Popp (2003). Similarly, Popp

(2002) uses patent citation data to proxy for knowledge flows across time, by using citation-weighted

patent counts as a measure of knowledge available for future inventors to build upon.

        Nonetheless, when working with patent data, it is important to be aware of its limitations. The

existing literature on the benefits and drawbacks of using patent data is quite large.9 Most importantly,

the quality of individual patents varies widely. Some inventions are extremely valuable, whereas others

are of almost no commercial value. This is partly a result of the random nature of the inventive process.

Accordingly, the results of studies using patent data are best interpreted as the effect of an “average”

patent, rather than any specific invention.

        In addition, although the decision to file a patent obviously follows from the decision to perform

R&D, not all successful research results are patented. In return for receiving the monopoly rights inferred

by a patent, the inventor is required to publicly disclose the invention. Rather than make this disclosure,

inventors may prefer to keep an invention secret. Surveys of inventors indicate that the rate at which new

innovations are patented varies across industry (Levin et al. 1987). As such, this propensity must be

controlled for.10




9
  Griliches (1990) provides a useful survey.
10
   For example, in Popp (2002), which studies advances in energy technologies, I control for changes in the
propensity to patent by using the percentage of all successful domestic patent applications per year in each
technology field as the measure of innovative activity. Policy changes that affect patenting in all patent
classifications would lead to a change in both the total number of patent applications and the number of pollution
control patent applications in a given year. For example, a change in patent law that increases the propensity to
patent by five percent would increase both the numerator and the denominator of my measure of innovation by five
percent. Although this still requires that the propensity to patent did not vary independently within the pollution
control industry, such an assumption is not nearly as strong as assuming the overall propensity to patent has
remained constant.

III. Key Lessons from Empirical Studies of Innovation

        Much of my research has focused on using patent data to study the links between policy and

environmentally-friendly innovation. In my empirical work, I aim both to better understand how policy

affects the evolution of technology, as well as to develop estimates of the magnitudes of these effects. I

use these estimates to calibrate a simulation of climate change policy with induced technological change.

In this section I offer several key lessons from this research. Section IV follows with the implications of

this work for climate policy.



Lesson #1: Innovation responds quickly to incentives

        Perhaps the most striking finding in my empirical work is the speed at which innovative activity

responds to incentives. Consider, for example, Figure 2, taken from Popp (2002), which shows how

patenting activity for various energy technologies responded to changes in energy prices. As is typical in

the economics of innovation literature, the patents in this figure are sorted by their application date. As

noted earlier, patents sorted by application date are a good indicator of R&D activity. Technologies such

as solar energy experienced large jumps in patenting activity immediately following the first energy

crisis. For example, in 1972 there were just 10 solar energy patents. This figure jumps to 36 in 1973, 104

in 1974, and 218 by 1975.

        Using a distributed lag model, Popp (2002) estimates the elasticity of energy patenting activity

with respect to energy prices for 11 different technologies. The distributed lag model is consistent with

an adaptive expectations model of prices, in which expected future prices depend on a weighted average

of past prices, so that

(1)      PE*,t = PE ,t + λPE ,t −1 + λ 2 PE ,t − 2 L + λt −1 PE ,1 ,

where P*E,t is the expected price at time t, and PE,t represents actual energy prices in year t. The

adjustment coefficient, λ, represents the weights placed on past observations. Popp (2002) finds a long-

run energy R&D elasticity of 0.354, and an adjustment coefficient of 0.829. As such, the mean lag occurs
Lessons From Patents: Using Patents To Measure Technological Change in Environmental Models                10


in 3.71 years, and the median lag in 4.86 years. The interpretation here is that over one-half of the full

effect of an energy price increase on R&D will have been experienced after just five years. Thus, prices

(or other regulations that increase the cost of using fossil fuels) can be expected to stimulate new research

quickly.



Lesson #2: Innovation in a given field experiences diminishing returns over time

           Referring again to Figure 2, note that not only does energy R&D respond quickly to energy

prices, but it also drops off more quickly than energy prices. Energy prices do not reach a peak until

1981. Nonetheless, patenting activity in most technologies peaks in the late 1970s. Had the returns to

energy R&D remained constant over time, we would expect patenting activities in these fields to remain

high until prices began to fall. These results suggest that the possibility of diminishing returns to research

should be explored.

           Popp (2002) shows that the returns to R&D are an important determinant of the level of

innovative activity. Inventors “stand on the shoulders” of their predecessors. As a result, the quality of

the existing knowledge on which an inventor can build is an important, positive contributor to the level of

innovative activity in a given year. I use patent citations as evidence of the existing state of technology

when an invention was completed. Citations to an earlier patent suggest that the previous patent provided

technological knowledge upon which the current inventor could build. Frequent citations to a patent

provide evidence that the knowledge embodied in that invention has been particularly useful to other

inventors. To verify the importance of the existing knowledge stock on innovative activity, I use citation

data to create stocks of patented knowledge, where patents in the stock are weighted by their propensity to

be cited. I find that the stocks have a significant positive effect on energy R&D activity.

           Furthermore, patterns of citation suggest that diminishing returns are important. I find the

likelihood of citations to new energy patents falls over time, suggesting that the quality of knowledge
Lessons From Patents: Using Patents To Measure Technological Change in Environmental Models                          11


available for inventors to build upon also falls.11 The intuition here is that, as more and more discoveries

are made, it gets harder to develop a new innovation that improves upon the existing technology. Since

the quality of the knowledge stock is an important determinant of the level of innovative activity,

decreasing quality of the knowledge stock over time means that diminishing returns to R&D investment

will result in lower levels of induced R&D over time.

         In addition, although diminishing returns are important, such returns should not vary

monotonically. Rather, as it is prior research that affects the potential success of future inventors, the

returns to research should vary along with the quality of the existing pool of research. To verify the value

of using patent citation data to measure the returns to research, Popp (2002) also includes regressions in

which the stock of knowledge is replaced by a time trend. If diminishing returns proceed monotonically

over time, a negative time trend should work as well as the weighted knowledge stocks. That, however, is

not the case. These regressions prove unreliable. In fact, the elasticity of energy R&D to energy prices

appears negative when a time trend is used in place of the knowledge stocks. Since diminishing returns

are a bigger problem when the level of energy R&D is highest, not controlling for them counteracts the

positive effect of prices on energy R&D.

         Finally, it is important to note that the notion of diminishing returns within a given field is not

inconsistent with the general notion that there are increasing returns to research. Here, diminishing

returns refers to the expected returns on the inputs of the R&D process – the likelihood of success from

additional R&D dollars spent in the energy field falls as more dollars are spent. When economists refer to

increasing returns to research, they are referring to the returns on the output of research. These increasing

returns result from the public goods nature of knowledge – once an invention is created, it can benefit

everyone, and thus any individual inventor is likely to capture only a subset of the social value of his or

her invention. Furthermore, as the expected returns to research in any one field decrease, we would

expect researchers to shift more resources to more promising fields. Thus, diminishing returns over time


11
  Note that since the probability of a patent being cited depends not only on the quality of the patent, but also on the
number of patents that follow, it is important to look at probability of citation, rather than raw citation counts.
Lessons From Patents: Using Patents To Measure Technological Change in Environmental Models            12


within a field need not result in diminishing returns for all research over time. However, when focusing

on innovation in a single field, such as energy-saving research in a climate change model, including

diminishing returns is important.



Lesson #3 – A Time Trend is Not a Substitute for Technological Change

        Typically, papers that attempt to assess the impact of technological change have done so using a

time trend to control for technological advances. Unfortunately, such results may be misleading when

translated into climate models incorporating induced innovation. The very notion of induced innovation

suggests that changes such as new policies or price shocks should change the nature of R&D. Using a

time trend to proxy for technological change does not allow for such a reaction. In addition, using a time

trend only captures the overall effect of technological change. For example, low energy prices make it

likely that energy use per unit output will increase, making technological change appear energy-using.

That does not mean, however, that no energy saving technologies are created and adopted during periods

of low energy prices.

        Examples of the problem of interpreting time trends can be found by comparing empirical studies

from different eras. In a study of U.S. industrial energy consumption from 1958 to 1974, Jorgenson and

Fraumeni (1981) found that technological change was energy-using – energy use per unit output increased

over time.   Of course, the time period of their data would not include any of the energy saving

innovations developed after the energy crises of the 1970s. Indeed, more recent work using a time trend

to capture technological change finds that technology is energy saving. Examples include Berndt et al.

(1993), Mountain et al. (1989) and Sterner (1990). Similarly, two empirical studies on the effect of new

flue gas desulfurization (FGD) technologies use time trends to reach different conclusions on

technological change. Looking at scrubbers installed by 1992, Bellas (1998) finds no significant evidence

of technological change in abatement technology. In contrast, Carlson et al. (2000) find that about 20%,

or $50, of the change in marginal abatement costs that have occurred from 1985 to 1995 can be attributed

to technological change. Such a change would be predicted by economic theory predicting market based
Lessons From Patents: Using Patents To Measure Technological Change in Environmental Models                13


policies induce more technological change, as Bellas’ data includes few scrubbers installed after passage

of the 1990 CAA, and none installed after trading in SO2 permits began. As shown in Popp (2003a), one

reason for this change is that the nature of R&D shifted after permit trading began.

        To illustrate the use of patents to estimate the effect of technological change, Popp (2001) uses

energy patents to estimate the effect of new technology on energy consumption. In that paper, I use patent

data to create stocks of knowledge. First, I match energy patents with the industries that use the

inventions. Then, I create stocks of energy knowledge, which are used as an explanatory variable in a

system of cost functions for 13 energy intensive industries. The knowledge stocks are defined as:

                            ∞
(2)              K i ,t = ∑ e − β1 ( s ) (1 − e − β 2 ( s +1) ) PATi , s ,
                           s =0


where Ki,t represents the knowledge stock in industry i at time t, s represents an index of years up to and

including year t, PATi,s represents the number of energy patents used by industry i in year s, β1 represents

a rate of decay, and β2 is a rate of diffusion. The stocks allow me to estimate the effect of a new patent on

energy consumption. By combining these results with the induced innovation results discussed above, I

calculate the effect of induced innovation as the combined effect of all new patents induced by a price

change. I find that induced innovation accounts for approximately one-third of the change in energy

consumption that occurs after a price change. Furthermore, the estimated elasticities of energy use with

respect to price found in that paper are lower than typically found, as they include only the effect of factor

substitution. By comparison, when the regressions from Popp (2001) are run using only a time trend to

represent technological change, the resulting energy price elasticities are consistent with those found in

other studies, and are comparable to the combined induced innovation elasticity and energy price

elasticity estimated using knowledge stocks. Table 1, taken from Popp (2001), illustrates these results for

selected technologies.

        The table shows the short-run breakdown in the effects on energy consumption from a change in

energy prices. The elasticity of energy use with respect to induced innovation is the percent change in

energy consumption resulting from the new technologies induced by a one percent change in energy
Lessons From Patents: Using Patents To Measure Technological Change in Environmental Models              14


prices. The elasticity of energy use with respect to price is the change in energy consumption resulting

from factor substitution. Column three shows the total effect of a change in energy prices. It is the sum

of the elasticities in columns one and two. Column 4 presents the percentage of the total elasticity that is

due to induced innovation. Finally, column 5 gives the elasticity of energy with respect to price from a

regression that excludes the knowledge stocks, so that only a time trend is used to capture technological

change. Note that these elasticities are comparable to the combined elasticities presented in column 3.

One implication here is that even models calibrated on typical estimates of energy price elasticity include

some effects of technological change in them. Incorporating endogenous technological change into these

models reveals the marginal effect of additional innovation induced by policy, but not the total effect of

all technological innovations.



Lesson #4 – The Social Returns to Environmental Research are High

          This lesson is not unique to environmental research. Consistently, economists studying the

returns to research have found that the social returns are higher than the private returns to R&D. The

reason for this is that the knowledge created by such research is a public good. Once new knowledge is

publicly available, it can be applied repeatedly without decay. Moreover, without public policy, such as

intellectual property rights, others cannot be excluded from making use of the new knowledge. As such,

firms are unable to capture the entire social value of their research investment, and thus underinvest in

research. Examples of such studies include Mansfield (1977, 1996), Pakes (1985), Jaffe (1986), and Hall

(1995).

          My research of environmental and energy technologies confirms that the social returns to

research in these fields are comparable to that in other fields. As such, it provides a useful guide for

calibrating the returns to R&D in climate policy models. In Popp (2001), I examine the effect of new

knowledge, measure by patents, on energy consumption in 13 energy-intensive industries. The median

patent leads to $14.5 million dollars in long-run energy savings. In comparison, these industries spend an

average of $2.25 million of R&D per patent. Using similar techniques, Popp (2003a) examines the effect
Lessons From Patents: Using Patents To Measure Technological Change in Environmental Models                         15


of flue gas desulfurization (FGD) unit innovation on coal-fired electric power plants. Included in that

paper is an estimate of the cost-savings that result from innovation. A single patent provides a present

value of $6 million in total cost savings across the industry. On average, about $1.5 million of R&D are

spent per patent granted.12



Lesson #5 – The type of policy used affects the nature of new innovations

         Theoretical papers concerning the innovation incentives offered by various environmental

policies consistently find that market mechanisms, such as emissions fees or tradable permits, offer

greater incentives for innovation. Although most empirical work verifies these predictions, it is important

to note that the superiority of market mechanisms for encouraging innovation depend not only on the level

of innovation induced, but also on the quality of innovation induced.

         As an example of this, Popp (2003a) finds that the level of innovation for FGD units was actually

higher before tradable sulfur dioxide (SO2) permits were introduced by the 1990 Clean Air Act (CAA).

However, the nature of innovation changed after passage of the Act. Before the 1990 Clean Air Act, most

new coal-fired electric utilities were required to install FGD units with a removal efficiency of 90%.13

Since installation of FGD units was mandatory, innovation focused on reducing the operating costs of

these units. However, since there were no incentives for firms to exceed the 90% limit, innovation had no

effect on the removal efficiency of FGD units.

         In contrast, by offering fewer permits, the 1990 CAA required greater SO2 emissions reductions,

but did not specify how those reductions be met. While some firms chose to use more efficient FGD


12
   Two caveats are important. First, these studies focused on energy-intensive industries, where the likelihood of
significant savings was high. Care should be taken in generalizing the results to other, less energy-intensive sectors.
At the macro level, this implies that the rate of return may be lower if significant energy R&D efforts are directed at
less promising research areas. Furthermore, this lesson should not be read as implying that public R&D dollars
should be non-discriminately directed towards energy research, because past successes do not guarantee future high
rates of return. Private rates of return are high because firms tend to direct research towards more promising
projects.
13
   Specifically, plants needed to either achieve emission rates less than 1.2 lbs SO2/million Btu heat input and reduce
90 percent of their potential SO2 emissions (a 90% removal efficiency) or achieve emission rates less than 0.6 lbs
SO2/million Btu heat input and achieve 70% removal efficiency. Potential SO2 emissions are calculated based on
the sulfur content of the fuel burned.
Lessons From Patents: Using Patents To Measure Technological Change in Environmental Models                  16


units, others were able to achieve reductions using alternative techniques, such as low-sulfur coal

(Ellerman et al. 1997). While the overall level of FGD innovation was lower after passage of the 1990

CAA, the post-1990 innovations had a more positive environmental effect. During the 1990 CAA

regime, the knowledge created each year increased the removal efficiency of FGD units by 1.71%.

Indeed, in 1995 (the first year of trading in the SO2 permit program), 11 new FGD units with a removal

efficiency of 95% or higher were installed.

        One possibility for the lower level of innovation is that fewer firms need to innovate in the post-

90 regime. Regulations requiring a specific technology gave every affected firm incentive to innovate in

ways that lowered the costs of compliance. However, the greater flexibility of permit trading offers firms

several ways to comply. Some firms could lower pollution by switching to cleaner coal. Other firms, if

necessary, could simply purchase permits from firms with lower marginal abatement costs. Only a subset

of firms found that installing more efficient scrubbers to be the best method for meeting new pollution

reduction targets.

        Nonetheless, because of the public goods nature of new knowledge, having fewer innovating

firms, but more promising innovations developed, is more beneficial to society. Once the know-how to

produce 95% efficient scrubbers exists, it can be adopted by other firms.14 As an analogy, consider

research to develop more fuel efficient cars. Society would benefit more from one firm that develops the

ability to reduce emissions completely by developing a cost-effective solar-powered car, as opposed to

several firms developing cars with slightly greater fuel efficiency.         Given this, it is important for

policymakers to be cognizant of not only the level of research induced by policy, but how different

policies may shape the outcome of this research.




14
   This assumes that there is a regulatory incentive to do so. Compared to emissions fees, this is a weakness of
tradable permits, as the total emissions level remains fixed even after a more promising technology is found, as
adopters of the new technology are able to sell unused permits to other firms.

IV. Implications for Climate Change

         Despite the growing evidence that environmental policy influences the direction of technological

change, few climate change models directly incorporate links between policy and technology.15 Those

that do typically model innovation in one of two ways. Bottom-up models include a detailed specification

of energy systems.         These models typically do not include detailed modeling of the overall

macroeconomy, and typically model induced technological change in a learning-by-doing framework, in

which the costs of various technologies decrease with experience. Examples include Gerlagh and van der

Zwaan (2003), Manne and Richels (2002), Grübler and Messner (1998), and Messner (1997). Top-down

models focus on the links between environmental policy and macroeconomic performance. Endogenous

technological change in these models typically comes through accumulated investment in research and

development (R&D). Recent models of this nature include Goulder and Schneider (1999), Nordhaus

(2002), and Buonanno et al. (2003).

         However, none of the existing models make use of empirical estimates on the nature of

technological change to calibrate the model. In recent work, I have begun to use the results of these

empirical studies to explore the effect of induced technological change (ITC) in models of climate

change. I use the estimates obtained in previous work to guide the development and calibration of a top-

down model of endogenous technological change that is supported by empirical evidence. My work

builds on the well-known DICE model of climate change (1994). The DICE model is a dynamic growth

model of the global economy that includes links between economic activity, carbon emissions, and the

climate. Because it includes both costs and benefits of climate change, it allows the modeler to simulate

optimal paths for control of carbon emissions. I modify the basic DICE model to include a fossil fuel




15
   The results of Chakravorty, Roumasset, and Tse (1997) show why considering the link between policy and
technological change is important. They present a simulation showing that the development of alternative fuels
lowers the projected temperature increases caused by global warming from 3-6 degrees centigrade to just 1-2
degrees centigrade. Unfortunately, they do not model the development of such technologies, but rather assume that
they continue to develop at historical rates. Since much of the development of alternatives such as solar energy
occurred during the period of high energy prices during the late 1970s, assuming that historical rate of technological
progress will continue without policy stimulation is unrealistic, and may lead to overly optimistic results.
Lessons From Patents: Using Patents To Measure Technological Change in Environmental Models                    18


sector and an energy research sector.16        The modified model is called ENTICE, for ENdogenous

Technological change.

        Although the DICE model is a greatly simplified macroeconomic representation of the global

economy and the environment, the relative transparency of the model makes sensitivity analysis

straightforward.    Existing models of technological change and the environment include differing

assumptions about features such as imperfect research markets, the potential crowding out effects of

energy R&D, and key elasticities. The ENTICE framework allows detailed sensitivity analysis of these

assumptions, helping to rectify the differences found in various models. To illustrate the importance of

the lessons presented earlier, in this section I highlight key results from this still ongoing work.



Implication #1: The Long-Run Effects of Technological Change are Important

        To compare welfare with and without induced technological change, I calculate the net economic

impact for an optimal climate change policy with and without ITC. The net economic impact of a policy

is the present value of consumption under the policy minus the present value of consumption in the base

case, in which carbon emissions are uncontrolled. Because the DICE model and its variants incorporate

environmental damages into the model, it is possible to calculate an optimal carbon policy, in which the

marginal costs of carbon abatement equal the marginal benefits of lower emissions.                     Typically,

simulations involving these models find that the optimal policy is to go slow. Since carbon emissions

remain in the atmosphere for several hundred years, the marginal damages resulting from any new

emissions are modest. Thus, gradually phasing in carbon reduction lowers the opportunity cost of

reducing emissions without having much impact on the global climate.

        In the base case of the ENTICE model, ITC increases net economic welfare by 8.3% over a

model with exogenous technological change. However, environmental benefits are negligible. Even after

100 years, there is practically no change (less than 1%) in average global temperature when ITC is added


16
  The fossil fuel sector is similar to that used in the RICE model, which is the regional version of DICE. Details
can be found in Popp (2003b).
Lessons From Patents: Using Patents To Measure Technological Change in Environmental Models             19


to the model. Nor is there much change in the optimal level of the carbon tax. Rather, welfare benefits

come from cost savings, in that emissions goals can be reached more cheaply.

        Also notable is that the cumulative effect of R&D is important. Figure 3 compares net welfare

with endogenous and exogenous technological change. The figure shows the cumulative welfare gains

over time for simulations without a backstop technology. Note that, in the years immediately after the

implementation of the carbon tax, the welfare gains are actually lower when ITC is included in the model.

Although R&D responds quickly to the carbon tax, in these early years, the opportunity costs of

performing additional R&D outweigh the potential benefits of more efficient energy technology.

However, since the benefits of R&D are cumulative, future research builds on these early successes, and

by 2125, the welfare gains from the model with ITC surpass those in the exogenous technology

simulations. As noted in Lesson #2 above, the productivity of future research depends on the productivity

of the knowledge on which they can build. Thus, research done today not only offers the benefit of

potential energy savings, but also serves to make future research more productive.

        Finally, note that the difference between the exogenous and ITC case soon stabilizes. Here we

see the importance of diminishing returns over time. Over time, finding new research successes in the

energy savings field becomes more and more difficult, so that the welfare gains from ITC cannot grow

continuously.



Implication #2 – The opportunity cost of R&D is important

        Recall from Lesson #4 that the social returns of R&D are typically higher than the private returns.

This offers an important limitation to the effect of ITC. To the extent that energy R&D crowds out other

forms of research, similarly productive research in other areas is reduced.

        Based on the results from lesson #4 above, in the ENTICE model, I assume energy R&D

spending has a social rate of return four times greater than its private rate of return. Fifty percent

crowding out is assumed – that is, half of new energy R&D spending displaces other R&D spending,

which also has a social rate of return four times greater than its private rate of return. The rate of
Lessons From Patents: Using Patents To Measure Technological Change in Environmental Models                  20


crowding out is based on changes in U.S. private sector R&D that occurred between 1972-1998.

Sensitivity analysis shows that the opportunity cost is an important limitation on the potential benefits of

ITC.   When crowding out is removed from the ENTICE model, welfare gains from ITC increase to as

much as 43.6%, compared to 8.3% in the base case with partial crowding out. Similarly, with complete
                                                                         17
crowding out, the welfare gain from ITC falls to as little as 2.1%.           Such results help to explain the

differences between models. For example, Nordhaus (2002), who finds little impact for ITC, assumes a

fixed supply of R&D labor, so that complete crowding out of other R&D occurs as energy R&D

increases. In comparision, Buonanno et al. (2003) assume that environmental R&D and other R&D are

complements, rather than substitutes. Not surprisingly, they find a much larger potential impact for ITC.

In addition, these results explain why top-down models assuming a learning curve, but not including

policy-induced innovation, tend to find larger benefits from technological change than bottom-down

models. Although learning by doing models do include an opportunity cost from increasing investment in

alternative energy sources, this cost is simply the loss of one dollar of potential investment elsewhere, as

opposed to the loss of more productive R&D dollars from elsewhere in the economy. As a result,

learning-by-doing models will overstate the potential gains from technological improvements.

        An important policy implication of crowding out is that it limits the potential of ITC under more

restrictive climate policies. Since more restrictive policies induce more energy R&D than the optimal

policy derived in ENTICE, the opportunity cost of lost R&D in other sectors becomes greater. To see this,

consider the results of a simulation restricting global carbon emissions at 1995 levels, taken from Popp

(2003b). Whereas including ITC improved welfare by 8.3% in the optimal policy simulation, welfare

only improves by 5.6% in this simulation when ITC is included. The importance of crowding out for this

result can be seen by eliminating crowding out from the simulation. Doing so increases the net welfare



17
   In Popp (2003b), I present upper and lower bounds of the influence of opportunity cost in the ENTICE model.
The upper bound estimates assume that R&D levels change as the opportunity costs change. The lower bound
estimates change the opportunity cost, but constrain R&D to remain at the base case levels. The later can be
interpreted as the gains from removing the assumption of partial crowding out. They are not the gains that would
result if the government intervened to remedy the problem of partial crowding out.
Lessons From Patents: Using Patents To Measure Technological Change in Environmental Models                     21


gain by 46%. A similar experiment in the optimal policy scenario only increases the welfare gain by just

14%.18



Implication #3 – Market failures for knowledge are important

         As noted in lesson #4, the high rates of return that make the opportunity cost of R&D important

are the result of market failures in markets for knowledge. The public goods nature of knowledge causes

firms to underinvest in R&D. To model these imperfections, the base ENTICE model constrains the

social rate of return on R&D to be four times greater than that of the return on other investment. The

problem of underinvestment could be addressed by subsidies to energy R&D, if government investments

in R&D are set so that all social returns are captured. Models that do not include market failures, such as

Buonanno et al. (2003) implicitly assume that government R&D subsidies sufficient to correct all market

failures are in place.

         Simulations removing the constraint on returns to R&D suggest that the returns on such subsidies

could be quite significant. The gain from ETC for the optimal policy improves to 14.0% when energy

subsidies are considered. Similarly, adding R&D subsidies to the endogenous R&D case increases the net

welfare gain to seven percent in the more restrictive policy case.



V. Future Research – Whither Diffusion?

         The simulation results presented above, while preliminary, not only suggest important policy

implications, but also fruitful avenues for future research. In particular, one area of great importance is

the diffusion of new energy technologies, particularly across countries. In nearly all of the models

discussed above, diffusion is not an issue.19 For example, both R&DICE and ENTICE are global models.

As such, once a technology is available, it can be used worldwide. Similarly, Goulder and Schneider’s

model focuses only on the United States. Assuming quick diffusion of technologies within a country is

18
   These results use the lower bound of the opportunity costs simulations. This holds R&D the same in both the high
and low opportunity cost case, to isolate the opportunity cost of the induced research in the base case.
19
   Buonanno et al. (2003) is an exception.
Lessons From Patents: Using Patents To Measure Technological Change in Environmental Models                 22


reasonable, and supported by empirical evidence (see, for example, Popp 2001). However, there is no

reason to expect that diffusion between countries should occur at the same rate. For example, research at

the domestic level might be needed to adopt foreign knowledge to domestic conditions. Just as the

empirical literature on knowledge spillovers finds that spillovers are greatest among similar industries, we

would also expect adoption of technologies to be quickest in similar countries.20

        At the international level, there is a large body of research on technological diffusion in general

(surveyed by Keller 2001), but little work focusing specifically on environmental technologies. As noted

earlier, the one exception is Lanjouw and Mody (1996). Suggesting the importance of diffusion, they find

that the majority of environmental technology patents in developing countries come from foreign

countries. Moreover, they find that policies in one nation may affect innovation of technologies in a

second nation. Looking at motor vehicles, they note that the majority of vehicle air emissions patents

granted in the U.S. are from foreign nations, even though the US was the first country to adopt strict

emissions standards.

        Given the importance of diffusion for bringing new environmental technologies to developing

countries, understanding the general lessons from empirical work on international diffusion is important.

There are two potential avenues through which foreign knowledge can have an influence in the domestic

economy. First, foreign inventions may be adopted directly by domestic firms. Second, rather than being

directly adopted by domestic users, foreign knowledge may affect the productivity of domestic R&D.

The “blueprints” represented by foreign patents may serve to inspire additional innovation by domestic

inventors. Such productivity increases are knowledge spillovers, as the knowledge represented by the

foreign patent creates a positive externality – knowledge from abroad that is borrowed by the domestic

inventor (Griliches 1979).




20
  At the industry level, Cohen and Levinthal (1989) show that firm R&D increases the ability of firms to absorb
knowledge spillovers. If such R&D is needed for spillovers to occur, the opportunity cost of this R&D must be
considered. Although such considerations are not included in a global model such as ENTICE, they are important
for sector-specific computable general equilibrium (CGE) models.
Lessons From Patents: Using Patents To Measure Technological Change in Environmental Models               23


        Since most R&D takes place in just a few countries, both types of diffusion are important. For

direct adoption, many of the same lessons from diffusion studies within a country apply here as well. In

particular, local conditions are an important determinant of the rate of diffusion across countries.

Regarding knowledge spillovers, researchers have followed several strategies. At a macro level, several

papers, most notably Coe and Helpman (1995), have estimated the effects of domestic and foreign R&D

stocks on total factor productivity (TFP) growth. Typically, the foreign R&D stocks are weighted by

international trade flows, so that these papers attempt to measure the effect of international trade on

knowledge flows. Such papers typically find a positive effect for foreign R&D, although this effect may

vary by country. In general, the relative contribution of foreign knowledge is inversely related to

economic size and level of development (Keller 2001). At a more micro level, studies looking at the

effect of foreign direct investment (FDI) and foreign knowledge spillovers find mixed results. Whether

the effect of FDI on growth is positive or negative depends on individual industry and country

characteristics, with inward FDI being more successful for developed countries (Keller 2001).

        Such results suggest that diffusion may limit the success of induced innovation as developing

countries begin to make greater use of fossil fuels. Since nearly all R&D is performed in the world’s

richest nations, diffusion of newly developed environmental technologies will be necessary if technology

is to play a role in mitigating future carbon emissions from the developing world. Research on both the

factors that affect the flows of environmentally-friendly technologies across countries, as well as research

on the speed at which such knowledge diffuses, will greatly improve our ability to model the potential

effects of technology on the climate change problem. Patents are likely to be a useful tool for such

research. Since patents are filed in multiple countries, patent data makes it possible to track the usage of

inventions across countries. Such data should be an invaluable source as studies of diffusion progress.

                                   The figure shows the cumulative gains in welfare from an optimal carbon tax. Note that
                                   welfare in the induced innovation is initially lower than exogenous R&D, but that
                                   induced innovation leads to larger long run improvements than in a simulation with
                                   exogenous technological change.

       The table shows the short-run breakdown in the effects on energy consumption from a
       change in energy prices. The elasticity of energy use with respect to induced innovation
       is the percent change in energy consumption resulting from the new technologies induced
       by a one percent change in energy prices. The elasticity of energy use with respect to
       price is the change in energy consumption resulting from factor substitution. Column
       three shows the total effect of a change in energy prices. It is the sum of the elasticities in
       columns one and two. Column 4 presents the percentage of the total elasticity that is due
       to induced innovation. Finally, column 5 gives the elasticity of energy with respect to
       price from a regression that excludes the knowledge stocks, so that only a time trend is
       used to capture technological change. Note that these elasticities are comparable to the
       combined elasticities presented in column 3.
