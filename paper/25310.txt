                                          ABSTRACT

Donald Trump's election and his nomination of Scott Pruitt, a climate skeptic, to lead the
Environmental Protection Agency drastically downshifted expectations on US climate-change
policy. We study firms' stock-price reactions and institutional investors' portfolio adjustments
after these events. As expected, carbon-intensive firms benefited. Should not companies with
responsible strategies on climate change have lost value, since they were paying for actions that
were now less urgent? In fact, investors actually rewarded such firms. The premium the firms
received resulted, at least in part, from the move into climate-responsible stocks by long-horizon
investors presumably expecting a post-Trump rebound to green policy.

1     Introduction

Anecdotal and survey evidence suggests that a growing number of investors attend to

environmental concerns, and climate change in particular, in their investment decisions

(see, e.g., Krueger, Sautner, and Starks 2019). If the marginal investor incorporates factors

related to climate change in his decision-making, then that will hurt the share price for less

climate-conscious companies, and will nudge them toward more climate-sensitive business

practices (Heinkel, Kraus, and Zechner, 2001). If so, market forces will help to promote the

transition to a low-carbon economy. However, there is scant evidence whether, and if so how

strongly, the marginal investor values firms’ climate-related performance. That valuation

will depend on a mix of personal preferences and investors’ assessments of how government

regulations will change and how firms will adapt.

    This paper provides clear evidence that firms’ climate-related performance does affect

their stock market valuations. It shows this by exploiting (a) the price reactions of US

stocks and (b) the changes in the portfolios of institutional investors to the 2016 climate

policy shock. Two salient events comprised this shock: the election of Donald Trump on

November 8, 2016 and the nomination of Scott Pruitt to head the Environmental Protection

Agency (EPA) on December 7, 2016. Pruitt’s selection reinforced beliefs about Trump’s

determination to dismantle or severely curb environmental protection rules and plans in

place at the time. As for (a), as surely was expected, carbon-intensive firms benefited. (The

analysis controls for firms’ differential exposure to other expected policy changes following

the election, such as in tax and trade policy.) However, strikingly, investors also rewarded

companies demonstrating climate responsibility, that is, future-oriented, strategic activities


                                              1
geared towards the transition to a low-carbon economy. Why did this occur? Result

(b) suggests an answer: Long-term institutional investors moved into climate-responsible

stocks, presumably anticipating higher future demand by pro-environment investors and/or a

regulatory boomerang effect leading to stiffer climate policies following the Trump Presidency.

       The shift in climate policy that began at the end of 2016 provides a rare opportunity

to study the impact of corporate climate performance on firm values and investor choices

due to three important factors. First, although climate policy had arguably slowly been

making progress up to the election, Trump’s victory threatened to reverse that slow progress.1

Second, the election outcome was largely unexpected.2 Third, Trump followed through on

his stated policy preferences when he appointed Scott Pruitt, a climate change skeptic, to

head the EPA (and later by indeed withdrawing from the Paris Agreement and replacing the

Clean Power Plan with the Affordable Power Plan).

       Firms differ with respect to both current environmental footprint (say greenhouse gas

emissions) and with respect to climate responsibility, i.e., their future-oriented climate

strategies and voluntary initiatives to take actions that foster the transition to a low-carbon

economy. This distinction gives rise to differentiated hypotheses.

       One would expect firms currently making extensive use of fossil fuels and other ‘‘dirty’’

companies to have benefited from the election outcome relative to firms in cleaner industries.

However, the impact of climate responsibility reflects two opposing forces. On the one
   1
     While Clinton had made fighting climate change a priority (see, e.g., Business Insider, ‘‘Where Hillary
Clinton and Donald Trump stand on climate change’’, October 5, 2016), Trump vowed throughout the
electoral campaign to dismantle a large part of the Obama-era environmental protection and climate policy,
inter alia by scrapping the Clean Power Plan (CPP) and withdrawing the US from the 2016 United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Paris Agreement.
   2
     On Election Day, Betfair gave Hillary Clinton a 83% probability of winning, and FiveThirtyEight gave
her a 72% chance of victory.

hand, the drastic decrease in short-term regulatory risks and costs associated with a Trump

presidency should benefit firms with relatively weak climate strategies. On the other hand,

the expected environmental hostility of the Trump Administration should lead to increased

demand for climate-responsible firms by (i) pro-environmental investors committed to the

transition to a low-carbon economy, and/or (ii) long-term investors expecting such firms

to do better in the long run due to stronger future demand by pro-environmental investors

or stiffer climate regulation post-Trump. Which of these two effects will dominate is an

empirical question.

   Our study follows firms comprising the Russell 3000 index. We measure current emissions

using Carbon intensity, defined as the firm’s annual greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions

divided by its market value of equity (or sales). Efforts focused on curbing future emissions

are represented by Climate responsibility, namely the extent to which a firm has undertaken

voluntary initiatives to manage the risks and opportunities inherent to the transition to a

low-carbon economy. Climate responsibility reflects firms’ adoption of emission reduction

targets and investment plans to curb future emissions (for example by improving energy

efficiency or switching to renewable energy sources). It also reflects the choices of financial

companies to limit exposure to carbon-intensive assets in their loan and investment portfolios.

Importantly, it does not comprise measures taken by firms merely to manage climate-related

physical risks, such as protecting key assets against rising sea levels or stronger hurricanes.

   We obtain data on firms’ carbon emissions and climate responsibility from two leading

providers of ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) data: MSCI KLD and Vigeo Eiris.

Carbon intensity and Climate responsibility are only weakly correlated. This confirms that

they capture different aspects of firms’ climate-related performance.

                                               3
      We begin by studying stock-price reactions. As discussed in Section 2, the Trump

election and the Pruitt appointment have clear advantages and disadvantages relating to the

strength of the surprise and the focus on environmental topics, and analyzing both provides

a comprehensive picture. The analysis controls for other factors including taxes and trade

exposure (Wagner, Zeckhauser, and Ziegler, 2018).

      The first result is that investors reacted to the election by rewarding carbon-intensive

firms. This result accords with the common narrative reported in the media and with basic

economic intuition. Large emitters are those most exposed to the costs of climate regulation.

As such, they are penalized by financial markets when regulation is tightened or expected

to be tightened, for instance through the adoption of a carbon tax. Conversely, they were

rewarded as investor expectations shifted towards a loosening of climate policy.

      Our main surprising result regarding stock-price reactions is that after both the election and

the Pruitt appointment, investors also rewarded companies demonstrating more responsible

climate strategies. The effect is economically significant. For example, firms with an advanced

climate responsibility designation from MSCI KLD -- about 11% of our sample -- earned a 81

(72) basis points higher cumulative CAPM-adjusted (Fama-French-adjusted) return by the

end of the fifth trading day after the election. From the election through year-end 2016, this

differential increased to 225 (157) basis points. Similar findings emerge when using the Vigeo

Eiris climate responsibility measure, and when we extend our analysis to the medium run

through the end of December 2017.

      In the second part of the paper, we analyze how different types of institutional investors

adjusted their portfolio holdings.3 This analysis can shed light on why climate-responsible
  3
      As of 2017, institutional investors held around 78% of the total market capitalization of the Russell 3000


                                                        4
firms outperformed their peers following the 2016 climate policy shock. As indicated above,

at least two forces could contribute to that out-performance. The first is that increased

concerns for global warming may have made pro-environmental investors more willing to

accept a lower rate of return in exchange for the ‘‘warm glow’’ (Andreoni, 1989) received

from investing in such firms, and the simultaneous avoidance of the ‘‘cold shiver’’ of holding

climate-irresponsible firms.4 We call this the Current Preferences hypothesis.

    The second possible explanation is that investors reward climate-responsible firms today

because they expect them to do better in the long-run due to some combination of two reasons:

1. They anticipate that future investors will receive an increased warm glow from holding

such firms in the wake of the Administration, both in response to its tactics and because

environmental conditions have worsened. 2. A boomerang effect leading to substantial

tightening in governmental climate regulation after the Trump Administration departs office,

due to intensified attitudes or worse environmental conditions. We call this the Future

Expectations hypothesis. (In fact, recent survey results indicate that since Trump was elected,

Americans became increasingly concerned about climate change.5 In mid-2019, a boomerang in

climate regulation appears possible. The Green New Deal, supported by multiple progressive

candidates for the Democratic nomination in 2020, is an extreme exemplar.)

    The data reveal striking differences among institutional investors, differences that speak

to these two hypotheses. Longer-term investors shifted more strongly than others towards

climate-responsible firms. This suggests that the observed out-performance of climate-
index (see Pensions and Investments, ‘‘80% of equity market cap held by institutions’’, April 25, 2017).
   4
     Andreoni (1995) juxtaposed ‘‘warm glow’’ and ‘‘cold prickle’’. Some investors -- such as many leading
universities that have refused to commit not to hold energy firms -- may feel that appropriate diversification
requires that they hold some firms in dirty industries. Selecting the relatively climate-responsible firms within
those industries may help to reduce any cold shiver.
   5
     See Yale, ‘‘Americans are Increasingly ‘Alarmed’ About Global Warming’’, February 12, 2019.


                                                       5
responsible firms can be at least partially attributed to the Future Expectations explanation:

Long-horizon investors appear to have reacted by looking beyond Trump’s Presidency, and

anticipating investor demand for climate-responsible firms to increase and climate regulation

to become more stringent than would have otherwise been the case.6 The Current Preferences

hypothesis would predict a strengthening of pro-environmental preferences given the shock

associated with the Trump Presidency. However, contrary to this hypothesis, investors

with large holdings of climate-responsible firms before the election reduced them afterwards.

Overall, these findings show that institutional investors value firms’ climate responsibility

choices for strategic reasons.

       Two central contributions emerge from our analysis. First, it provides evidence that

corporate environmental responsibility affects firm values and investors’ portfolio decisions.

By contrast with regulatory changes considered in the extant literature, the policy shock it

analyzes is not the continuation of a trend towards tighter environmental regulation, but

a largely unexpected shift towards a rollback in regulation. This unique feature makes it

an attractive natural experiment that mitigates concerns, looming large in the literature,

that observed effects are not causal but merely the continuation of pre-existing trends.

Moreover, the existing literature on corporate social responsibility (CSR) relies predominantly

on stock-price reactions.7 Going beyond this mode of analysis, we also provide evidence
   6
      This result also rejects the idea that investors might have rewarded climate-responsible firms because of
the prospects of the roll-back of their (expensive) climate strategies. As climate responsibility was rewarded
by long-horizon investors and not by short-horizon ones, the price reaction does not result from an expectation
of lower costs in the short run, but rather from higher expected benefits in the long run.
    7
      For example, Krueger (2015b) documents negative stock-price reactions to negative firm-specific CSR
events. Flammer (2015) uses a regression discontinuity design (exploiting differences between firms that
narrowly pass or fail to pass shareholder resolutions regarding CSR) and finds that the adoption of CSR
proposals leads to positive stock-price reactions. Yet other research focuses on the role of disclosure rules.
For example, Krueger (2015a) finds that UK firms most heavily affected by new greenhouse gas emissions
reporting regulations benefited the most. See Amel-Zadeh (2018) for a survey of the literature on shareholder
value effects of CSR.


                                                      6
of the actual portfolio changes that institutional investors undertake. This allows us to

identify one of the drivers of the observed changes in prices for climate-responsible firms. A

number of recent studies highlight the role of institutional investor horizon and tastes on

ESG investing decisions (Dyck, Lins, Roth, and Wagner, 2019, Fernando, Sharfman, and

Uysal, 2017, Gibson and Krueger, 2017, Hwang, Titman, and Wang, 2017, Krueger, Sautner,

and Starks, 2019, and Starks, Venkat, and Zhu, 2017). Our results show that long-term

institutional investors are more likely to benefit from climate-responsible firms’ ability to

better cope with the tightening in regulation that will likely follow the Trump era.

   Second, the paper contributes to the fast-growing literature exploring the interconnections

between climate change and financial markets. Recent studies in this area include Addoum,

Ng, and Ortiz-Bobea (2019a,b), Andersson, Bolton, and Samama (2016), Baldauf, Garlappi,

and Yannelis (2019), Bernstein, Gustafson, and Lewis (2019), Choi, Gao, and Jiang (2019),

Hong, Li, and Xu (2019), and Ilhan, Sautner, and Vilkov (2019). Our paper complements

this new strand of research by showing that investor rewards to climate-responsible firms

strongly depend on the regulatory environment on climate change expected in the long run.

The interaction of regulation and CSR features prominently in the conceptual and theoretical

CSR literature. For example, Bénabou and Tirole (2010) and Kitzmueller and Shimshack

(2012) note that CSR can respond to government failures to control negative externalities,

and can serve to overcome firms’ short-term bias by allowing them to take a long-term

perspective and maximize intertemporal profits. Under both views, corporate environmental

responsibility should be particularly valuable when environmental regulation fails. Our paper

shows that financial markets support this type of long-term orientation by firms, and that

long-term investors are driving this effect.

                                               7
2         Sample and empirical strategy

We employ two complementary empirical strategies. First, Sections 3, 4, and 5 investigate the

stock-price response to the 2016 climate policy shock, represented by the Trump victory and

the Pruitt appointment, and the relative performance of climate-responsible firms through

the end of 2017. In Section 6, we then analyze institutional investor portfolio changes to

assess different explanations for the observed stock-price reactions. (The empirical strategy

for that analysis is laid out in Section 6.)

        Our sample includes the Russell 3000 firms on the day of the election for whom the

measures of climate-related performance and control variables described below are available.

Together, the index constituents represent roughly 98% of the US equity market capitalization.

        Throughout the 2016 electoral campaign, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton expressed

diametrically opposed views on climate policy. Clinton’s views were close to those of then-

sitting President Obama. Accordingly, Clinton identified the fight against global warming as

a policy priority.8 By contrast, Trump vowed to undertake a radical U-turn on environmental

regulation so as to promote economic well-being. Most notably, he expressed an intention to

dismantle the Clean Power Plan and exit the Paris Agreement.

        Trump’s surprising victory was followed by a few weeks when the President Elect’s inten-

tions to follow through on his various promises, including those related to the environment,

remained inconclusive. To illustrate, during an interview with The New York Times on

November 23, 2016, asked the question ‘‘Are you going to take America out of the world’s

lead of confronting climate change? ’’, Trump replied ‘‘I’m looking at it very closely. I’ll tell
    8
    Clinton’s proposals included the objective to ‘‘reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 30 percent in
2025 relative to 2005 levels and put the country on a path to cut emissions more than 80 percent by 2050 ’’
(from Clinton’s 2016 electoral campaign site).


                                                    8
you what. I have an open mind to it.’’ Asked whether he believed human activity causes

climate change, he said ‘‘I think right now...well, I think there is some connectivity. There is

some, something. [...]’’9 A month later, these equivocal statements were followed by Trump’s

appointment of Scott Pruitt to head the EPA. That appointment clearly indicated that

he was committed to a harsh scale back on environmental policies.10 The nomination of a

climate skeptic to lead the institution responsible for upholding and implementing federal

environmental laws marked a real turning point in the US policy towards climate change.11

       Trump’s election and Pruitt’s nomination each has advantages and disadvantages for

identifying the impact of firms’ climate-related performance on their value. The pluses and

minuses of the two events as identifiers cut in opposite directions; hence, they complement

each other well for reaching conclusions. The Trump election offers the advantage of having

a large surprise component. Its disadvantage is that it shifted expectations on a mélange

of dimensions, many far removed from environmental policy. Pruitt’s nomination has the

advantage of being solely focused on environmental issues, with particular salience with

respect to climate change policy. Its main disadvantage is that although the date was

not known in advance, it was only a moderate surprise. Though Pruitt was one of five

candidates the media rumored for the appointment, none strong on the environment, he

was the candidate most hostile to climate regulation. And he was an announced skeptic on

human activity being the cause of global warming.12 We next describe the main firm-related

variables of interest to our study and our data set.



2.1       Measures of climate-related performance

2.1.1      Climate responsibility


Our Climate responsibility variable measures capture whether a firm has undertaken in-

vestments that effectively improved its energy efficiency in recent years, has set targets

to reduce its future emissions, has adopted frameworks to manage climate change, and/or

has launched new products to directly address this class of problems. Such efforts would

provide important forward-looking indicators of a company’s climate performance and, hence,

represent plausible proxies for the perception of investors with respect to such actions.

       Data on corporate climate-related strategies was taken from two different ESG providers,

thereby strengthening the robustness of our results. First, following a large part of the finance

literature on CSR, we use the MSCI KLD Research & Analytics (MSCI KLD) database

(e.g., Galema, Plantinga, and Scholtens, 2008, Hong and Kostovetsky, 2012, Krueger, 2015b,

and Fernando, Sharfman, and Uysal, 2017). The MSCI KLD database provides a set of

binary indicators specifying, for each company, the presence of either strengths or concerns

on a series of environmental, social, and governance factors. We focus on the two MSCI

KLD indicators that specifically address firms’ climate performance. The first, the strength

indicator ‘‘Env-str-d’’, equals 1 for firms demonstrating best practices on the management

of risks of increased costs linked to carbon pricing or regulatory caps, and 0 otherwise.13

The second, the weakness indicator ‘‘Env-con-f’’, equals 1 for firms involved in serious
  13
    Factors affecting this assessment include efforts to reduce exposure through comprehensive carbon policies
and implementation mechanisms, including carbon reduction targets, production process improvements,
installation of emissions capture equipment, and/or switching to cleaner energy sources.


                                                     10
controversies related to their climate change and energy-related policies and initiatives, and

0 otherwise.14 For 2016, these two indicators as well as the accounting information required

to compute our control variables are available for 1,801 Russell 3000 firms. (The required

accounting information is described in detail in Section 2.2 below.) Accordingly, for each firm,

we define the variable Climate responsibility (kld) to be the indicator ‘‘Env-str-d’’ minus

the indicator ‘‘Env-con-f’’. Aggregating strengths and concerns to derive ‘‘net’’ CSR scores

is a common practice in the finance literature using the KLD MSCI data (e.g., Fernando,

Sharfman, and Uysal, 2017). By contrast with other ESG variables, very few firms were

assessed to have a serious weakness on climate responsibility. As a consequence, in our

sample Climate responsibility (kld) in fact is a binary indicator variable.

       Our second source of data on firms’ climate-related performance is Vigeo Eiris. Vigeo

Eiris evaluates firms in six ESG areas (environment, human rights, human resources, business

behaviour, community involvement, and corporate governance). Vigeo Eiris scores have

also been used in various academic contributions on sustainable finance and CSR. (See, e.g.,

Ferrell, Liang, and Renneboog, 2016 and Liang and Renneboog, 2017.)

       As a proxy for firms’ climate responsibility, we use the Vigeo Eiris ‘‘Energy Transition’’

score, which we denote as Climate responsibility (ve). The Energy Transition score assesses

a firm’s strategic approach to reduce carbon emissions and to adapt its business model to

manage the risks and the opportunities presented by the regulatory and market environment

in the transition to a low-carbon economy. The measure is a forward-looking measure

identifying companies who could reduce their carbon footprint in the future, reduce portfolio
  14
   Factors affecting this indicator include a history of involvement in GHG-related legal cases, widespread
impacts due to corporate GHG emissions, resistance to improved practices, and criticism by NGOs.




                                                    11
exposure to carbon risk and exploit market opportunities presented by the regulatory and

market environment to mitigate climate change. The assessment is based on the evaluation

of firms’ climate-related performance in terms of policies adopted, measures implemented,

evolution of key performance indicators, and stakeholder feedbacks. The resulting scores

range from 0 to 100. For 2016, this variable is available for 766 Russell 3000 firms. We also

define a binary indicator Climate responsibility leader, which equals 1 for firms in the top

quartile of the Climate responsibility (ve) scores, and 0 otherwise. This definition is intended

to mirror the KLD ‘‘strength’’ measure.

       Importantly, both MSCI KLD and Vigeo Eiris choose to cover firms based on index

membership; coverage in no way reflects CSR performance.15 Moreover, both providers’

climate responsibility measures reflect firms’ efforts to curb future emissions, not the measures

they may have taken to manage physical climate-related risks.


2.1.2      Carbon intensity


Vigeo Eiris also provides information on firms’ total absolute yearly Scope 1 and Scope

2 greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions in kilotons of CO2 equivalents in 2015.16 These

carbon emission data are based on information filed through the ‘‘Carbon Disclosure Project’’

(CDP).17 When self-reported data are not available, Vigeo Eiris estimates the carbon emissions
  15
     In particular, as of 2016, the MSCI KLD database covers the MSCI USA Investable Market Index (IMI),
with indicatively 2,400 constituents. Vigeo Eiris uses different indexes, including primarily the Stoxx Global
1800 (hence, US firms part of the STOXX North America 600).
  16
     The GHG Protocol identifies three emission categories: Scope 1 covers direct GHG emissions from sources
that are owned or controlled by the firm. Scope 2 covers indirect GHG emissions caused by the organization’s
consumption of electricity, heat, cooling or steam purchased or brought into its reporting boundary. Scope
3 covers emissions that are a consequence of the operations of a company, but are not directly owned or
controlled by the organization.
  17
     CDP is a non-governmental organization submitting annual questionnaire surveys on carbon emissions
to the world’s largest firms on behalf of large institutional investors.



                                                     12
based on the size of the issuer, the nature of its activities, and the emissions of its peers.

In total, carbon emissions are available for 766 companies.18 We normalize the 2015 total

emission data by the market value of equity in the same year and denote the resulting measure

Carbon intensity. Normalizing GHG emissions by the market value of equity provides a

simple indicator of a firm’s reliance on GHG emissions in its business activities (Hoffmann

and Busch, 2008). Very similar results obtain when GHG emissions were scaled by total sales

or total assets. Carbon intensity thus quantifies the firm’s short-term exposure to the costs

(or potential costs) of climate regulation, such as the cutback on permissible admissions, or a

carbon tax.19 However, it only provides limited information on a firm’s strategic positioning

on climate change.


2.1.3    Descriptive statistics of Climate responsibility and Carbon intensity


Table 1 summarizes the climate-related variables our analyses employ. Table 2 reports the

number of firms above and below the medians of Climate responsibility (ve) and Carbon

intensity in the Vigeo Eiris sample. This analysis shows that these two variables are reasonably

independent of each other, confirming that they capture different dimensions of a firm’s

climate performance.
  18
    The carbon emission data are self-reported for 340 companies and estimated for 426 companies.
  19
    Our samples include companies in the financial industry. Since these firms are exposed through their
loan portfolios, their Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions provide an incomplete picture of their exposure
to climate risks. However, the climate strategies of financial firms (e.g., limit the exposure to fossil fuel
assets in loan portfolios, increase the financing of ‘‘green’’ projects, etc.) may be particularly relevant for
climate-conscious investors. While we keep financial companies in our sample, analysis available on request
shows that our results hold even when they are excluded.

       Table A1 in the Supplementary Appendix reports correlations among various climate-

   related variables. Our two main variables of interest -- Climate responsibility (kld) and

   Climate responsibility (ve) -- are strongly positively correlated (0.56, p < 0.01). Nevertheless,

   the fact that the correlation is well below 1 reflects the difference in structure between the two

   indicators (one is binary, the other continuous), and the different methodological approaches

   between these two ESG data providers. The MSCI KLD measure to some extent captures

   firms’ relative GHG emissions, while the Vigeo Eiris measure specifically focuses on firms’

   managerial efforts to improve their climate performance. These differences across indicators

   help to cross-validate our findings.


                                                          14
       Climate responsibility (kld) is modestly negatively correlated with Carbon intensity

(−0.09), but sufficiently so to be statistically significant. The correlation between Climate

responsibility (ve) and Carbon intensity, though still slightly negative, is insignificant (−0.03).

       Table 3 shows the descriptive statistics of the climate-related variables by Fama-French

12-industry classification.20 The table reveals sizable variation in firms’ climate-related

performance within industries, and not merely across industries.



2.2       Accounting information

We obtain standard accounting firm characteristics -- market value of equity, profitability

(ROA), revenue growth, and market leverage -- from Compustat Capital IQ. For each

company, we use the latest available accounting data before November 2016.21

       Following the 2016 election, high-tax companies gained compared to low-tax firms, and

domestically focused companies gained compared to internationally oriented ones (Wagner,

Zeckhauser, and Ziegler, 2018). To control for these effects, we compute the cash effective

tax rate (henceforth cash ETR, the ratio of total cash taxes paid to pretax income adjusted

for special items during the previous 5 years) from Compustat data.22 From Bloomberg

(and Compustat geographical segments data), we collect the percentage of revenues from

foreign sources. This allows us to control for the fact that firms producing tradable goods
  20
     To ensure that our analyses appropriately control for sector fixed effects, we analyzed all firms classified
as ‘‘Other’’ in the Fama-French industry classifications. We reclassified two of these firms (AES Corporation
and Calpine Corporation) to the utilities sector.
  21
     For most companies, this means the December 31, 2015 data. However, several companies have fiscal
years that end in other months. Thus, in the MSCI KLD and Vigeo Eiris samples we have, respectively, 558
and 227 companies for which calendar year 2016 data are used.
  22
     We use the 5-year cash ETR to ensure a larger sample than when using the prior year cash ETR. The
results with 1-year cash ETR are very similar, though slightly weaker because of the smaller number of
observations. In line with the extant literature, we restrict the sample to those firms with positive tax rates
below 100%.

Note: This table shows the descriptive statistics of climate-related variables provided by MSCI KLD
(Panel A) and Vigeo Eiris (Panel B), by Fama-French 12-industry classification. The samples consist of
2,070 (Panel A) and 766 (Panel B) Russell 3000 constituents as of November 8, 2016 for which informa-
tion on standard control variables (log market cap, revenue growth, profitability, and market leverage) is
available. Climate responsibility (kld) is a three-valued measure computed as firms’ MSCI KLD climate
strength (env-str-d, 0 or 1) minus climate concern (env-con-f, 0 or 1) indicators for 2016. Climate respon-
sibility (ve) denotes the Vigeo Eiris Energy Transition score (from 0 to 100) for 2016. It measures a firm’s
strategic approach to climate change. Carbon intensity is defined as the firm’s kilotons of CO2 emission
equivalents (total Scope 1 and 2) in 2015 normalized by the market value of equity (in USD billions).

(particularly in manufacturing) are both more likely to be affected by trade policy and to

have environmental impact.

   Table 4 provides descriptive statistics of accounting information for our three samples: The

sample including all 2,677 Russell 3000 constituent companies for which standard accounting

characteristics are available (Panel A); the sub-sample of 2,070 firms for which the two MSCI

KLD indicators of interest are available (Panel B); and finally the sub-sample of 766 issuers

covered by Vigeo Eiris (Panel C).

   After including the cash ETR, the MSCI KLD sample reduces to 1,801 firms and the Vigeo

Eiris sample to 671 firms, representing respectively about 88% and 78% of total US market

capitalization. The share of foreign revenues is not always available for these companies. To

avoid reducing the sample sizes further, we replace missing values of the share of foreign

revenues with 0 and include a dummy variable equal to 1 (and 0 elsewhere) to absorb the

effect of this adjustment in our empirical specifications. This treatment is employed for 355

out of 1,801 firms in the MSCI KLD sample, and 95 out of 671 firms in the Vigeo Eiris

sample.

   Interestingly, little of the variability in climate responsibility choices is explained by

traditional firm characteristics. Regressing our climate responsibility measures on industry

dummies and other control variables yields some significant coefficients (in line with the

correlation levels in Table A1 in the Supplementary Appendix). However, the adjusted

R-squared values are quite low (0.26 for Climate responsibility (kld), and 0.29 for Climate

responsibility (ve)).

2.3      Stock returns

We obtain daily stock-return data from October 1, 2015 through December 29, 2017 on all

US common stocks (with the exception of closed-end funds) traded on NYSE, Amex and


                                                     18
Nasdaq from CRSP. In our analysis, we consider returns on the Russell 3000 constituents as

of November 8, 2016.

       We consider three sets of returns: Raw returns, abnormal returns calculated with respect

to the CAPM, and abnormal returns calculated with respect to the Fama-French three-factor

model. To compute abnormal returns, we utilize daily data for the market excess return, the

size and value factor returns (Fama and French 1993), and the return on the riskless asset

from Ken French’s website.

       Betas are estimated using one year of daily data, and are then used to compute the

abnormal returns for the following quarter.23 For instance, abnormal returns for the last

quarter of 2016 (the quarter of the election) are based on betas estimated from daily returns

from October 1, 2015 through September 30, 2016. Similarly, the abnormal returns for the

first quarter of 2017 are based on betas estimated from daily returns throughout 2016.

       To obtain CAPM-adjusted returns, we first estimate each stock’s market beta from an

OLS regression of daily stock returns in excess of the riskless asset return on the market

excess returns. We then compute abnormal returns for all days in the following quarter as

the daily excess return on the stock minus beta times the market excess return. We compute

Fama-French-adjusted returns in a similar fashion.

       Throughout the paper, all returns are reported in percentage points. Descriptive statistics

are reported in Table 5. For space reasons, we show data only for the MSCI KLD sample.




  23
    For most firms, data are available for the entire estimation window. Where they are not, betas are
estimated using returns from the date the firm was first traded through the end of the estimation window,
provided that the firm has at least 126 daily return observations available. If fewer than 126 observations are
available, no abnormal returns are computed for that firm to avoid our results being affected by imprecise
beta estimates.

CAPM-adjusted returns, we first estimate each stock’s market beta from an OLS regression of daily stock

returns for all days in the following quarter as the daily excess return on the stock minus beta times the
market excess return. Similarly, Fama-French-adjusted returns are computed as the stock’s excess return
minus the sum of its factor exposures times the factor returns, where the factor exposures are estimated
using daily market excess returns, size, and value factor returns using one year of data.




                                                   20
   Before embarking on the empirical analysis, it is useful to reflect on the relative advantages

in our setting of using raw returns, CAPM-adjusted returns, or Fama-French-adjusted returns.

Conceptually, the purpose of using adjusted returns is to eliminate the impact of factors that

are unrelated to the effects being investigated.

   To illustrate, small stocks outperformed large stocks and value stocks outperformed growth

stocks after the election. However, this out-performance could itself be driven by the new

administration’s expected policies. Indeed, in their analysis of the effect of expected changes

in tax policy after the election, Wagner, Zeckhauser, and Ziegler (2018) find that firms with

high loadings on the size and value factors have higher ETRs on average. They then note

that to the extent that the size and value returns are themselves driven by expected changes

in tax policy, regressions using Fama-French-adjusted returns will tend to understate the

impact of taxes on stock returns. Similar effects could obviously arise if the climate-related

variables correlate significantly with some of the Fama-French factor loadings.

   Figure 1 indicates that firms graded higher on Climate responsibility (ve) on average load

more highly on the value factor. This relation is statistically significant (p < 0.01). However,

Climate responsibility (ve) appears to be uncorrelated with either the market or the size

factor loadings. Similar results hold with Climate responsibility (kld) (though in this case,

the relation with value factor loadings only reaches significance at the 10% level). Figure

1 also reveals that in the Vigeo Eiris sample, firms with higher Carbon intensity have, on

average, higher loading on the market, value and size factors (controlling for sector and firm

characteristics). Each of these three relations is statistically significant (p < 0.01).

   Due to these differences in factor exposures, differences in the magnitude of the effects

that we document across alternative sets of returns are to be expected. In what follows, we

use CAPM-adjusted returns as our primary dependent variable; however, as we show in

the robustness section, our main results are robust to using raw and Fama-French-adjusted

returns, and the differences in the magnitude of the coefficients across sets of returns are in

line with what one would expect based on the relation between the climate variables and the

factor exposures.



                                                                                                                        22
3        Industry level stock-price reactions

We first analyze stock-price reactions at the industry level. In 2016, 7,631 large facilities in

nine industry sectors -- power plants, petroleum and natural gas systems, refineries, chemicals,

waste, metals, minerals, pulp and paper, and others (including coal mines and electronics

manufacturing) -- accounted for about half of US emissions.24

       As Figure 2 shows, stock prices in these industries gained substantially following Trump’s

election victory, as one might expect. Specifically, this figure plots the industry coefficients

when CAPM-adjusted returns on the first day after the election (maroon bars) and cumulative

abnormal returns through year-end 2016 (light grey bars) are regressed on Fama-French

30-industry dummies and firm characteristics (log market cap, revenue growth, profitability,

and market leverage) using the full Russell 3000 sample (2,677 firms). The coefficients are

reported in descending order by the abnormal returns on the first post-election day.

       Adjusting for the market’s overall move, the stocks of ‘‘dirty’’ industries performed very

well on the day after the election. In particular, investors immediately turned the coal, steel,

metals, and petroleum and natural gas industries into notable relative winners. Shifts in

investor expectations about other policy areas (such as Trump’s pledge to revive American

manufacturing and his tough announced stance on trade) undoubtedly account for some of

these industry-level returns. Still, it is striking how great were the relative short-term gains

that high-emission industries enjoyed.

       Among the carbon-intensive industries, all but the utilities sector fared quite well after

industries (also including beer, tobacco, and food products) into high-beta industries in

response to Trump’s pledge to revive growth and the potential consequence of increased

long-term interest rates.

market leverage). The sample includes the 2,677 Russell 3000 index constituents as of November 8,
2016 for which controls are available. The ‘‘Everything else’’ industry is used as the base level.


   Figure 2 also reveals that the cumulative abnormal returns from the election through

year-end 2016 differed substantially from the immediate market reaction. In particular,

                                                                   24
investors appear to have been initially too optimistic about the prospects for the coal25 and

metal industries under Trump.26 On the other hand, petroleum and natural gas companies, as

well as chemicals and steel works, enjoyed substantial increases in abnormal returns through

year-end.

       As mentioned above, industry reactions also reflected shifts in investor expectations

about policy areas quite apart from climate change. Healthcare, medical equipment, and

pharmaceuticals lost dramatically through year-end (a consequence of the expectation that

Obamacare would be dismantled, or at least significantly altered), as did textile and apparel

firms (reflecting their dependence on imports, which Trump had vowed to strongly discourage).

Business supplies and shipping containers also lost, presumably reflecting Trump’s tough

stance on trade. Finally, financial companies gained due to the prospect of softened regulation

in that sector.

       Overall, the simple descriptive results illustrated by Figure 2 strongly suggest that Trump’s

election represented good news for high-emissions sectors. However, heterogeneity among

firms within the same industry is typically as large as it is across industries, both in terms of

abnormal returns and efforts to mitigate climate change. For instance, as Table 3 indicates,

the energy sector comprises both firms trying to pro-actively manage climate-related issues

and firms basically neglecting such concerns. (This is shown by the standard deviation of

Climate responsibility (ve), which actually exceeds the sector mean.) And while the average

Presidency. See Fisman and Zitzewitz (2017).
   26
      This result is consistent with the analysis in Addoum and Kumar (2016). They provide evidence that
political sentiment following a change of the presidential party can give rise to temporary mispricing in
certain party-sensitive sectors, through a shift of demand by politically-sensitive investors that arbitrageurs
cannot immediately compensate. The pattern of the stock-price reactions of the coal, mining, and metals
industries (which, not surprisingly, they classify as ‘‘Republican sectors’’) may well have been due to a similar
effect.

abnormal return on the day after the election of firms in that sector was 2.22 percentage

points, the spread around that value was great. The 25th percentile was −0.15 percentage

points and the 75th percentile was 2.93 percentage points.

       The next section capitalizes on this heterogeneity across firms to investigate how their

climate responsibility affected their stock prices after the 2016 policy shock.




4        Within industry stock-price reactions

4.1       Main results

As discussed in Section 2, our main empirical strategy investigates the cross-sectional variation

of returns following two market-wide events, the Trump victory and the Pruitt appointment.

Given the potential cross-sectional correlation of stock returns, conventional t-statistics,

which posit independently distributed errors, could be biased upwards (Fama and French,

2000). To avoid this problem, we test the statistical significance of coefficients from the

cross-sectional regressions using adjusted t-statistics based on the empirical distribution of

coefficient estimates, following the approach of Cohn, Gillan, and Hartzell (2016). Specifically,

we calculate the adjusted t-statistics as follows. First, we run the cross-sectional regression

using daily (abnormal) returns over a non-event period ranging from October 1, 2015 through

September 30, 2016.27 Then we run the same cross-sectional regression using event period

returns. The adjusted t-statistic is computed by subtracting the mean time-series coefficients

over the non-event period from the estimated event coefficients, and then dividing this
  27
    Betas over this non-event period are estimated using one year of daily stock-return data going back up
to October 1, 2014, and are then used to compute the abnormal returns for the following quarter.

difference by the standard deviation of the time-series coefficients over the non-event period.

When using cumulative (abnormal) returns, we combine returns in the non-event period in

order to estimate comparable coefficients. Our findings hold as well when using conventional

t-statistics. Differences in statistical significance are minor.

       Turning to the analysis, Table 6 shows the results of regressions of individual stock

CAPM-adjusted returns on firms’ Climate responsibility (kld) following our two key events:

Trump’s election on November 8, 2016 and Pruitt’s nomination on December 7, 2016. The

results for raw and Fama-French-adjusted returns are very similar and are reported in Section

4.2.3. Controls in the regression are the cash ETR, share of foreign revenues, market leverage,

log market cap, revenue growth, profitability, and industry fixed effects.28

       Interestingly, firms displaying a high level of climate responsibility enjoyed a 43 basis

points higher abnormal return on the first trading day after the election. Their cumulative

abnormal returns grew strongly by the third day, reaching 145 basis points, and remain

positive, although not quite statistically significant through the 10th trading day after the

election. At that point firms with strong climate responsibility were still 62 basis points ahead

of otherwise similar stocks. Companies at the forefront of climate responsibility benefited

further following the nomination of Scott Pruitt, securing an additional 102 basis points

higher abnormal return after 10 trading days from December 7, 2016.

       The coefficients on the control variables accord with the results established in the prior

literature. After the election, domestically focused firms and those with a higher cash ETR

fared relatively better than did low-tax and internationally oriented companies. We also
  28
    The primary analysis includes industry fixed effects according to the Fama-French 12-industry classifica-
tion in order to keep things comparable once we move to the smaller Vigeo Eiris sample. The robustness
section shows that the results continue to hold with Fama-French 30-industry fixed effects.

      observe that market leverage has a negative and highly statistically significant effect. All

      these findings are consistent with those documented in Wagner, Zeckhauser, and Ziegler

     (2018), which had a larger sample available.

Note: This table shows results of OLS regressions of CAPM-adjusted returns on Climate responsibility (kld),
cash ETR, share of foreign revenues, and other control variables (market leverage, log market cap, revenue
growth, and profitability). For 355 firms with missing foreign revenues data we apply a dummy variable
adjustment to preserve the sample size. All models also include Fama-French 12-industry fixed effects. Columns
1 through 4 refer to Trump’s election and cover the following periods: November 9, 2016 (Column 1); November
9 through 11, 2016 (Column 2); November 9 through 15, 2016 (Column 3); and November 9 through 22, 2016
(Column 4). Columns 5 through 8 refer to Pruitt’s nomination and cover the following periods: December 7,
2016 (Column 5); December 7 through 11, 2016 (Column 6); December 7 through 14, 2016 (Column 7); and
December 7 through 20, 2016 (Column 8). The sample includes all Russell 3000 firms covered by MSCI KLD in
2016 for which the climate-specific indicators and the control variables are available. Adjusted t-statistics in
parentheses, calculated from the empirical time-series distribution of returns on trading days between October
1, 2015 and September 30, 2016. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.

   Figure 3 uses binned scatter plots to show the stock-price effect of climate responsibility

when using the Vigeo Eiris sample. As can be seen, with this measure, too, we find that

investors reacted positively to greater levels of climate responsibility both after Trump’s

election (left panels) and after Pruitt’s nomination (right panels). This is contrary to what

naı̈ve intuition might suggest.

                                                                                                                                 29
   These binned scatter plots are derived from the regression results presented in Panel A of

Table 7. Specifically, Panel A of Table 7 reports the results of regressions of CAPM-adjusted

stock returns on firm Climate responsibility (ve), Carbon intensity, and control variables

(cash ETR, share of foreign revenues, log market cap, revenue growth, profitability, and

market leverage). The coefficients of the control variables, available on request, are in line

with those discussed above.

   The point estimate on Climate responsibility (ve) on the first day is slightly negative, but

becomes positive and statistically significant after three days. Firms with better strategic

positioning on climate change also experienced higher returns after Pruitt’s nomination as well.

The effect is economically important: A one standard deviation higher Climate responsibility

(ve) is associated with a 0.54 percentage point (16.41*0.033) increase in three-day cumulative

CAPM-adjusted returns after Pruitt’s nomination, about a seventh of a standard deviation

of those returns.

   When comparing the results in Table 6 with those in Panel A of Table 7, note that the

two measures of firms’ climate strategies are structurally different: The Vigeo Eiris measure

is continuous, while the MSCI KLD measure is binary to separate out good performers (about

11% of firms). To better compare the results with the two samples, Panel B of Table 7

reports the regression results of the usual specification using the binary variable Climate

responsibility leader (ve), equal to 1 for firms in the top quartile of Climate responsibility (ve)

and 0 otherwise. (We use the top quartile given the smaller size of the Vigeo Eiris sample.)

This approach allows us to better isolate the returns of firms with more advanced climate

strategies relative to other companies.

Note: Panel A reports the results of OLS regressions of CAPM-adjusted returns on Climate responsibility (ve), Carbon
intensity, control variables (cash ETR, share of foreign revenues, market leverage, log market cap, revenue growth, and
profitability), and Fama-French 12-industry fixed effects. Regressions in Panel B replace Climate responsibility (ve) with a
dummy variable equal to 1 for firms in the top quartile of Climate responsibility (ve) and zero otherwise. In Panels C and D,
Carbon intensity is trimmed at the 99th percentile. For 95 firms with missing foreign revenue data we apply a dummy variable
adjustment to preserve the sample size. Table 6 describes the columns. Adjusted t-statistics in parentheses, calculated from

       As can be seen, a high level of Climate responsibility (ve) is associated with a 144 basis

points higher cumulative abnormal return at the end of the third trading day after the election,

similarly to what we observed in the MSCI KLD sample. This positive and significant effect

persists through the 10th trading day after the election. Firms with high climate responsibility

also outperform following Pruitt’s nomination. The effect becomes insignificant by day 10

after that event, though the economic size is similar to that after 5 days.

       Consider now the effects of Carbon intensity. The literature suggests that firms more

exposed to the (actual or potential) compliance costs of climate regulation incur a penalty

(e.g., Matsumura, Prakash, and Vera-Muñoz, 2014). Column (1) of Panel A and Panel B

in Table 7 indicates that, on the first day after the election, companies with higher carbon

intensities gained relative to those less carbon-intensive. This result reflects the common

narrative, including anecdotal accounts in the press, that on the first day after the election

investors reacted by boosting the prices of large GHG emitters.29 However, on the second day

after the election, the market seems to have already partially re-assessed Trump’s positive

influence on these companies (not shown), and by the third day, the effect fell to only half

the size (and statistically insignificant). As can be seen in Columns (5) to (8), stock-price

movements after Pruitt’s nomination are unrelated to Carbon intensity. This suggests that

this nomination didn’t affect investors’ policy expectations on carbon pricing or regulatory

caps on emissions. Very similar results obtain when GHG emissions were scaled by total

sales or total assets.

       A potential concern with the analysis so far is that Carbon intensity is highly skewed,

2016.




                                                    32
which could bias the results. Therefore, in Panels C and D, we re-run the regressions trimming

Carbon intensity at the 99th percentile. With this specification, the statistically significant

effect of carbon intensities on abnormal returns persists beyond the first post-election day.

   In sum, our results in this first part of the study suggest two quite disparate components

to investor perceptions of firms’ climate-related performance. On the one hand, highly

carbon-intensive industries and companies benefited from the policy shock due to anticipated

relief from regulatory impositions during the Trump years. On the other hand, firms with

more forward-thinking climate policies and strategies were rewarded by investors. Section 6

investigates the possible explanations for these striking findings about climate responsibility.



4.2     Robustness

This subsection investigates the robustness of the stock-price reaction results in three domains:

Controlling for industry fixed effects at a finer level of classification, controlling for corporate

governance, and using alternative measures of stock returns.


4.2.1   Controlling for a finer industry classification


Our regressions thus far have controlled for industry-level return differentials using the Fama-

French 12-industry classification. This classification appropriately preserves the variability

of climate-related measures when using the relatively small Vigeo Eiris sample.

   For consistency, we adopted the same methodological approach employing the larger MSCI

KLD sample. That larger sample permits a finer industry classification, as a robustness check.

Table A2 in the Supplementary Appendix presents the results for the MSCI KLD sample

controlling for Fama-French 30-industry fixed effects. We observe minor differences compared

                                                33
to our baseline results in Table 6. Specifically, the coefficients on Climate responsibility (kld)

are now more strongly significant in the immediate post-election period and slightly reduced

in magnitude following Pruitt’s nomination.


4.2.2   Controlling for corporate governance


One concern with our findings could be that the out-performance of climate-responsible

firms could be driven by their higher score on corporate governance more generally. For

example, it is conceivable that investors believe that environmental deregulation would go

hand-in-hand with deregulation in the financial realm as well. Positing that such regulation,

on net, benefits investors, better-governed firms would get a relative benefit from the broad

theme of Trump’s election and Pruitt’s nomination. We re-run the analysis controlling for

corporate governance.

   We conduct this analysis using three alternative measures of governance. First, we

compute a measure of governance based on the MSCI KLD database, as follows: For each

firm, we divide the number of governance strengths by its possible maximum value, and we

then subtract the number of governance concerns divided by its possible maximum value.

The resulting measure, Corporate governance (kld), ranges from -1 to +1. We use information

on governance as of year-end 2013, the latest available data on the MSCI KLD database.

Second, we use firms’ institutional ownership, a corporate governance proxy extensively used

in the literature (e.g., Chung and Zhang, 2011). We compute this measure using WRDS

SEC Analytics Suite data as the percentage of firms’ common stocks held by institutional

investors at the end of Q3-2016. Third, we use the corporate governance score provided by

Vigeo Eiris (ranging from 0 to 100).

                                               34
   The results in Table A3 in the Supplementary Appendix reveal that our main results hold

after controlling for each of these three measures of firms’ corporate governance performance.


4.2.3   Alternative sets of returns


We replicate our analysis using two alternative sets of returns: Raw returns and Fama-

French-adjusted returns. Table A4 in the Supplementary Appendix shows the results of this

robustness check.

   The effects of the factor loadings are intuitive. As previously shown in Figure 1, in the

Vigeo Eiris sample firms with higher Climate responsibility (ve) have, on average, higher

loadings on the value factor (after controlling for sector and firm characteristics). The data

reflects this correlation: Although the climate-responsibility coefficients when using raw

returns (Panel B.1) are extremely close to those obtained with CAPM-adjusted returns, they

are slightly reduced when using Fama-French-adjusted returns (Panel B.2). However, the

statistical and economic importance of Climate responsibility (ve) is quite similar across the

three sets of returns. Similarly, in unreported results we confirm that Climate responsibility

leader (ve) is significant immediately after the election when using either raw or Fama-

French-adjusted returns, much as in Table 7 Panel B.

   Similar effects arise in the case of Carbon intensity. When using Fama-French-adjusted

returns, the coefficient on Carbon intensity is somewhat smaller than with CAPM-adjusted

returns. This result again emerges because Carbon intensity is also positively correlated

(p < 0.01) with the value and size factors. This implies that, if we utilize returns net of their

size and value factor components, the coefficients on Carbon intensity capture the general

out-performance of value (versus growth) stocks after the election. Conversely, when using

                                               35
raw returns, the coefficients on Carbon intensity are slightly larger in magnitude than those

obtained with CAPM-adjusted returns, reflecting the positive correlation of this variable

with the market beta.

       Overall, the coefficients on climate responsibility differ little from those obtained with

CAPM-adjusted returns. In short, our main results are robust to the use of returns in any of

the three traditional forms.




5        Long-run stock returns and Trump’s popularity

The analyses above considered the short-run stock-price reactions to the Trump election and

the Pruitt nomination. This section extends the analysis to the longer run.

       Figure 4 illustrates the evolution of the pricing of firms’ climate strategies from Trump’s

election through December 29, 2017. Specifically, for each day, the figure shows the coefficient

on Climate responsibility (kld) when using the cumulative abnormal returns through that

day as the dependent variable, and including our usual battery of controls.

       The figure shows that firms with advanced climate strategies gained significantly through

the brief period to the end of 2016, with the climate responsibility premium climbing to

225 basis points on a CAPM-adjusted basis by December 31.30 Other firms caught up in

the first months of 2017. Later in the year, however, the stock-price premium on climate

responsibility regained its quite strong economic magnitude, reaching nearly 300 basis points

by year-end 2017.31
  30
      On a Fama-French-adjusted basis, the cumulative abnormal return is 157 basis points. For both sets
of returns, the coefficient on climate responsibility from a regression of cumulative abnormal returns from
Trump’s election through the end of 2016 on firms’ climate responsibility (and control variables) is highly
significant.
   31
      At the end of 2017, more than one year after the election, the coefficient on Climate responsibility (kld)

Note: This figure shows the evolution of the coefficients on Climate responsibility (kld) from the
Trump election through the end of December 2017. The regressions use the MSCI KLD sample
comprising 1,801 firms at the beginning of the sample period. The coefficients for each day are
obtained by regressing cumulative CAPM-adjusted abnormal returns from Trump’s election through
that day on Climate responsibility (kld), controls (cash ETR, foreign revenues, market leverage, log
market cap, revenue growth, and profitability), and Fama-French 12-industry fixed effects.



    The figure also reveals that the pricing of advanced climate strategies during the first

year after Trump’s election varied greatly.32 To understand this variability, we investigate
is economically important (2.78), but is not statistically significant (p = 0.16). Of course, it gets increasingly
difficult to obtain a significant effect over such a long event window.
   32
      We investigate two additional events as well. First, on Wednesday January 4, 2017, then President-elect
Trump nominated Jay Clayton to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). While obviously
not a key climate-change event, it is noteworthy that Clayton was considered a strong advocate of corporate
climate-related disclosure. (See MarketWatch, ‘‘Trump’s SEC pick pushed clients to say more about climate-
change risks’’, January 5, 2017.) His nomination may have partially bucked the trend of Trump’s deregulatory
push on climate policy, casting doubts on the SEC’s abandonment of its enforcement actions in the field
of corporate climate-related disclosure and risk management. To the extent that investors favored firms
with strong climate change strategies in the face of anticipated regulatory failure, Clayton’s nomination may
account in part for the reversal of the premium for climate-responsible firms observed at the beginning of
2017. Second, on June 1, 2017, Trump announced his decision to withdraw the US from the Paris Agreement.
In an unreported analysis, we examine the short-term stock-price reaction around this event in more detail;
no statistically significant effect of climate strategies emerges. The lack of strong price responses may be
because Trump’s move on the Paris Agreement, despite the huge media coverage and public outrage that


                                                                                              37

the relation between the price effect of climate responsibility and Trump’s popularity from

the Inauguration through year-end 2017. Such popularity might indicate Trump’s ability to

secure legislation that lowers environmental standards, and the probability that he serves

the first full term. We obtain Trump’s daily approval ratings from the poll firm Rasmussen

Reports and we standardize them to have mean zero and unit standard deviation. These

ratings are available starting with the Inauguration.

interaction term show that Trump’s popularity related positively to the effect of climate

responsibility on stock prices.

    Overall, we interpret these findings as providing additional evidence in support of our

main result, namely that following the 2016 climate policy shock, investors put a premium

on corporate climate responsibility.




6     Institutional investor portfolio changes

6.1    What is the source of the climate responsibility premium?

In Sections 4 and 5 we documented that climate-responsible firms outperformed otherwise

similar peers after the 2016 climate policy shock, both in the short and in the longer run.

There are at least two possible explanations for this observed out-performance.

    The first is that investors value corporate climate responsibility on the basis of personal

social preferences (e.g., Riedl and Smeets, 2017), the flip side of investors’ penalizing firms

that promote vice, such as alcohol, tobacco, and gaming (e.g., Hong and Kacperczyk, 2009).

Socially concerned investors may be more willing to reward firms showing good behavior when

current public policies are at odds with their values (even if this means accepting a lower

return as a consequence). In other words, pro-environmental investors may have increased

their concern about climate change after Trump’s election, and hence became willing to

pay more for the ‘‘warm glow’’ effect (Andreoni, 1989) of investing in climate-conscious

firms or avoid suffering the cold shiver of buying irresponsible firms. We call this investor

reaction based on climate preferences the Current Preferences hypothesis. Opinion polls



                                              39
by Gallup and by Yale University indicate that the percentages of Americans concerned, or

even alarmed, about global warming increased significantly after Trump’s election.33

       The second possible explanation is that investors paid up for climate-responsible firms for

strategic reasons; they expected them to perform better in the long-run, for either or both of

two future-focused reasons.

       First, investors may foresee that pro-environmental investors will reap a warmer warm

glow, hence pay more, for climate-responsible firms. Second, investors may expect a boomerang

effect where direct government climate regulation post-Trump becomes more stringent than it

would have been had Trump never been elected. Three factors may give rise to stronger climate

preferences and stricter policies post-Trump: the increased severity of the problem of global

warming, the time lost addressing it, and as a reaction against the prior Administration’s

purposefully lax policies. Interestingly, although we first developed these conjectures in 2018,

as we write in March 2019, it does appear as if climate regulation is already preparing to

regain strength should Trump be gone after the 2020 Presidential election. In February 2019,

several prominent Democratic candidates for the 2020 Presidential nomination supported a

resolution in Congress for the development of a ‘‘Green New Deal’’, a policy plan aspiring,

among other things, to power the U.S. economy with 100% renewable energy within 10

years.34 Even a pale version of the Green New Deal, if adopted, would make climate regulation
  33
     In a Gallup poll of March 2017, 45% of Americans declared to worry ‘‘a great deal’’ about global warming,
up from 37% in March 2016. According to Gallup, this heightened concern about climate change can be
motivated to some extent by the anxiety about President Trump’s environmental stance, and the greater
sense of urgency about the issue perceived by climate-conscious citizens. See Gallup, ‘‘Global Warming
Concern at Three-Decade High in U.S.’’, March 14, 2017. The December 2018 Yale Program on Climate
Change Communication survey found that 29% of Americans are now ‘‘alarmed’’ about climate change (up 8
percentage points since March 2018), and another 47% are ‘‘concerned’’ or ‘‘cautious’’. See Yale, ‘‘Americans
are Increasingly ‘Alarmed’ About Global Warming’’, February 12, 2019.
  34
     See Financial Times, ‘‘The week in energy: A Green New Deal’’, January 12, 2019.




                                                     40
dramatically tighter than it was under the Obama Administration, or would have been under

a Clinton Administration. As a result, the competitive advantages of climate-responsible

firms would increase over what they were before the 2016 election and above what they were

expected to be had Clinton won power. Investors might well have anticipated this policy

scenario, and hence rewarded climate responsibility already after the election. We call such

investor reactions based on strategic reasoning the Future Expectations hypothesis.



6.2       Empirical strategy

To test these hypotheses, we investigate how different groups of 13F institutional investors35

adjusted their holdings after the 2016 climate policy shock. Specifically, we analyze the

differential trading behavior of these large institutional investors with respect to two specific

characteristics: Their prior exposure to climate-responsible firms and their revealed investment

horizons. The Current Preferences explanation predicts a shift towards climate-responsible

firms by investors whose climate preferences are strong; prime candidates would be investors

with higher prior exposure to climate-responsible firms. The Future Expectations explanation

predicts a more significant shift towards climate-responsible firms by longer-horizon investors.

       We obtain quarterly institutional ownership data from the WRDS SEC Analytics Suite.

We match the 13F institutional holdings with the share prices and number of shares out-

standing (adjusted for stock splits) at the end of each quarter from CRSP, as well as with the
  35
    Section 13(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Pub.L. 73-291) requires investment managers
that exercise investment discretion over USD 100 million or more of ‘‘Section 13(f) securities’’ (in general,
US publicly traded equity securities) to report their holdings to the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) at the end of each calendar quarter. The reporting form that need to be filed by these institutions --
which comprise pension funds, endowments, insurance companies, bank trusts, mutual funds, hedge funds,
and independent advisors -- is Form 13F (hence the name ‘‘13F investors’’). For more information see
https://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/13ffaq.htm.



                                                     41
climate-related variables from MSCI KLD and Vigeo Eiris. We clean the 13F data following

the methodology outlined in Ben-David, Franzoni, Moussawi, and Sedunov (2018). We have

data on 3,934 distinct investors as of September 30, 2016 (Q3-2016).

    We use institutional investors’ portfolio turnover to proxy for their investment horizons,

the approach used, for instance, in Froot, Scharfstein, and Stein, 1992, Gaspar, Massa, and

Matos, 2005, and Cella, Ellul, and Giannetti, 2013. The rationale here is that short-horizon

investors tend to adjust their portfolios more frequently than do patient investors. We

calculate the portfolio turnover for investor i in quarter q according to the widely-used churn

ratio formulated by Gaspar, Massa, and Matos (2005). Thus,


                                        P
                                            j∈S   | Nj,i,q Pj,q − Nj,i,q−1 Pj,q−1 − Nj,i,q−1 ∆Pj,q |
           Portfolio turnoveri,q =                       P
                                                                   Nj,i,q Pj,q +Nj,i,q−1 Pj,q−1
                                                                                                       ,
                                                             j∈S
                                                                              2


where S denotes the set of firms held by investor i, and Pj,q and Nj,i,q are the price and number

of shares of stock j held by institution i in quarter q.36 For each investor i, we measure the

investment horizon as the average portfolio turnover over the period ranging from Q1-2015

to Q3-2016 (using all quarters with available data), and denote it P ortf olio turnoveri .37

Using the average portfolio turnover over several quarters minimizes the influence of a single

quarter in the calculation (e.g., Gaspar, Massa, and Matos, 2005). Considering portfolio

turnovers through September 30, 2016 (Q3-2016) ensures that our measure of investment

horizon is not related to the Trump presidency.

    Following Gibson and Krueger (2017) and Starks, Venkat, and Zhu (2017), we use
  36
     Our analysis is robust to an alternative calculation of portfolio turnover, following Carhart (1997). That
calculation looks at the minimum value between the total sales and the total buys in a given quarter, divided
by the average asset value of the portfolio between the end of the previous quarter and the end of the current
one.
  37
     Varying the number of quarters used to calculated the average turnover does not affect our results.


                                                        42
investors’ quarterly 13F filings to measure their exposure to climate-responsible firms. Specif-

ically, for each investor-quarter combination, we calculate the average of the climate-related

characteristics (Climate responsibility (kld), Climate responsibility (ve), and Carbon intensity)

of the firms in the investor’s portfolio using the portfolio weights. We denote the resulting

investor-level values by Portfolio CR (kld), Portfolio CR (ve), and Portfolio CO2.

       For each investor i and quarter q from Q4-2016 through Q4-2017, we then compute

the difference between the portfolio’s actual climate responsibility and what the portfolio

climate responsibility level would have been had the investor kept his holdings unchanged

from Q3-2016. That difference is:


                                          X
            ∆Portfolio CR (kld)i,q =            (wj,i,q − ŵj,i,q ) · Climate responsibility (kld)j ,
                                          j∈S



where S denotes the set of firms held by investor i, wj,i,q denotes the weight of stock j in

investor i ’s portfolio in quarter q, and ŵj,i,q represents the corresponding weight based on Q3-

2016 holdings and adjusting for price changes through quarter q. In other words, (wj,i,q − ŵj,i,q )

captures the change of the weight of company j resulting from investor i ’s trading from

September 30, 2016 through the end of quarter q. Importantly, this measure takes account

of the effect of price changes, which may mechanically impact the climate responsibility of

investors’ portfolios due to the observed out-performance of high climate-responsible firms

(documented in previous sections).38

       Panel A of Table 9 describes the characteristics of institutional investors’ portfolios as
  38
    Our results also hold without adjusting for price changes, namely by simply comparing the portfolio’s
climate responsibility levels before and after the policy shock. We also ensure that our findings hold when
computing the portfolio climate responsibility after orthogonalizing by other firm characteristics, such as size
and taxes.

of Q3-2016, while Panel B shows the correlations between variables. Even before the 2016

election, investors with longer investment horizons (low turnovers) tended to hold portfolios

with higher average climate responsibility levels and lower average carbon intensities. These

results accord with those of Gibson and Krueger (2017) and of Starks, Venkat, and Zhu

(2017).



6.3       Results

Investors with different characteristics adjusted the climate responsibility of their portfolios

differentially following the 2016 climate policy shock, as shown in Table 10. For comparison,

column (1) reports the results for the quarter preceding the election. Interestingly, long-

horizon investors reacted to the election by actively moving towards climate-responsible

firms, after controlling for their prior exposure to climate responsibility. For instance, a one

standard deviation higher long-term orientation (i.e., lower portfolio turnover) is associated

with an increase of 8.7% of one standard deviation of ∆Portfolio CR (kld) at Q4-2016. This

effect strengthens in subsequent quarters through the end of 2017. Importantly, this effect is

not statistically significant in the quarter before Trump’s election (see Column 1).

   The coefficients on investors’ prior exposure to climate-responsible firms, Portfolio CR

(kld), are negative and highly statistically significant for all quarters under review. This

suggests that investors who already had relatively large holdings in climate-responsible firms

before the election did not exert the buying pressures that led to the increased climate

responsibility premium observed after Trump’s election. The persistence of interest that

the Current Preferences hypothesis would predict is soundly rejected. Instead, the out-

performance of climate-responsible firms can be at least partially attributed to increased

portfolio demand by long-horizon investors who prior to the election did not have relatively

large holdings of climate-responsible firms.

   Figure 5 shows the mean cumulated changes in portfolio climate responsibility from

Q3-2016 through Q4-2017 for four groups of institutional investors formed based on the

turnover and the climate responsibility of their portfolios as of Q3-2016. On each dimension,

they are broken into categories above and below the median.

   As can be seen, the investors that significantly increased their holdings in high climate-

responsible firms were those with a long-term investment horizon and no strong pre-election

tilt towards these companies. Long-horizon investors with a strong prior exposure to

climate-responsible firms, in fact, reduced their holdings in these companies, but they did so

   Overall, the results in this section support the idea that long-term institutional investors

value corporate climate responsibility for strategic reasons, and that the climate responsibility

premium observed after Trump’s election can be at least partially attributed to the Future

Expectations explanation. In other words, long-horizon investors reacted to Trump’s election

by anticipating investor demand for climate-responsible firms would increase in the non-

immediate future, and/or that there would be a potential boomerang to tighter regulation

post-Trump.

                                                                                          47
7     Conclusion

With Donald Trump’s surprise election, expectations about environmental policy took a

punch on the chin. Stock prices responded to the anticipation of laxer regulation. Companies

in carbon-intensive industries -- e.g., coal, steel works, metals, petroleum and natural gas --

enjoyed a short-run bump in price, as conventional theory would predict.

    Our primary analysis focuses more finely within industries. What should happen to firms

taking greater climate responsibility? If regulation were to be bumped in a less stringent

direction for the long term, with no other long-term consequences, climate-responsible firms

would be wasting monies on unrewarded good behavior. Climate responsibility would be

penalized.

    In fact, however, climate responsibility was rewarded. We evaluate two possible hypotheses

that could explain that reward. The first, the Current Preferences hypothesis, is that pro-

environment investors, facing hostile rhetoric and the prospect of climate policy profligacy,

experienced a greater warm glow from holding climate-responsible stocks than they would

have received had Clinton been elected, and they paid for this increased benefit. The

second, the Future Expectations hypothesis, is that strategic investors, despite receiving no

consumption-style benefits from holding climate-responsible stocks, expected those stocks

to perform better in the long run. They might have projected that post-Trump, stirred by

the climate hostility of prior years and the deteriorated environment, pro-environmental

investors would be receiving a more intense warm glow from owning climate-responsible firms.

Heightened government action, due to a regulatory boomerang once Trump had departed

office, would be an alternative and possibly complementary factor increasing the future value


                                              48
of climate-responsible firms.39

    To test these two hypotheses, we analyze how institutional investors adjusted their

portfolios after the election. Investors that already held relatively large amounts of climate-

responsible firms before the election, those whom we might initially have thought of as warm

glow investors, in fact tilted their portfolios not toward, but rather away from such stocks

afterwards. These were prime candidates for engaging in behavior in support of the Current

Preferences hypothesis. Their behavior soundly rejects that hypothesis. By contrast, investors

with a long-term orientation -- those most likely to buy climate-responsible stocks for strategic

purposes -- were net purchasers of climate-responsible stocks. Their behavior helps to explain

the boost in price those stocks experienced shortly after the Trump election, despite the more

hostile environment for climate policy. This finding is precisely the prediction of the Future

Expectations hypothesis.

    Importantly, we do not reach the Pollyannaish conclusion that market forces can fully

substitute for formal regulation to correct for climate externalities. They cannot. The net

effect of the 2016 climate policy shock on prospects for containing climate change may well

be strongly negative. However, that dark climate cloud does have a moderate silver lining.

While some observers assert that financial markets put a premium on short-termist thinking,
   39
      Recent practitioner opinions indeed suggest a ‘‘galvanizing’’ effect of Trump’s climate policy on socially
responsible investments (see, e.g., Financial Advisor, ‘‘As Trump Rolls Back Regulations, ESG Investing Is
Poised To Soar’’, April 3, 2017). For instance, in August 2017, Morningstar reported that the use of ESG
data on its platform for asset managers, advisory firms, and independent wealth managers had ‘‘quadrupled
since Trump’s January inauguration’’ (Morningstar, ‘‘President Trump Drives Investors to ESG’’, August 9,
2017). Similarly, in November 2018, the CEO of the US Sustainable Investment Forum (SIF) stated that the
unprecedented growth in sustainable investing observed in the U.S. between 2016 and 2018 can be partially
attributed to the reaction of investors to Trump’s climate policy (see Barron’s, ‘‘Sustainable Investing Assets
Hit USD 12 Trillion -- Thanks to Donald Trump’’, November 1, 2018). There is also anecdotal evidence of
an increased activism by US investors on environmental issues following Trump’s election. For instance, at
the 2017 annual general meeting of Exxon Mobil, 62% of shareholders backed a resolution demanding more
transparency on climate-related matters despite the opposition of the board (a similar resolution in 2016 only
received 38% support from shareholders).


                                                      49
our analysis identifies a significant group of investors who raise the value of firms taking a

long-term perspective. In this instance, they value firms’ making climate-responsible choices

as preparation for a more climate-conscious future.

Note: This table shows results of OLS regressions of our main models when controlling for firms’ corporate governance per-
formance. Panel A shows the results when using the corporate governance score from the MSCI KLD database. (We use
information on governance as of year-end 2013, the latest available data on the MSCI KLD database.) Panel B shows the results
when including the share of firms’ institutional ownership as of Q3-2016, based on WRDS SEC Analytics Suite data. Finally,
Panel C shows the results when using the 2016 corporate governance score provided by Vigeo-Eiris. All models include control
variables (cash ETR, foreign revenues, market leverage, log market cap, revenue growth, and profitability) and Fama-French
12-industry fixed effects. Table 6 describes the columns. Adjusted t-statistics in parentheses, calculated from the empirical time-
series distribution of returns on trading days between October 1, 2015 and September 30, 2016. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.

Note: This table shows results of OLS regressions of our main models when using raw and Fama-French-adjusted
returns as dependent variables. Panel A shows the results for the MSCI KLD sample. Panel B shows those for the
Vigeo Eiris sample. Panels A.1 and B.1 report results for raw returns, while Panels A.2 and B.2 present them for
Fama-French-adjusted returns. In addition to the climate-related variables, all models include firm characteristics
(cash ETR, foreign revenues, log market cap, revenue growth, profitability, and market leverage), and Fama-French
12-industry fixed-effects. Table 6 describes the columns. Adjusted t-statistics in parentheses, calculated from the
empirical time-series distribution of returns on trading days between October 1, 2015 and September 30, 2016. ***
