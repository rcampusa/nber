              Debt and Economic Activity in the United States



                                 ABSTRACT


       This paper documents a long-standing stability in the relationship

between outstanding debt and economic activity in the United States, and

explores the implications for capital formation of several hypotheses that

could explain this observed phenomenon.

       The aggregate of outstanding credit liabilities of all nonfinancial

borrowers in the United States bears as close a relationship to U.S. non-

financial economic activity as do the more familiar asset aggregates like

the money stock (however measured) or the monetary base. This stability in

the debt-to-income relationship reflects the net outcome of pronounced but

offsetting movements of the public and private components of the total debt

aggregate.

       Three different hypotheses provide potential explanations for this

phenomenon. Two of these, one emphasizing taxpayers' actions and one based

on credit market borrowing constraints, carry the implication that increases

in government debt outstanding associated with financing budget deficits

crowd out private financing and hence private capital formation. The third

hypothesis, which emphasizes the portfolio preferences of lenders, implies

that increased government financing will not crowd out private capital forma-

tion but will cause the private sector to shift from debt to equity financing.

                DEBT AND ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES


                            Benjamin M. Friedman*



         Businesses and individuals, in an economy like that of the United

 States, can finance their activities in a rich variety of ways. Businesses

investing in new plant and equipment can rely on internally generated funds,

or they can raise external funds from the financial markets. When they do turn

to external sources of funds, they can issue either debt obligations or new equity

shares in the enterprise. Individuals can likewise use their own or borrowed

funds to make major purchases like automobiles, and many individuals can also

borrow to finance ordinary consumer spending apart from major hardgoods. Even

in arranging home purchases, transactions that are almost always partly debt

financed, individuals usually can choose what fraction of the purchase price

initially represents their own equity. In principle, businesses and individuals

are continually making these and other financing choices on the basis of yield

comparisons, credit availability, and other considerations, so that the total

amount of debt financing does not necessarily have to bear any close relationship

to the underlying economic activity.

        In fact, however, the relationship between outstanding debt and economic

activity in the United States is remarkably steady —   indeed, just as steady as
the more widely recognized and better understood relationship between economic

activity and money. The aggregate outstanding indebtedness of all nonfinancial

borrowers in the United States has been approximately $1.40 for each $1.00 of

the economy's gross national product, ever since World War II. Throughout the

postwar period the overall debt—to—income ratio has displayed neither trend nor

cyclical variation.

        Moreover, the stability of the U.S. economy's outstanding debt in relation
                                      —2—




 to its income has not merely represented the stability of a sum of stable parts,

 as is apparently the case (apart from trend) among the familiar monetary aggre-

 gates. Neither private-sector debt nor government debt has borne a stable

 relationship to economic activity, but their total has. In particular, the

 secular rise and procyclical fluctuation in the private sector's debt have

approximately offset the corresponding secular decline (relative to income)

and countercyclical fluctuation in the federal government's debt.

        The stability of the debt-to-income relationship, if it is indeed a

regularity that will persist, bears a number of important implications for the

U.S. economy. The finding that debt is as reliably related to economic activity

as is money has immediate implications for the choice of monetary policy target.

It is also potentially relevant for fiscal policy, in that some hypotheses that

may explain the observed debt-to-income stability bear strong implications

for the "crowding out" of private investment by debt—financed government

spending. Finally, it is especially important in the context of the current

widespread concern over capital formation in the U.S. economy. The financing

of an increased capital formation rate in the l980s, as well as the aggregate-

level risk to the economy associated with that financing, depends in large part

on issues underlying the debt-to—income relationship.

        The object of this paper is to examine the debt-to--income stability

phenomenon in the United States, with particular attention to implications for

the financing of capital formation. Section I explains in what sense the

economy's outstanding debt is stable in relation to its income. Section II

reports on some empirical comparisons of relative stability for different

liability and asset aggregates. Section III outlines three separate hypotheses

that could plausibly account for the observed debt-to-income stability,

emphasizing the economic implications of these hypotheses, and briefly reports
                                      —3—




on some preliminary attempts to test them empirically. To anticipate, findings

thus far along these lines are largely inconclusive, so that the debt—to—

income stability phenomenon itself, while well documented, remains something

of a puzzle. Section IV concludes the paper by briefly considering some

implications of debt-to—income stability for the financing of U.S. capital

formation.

I. Debt and Income in the Postwar Period

        Table 1 presents data showing the yearend indebtedness of U.S. nonfinan-

cial borrowers, as a percentage of fourth—quarter gross national product, for

each year since 1945. The first column of the table shows the total credit

market indebtedness of all U.S. nonfinancial borrowers. The next five columns

present comparable data dividing this total into the respective indebtedness

of each of five specific borrowing sectors. The tablets final column shows,

as a memorandum item, comparable data (not included in the total in the first

column) for the debt issued in U.S. markets by foreign borrowers.1 Figure 1

plots the total nonfinancial debt ratio and its five components by sector.

        These data are "net" in the sense that they net out financial inter-

mediation. In other words, the data include such items as a household's

mortgage issued to a bank, or a corporation's bonds sold to an insurance

company, but they exclude any liability issued in turn by the bank or the

insurance company in order to finance that lending activity. The   data   also

exclude debt issued by separate financial subsidiaries of nonfinancial

corporations, as well as by federally sponsored credit agencies and mortgage

pools. The data are "gross," however, in the sense that they include all

of an individual household or firm's outstanding credit market liabilities,

not just any excess of liabilities over either financial or total assets,

and also in the sense that they include one household's borrowing from

another or one firm's borrowing from another.

       The strong stability of the total nonfinancial debt ratio, shown in

the top line in Figure 1 and the first column of Table 1, stands out in stark

contrast to the variation of the individual sector components. The non-

financial economy's reliance on debt, scaled in relation to economic activity,

has shown almost no trend and but little variation since World War II. During

  this period the total nonfinancial debt ratio has
                                                        trended slightly upward,
  apart from a dip in the first few postwar years, and has also exhibited a

  slight cyclicality, typically rising a point or two in recession years (when

 gross national product, in the denominator, is weak).

            The individual components of this total, however, have varied in

 sharply different directions both secularly and cyclically. In brief, the

 secular postwar rise in private debt has largely mirrored a substantial

 decline (relative to economic activity) in federal government debt, while

 cyclical bulges in federal debt issuance have mostly had their counterpart in

 the abatement of private borrowing. Households have almost continually increased

 their reliance on debt in relation to their nonfinancial
                                                              activity throughout
 this period. Both corporations and unincorporated businesses have also

 issued steadily more debt, on a relative basis, except for temporary retrench-

ments during recession years. State and local governments steadily increased

their relative debt issuing activity during the l950s and 1960s, but just as

steadily reduced it during the l970s. Except only for 1975-76 and 1980, the

federal government has reduced its debt ratio in every year since 1953, although

this relative debt reduction has been slower in years when recession has temporar-

ily inflated its deficit (and, again, depressed gross national product in the

denominator).

           Although the principal focus of this paper is on the postwar experience

shown in Table 1 and Figure 1, it is also useful to consider briefly the history

of the economy's debt ratio in a longer time frame.      Figure 2 shows the size
arid   composition   of the U.S. nonfinancial debt ratio (with corporations and

unincorporated businesses aggregated) for 1918_78.2 Apart from a one—time

adjustment associated with the fall of prices after World War I, the U.S.

nonfinancial economy's reliance on debt relative to economic activity showed

essentially no trend over these sixty years. At 143% as of yearend 1978,

the debt ratio was virtually unchanged from 142% in 1921. NonfinanCial

borrowers' outstanding debt rose significantly in relation to gross national

product only during the depression years 1930—33, when gross national product

itself not only was well below trend but also was falling too rapidly for the

pay-down of debt to keep pace.3 Otherwise the economy's total nonfinancial

debt ratio remained roughly steady throughout this period, and the postwar

stability therefore appears to be in large part a continuation of a pattern

that dates back at least to the 1920s.

II. Comparative Stability 1\nalysis

        In order to determine that a relationship is stable, it is important

to have at hand some benchmark for comparative purposes.   In other words,

if the debt-to-income relationship is to be judged "stable," then stable in

comparison to what? Table 2 indicates five liability aggregates (including

total nonfinancial debt, as shown in ratio form in Table 1 and Figure 1) and

five asset aggregates used for such comparative purposes in a series of tests

of the stability of each of these aggregates in relation to U.S. economic

activity during l953—78. In brief, the results of these tests are as follows:5

        Comparison of Ratios. Table 1 shows the ratio of the U.S. economy's

total nonfinancial debt to gross national product. One form of relative stabil-

ity test is simply to compare the variability of this ratio over time, as

measured by its coefficient of variation (standard deviation divided by the

mean), with that of analogous ratios for other liability or asset aggregates.

As the first and third columns of Table 3 show, this comparison for data

including time trends indicates that total net assets and total nonfinancial

debt are (in that order) the most stable, while the Ml money stock and the

monetary base (in that order) are the least stable, among the ten aggregates.

The corresponding comparison for detrended data, shown in the adjacent columns

of Table 3, again indicates that total net assets is the most stable aggregate

in relation to gross national product, with total debt and total nonfinancial

debt, respectively, a close second and third. The monetary base exhibits

the least stability on a detrended basis, with private nonfinancial liabilities

and the Ml money stock close behind. Orderings based on annual data are essen-

tially the same as those based on quarterly data.

        Nominal Income Regressions. Simple ratios of precisely contemporaneous

observations may well fail to capture the relevant concept of "stability" in

 the relationship among variables that move over time with some general lead

 or lag pattern between them. A second relative stability test therefore

 involves estimating ten regression equations, in each case relating the growth

 of nominal gross national product to a moving average of the growth of one of

 the ten financial aggregates listed in Table 3, plus a moving average of a

 fiscal policy measure, along the lines made familiar by the Federal Reserve

 Bank of St. Louis. As the fifth column of Table 3 shows, total net assets

performs best in this test based on quarterly data for 1953—78, with a standard

error of 0.85% per quarter in "explaining" the historical growth of gross nation-

al product, while bank credit (standard error 0.97%) performs worst.6 Total

nonfinancial debt is about in the middle. Because the evidence indicates

at least some significant break in each of the underlying regressions at around

1970, the last column of Table 4 also shows the respective standard errors for

analogous regression equations based on data for 1970—78 only. For this shorter

period the relative performance of total nonfinancial debt is somewhat better,

equalling that of the Ml money stock.

        Richer Dynamic Representations. In part because of the extent to which

regressions of the St. Louis form have been discredited by a variety of criticisms,

researchers examining the money-to—income (or, here, debt—to—income) relationship

have increasingly turned to methods that allow for a richer dynamic interaction

between money and income by relating the variation of income not to the entirety

of the variation of money but only to that part of it which cannot already

be deduced either from the past history of money itself or from the joint past

history of both money and income.7 In this context a key indication of the

stability of the relationship to income of any financial aggregate is the

behavior of that relationship following just such an innovation," or unantici-

pated movement, in the aggregate. The aggregate—to—income ratio of course rises

at first after a positive innovation, but it will then fall back toward a normal
                                     —9—




position if the rise in the aggregate induces a subsequent rise in income

(or a reversal in the aggregate itself). Both the timing and the magnitude

of the ratio's return to normal provide important information about the stabil-

ity of the dynamic aggregate-to-income relationship.

        Experimentation along these indicates that, on the whole, there is

little ground for distinguishing the stability of any one of the five asset

aggregates listed in Table 2 from that of any other. The same is not true for the

five liability aggregates, however. Here only the total nonfinancial debt ratio

(again, the series shown in Table 1), and to a lesser extent the bank credit

ratio, return to their initial values rapidly and   without   overshooting after a

shock to the relevant aggregate. What is especially interesting in these results

is the contrast between the performance of the ratio for total nonfinancial debt

and the ratios for non-federal debt and private debt (both of which are just

components of the total) as well as the broader total debt measure. Both the

private debt ratio and the non—federal debt ratio continue to move further

away from their initial values for two years in response to an innovation

in the relevant aggregate, and neither shows any significant return to its

initial value within five years — hardly a demonstration of stability. Once

federal government debt is included, however, the total nonfinancial debt ratio

exhibits just as much stability in this context as does any of the five asset

raios. Moreover, proceeding to broaden the liability aggregate further by

including financial intermediaries' credit market liabilities only results in

lessened apparent stability.

        Among the various liability measures considered, therefore, these results

suggest that there is indeed something unique about total nonfinancial debt: It

is as if the Ml money stock ratio were sharply unstable, but adding commercial

bank time and saving deposits to form the M2 money stock ratio yielded stability,
                                        —10—




 and further adding thrift Institution deposits to form the M3 money stock

 ratio destroyed that stability — none of which appears to happen. Hence

 not only does the total nonfinancial debt ratio exhibit just as much stability

 as any of the five asset ratios in these dynamic tests, it does so uniquely

 among the various liability aggregates tested.8

         Overview. In sum,   the   evidence provided by these three different
kinds of tests shows that at least one aggregate measure of outstanding debt

liabilities —   total   nonfinancial debt —    consistently   exhibits just as much
stability in relation to economic activity as do the more familiar asset

aggregates including the money stock (however measured).        Indeed, some of these
tests suggest that the debt-to-income relationship, measured in this way, is

more stable than   any of the various money—to-Income relationships.      Regardless
of whether the U.S. debt—to—income
                                      relationship is "as stable as" or "more

stable than" that for money, however, like the
                                                   money-to—income relationship
it is potentially important for understanding the economy. By contrast,

although the money—to—income relationship has long been the focus of attention,

the debt-to-income relationship has to date received little notice.

III. Three Possible Explanations

        What accounts for this phenomenon? Unlike the case of income and money,

for which well accepted models of the role of money in the economic process do

suggest a close relationship on a priori grounds, what little study the role of

debt has received in the literature thus far has not appeared to indicate any

necessarily close or stable relationship to income. Explaining the observed

stability of the debt—to-income relationship therefore presents a major

research challenge.

        A useful starting place for thinking about the underlying economic

behavior that could plausibly explain the observed stability of the relation-

ship between the nonfinancial economy's total liabilities and its income

is the familiar proposition that, because people hold wealth for the stream

of services (positive for assets, negative for liabilities) it provides, they

therefore maintain some approximately fixed target for overall wealth in relation

to their incomes. Each person's wealth—to—income target is age—specific, of course,

but if the age structure of the population is roughly stable over time the economy's

aggregate wealth-to-income ratio will be approximately stable as well.9

        Work to date suggests three potential explanations for a stable debt-to-

income ratio, each of which proceeds from the assumption of a stable wealth—to—

income ratio for the economy as a whole:

        An Ultrarationality Hypothesis. One such potential explanation is an

"ultrarationality" hypothesis that in part recasts into stock—flow form work

by David and Scadding [2 1   intended to explain the stability of the U.S. gross
private saving rate as noted earlier on by Denison [ 3 1.   If the streams of
services (again, positive for assets and negative for liabilities) provided

by specific components of overall wealth are imperfect substitutes for one

another, then the same analysis that implies a stable target wealth in relation
                                     —12—




to income also implies a stable "sub—target" for each component —   including
indebtedness. If, in addition, individuals "see through the shell" of gov n-

ment and corporations, as David and Scadding argued, then they will regard debt

obligations issued by the government (for the case of taxpayers) and by

corporations (for shareholders) as equivalent to their own liabilities.

        Under the ultrarationality hypothesis, therefore, the observed stabil-

ity of the aggregate debt-to-income relationship has primarily reflected the

response of the private sector to movements in the government's indebtedness.

Given any variation in the government's liabilities, for whatever purposes may

be indicated by public policy, the private sector consisting of households

and the corporations that the households own will simply adjust by issuing

enough debt to offset the government's action. Yet a further elaboration

of the same basic idea that changes nothing fundamental is to view corporations

as also responding to independent objectives or influences (for example, tax

laws), and households as then adjusting their debt positions to offset the

given actions of both the government and the corporations. In either case,

the nonfinancial economy will seek (and achieve) a stable ratio of its aggregate

liabilities to income, regardless of the composition of that aggregate.

        The ultrarationality hypothesis is interesting for several reasons

that go beyond its potential ability to explain the debt-to-income stability

phenomenon. From a purely behavioral standpoint it carries strong implications

about individuals' perceptions and about familiar aspects of wealth holding. In

addition, as David and Scadding have pointed out, it implies that people regard

as close substitutes personal saving and corporate saving, as well as personal

consumption and taxes. Hence "crowding out ex ante" renders fiscal policy

impotent in both the short and the long run.

        A Capital Leveraging Hypothesis. A second potential explanation is a
                                          —13—




"capital    leveraging" hypothesis that emphasizes credit market imperfections

and the need of most would-be borrowers to provide some kind of collateral,

explicit or implicit, in order to obtain credit. To the extent that people

do not see through the shell of government, or that the distribution of tax

liabilities and the distribution of bond holdings overlap only weakly, the

private sector's assets (after netting out inside debt) consist of tangible

assets — including not only corporate assets like plant and equipment but also

residential real estate and consumer durables —plus government bonds. If

people have not only a stable target for net wealth but also a stable sub—

target for total assets in relation to income, then they will vary their

holdings of tangible assets so as to offset variations in the government's

outstanding indebtedness. Variations in the private sector's holdings of tan-

gible assets also typically affect its borrowing capacity, however. When

collateral constraints are binding, the increase in tangible asset holdings

that follows as a consequence of a reduction in the government's indebtedness

therefore facilitates a corresponding increase in the private sector's out-

standing liabilities.

          The importance of credit market constraints is most readily apparent in

the household sector's debt arrangements. In fact, borrowing against tangible

assets in the form of home mortgage and consumer installment credit has

constituted the overwhelming majority of the household sector's credit market

indebtedness at least since World War II (89% as of yearend 1980). Similarly,

the borrowing of many corporations consists primarily of explicitly secured

long—term   market debt, in the form of mortgages or "first mortgage" bonds,    and

implicitly secured       short—term bank debt matched by inventory holdings.
          If   credit   market collateral constraints restrict the private sector's
ability   to substitute its own liabilities in place of the government's declining
                                    —14—




indebtedness, the private sector can increase its outstanding liabilities only

to the extent that it is also accumulating more tangible assets with which to

back them. Under the capital leveraging hypothesis, therefore, the stability

of the U.S. nonfinancial debt ratio has reflected in the first instance

an increase in tangible assets in approximately the proportion necessary to

hold the private sector's net worth fixed in relation to income, as its owner-

ship of government liabilities has declined relative to income. By easing the

effective credit market constraints, this relative increase in tangible assets

facilitates the increase in private-sector liabilities. If private liabilities

increase fully in step with tangible asset holdings, while tangible assets

increase in step with the reduction in government debt, then total nonfinancial

debt (private plus government) will remain stable in relation to income.

        The capital leveraging hypothesis also bears a number of potentially

interesting implications apart from any connection to the stable debt—to—

income relationship. Probably the most important of these is the picture

it provides of the importance of collateral constraints in the everyday work-

ing of the credit markets. In addition, it implies that the government's

deficit is a major determinant of the economy's physical investment. Unlike

the case of the ultrarationality hypothesis, however, there is no necessary

connection between consumption and taxes, so that fiscal policy can affect

not just the composition of income but also its total.

        An Asset Demand Hypothesis. Finally — at least with respect to work

done thus far — a third potential explanation is that the appearance of

stability in the economy's liability issuing behavior is merely a consequence

of balance—sheet identities and market-clearing conditions imposed on stable

asset holding behavior. If the separate streams of services provided by

tangible assets and financial assets are imperfect substitutes, then people
                                      —15—




will have stable sub—targets in relation to income for the two asset classes

separately. In other words, the demand for financial assets, given income,

will be relatively interest inelastic. Since total financial assets held

must equal total financial assets issued, however, the combination of inelas-

tic demand and an at least partly elastic supply will also result in a stable

relationship between income and total financial assets issued.1°

           The most interesting implications of the resulting "asset demand"

hypothesis concern the role of equities in asset holders' portfolios, and the

nature of financial intermediation. Because what is stable in relation to

income is outstanding debt liabilities of nonfinancial borrowers, a stable

demand for total financial assets is, in the end, not a sufficient explanation

after all. In addition, it is necessary to posit not only that investors treat

debt and equity securities as only weakly substitutable — an assumption that

in turn bears importantly on the debate about the "ex post crowding out" of

private spending by debt—financed fiscal policy — but also that, in holding

debt obligations issued by an intermediary, investors look through the shell

of the intermediary too.11

           Test Results. Efforts thus far to test these three potential explanations

for the stable debt—to-income relationship, using data for the U.S. household

and nonfinancial corporate business sectors, have not produced conclusive

results.

           Perhaps the strongest statement possible on the basis of these results

is that the capital leveraging hypothesis is clearly not the entire answer. As

Figure 3 shows, neither individuals nor nonfinancial business corporations

have on balance increased their indebtedness merely in pace with their ownership

of tangible assets. During 1947-66 for individuals, and during 1957—73 for

corporations, the rapid increase in private—sector indebtedness also represented

increasing leverage.

           Tests do, however, reveal at least some positive evidence consistent

with each of the three hypotheses.12 For example, the dynamic relationship

between the federal and non—federal components of the total nonfinancial

debt—to—income ratio shows a distinct tendency for the non-federal debt ratio

to fall in relation to a positive innovation (in the sense described in Section Ti)

in the federal debt ratio, after a delay of about one year. Conversely, a

positive innovation in the non—federal debt ratio causes the federal debt ratio

to fall, essentially without delay. In a study of the three-way interaction

among federal debt, corporate debt and corporate tangible asset holdings, a

positive innovation in the federal debt ratio immediately reduces corporate

tangible   assets and corporate indebtedness relative to income, thereby lending
support to the capital leveraging hypothesis. In an analogous study for the
household   sector, a positive innovation in the federal debt ratio immediately

reduces household tangible assets relative to income, but the associated reduc-

tion of household indebtedness follows only after a puzzling delay of two years.

        Overall, although (at least) three different explanations are available

for the observed stability of the debt-to-income relationship in the United

States, the evidence now at hand is insufficient to choose among them. The

debt-to-income phenomenon remains for the present a major puzzle. In light

of its potential importance, finding the right explanation is an objective

that clearly warrants further research.

  IV.       ications for Debt and Equity Financing of Capital Formation
          An increased rate of capital formation has
                                                     emerged as a nearly undisputed
  objective of U.s. economic policy for the
                                                  l980s. Dissatisfaction with the U.S.
  economy's poor productivity performance in the 1970s, as well as with the

  erosion of international competitiveness
                                                 that began much earlier but also
  became more evident in the l970s
                                     as the international exchange value of the
  dollar declined dramatically, has elevated what was once largely a business

  interest into a much more widely shared
                                             goal. In today's environment groups
 representing labor and consumers also recognize the need
                                                                for capital investment
 to create jobs and to raise productivity and hence the population's overall

 standard of living. On the whole, public discussion has moved from whether

 more capital formaEion is desirable to what policies can best achieve it.

         An important aspect of capital formation that this discussion has

 often overlooked, however, is its explicitly financial side. In an economy

 like that of the United States, each decision to create more physical capital

 necessarily has a financial counterpart. Moreover, the financial transactions

 associated with capital formation are not merely a reflection of real resource

 allocations that would necessarily come about in any case. The setting in

which the financing of capital formation takes place can also be a key deter-

minant of real resource allocations,
                                          including not only the total amount of

capital formation undertaken but also its composition. The financial and the

nonfinancial elements of the process jointly determine one another, and public

policy can affect the ultimate outcome by
                                              influencing either.

        It is also important to recognize that businesses and individuals in

the U.S. economy have in fact been undertaking more capital formation rather

than less, at least in the usual sense of investment in plant and equipment.

As the first coluxm-i of Table 4 shows,

expenditures on plant and equipment actually increased as a share of the nation's

gross national product. More importantly, however, while gross capital formation

has represented a progressively larger share of total output, the corresponding

net capital formation underwent a sharp reversal within this period. As the

second column of the table shows, net U.S. investment in plant and equipment

 (that is, net of the true economic depreciation) rose rapidly as a share of

total output between the late l950s and the late 1960s, but then fell back

almost as rapidly by the late 1970s.

            Still, it is gross capital outlays that the businesses and individuals

investing in plant and equipment need to finance. Corporations engaged in

nonfinancial lines of business have consistently accounted for nearly three—

fourths of all U.S. investment in plant and equipment since World War II.

As the next two columns of Table 4 show, over the last quarter-century the

U.S. nonfinancial corporate business sector has increasingly relied on external

as opposed to internal funds (including depreciation allowances) in financing

its capital outlays.13 Moreover, as the table's final colmTtns show, corporations

have consistently raised almost all of these external funds by issuing debt,

and   in   doing so they have increasingly relied on short—term instruments.
                                                                               14


           How has the economy absorbed this enormous expansion in the corporate

sector's reliance on debt? As the discussion in Section I of the U.S. economy's

stable overall debt—to—income ratio notes, the chief counterpart of the increasing

corporate (and household) indebtedness relative to income over much of this

period has been the federal government's declining indebtedness relative to

income.

           Recognition of this stable overall debt-to-income relationship raises

two important questions about the financing of an increased rate of U.S. capital

formation in the 1980s: First, if business corporations undertake sharply
                                    -19-




increased capital outlays, will they be able to continue their reliance on

debt financing if the federal government's indebtedness relative to gross nation-

al product declines only slowly (or not at all) as in the l970s, in contrast

to the rapid decline in the 1950s and 1960s? The historical experience repre—

sented by the data shown in Table 1 and Figure 1 suggests otherwise. If the

stability of the economy's aggregate nonfinancial debt-to-income ratio is

indeed a regularity likely to persist, then the corporate sector will be able

to undertake more investment in plant and equipment only if the government's

relative indebtedness falls, or if corporations turn increasingly to equity

finance through retention of internally generated funds or issues of new shares.

        Second, even if declining federal government indebtedness relative to

income does enable the corporate sector to finance increased capital outlays

by further increasing its own indebtedness relative to income, what effect

will this renewed change in the U.S. economy's government/private debt mix

have on the economy's overall level of financial risk? In an economy with

highly developed financial markets, potential hazards to the sbability of the

economy as a whole arise not just from the disruptions that from time to time

may disturb the economy's nonfinancial activity directly but also from fragility

of the financial superstructure built around it. Although a detailed considera-

tion of the level of aggregate financial risk associated with any given further

change in the government/private debt mix lies beyond the scope of this paper,

it is clear that, without a base of presumably default-free government debt

(or private debt rendered default—free through effective monetization), each

market participant's financial assets consist simply of other market participants'

liabilities.15 Even if it is not necessary for the corporate sector to turn

to equity finance because of an inability to increase its relative indebtedness,

therefore, in the context of a sharply increased U.S. capital formation rate
                                      —20—




greater   reliance on equity finance may have an important role to play in this

process anyway.

 *professor of Economics, Harvard University. This paper, prepared for the
  National Bureau of Economic Research conference on "The Changing Roles of
  Debt and Equity in Financing U.S. Capital Formation," is a part of the
  National Bureau's research project on this subject sponsored by the American
  Council of Life Insurance. The paper draws in large part on my earlier
  research done within this project. I am grateful to the National Bureau
  and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation for research support.

 1. In part because of the capital export controls that were in force during
     1964—74, foreign obligors accounted for only a small fraction of borrowing
     in the U.S. markets throughout this period.

 2. Figure 2 is from my earlier paper [5].

 3. The debt ratio peak during 1918-78 occurred in 1933, the trough year
     of the depression. In addition, much of the household and business debt
     nominally outstanding during the depression was of questionable value.

 4. It is important to exclude the pre-1953 data because of the behavior of
     the monetary aggregates while the Federal Reserve System stabilized govern-
     ment bond prices before the Treasury—Federal Reserve Accord.

 5. The full sets of test results are reported in my earlier paper [6 ].

 6. An equation with standard error of 0.85% would be expected to predict
     the GNP growth rate to within        two-thirds of the time. This ranking
     ignores the superior result for M3 based on a shorter sample period.

 7. Among the most important criticisms of the St. Louis approach have been
     those of Goldfeld and Blinder [8 ), Sargent [13], and Mocligliani and Ando [121.
     The methodology underlying the tests described below is due largely to
     Granger and Sims; see especially Sims [14].

 8. Similar tests that distinguish the reaction of nominal income between effects
     on real income and effects on prices (not described in the text) show
     essentially identical results.

 9. Modigliani [11] provided a clear discussion of these propositions, showing
     how they are derivable from more fundamental principles.

10. At the most fully aggregated level — that is, with the government and the
    private sector consolidated — there would be no meaningful distinction
    between the demand and supply side of the asset markets for purposes of
    measurement. This problem is merely an example of the fundamental indentifi—
    cation problem emphasized by Brainard and Tobin [1 ] and Smith [15].

11. My earlier paper [4] showed why the substitutability of debt and equity
     securities is so important for the "crowding out" issue.

12. My earlier paper [6 1 included a more detailed discussion of these tests
     and their implications.
13. The appearance of a reversal in the latest half-decade is largely due to
     the aftermath of the unusually severe 1973-75 recession as well as
     the 1980 recession.

14. My earlier paper [7] discussed these patterns of corporate financing, and
     their implications for capital formation, in greater detail.

15. Minsky's work has typically emphasized this issue; see, for example,
     Minsky [9, 10]. My earlier paper [7] discussed the resulting aspect
     of financial stability as a "public good."
