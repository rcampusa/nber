                                           ABSTRACT

       The question of how entrepreneurship relates to income mobility is cogent given the current
public debate about the sources of income inequality and mobility in United States society. We
examine how experience with entrepreneurship has affected an individual’s place in the earnings
distribution. Our basic tack is to follow individuals’ positions in the income distribution over time,
and to see how their mobility (or lack thereof) was affected by involvement with entrepreneurship.
Our main finding is that for low-income individuals there is some merit to the notion that the self-
employed moved ahead in the earnings distribution relative to those who remained wage earners.
On the other hand, for those at the upper end of the earnings distribution, those who became self-
employed often advanced less in the earnings distribution than their salaried counterparts.

1.     INTRODUCTION

       The Horatio Alger theme continues to exert a powerful grip on the American imagination.

Its basic message is that one can get ahead in life by striking out on one’s own as an

entrepreneur.1 This notion is consistent with sociologists’ accounts of the immigrants’

experience in the United States: “But as against the worker, each businessman had the

possibility, slim though it was, of achieving influence and perhaps wealth” [Glazer and

Moynihan, 1970, pp. 30-31]. A recent variation on this theme is that encouraging

entrepreneurship would be a good strategy for improving the economic status of black people.

For example, the distinguished journalist William Raspberry [1991, p. A23] has argued that there

“is a need to shift the black focus from jobs to ownership, from income to wealth, from political

office to using politics to improve the climate for black business development.” More generally,

the question of how entrepreneurship relates to earnings mobility is cogent given the current

public debate about income inequality and mobility in United States society.2 As the Wall Street

Journal recently suggested, the stakes in this debate are high:


       a widening wage gap alone doesn’t prove that the rich are getting forever richer and the
       poor forever poorer. Annual pay provides only a snapshot of worker well-being...Do
       people who hit the skids one year move up the income ladder the next? Do the poor
       ascend easily enough to make up for the paltry wages they earn while still at the bottom?
       That is the real test of whether the U.S. is an increasingly caste-based society (Phillips
       [1996, p. A1]).


       Economists have now produced a substantial number of careful empirical studies

designed to address these and related issues, both for the United States and a number of European

countries.3 For the most part, however, these studies have ignored possible links between

entrepreneurship and earnings mobility.4 The purpose of this paper is to provide a statistical

history of how experience with entrepreneurship has affected earnings mobility. Our basic

strategy is to track individuals’ positions in the earnings distribution over time, and to see how
their mobility (or lack thereof) was affected by involvement with entrepreneurship. Of course,

individuals select into and out of entrepreneurship. We do not attempt to analyze this self-

selection process, so we cannot determine what would have happened to a randomly selected

person who became an entrepreneur. Rather, we have the more modest goal of summarizing how

entrepreneurship has actually affected the relative positions of those individuals who have

tried it.

            Section 2 provides a first cut at the data with a comparison of mobility tables for wage-

earners and entrepreneurs. The focus here is on movements from one quintile of the earnings

distribution to another. In Section 3 we impose more structure on the data in order to estimate

how entrepreneurship affects one’s position in the distribution conditional on education,

experience, race, gender, and other variables. Our main finding is that there is some merit to the

notion that self-employment has been a way for low-earnings individuals to move up in the

earnings distribution, relative to those who were salaried. On the other hand, high-earnings

individuals who got involved with self-employment tended to move downward relative to their

wage-earning counterparts. These general tendencies were present for all demographic groups,

although there were some interesting differences by gender and race. Section 4 has the

conclusion and suggestions for future research.



2.          PRELIMINARIES: MOBILITY TABLES

            Our analysis is based upon the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), which has

interviewed annually a representative sample of some 5,000 families since 1968.5 We analyze

information on men and women between the ages of 25 and 55 for the calendar years 1969 to




                                                    -2-
1990. We focus on this “prime-age” group to avoid the complications that arise from younger

individuals’ labor market entry decisions and older individuals’ impending retirements.



       2.1     Key Concepts

       Our first problem is to identify the entrepreneurs in our sample. The PSID asks each

individual, “On your main job, are you self-employed, are you employed by someone else, or

what?” Throughout this paper, we characterize the self-employed as being “entrepreneurs.” In

the nonstatistical literature on this topic, entrepreneurs are characterized in Schumpeterian

terms—they are daring, overflowing with animal spirits and creativity, and so on. Those who do

statistical work must settle for observable (and hence, more prosaic) criteria for identifying

entrepreneurs. With survey data of this sort, self-employment is a sensible proxy, and it has been

used in a number of previous studies.6 Some individuals indicated that they were simultaneously

self-employed and wage-earners. Somewhat arbitrarily, we put these individuals in the self-

employed category. Fortunately, the decision is not crucial; there are few such observations

(only 0.5 percent on average), and our substantive conclusions are unaffected when we classify

these individuals as wage-earners.

       Both salary workers and the self-employed were asked to report their labor earnings; this

figure includes any bonuses, overtime, and commissions. As is the case with most data sets, the

PSID does not allow us to measure comprehensively the economic income accruing to

individuals in the form of in-kind payments and various fringe benefits. In addition to this

familiar difficulty, a particular problem arises in comparing the earnings of entrepreneurs and

wage-earners. The PSID question on self-employment earnings asked, “How much was (your)

share of the total income from business in (the year)—that is, the amount (you) took out plus any




                                                -3-
profit left in?” Total income from business depends not only on the entrepreneur’s labor input,

but any capital invested as well. Thus, we can imagine a situation in which the “earnings” of an

individual increased after he made a transition to entrepreneurship, but this was due to the return

on the capital that he had invested in the enterprise, as opposed to his labor. And the PSID

provides no way to estimate the capital share of self-employment income.

       One response to this observation is to note that a great many entrepreneurial enterprises

have little or no capital, so as a practical matter, this is not an important drawback.7 Indeed,

using data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), which allows one to

estimate the capital component of self-employment earnings, Hamilton [1995, p. 29] found that,

in general, results relating to earnings differences between entrepreneurs and salaried individuals

do not differ substantively when the capital income component is taken into account. Further, on

the basis of examination of Survey of Consumer Finances data, Yuengert [1996] concluded that

the self-employed actually overstate capital income relative to labor income. Thus, to the extent

there is a bias, its direction is not clear. This may be the reason that most studies of self-

employment income simply ignore this issue.8 That said, we do make an attempt to roughly

gauge its importance for our substantive results. If the individual takes some of his or her

family’s money and invests it in the enterprise, then it might make sense to examine how family

income changes when the individual makes a transition to entrepreneurship. Hence, we repeat

our major analyses focusing on movements within the family income distribution as opposed to

movements within the individual earnings distribution. No important substantive results

emerged.9

       A final issue relating to the measurement of earnings concerns the treatment of

individuals with no reported earnings. We assume that those who never reported labor earnings




                                                  -4-
during our sample period were not actively participating in the labor market and exclude them

from the analysis. Some individuals, however, reported zero labor earnings in some years and

positive values in others. Movements between positive and zero earnings may be an important

part of our story, so such individuals are kept in the sample.



        2.2    Constructing Mobility Tables

        With earnings for each individual in hand, the next step is to summarize their movements

through time. The traditional way to do this is to compute mobility tables showing movements

among different parts of the income distribution, so that is how we begin our analysis. Following

Burkhauser, Holtz-Eakin, and Rhody [1997], we computed mobility tables as follows: In each

year, for example 1980, we ranked individuals by their earnings (as defined above), and

calculated each individual’s quintile in the distribution. We then went to the next year (1981)

and calculated the individual’s quintile in that year’s earnings distribution. We know, then,

whether each individual moved up, moved down, or stayed in the same quintile. To get some

sense of “typical” behavior, we averaged over individuals in the sample. Specifically, define the

indicator variables    to be equal to 1 if individual i made a transition from quintile q to quintile

r, and zero otherwise. Our estimate of the probability of moving between quintiles q and r is



                                                                                                        (2.1)



where wi is the sample weight for individual i and Nq is the number of individuals initially in

quintile q.




                                                 -5-
       This process produces a picture of mobility between any two years (1980 and 1981 in this

example). Next, we collected together all the year-to-year comparisons—1970 to 1971, 1971 to

1972, etc.—and calculated the average experience, which we call “one-year” mobility.10 In order

to see how becoming an entrepreneur affected mobility, we divided the set of one-year transitions

into two groups: those in which the individual was a wage-earner in the first year and self-

employed the next, and all the rest. We then computed one-year mobility tables for both groups.

       It is well-established that mobility patterns depend on the length of the transition period

(see, for example, Atkinson, Bourguignon, and Morrisson [1992, p. 138]). Hence, in addition to

one year transitions, it is important to analyze the longer term effects of experience with

entrepreneurship on mobility. We therefore computed five-year mobility measures as well. To

do so, we again began by calculating the quintile for each individual in each year (say 1980). We

then examined the individual’s situation five years later (in this case, 1985), and computed

whether he or she moved up a quintile, down a quintile, and so forth. We next calculated the

fraction of individuals who moved up or down by various numbers of quintiles, and took

averages over all the five-year periods. We call this average “five-year” mobility. To assess the

impact of self-employment on five-year mobility, we took all the five-year transitions and

divided them into two groups—those in which the individual was a wage-earner in the initial

year (say 1980) and self-employed in any two of the five subsequent years (in this case 1981-85);

and everyone else. The former are deemed to have become “self-employed” during the period.

We then computed separate mobility tables for both groups.

       An obvious problem with this method is that it arbitrarily lumps together individuals who

were self-employed only two years with those who remained self-employed for up to five years

and, similarly, ignores the self-employment experience of those who were in that category for




                                                -6-
only one year. One could address this problem by computing separate mobility tables for those

with one, two, three, four, and five years of self-employment experience during the transition

period, but the number of observations per table would be too small to allow us to make reliable

inferences. Further, one would soon start drowning in numbers. This points to a problem with

using mobility tables to investigate the role of entrepreneurship—it is cumbersome to investigate

how various experiences with self-employment affect mobility, ceteris paribus. More generally,

mobility tables are inconvenient for exploring how other variables such as experience and

education may interact with self-employment experience. Another manifestation of this problem

is that mobility tables do not allow us to distinguish between the effect of a transition per se

versus the impact of additional years of self-employment experience. A discrete model simply

cannot deal with such continuous phenomena. All of this said, the tables provide a wealth of

useful information on the distribution of movements within the population. Further, they

facilitate comparisons with earlier studies. Hence, our tack is to present the mobility tables, even

given their limitations, and then in Section 3 to provide a complementary approach that is more

concise and structural (but has less information about the distribution of transitions).



       2.3     Results

       Our presentation of the mobility tables begins in Table 1, in which we display one-year

transition results for the entire sample, and transition results broken down by various

demographic groups. In each table, the first figure in cell (i,j) shows the proportion of

individuals originally in quintile i who were in quintile j one year later. The second figure in the

cell is the associated number of observations used to compute the transition rate.11 Transition

matrices on the left-hand side of the page are based on individuals who were wage earners both




                                                 -7-
years of the two-year period, and those on the right-hand side are for individuals who began as

wage earners and made a transition to self-employment.12 For example, the first cell of the first

matrix tells us that of the set of individuals who remained wage-earners, about 75 percent of

those who were in lowest quintile of the earnings distribution initially were also in the lowest

quintile one year later. Further, there were 7,204 data points representing such transitions. Note

that the figures on the diagonal tell us the percentage of individuals in each quintile who do not

change quintiles at all. They provide a simple but useful way to characterize the degree of

mobility—the greater the size of the diagonal element, the less the mobility, ceteris paribus.13

       Let us first consider the results at the top of the table, which pool together all the

demographic groups. Among individuals who did not make a transition to self-employment,

there was not a great deal of one-year mobility. The figures on the diagonals of the matrix

indicate that, in every earnings quintile, the probability of remaining in that quintile exceeded 60

percent. The likelihood of remaining in the very highest quintile was 85 percent. This finding of

low mobility is no surprise. The salaried-both-periods sample comprises the bulk of individuals

in the data, and it is well known that for the population as a whole, mobility rates are very low

over short time periods (see Atkinson, Bourguignon, and Morrisson [1992, p. 139]).

       Comparing these results to those for individuals who made a transition to self-

employment we note that, except in the bottom quintile, the probability of remaining in any given

quintile was lower than the corresponding probability for those who did not make a transition.

For example, of those who started out in the middle quintile and became self-employed, only 40

percent were there a year later, as opposed to 64 percent in the other group. What happened to

the 60 percent of the newly self-employed who changed quintiles? Some of them advanced

substantially in the earnings distribution—5.59 percent of the newly self-employed ended up in




                                                 -8-
the top quintile, as opposed to only 1.40 percent of those who remained wage-earners. But about

43 percent of the newly self-employed who started in the third quintile ended up in the lower two

quintiles, as opposed to only about 18 percent of the wage-earners. This theme will repeat itself

throughout our analysis: movements into self-employment were associated with greater mobility,

but it was downward as well as upward.14

       The next two pairs of matrices allow us to compare the mobility patterns of males and

females. Consider first individuals who remained wage earners. Comparing the figures on the

diagonals across matrices, we see that except in the top quintile, men were more mobile than

women. Of those who did not make a transition, for example, 60 percent of the males who

started in the third quintile remained there, while for women this figure was 67 percent. In

contrast, when we consider those who became self-employed, except in the bottom quintile, men

were more likely to remain in the quintile in which they began. For both males and females, the

probability of an extreme outcome was higher for those who became self-employed. However,

men appear to have had a better chance of obtaining a positive outcome from a move to self-

employment. For example, about 22 percent of males who started in the third quintile moved

upward in the earnings distribution, while for females this was only 7 percent. Note, however,

that the cell counts are small in the matrix for female entry into self-employment, particularly in

the higher quintiles. Hence, one must be cautious in making inferences about the impact of self-

employment on women who started near the top of the earnings distribution.

       The last two sets of matrices in the tables allow us to compare results for blacks and non-

blacks.15 For those who remained wage-earners, a comparison of the diagonal elements suggests

that blacks and non-blacks were roughly equally likely to remain in the quintile in which they

started a year before. (In the top quintile, the probability of leaving was somewhat higher for




                                                -9-
blacks than for non-blacks.) For those who became self-employed, except in the top quintile,

blacks were less likely to leave their original quintiles than their non-black counterparts. In the

top quintile, this tendency was reversed. However, as was the case for women, there are very

few observations in this part of the matrix for blacks. In any case, the overall comparison of the

matrices for blacks and non-blacks highlights the necessity of taking care in contrasting racial

differences in this context, because the magnitudes appear to depend on individuals’ starting

places in the earnings distribution.

       We now consider the results for five-year transition periods, which are presented in

Table 2. As already noted, for these purposes, an individual is deemed to have made a transition

to self-employment if he or she began as a wage earner, and was then self-employed for at least

two of the next five years. The most apparent difference between the five-year matrices and the

one-year matrices in Table 1 is how much more mobility there is in the former. Consider the

individuals who were wage earners during the entire period, shown on the left hand side of the

page. Of those who began the period in the lowest quintile, only 56 percent were there five years

later. In contrast, from Table 1, 75 percent of the individuals who started in the lowest quintile

were there one year later. Similarly, of those who started in the third quintile, only 46 percent

were there five years later, whereas from Table 1, 64 percent who began in the third quintile were

there one year later.

       Turning now to the right side of Table 2 we see that, as before, experience with self-

employment generally increased mobility in both directions. For individuals who began in the

middle quintile and became self-employed, only 21 percent were there five years later; this

proportion was more than twice as high for the wage-earners. At the extremes of the earnings

distribution, entry into self-employment had a negative impact on mobility. For individuals who




                                                -10-
began in the top quintile and became self-employed, 55 percent were there five years later. For

those who were wage earners throughout the period, a higher proportion—about 75 percent—

maintained their places at the top of the earnings distribution. And in the lowest quintile,

individuals who became self-employed were more likely to stay there than their wage-earnings

counterparts—60 percent versus 56 percent.

       The next two pairs of matrices in Table 2 indicate that there were marked differences in

the mobility impacts of self-employment on males and females. Generally, it appears to have

been a more successful strategy for males. In the lowest quintile, only 33 percent of the men who

had some experience with self-employment were there five years later; for women, this figure

was 64 percent. For males in the middle quintile who tried self-employment, about 35 percent

were in the two top quintiles five years later. For females, this figure was only 21 percent. We

conjecture that at least some of this difference may be due to the fact that the businesses started

by males could have lasted longer than those by females, and length of survival is related to the

success of the venture.16 Mobility matrices are too crude a tool for sorting out the effects of

differentials in the amount of time devoted to self-employment; this issue is addressed in the next

section.

       The last two sets of matrices in Table 2 allow us to compare five-year mobility for blacks

and non-blacks. Generally, over five-year periods, self-employment appears to have been less

successful as a mobility strategy for blacks than for non-blacks. In the third quintile, for

example, about 8 percent of the blacks who became entrepreneurs were in higher quintiles two

years later, while the corresponding figure for non-blacks was 31 percent. In the bottom quintile,

a greater proportion of blacks who entered self-employment were still there five years later—68

percent versus 59 percent. As was the case for the male-female comparisons, some of these




                                                -11-
differences might have been due to differences in the duration of self-employment that are

concealed in the mobility matrices.17 And as was the case for the females, many of the cell

counts in the right hand side matrix for the blacks are very low.

       In summary, the matrices in Tables 1 and 2 indicate that mobility patterns differed by

length of transition period and by demographic group, results that are consistent with earlier

research. There are also strong indications that experience with self-employment had important

effects on mobility patterns, both over short and long periods. Importantly, however, the

matrices warn us that it is difficult to characterize these patterns in a simple fashion—they

depend on demographic characteristics and starting position in the earnings distribution, inter

alia. Further, there may be factors that interacted with self-employment experience such as

experience and age that are difficult to capture in a mobility matrix framework. We now turn to

an alternative framework that allows us to take some of these factors into account.



3.     A MULTIVARIATE APPROACH

       Mobility matrices do not require that one put much structure on the data, and they contain

an enormous amount of information. But, as already suggested, these benefits come at a cost.

For one thing, matrices are not a convenient framework for exploring the reasons for differences

in mobility patterns within and between demographic groups. For example, we found that the

impact of self-employment on mobility depended on one’s starting point in the earnings

distribution. To what extent is this due to the fact that education levels differ by quintiles? Or

how might differences in the age structures between the black and non-black populations explain

the differential impact of self-employment by race? Another problem with the mobility matrix

approach is that it ignores information on within-quintile movements in the distribution. Of




                                                -12-
course, looking at deciles rather than quintiles would attenuate this problem, but not make it go

away, and would come at the cost of quadrupling the quantity of numbers to be examined. In this

section we develop and implement a complementary strategy based on multivariate regressions.



         3.1    Specification of the Model

         Our approach is to use ordinary least squares regressions to summarize the relationship

between an individual’s percentile in the income distribution in some year and his percentile in

an earlier year, and to allow this relationship to depend on his self-employment experience.18 To

begin, let us consider the one-year mobility data, which were summarized in Table 1. The

clearest message from that table is that there is a strong relationship between a person’s

percentile in the earnings distribution in year t+1, Pt+1, and his percentile in period t, Pt. To fix

ideas, we begin by positing a simple linear relationship between Pt+1 and Pt:

                                                                                                        (3.1)

where "0 and "1 are parameters. An important benchmark is the case of "0=0 and "1=1. If so,

Pt+1= Pt, and there is no mobility. However, if "0>0 and 0<"1<1, this specification implies that

the long-run location in the earnings distribution (P*) differs from the current location:


                                                                                                        (3.2)


Further, in the short-run there is “regression toward the mean”: if Pt > P* then Pt+1 < Pt and vice

versa.

         While linear models have expositional virtues, there is no reason to impose linearity on

the relationship between past and present positions in the earnings distribution. We assume a

quadratic specification:




                                                 -13-
                                                                                                          (3.3)

The quadratic term permits the degree of regression to the mean to differ between high and low

percentiles; i.e., the poor may rise faster than the rich fall and vice versa.19

        Equation (3.2) reveals a major flaw in a model that makes one’s present place in the

earnings distribution depend only on the past value: it leads to the counterfactual prediction that

everyone ends up in the same place in the earnings distribution. In practice, individuals’

positions in the earnings distribution differ due to attributes such as education (EDUC) and labor

market experience (EXP).20

        Indeed, these variables may affect not only the intercept of equation (3.3), but also the

entire dynamics of the process.21 That is, it may be appropriate to interact education and

experience with Pt and      as well as to enter them in levels. The general labor market situation

confronting individuals may also affect their mobility—mobility patterns may be different in

tight and loose labor markets. We therefore enter into the equation the national civilian

unemployment rate (URt), both by itself and interacted with Pt and         .

        Defining                            this leads to the following specification:


                                                                                                      (3.4)


        Our next task is to build into the model the individual’s record with entrepreneurship

during the transition period. Define SEt to be one if the individual was self-employed in period t,

and zero otherwise, and SEt+1 analogously. Then by augmenting equation (3.4) with SEt and

SEt+1 we can fully characterize the individual’s experience with entrepreneurship during the two-

year period, and estimate directly how it affects his or her position in the earnings distribution,




                                                  -14-
ceteris paribus. Further, we can interact the SE variables with             , and thus estimate

how self-employment affects the dynamics of the mobility process.

       A final issue relates to the fact that a movement into or out of self-employment is

necessarily a job change, and it is well documented that job changes in themselves tend to lower

individuals’ earnings. (See, for example, Farber [1995].) We do not want to confound the

effects of changing jobs per se with the effects of changing self-employment status. Hence, we

augment the equation with the variable CHANGEt+1, which takes a value of one if the individual

changed jobs between years t and t+1, and zero otherwise.22 Further, we interact CHANGEt+1

with all the right hand side variables except those containing the SE variables. Thus, the

equation now appears as




                                                                                                      (3.5)




where gt+1 is a random error term.23 Given the strong differences in the patterns among genders

and races evident from Table 1, we estimate the equation separately for males and females and

for blacks and non-blacks, as well as for the sample as a whole.24

       An econometric issue arises because our left hand side variable is bounded between zero

and one. This can lead to heteroskedastic errors. We therefore estimate robust standard errors

using Huber’s method. A related issue is that it is possible for a linear model to generate

predictions that are greater than one or less than zero. However, in our application, this is of no




                                                -15-
practical importance. For example, in our analysis of one-year transitions for the entire sample,

only three predictions out of 48,818 were outside the zero-one interval.

       We estimate equation (3.5) using data on all the one-year transitions in our sample.

Summary statistics on the basic right hand side variables in equation (3.5) (but not the interaction

terms) are included in Table 3.25

       Due to the presence of so many interactions, the equation is very messy and it is virtually

impossible to make sense of individual estimated coefficients. Luckily, the coefficients

themselves are of little interest to us. What we care about is using them to estimate how

experience with entrepreneurship affected individuals’ movements through the earnings

distribution. To be more specific, consider an individual at the 25th percentile of the earnings

distribution who had a known set of characteristics (education, experience). Suppose further that

the individual was a wage-earner in both periods, i.e., SEt and SEt+1 were both zero. Then we can

substitute into equation (3.5) to predict what his or her percentile would have been the next year.

Now we can repeat the exercise, but instead assume that the individual made a transition from

wage-earning to self-employment, i.e., SEt = 0 and SEt+1 = 1. By comparing this figure to that for

the individual who stayed a wage-earner, we obtain an estimate of how becoming self-employed

affected an individual’s one-year mobility. In the same way, we can learn how exiting from

entrepreneurship affected one’s position in the earnings distribution (SEt = 1 and SEt+1 = 0), and

how being an entrepreneur both periods affected one’s position (SEt = 1 and SEt+1 = 1).26 Our

main interest is in these computations—in effect, the analogues of the partial derivatives of

equation (3.5) with respect to self-employment experience—not the coefficients themselves.

       The strategy for analyzing five-year mobility requires only minor modifications. In this

case, the left hand side variable in equation (3.5) becomes Pt+5 rather than Pt+1. The main serious




                                                -16-
new issue is the treatment of self-employment experience during the transition period. In direct

analogy to equation (3.5), one could create six dichotomous variables, each indicating whether

the individual was self-employed or not during the initial year and each year of the transition

period. As before, this would allow us to characterize completely the individual’s self-

employment history during the transition period, including the possibility of several entries and

exits. However, this history would involve 26=64 possible cases. While we could report such

results in a tabular fashion, it would defeat our purpose, which is to create comprehensible

summaries of the data. Instead, we characterize self-employment experience during the

transition by including the variable %SE, defined as the proportion of the six-year period during

which the individual was self-employed. We include %SE and its square, as well as their

interactions with the other right hand side variables, in analogy to equation (3.5). Note that %SE

can take on only seven values: 0, 1/6, 1/3, 1/2, 2/3, 5/6, and 1.27 Table 4 shows the frequency

distribution of %SE for the various groups in our sample.

       An analogous issue crops up in the context of job change, and we deal with it in a similar

way. Specifically, we define the variable %CHNG, the proportion of times that the individual

changed jobs during the transition period. Over the period, there were at most five opportunities

to change jobs, so the only possible values for %CHNG are 0, 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, 4/5, and 1.

Intuitively, one can think of this variable as a measure of the disruption in the individual’s work

history and the associated effects on his or her place in the earnings distribution. In analogy to

%SE, we enter %CHNG and its square, and interact it with the initial percentile in the earnings

distribution, education, experience (and its square), and the unemployment rate.

       A final issue relating to our model is that it is essentially a “one-size-fits-all” approach.

The model is the same across gender and racial groups (although, of course, the parameters




                                                -17-
differ). The advantage of this approach is that it permits us to make comparisons across gender

and racial groups in a common framework. On the other hand, there is some evidence that the

processes relating to entry into self-employment may differ across groups. For example, Devine

[1994] and Bruce [1999] find that married, self-employed women are much more likely to have a

self-employed husband than married, wage-and-salary women. Thus, a woman’s mobility may

depend upon her husband’s. The problem then becomes the possible endogeneity of the

husband’s self-employment status and how to deal with it. Especially in light of such

complications, we feel the virtue of a common framework outweighs the advantages of tailoring

the model to the particular circumstances of each group.

       3.2 Results

       As already noted, the regression coefficients themselves are of limited interest, and they

are reported in the Appendix. Our main focus in this section is on the implications of the

coefficients for the mobility process. Before turning to the self-employment results, we note

briefly some findings from the Appendix. First, Pt and        are jointly statistically significant.

Evaluated at the means, the effect of Pt is positive, and that for    is negative. As noted earlier,

this means that those in lower percentiles rise faster than those at the upper end of the

distribution fall. Second, the partial derivative of Pt with respect to years of education is positive

and statistically significant. While it is not shocking that education improves ones place in the

earnings distribution, it is important to remember that this is an effect conditional on the

individual’s previous position in the distribution. The coefficients on potential experience and its

square are also jointly significant.

       One-year mobility.      We turn now to our main concern, the effect of self-employment on

income mobility. In Table 5 we show for the entire sample, and by gender and race, the effects




                                                 -18-
of experience with entrepreneurship on one-year mobility. The effects are given separately for

individuals in the 10th, 25th, 50th, and 75th, and 90th percentiles.28 The table has four columns.

The first column gives percentile predictions for individuals who were wage-earners both years

of the transition period. In terms of our notation, SEt and SEt+1 are both zero. Column (2) is for

individuals who were initially self-employed and then exited self-employment; SEt = 1 and

Set+1 = 0. The third column provides predictions for individuals who entered self-employment;

SEt = 0 and SEt+1 = 1. Finally, column (4) shows predicted percentiles for those who were self-

employed both years; Set = 1 and SEt+1 = 1.

       To fix ideas, consider the first cell in the second row of the table. It gives us the predicted

percentile in year t + 1 of an individual who began in the 25th percentile, had the mean

characteristics of the group, and was a wage-earner both years. According to the table, he or she

would have been in the 28th percentile one year later. Moving rightward in the table, we learn

that an individual with the same characteristics but who was self-employed the first year and then

exited self-employment, would have been in the 32nd percentile the second year. From

column 3, if the individual entered self-employment, he or she would have been in the 28th

percentile the second year, and from column 4, a person who was self-employed both years

would have been in the 32nd percentile.

       One finding certainly stands out from Table 5. For all demographic groups, and

regardless of experience with self-employment, there is “regression toward the mean.” On

average, individuals in the 10th percentile were in a higher percentile one year later, and

individuals in the 90th percentile were in a lower percentile one year later. Now, if all individuals

in the 10th percentile moved up in the earnings distribution (on average), it is not very

informative to say that individuals toward the bottom who entered self-employment also




                                                 -19-
advanced. We want to know whether a transition to self-employment moved an individual up

relative to someone who was a wage-earner the entire period. The same consideration applies to

the decreases in position of those toward the top. To find the relative effect of entering self-

employment, we simply subtract the number in the first column from the number in the third

column. For example, according to the first row of Table 5, entering self-employment did

nothing to aid the relative position of an individual who started out in the 10th percentile

(0.150 - 0.150 = 0). The same is true at the 25th percentile. More generally, to find the relative

effect of each pattern of self-employment, we take the associated figure and subtract from it the

figure in column (1).

       For easy reference, the results of a series of such calculations for the sample as a whole

are graphed in Figure 1, and in Figures 2 through 5 for the various sub-groups. Because the

patterns for the 10th and 90th percentiles are essentially the same as those for the 25th and 75th

percentiles, respectively, we omit the former two categories in the interest of readability. The

calculations suggest that during the year an individual entered self-employment, there was

virtually no change in his or her position in the earnings distribution. This absence of any

substantial movement was present in each of the subgroups, except for blacks. For blacks

starting in the 25th percentile, entry into self-employment was associated with a 2.3 point decline

(relative to those who remained wage earners), while those who started at the 75th percentile

experienced a relative 7.9 point gain.29

       We turn next to the impact of exiting from self-employment. For the sample as a whole,

for individuals who started in the 25th and 50th percentiles, departure from self-employment was

associated with relative movements upward in the earnings distribution (4.2 and 1.9 points,

respectively). On the other hand, for those who began at the top of the distribution, exit from




                                                 -20-
self-employment was associated with a 2.8 point relative decline.30 This 2.8 point figure masks

considerable differences across subgroups—the comparable number for women was 8.1 points,

and for blacks 13.8 points.31

       We next consider the impact on one-year mobility of being self-employed both years of

the transition period. For the sample as a whole, the gains to being self-employed varied

inversely with the individual’s starting position. In the 25th percentile, an individual who was

self-employed both years gained 4.2 points in the earnings distribution relative to a similar

individual who was a wage earner in both periods. On the other hand, for two individuals

starting in the 75th percentile, the one who was self-employed both periods ended up 2.6 points

below a comparable wage earner. The same pattern repeats itself in each of our demographic

groups—the lower the initial percentile, the greater the gain (or the lower the loss) from having

been self-employed. Interestingly, for blacks and women, self-employment did not lead to a

relative improvement in any percentile.

       Five-year mobility.      As already stressed, two year bits of time are not really long enough

to assess the consequences of self-employment. Table 6 turns to the analysis of mobility over

five-year periods. The setup is basically the same as that in Table 5. Each figure is the predicted

percentile in year (t+5), conditional on the percentile in year t as well as the other variables on the

right hand side of equation (2.5). (The estimated coefficients are in the Appendix.)32 Recall that

in these equations, we characterize the individual’s self-employment experience with the variable

%SE, the percentage of the six year period during which the individual was self-employed.33

Table 6 shows the predicted percentile for each value of %SE.

       Echoing the results from the mobility tables, there is a lot more movement reflected in the

five-year transitions of Table 6 than the one-year transitions of Table 5. For example, for the




                                                 -21-
sample as a whole, a wage earner who started out in the 10th percentile was, on average, in the

26th percentile five years later. The comparable percentile in Table 5 was only 15. Let us now

consider the effects of self-employment on mobility, relative to having remained a wage-earner.

As before, these are summarized graphically for the entire sample and for each demographic

group. For the entire sample (Figure 6), individuals who started in the 25th percentile and were

engaged in self-employment over the entire five-year period (%SE = 1) experienced substantial

gains in mobility—about 6.1 points relative to those who were wage-earners during the entire

period. For those who started in the 50th percentile and had %SE =1, there were also relative

gains, but they were quite small—1.9 points. However, individuals in the 75th percentile who

experienced six years of self-employment ended up 4.0 points below their wage-earning

counterparts.34 As before, the patterns in the 10th percentile are quite similar to those in the 25th

percentile, and those in the 90th are close to those in the 75th percentile. Again, in the interest of

readability we omit the 10th and 90th percentiles from the figures.

        A glance at figures (7) through (10) reveals that the qualitative story is quite similar for

each of the subgroups. The largest relative losses associated with being self-employed throughout

the period were incurred by individuals who started in the 75th percentile. For blacks and

women, the relative advantage to being self-employed during the entire period was slightly larger

for those who started in the 50th than the 25th percentiles. For men and non-blacks, on the other

hand, those who started at the 25th percentile benefitted substantially more than those who

started in the 50th percentile. From a quantitative standpoint, the most dramatic aspects of the

figures are the large gains for blacks who started out in the 50th percentile (7.2 points), and the

large losses for women who started out in the 75th percentile (6.4 points).




                                                 -22-
       Return now to Figure 6, and consider the impact upon five-year mobility of participation

in self-employment for less than the entire period. For the sample as a whole, there was not a

great deal of impact one way or the other. There were both small pluses and small minuses,

depending on the extent of experience with self-employment and starting point in the earnings

distribution. There were, however, some differences across the various groups. Figure 9, for

example, suggests that partial involvement almost never hurt the relative position of blacks,

while Figure 10 indicates that this was not the case for non-blacks.

       Summary.        In the sample as a whole, for individuals who began toward the bottom of

the earnings distribution, continuous experience with self-employment was a successful strategy

for moving ahead (relative to wage-earners), both in the short- and long-term. The result is just

the opposite for those who started out toward the top—continuous experience with self-

employment led to a fall in their relative positions. With respect to individuals who took a stab

at self-employment and then went back to the salaried sector, we find that in the short run their

relative positions in the earnings distribution fell. But over a longer period, these negative effects

more or less evaporated—the effects of partial experience with self-employment upon five-year

mobility were small.

       For women, the main message that seems to come through is that entrepreneurship has

not been a very successful strategy for moving ahead in the earnings distribution. In both the

short- and long-term, experience with self-employment sometimes led to small gains, but often to

substantial losses. The losses were particularly large for those who started out toward the high

end of the earnings distribution. With respect to blacks, the most striking phenomenon is the

difference between the short-term and long-term effects of experience with self-employment. In

the short-term, the effects were often negative, and dramatically so for those who began in the




                                                -23-
middle of the earnings distribution and exited from self-employment. However, when we look at

longer term effects of experience with self-employment, the impact was generally positive and

sometimes substantially so. Importantly, continuous experience with self-employment led to

very large improvements for blacks who started toward the bottom of the earning distribution.35



4.     CONCLUSION

       Do entrepreneurs get ahead in life, as suggested by the Horatio Alger myth? We have

analyzed panel data from the last several decades to determine whether entrepreneurs moved

ahead in the earnings distribution relative to their wage-earning peers. An examination of

mobility tables suggests that making a transition to entrepreneurship increased the likelihood that

an individual left his or her current quintile in the earnings distribution. In general, new

entrepreneurs were more likely to end up in a higher quintile than their wage-earning

counterparts. But they were also more likely to end up in lower quintiles. This result echoes a

theme found in earlier research—entrepreneurship is a risky business.

       We supplemented the mobility tables with a regression-based strategy to allow us to take

into account variables such as experience and education when analyzing the effects of

entrepreneurship on mobility. For individuals who started at the low end of the earnings

distribution, the Horatio Alger myth is alive and well—provided that they were able to stick it

out as entrepreneurs for several years. But those who started out near the top of the earnings

distribution lost ground relative to their counterparts who remained wage-earners.

       A striking result is that, on average, entrepreneurship was a more successful long-term

strategy for blacks than for non-blacks, ceteris paribus. If potential black entrepreneurs observe

that this strategy has worked for others who have tried it, one might imagine that they would try




                                                -24-
it for themselves. Thus, this finding would seem to complicate even further the task of

explaining why there are so few black entrepreneurs (Meyer [1990]). The answer may perhaps

be found in the fact that experience with entrepreneurship had a substantial negative impact on

blacks in the short-term. It may be the case that blacks lack the financial resources to sustain

their enterprises through initial hard times. This is just a conjecture. Further research is needed

on how the financing patterns of small businesses differ among racial and ethnic groups.

1.   Sarachek [1978] examines the life histories of a number of successful entrepreneurs to
     determine whether they have backgrounds similar to those of Horatio Alger’s heroes.
     Aficionados of nineteenth century American culture will know that despite their close
     identification with entrepreneurship in the population imagination, Horatio Alger’s heroes
     get ahead in a variety of ways, including marrying the boss’s daughter.

     the normative aspects of income mobility.

3.   See, for example, Aaberge et al. [1996], Palme [1995], Burkhauser, Holtz-Eakin and
     Rhody [1998], and Buchinsky and Hunt [1996]. Gottschalk and Smeeding [1997] survey
     the empirical literature on inequality. Atkinson, Bourguignon, and Morrisson [1992] and
     McMurrer and Sawhill [1996] provide useful surveys.

4.   Quadrini [1996] provides a theoretical model of the evolution of entrepreneurs’ wealth
     over time, how it compares with that of wage earners, and the implications for the wealth
     mobility of entrepreneurs.

5.   See Hill [1992] for a complete discussion of these data.

6.   See, for example, Hamilton [1995], Quadrini [1996], Evans and Jovanovic [1989], Evans
     and Leighton [1989], and Meyer [1990]. Self-employed workers as defined here meet the
     Census’ criteria for business ownership.

7.   Using tax-based data, Holtz-Eakin, Joulfaian, and Rosen [1994] found that only 41
     percent of sole proprietorships have any depreciable assets. Similarly, in examining data
     from the Survey of Income and Program Participation, Meyer [1990] found that 56
     percent of individuals report no new business equity upon entering self-employment.
     Meyer also noted that about 60 percent of new enterprises in the Characteristics of
     Business Owners survey report zero equity capital. Yuengert [1996] computed that, in
     the Survey of Consumer Finances, 43 percent of self-employed individuals have no
     business equity.

8.   See, for example, Fuchs [1982], Evans and Leighton [1989], and Fairlie and Meyer
     [1995].

9.   A final ambiguity in comparing wage/salary earnings with those from self-employment
     revolves around the payroll tax. Ideally one would like to compare both figures gross of
     the employer and employee share of the tax or both figures net of the total tax. Under one
     interpretation reported self-employment earnings are gross of all taxes and thus
     inappropriately high to compare to wage earnings that are (presumably) net of the
     employer share. At the other extreme, reported earnings may be net of all payroll taxes,
     making the comparison inappropriately small. Or, the reported value could be anywhere
     in between. In the absence of any firm way to determine the appropriate adjustment, we



                                            -26-
      restrict ourselves to using the reported data.

10.   Note that we are not taking averages over exactly the same groups of people. Some
      individuals join the sample over time (because they become 25 years old) and some leave
      it (because they become 56). There is, of course, attrition in the panel for other reasons as
      well.

11.   The transition rates are based on weighted data. To compute quintiles in the earnings
      distribution, we weight the data; quintiles are thus the population quintiles and transitions
      are population transition rates. In these computations, each sample data point represents
      a different number of individuals in the population. The second number in each cell is
      the unweighted number of sample data points used in each computation. An implication
      of this is that one cannot use the sample figures to replicate the transition rates shown in
      the matrices. Indeed, there is not even any reason for the number of sample points in
      each quintile to be constant within a matrix. The quintile breaks (in 1991) are $8,900,
      $17,182, $26,500, and $39,400.

12.   Thus, individuals who began the two-year period as entrepreneurs are excluded from both
      tables.

13.   The diagonal elements are closely related to the “immobility ratio,” which is the
      percentage of people staying in the same decile or entering the decile immediately above
      or below. There are a number of ways in which to collapse the information in a mobility
      matrix into a single number; see Atkinson, Bourguignon, and Morrisson [1992,
      pp. 74-79], and Buchinsky and Hunt [1996]. Given that our reason for examining
      mobility tables is to obtain a rough sense of what is in the data, we eschew here the use of
      such measures. Moreover, as noted earlier, the approach followed in Section 3 serves to
      condense the information regarding mobility; there is no need to do so here.

14.   Note that the comparison includes wage earners who both did and did not change jobs
      during the period. To the extent that job changes per se are associated with greater
      upward and downward mobility, then comparisons of the matrices may overstate the
      impact of changing to self-employment. As we stressed before, such problems are
      inherent to the mobility matrix methodology. We deal with them explicitly in our
      multivariate analysis below.

15.   The PSID contains information that would allow one to make finer distinctions with
      respect to race and ethnicity. However, within subgroups there are not enough self-
      employed individuals to allow meaningful comparisons. See Fairlie and Meyer [1993],
      and Borjas [1990, Chapter 10] on ethnic differences in self-employment.

16.   Over five-year periods, the mean percentage of women who are self-employed during the
      entire period is 2.1 percent as opposed to 9.6 percent for men.

17.   On average, only 0.6 percent of the blacks in the sample were self-employed during the
      entire period, while the figure for non-blacks was 6.4 percent.




                                               -27-
18.   There are obvious correspondences to the analysis of wage dynamics. See Atkinson,
      Bourguignon, and Morrison [1992, pp. 8-14].

19.   Formally, (3.3) is a nonlinear difference equation, which can be conveniently analyzed by
      linearizing in the vicinity of the steady state, P*. Doing so indicates that the time, t,
      required to close 50% of the gap between the initial location, P0, and P* is given by
      ln(0.5)/ln(1+g) where                   . Thus,        permits the speed of adjustment to
                  *
      vary with P .

20.   Because the PSID does not report actual experience on a regular basis, we analyze
      “potential experience” defined as age minus years of education minus six.

21.   For example, an empirical regularity is the earnings mobility falls with age. See
      Atkinson, Bourguignon, and Morrisson [1992, p. 138].

22.   A job change is recorded if the months of tenure on the job reported at the date of the
      interview is less than or equal to the months since the last interview. See Brown and
      Light [1992] for a careful discussion of issues involved in measuring job changes in the
      PSID. The incidence of job change in our sample is similar to that found in previous
      studies; e.g., Jaeger and Stevens [1997].

23.   In some cases, transitions associated with the same individual will occur multiple times.
      The error terms for a given individual across time may be correlated with each other.
      This may lead to inefficient estimates but they are still consistent.

24.   The data strongly rejects the hypothesis that mobility processes are the same across races
      and sexes. In each case, the joint hypothesis that all the coefficients are the same is
      rejected at least at the 1 percent level.

25.   The sample used to estimate the equation for five-year transition is, of course, different.
      However, the mean values of the various right-hand side variables do not differ
      appreciably.

26.   Note that the mobility tables presented in the right hand side of Table 1 correspond to the
      case SEt = 0 and SEt+1 = 1. The formulation in equation (3.5) allows us to explore a richer
      set of possibilities.

27.   In addition, given our particular interest in the effects of entry into self-employment, we
      include a dichotomous variable that is one if the individual was self-employed the first
      year of the period, and zero otherwise. We experimented with an alternative specification
      that allows for the transition to self-employment per se to have an independent effect. In
      this experiment, we created a dichotomous variable that took a value of 1 whenever
      %SE = 1/6, and of zero otherwise. When we entered this variable and its interactions
      with the other right-hand-side variables, we found that it was statistically significant but
      had only a minuscule effect on the mobility probabilities.

28.   The estimates at the 10th and 90th percentiles allow us to address the poverty-alleviation
      effects of entrepreneurship and its impact on the very well-to-do, respectively. We thank

29.   For purposes of reference, around the 25th percentile, a 5 percentile movement
      corresponds roughly to a $2,450 change in earnings (in 1990 dollars); around the 50th
      percentile, $2,320; and around the 75th percentile, $3,850.

30.   Our results are consistent with Hamilton’s [1995] finding that, at the median,
      entrepreneurs returning to paid wage employment earn a higher wage than employees
      with the same characteristics.

31.   But remember from Table 1 that there were very few blacks and women who were self-
      employed and in the 75th percentile. This should be taken into account in interpreting
      these results.

32.   For the sample as a whole, the R2 is 0.80 for the one-year transitions and 0.64 for the five
      year transitions. This is no surprise given the results from the mobility tables—initial
      position does a worse job of predicting one’s position over a short horizon than a long
      horizon.

33.   Recall that the equation contains a dichotomous variable for whether the individual was
      self-employed during the initial period. We view the simulations as telling us about the
      impact of entering self-employment for various proportions of the five-year period.
      Hence, in the simulations we set this dichotomous variable equal to zero. For example,
      we compute the effects of two years of self-employment by setting the dichotomous
      variable equal to zero and %SE equal to 2/6. When %SE equals 1.0, however,
      definitionally the dichotomous variable must be equal to 1.0. Similarly, we view the
      simulations as telling us the impact of becoming self-employed, above and beyond the
      impact of a job change alone. Thus, in the simulations, we set the variable showing the
      fraction of years in which there was a job change equal to zero.

34.   Taken at face value, this finding contradicts the common notion that self-employment is
      riskier than wage-earning, and hence, requires greater mean returns. We emphasize,
      however, two caveats. First, the riskiness of self-employment depends on the variability
      of consumption streams, not income streams. Higher income people may be able to
      insure their consumption despite income shocks; whether self-employment really is
      riskier than wage earning remains an open question. Second, to the extent that non-
      monetary aspects of self-employment are higher, utility may be higher in self-employment
      even if mean returns are lower.

35.   To the extent that blacks face particularly severe liquidity constraints, we expect only the
      most able blacks to enter and survive in self-employment. This may explain why the
      mobility effects are greater for blacks than the rest of the population.

    The first figure in cell (i,j) shows the population-weighted proportion of individuals originally in quintile i who
in quintile j one year later. The second figure in the cell is the number of observations used in the computation of
transitions. Transition matrices on the left-hand side of the page are for individuals who were wage-earners during
the first year of the two-year period. Matrices on the right-hand side of the page are for individuals who were
wage-earners during the first year and self-employed during the second year.

     The first figure in cell (i,j) shows the population-weighted proportion of individuals originally in quintile i who
in quintile j five years later. The second figure in the cell is the number of observations used in the computation of
transitions. Transition matrices on the left-hand side of the page are for individuals who were wage-earners during
the entire period. Matrices on the right-hand side of the page are for individuals who were wage-earners during the
first year and self-employed two or more of the next five years.

    Numbers in parentheses are standard deviations of the means. Means are taken over the number of
transitions, not the number of individuals. In any given year, the value of URt (the national unemployment rate),
is essentially invariant across demographic groups. Its mean is 6.68 (s.d. = 7.04).

   a
    Each figure shows the predicted percentile in the distribution using the estimated coefficients from equation
(2.5). The equation is estimated separately for each demographic group. Predictions are for the second-year of
two-year periods, for individuals in the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles. Column (1) assumes SEt = SEt+1 = 0; i.e.,
the individual was never self-employed. In column (2), the individual was self-employed the first year, and then
exited self-employment, i.e., SEt = 1, SEt+1 = 0. In column (3), the individual was a wage earner the first period,
and made a transition to self-employment, i.e., SEt = 0, SEt+1 = 1. In column (4) the individual was self-employed
both years, SEt = SEt+1 = 1. Number in parentheses are heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors of the
predictions.

    Each figure shows the predicted percentile in the earnings distribution conditional on percentile in the earnings distribution five years earlier, inter alia.
Estimates are based on a variant of equation (2.5) in which the left hand side variable is Pt+5, and the experience with self-employment is a quadratic in %SE,
the proportion of the five-year period in which the individual was self-employed. Figures in parentheses are heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors of
the predictions.

*Based on Table 6. Bars are difference between percentile of a group member and that of a wage-earner in all years; e.g., "3 Years" equals difference
between self-employed for 3 years and a wage-earner in all years.
                                        APPENDIX


       The results summarized in Tables 5 and 6 and the associated figures are based on

the estimated parameters of the regression model developed in Section 3.1. This

appendix contains the parameter estimates. Appendix Table 1 defines the right-hand-side

variables. Appendix Table 2 exhibits the one-year mobility results for both the entire

sample and the various sub-groups. Appendix Table 3 provides the same information for

the analysis of five-year mobility.

       As noted in the text, because of the many interactions among the right-hand-side

variables, the coefficients are very hard to interpret. Therefore, to help assess the

implications of the coefficients, we report in Appendix Table 4 the partial derivatives of

the dependent variables (Pt+1 or Pt+5, depending on whether we are examining one-year or

five-year mobility) with respect to potential experience, the unemployment rate,

education, and initial position (i.e., Pt). This table shows the impact of each variable for

the sample as a whole and for each demographic group.
