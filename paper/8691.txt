        Since the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement between states and the tobacco industry, states have
unprecedented resources for programs to reduce tobacco use. Decisions concerning the use of these funds
will, in part, be based on the experiences of states with existing programs. We review the experiences of
several states that have adopted comprehensive tobacco control programs. We also report estimates from
econometric analyses of the impact of tobacco control expenditures on aggregate tobacco use in all states
and in selected states with comprehensive programs for the period from 1981 through 1998. Our analyses
clearly show that increases in funding for state tobacco control programs reduce tobacco use.

Introduction

       In the wake of the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) between states and the

tobacco industry, the states are in a position to allocate settlement dollars for programs aimed at

reducing tobacco use. As state policymakers consider whether or not to fund tobacco control

programs, many will review the impact of existing state programs on tobacco use. We review

the experiences of several states with comprehensive tobacco control programs and perform an

analysis of the impact of tobacco control expenditures on aggregate tobacco use in all states

before the MSA, from 1981 through 1998.

       Historically, funding for tobacco control has come from a variety of sources, including

state cigarette excise taxes, appropriations by state legislatures, voluntary organizations (e.g.,

American Lung Association, American Cancer Society) and federal programs (USDHHS, 2000).

During the late 1980s and the 1990s, funding for tobacco control programs in several states

increased markedly. In 1988, California voters approved Proposition 99 which raised the

cigarette excise tax by 25 cents per pack and used the new revenue to support a statewide

tobacco control program that began in 1989 with an annual budget of roughly $100 million. In

November 1992, Massachusetts voters passed the Question 1 referendum to raise the tobacco tax

by 25 cents and created the Massachusetts Tobacco Control Program that began in October of

1993. Arizona voters passed Proposition 200 in 1995, which increased the state cigarette excise

tax by 40 cents and funded a tobacco control program. Oregon voters passed Measure 44 in

November 1996, which increased the cigarette excise tax by 30 cents and created a tobacco

control program that began in July 1997. In June 1997, Maine raised the cigarette excise tax

from 37 cents to 74 cents and created its tobacco control program that began in 1998. Recently,




                                                                                                      3
Alaska, Hawaii, New York and Washington have also substantially raised their cigarette excise

taxes.

         In addition to excise-tax-funded programs, three national programs have contributed

substantial resources to tobacco control, beginning with the Americans’ Stop Smoking

Intervention Study (ASSIST). In 1990, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the American

Cancer Society selected 17 states to participate in ASSIST, beginning with 2 years of funding for

planning followed by 5 years of funding for tobacco control activities. In 1993, CDC’s Office on

Smoking and Health (OSH) started the Initiatives to Mobilize for the Prevention and Control of

Tobacco Use (IMPACT) program, which funded tobacco control programs in 32 of the 33

remaining states, excluding California. 1 Lastly, in 1994 the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

(RWJF) began providing additional funding to 19 states through its SmokeLess States program.

This number increased to 32 states in 1997 and 40 in 2001.

         In addition to these sources of funding, individual state settlements with the tobacco

industry (Florida, Minnesota, Mississippi, and Texas) and the MSA, which sets aside $206

billion for 46 states over 25 years, provide policymakers with substantial funds that could be

allocated for programs aimed at reducing tobacco use. These allocation decisions will, in part,

be based on the evidence concerning the impact of existing state programs on tobacco use.

However, with the exception of one study, analyses of the impact of current programs on tobacco

use have focused on trend analyses that do not control for changes in excise taxes, cross-border

cigarette sales, and other state-specific factors. In the current study, we analyze time-series data

on cigarette demand to evaluate these programs as natural experiments, controlling for other

relevant state-specific factors. The results of this study should provide policymakers with more




                                                                                                       4
complete information on the effectiveness of tobacco control programs as states consider

appropriating MSA funds for tobacco control programs.

Overview of Tobacco Control Programs

        A handful of states have invested in large-scale comprehensive, tobacco control programs

(USDHHS, 2000; ACSL, 2001). These programs vary considerably from state to state, but they

generally include some or all of the following components: TV, radio, and/or print public

education campaigns; school-based tobacco prevention programs; smoking cessation materials

and telephone “quitlines”; community grants to promote smoking cessation and tobacco control

policy change; and enforcement of existing policies aimed at curbing exposure to smoke in

public places and access to tobacco by youth. The CDC has produced guidelines, summarized in

its “Best Practices for Comprehensive Tobacco Control Programs,” that outline specific funding

ranges and programmatic recommendations to states for creating comprehensive programs

(CDC, 1999). These guidelines resulted from evidence-based analyses of excise tax-funded

programs in California and Massachusetts and on the CDC’s involvement in the establishment of

comprehensive tobacco control programs in Oregon and Maine.

        Overall, in fiscal year 1998, tobacco control funding for all states ranged from $0.03 to

$6.35 per capita, with the larger programs ranging from $1.59 to $6.35. Because the overall

average per capita funding is only $1.03, most states are far from CDC guidelines for

comprehensive programs of $5.98 to $15.85 annual per capita funding (CDC, 2001). To assess

the impact that these investments have had on tobacco use, we briefly review several state-based

studies and one national study.



1
 The two federal programs have since merged into the National Tobacco Control Program, based at CDC’s Office
on Smoking and Health.


                                                                                                               5
         With the exception of one national evaluation, most existing evaluations of state

programs have focused on changes in tobacco use within a state after the implementation of a

tobacco control program. In addition, most of these studies perform trend analyses that do not

control for price or tax effects or other potentially confounding factors.

         For example, Manley and colleagues (Manley et al., 1997) compared the trends in per

capita monthly sales in states participating in the ASSIST program to other states. Their analysis

showed that trends in both ASSIST and non-ASSIST states were closely matched in per capita

sales until 1993 (when the ASSIST interventions began), at which time sales began to decline

faster in the ASSIST states. The data in Figure 1 are similar to those of Manley et al. (1997).

Per capita sales declined 28 percent more in non-ASSIST states during this time period.

However, whether these results would change if taxes and other factors were considered is not

clear.

         Several studies summarize the experiences of Arizona, California (Pierce et al., 1998; Hu

et al., 1995a, 1995b), Florida (Florida Health Department, 2000), Massachusetts (CDC, 1996;

and Connolly and Robbins, 1998), and Oregon (CDC, 1999), which have implemented large-

scaled programs and experienced declines in tobacco use. With the exception of Hu et al.

(1995a, 1995b), these studies focus on differences in univariate trend analyses that compare

tobacco use before and after program initiation, as well as changes in tobacco use relative to all

other states without similar programs (Figure 2). Whereas per capita sales dropped 15.4 percent

for the total U.S. from 1990 to 1999, the other 4 states dropped 36.9 percent on average. Thus,

the evidence is compelling that these programs have reduced tobacco use. Once again, however,

these reductions may be confounded by other factors.




                                                                                                     6
       For example, with the exception of Florida, all state programs were funded by increases

in cigarette excise taxes. As a result, some of the changes in consumption in Figure 2 are a result

of tax changes. Critics of tobacco control programs question whether some or all of these

successes resulted from the increases in cigarette prices caused by increases in excise taxes. In

addition, some researchers have claimed that tobacco industry promotions were heavily

concentrated in states with large-scaled tobacco control programs (Pierce et al., 1998; Balbach

and Glantz, 1998).

       The results from the trend analysis by Pierce et al. (1998) for California were bolstered

by multivariable analyses by Hu et al. (1995a). Hu and colleagues created an aggregate demand

model using quarterly data on per capita cigarette sales from 1980 to 1993. They then looked for

associations between current per capita sales and lagged sales, excise taxes, cigarette prices (less

taxes), time, quarterly dummy variables, a dummy variable for the 1983 federal excise tax

increase, cigarette advertising, and expenditures on California’s anti-smoking campaign. The

authors argue that advertising (and in this case, counter-advertising) has a cumulative effect on

sales and hence should be treated as a stock variable, rather than a flow variable. As a result,

they create a variable that sums all past campaign expenditures and depreciate them by 5 percent,

as suggested by McGuinness and Cowling (1975) as the optimal decay rate. This approach

alleviates the problem of collinearity across multiple lags; however, the decay function forced on

the data may not be borne out in the data.

       Hu et al. (1995a) did find that that per capita cigarette sales decreased as anti-tobacco

mass media expenditures increased and that a proxy variable for increased cigarette advertising

in California was associated with increases in per capita consumption. Using the same data, Hu




                                                                                                       7
et al. (1995b) estimated the elasticity of the effect of tobacco control expenditures on per capita

consumption to be –0.05.

Demand Model Specifications

          Our paper builds on the work of Hu et al. (1995a), on an extensive aggregate cigarette

demand literature (e.g. Chaloupka and Saffer, 1992; Evans, Ringel, and Stech, 1999; Baltagi and

Levin, 1985; Sung, Hu and Keeler, 1994; and Becker, Grossman and Murphy, 1994), and on a

unique historical database of tobacco control program expenditures from all states. We use

variation over time and across states in tobacco control program spending to isolate the impact of

tobacco control programs on cigarette consumption. Utilizing this natural experiment framework,

we estimate linear regressions of per capita cigarette sales on per capita expenditures for tobacco

control programs, controlling for cigarette excise taxes, cross-border cigarette sales that result

from interstate tax-differentials, time-varying state factors (such as education and income), and

state- and year-specific indicator variables.

Controlling for Cross-Border Sales

          The dependent variable in our models, cigarette sales, is based on tax-paid sales. Tax-

paid sales in any given state can over- or under-estimate actual consumption as a result of cross-

border sales and untaxed sales on Native American reservations or military bases. Cross-border

sales can result in relatively low-tax (high-tax) states having tax-paid sales that are higher

(lower) than actual consumption in that state. Our controls for cross-border sales are based on the

assumption that this type of activity depends on the size of the tax differential between states, the

size of border populations, and the distance of these populations to the relatively low-tax state

border.




                                                                                                      8
        Chaloupka and Saffer (1992) capture casual or short-distance “smuggling” by creating a

measure for the “importing” of cigarettes from nearby low-tax states and an “exporting” measure

to capture smuggling from low-tax states to high-tax states. The incentives for short-distance

smuggling rise as the difference between the own-tax and the border-tax increases. The authors

also assume that the magnitude of short-distance smuggling depends on the size of the

population near the border between the states. They define the short-distance import variable for

state i as:


                                    Importsi =∑jKij(Pricei-Pricej)                                  (1)



where Kij is the fraction of the population in the higher-price importing state, i, who live in

counties within 20 miles of the lower-price, exporting state, j. For each state, the sum is taken

over all lower price border-states. The short-distance export variable is defined as:

                             Exportsi =∑jKji(Pricei-Pricej)(POPj/POPi)                              (2)



where Kji is the fraction of the population in the higher-price importing state, j, who live in

counties within 20 miles of the lower-price exporting state, i. Including the population of the

importing state(s) relative to the exporting state captures the effect that the size of border

populations can have on sales in the exporting states.

        Our adjustment for smuggling diverges from Chaloupka and Saffer (1992) in three ways.

First, we use Geographic Information Systems software for calculating all measures of

smuggling. This software provides a straightforward method of calculating distances to all state

borders and population weights that is useful for calculating measures of the potential for

smuggling. For example, we can calculate the distance from the centroid of every census block



                                                                                                     9
group in a state to the border and use this distance, combined with census block populations, to

weight interstate tax differentials. Although most of the smuggling will happen closer to borders

(previous studies only examine populations within 20 to 30 miles from a state border), we

include all block groups and weight the tax differentials by the inverse of the distance to the

border so that populations far from the border will get small weights. Previous estimates relied

on calculating distances from counties that can have several population centers.

           Second, Chaloupka and Saffer (1992) include a measure to control for the potential of

long-distance smuggling from extremely low-tax, tobacco-producing states, such as Virginia,

North Carolina, and Kentucky. However, the construct used in Chaloupka and Saffer (1992) is

based on price differentials between a given state and these tobacco-producing states. We chose

not to include this measure because the primary source of variation in prices is the state tax and

taxes in these states did not change between 1981 and 1998 (with the exception of a small

change in the tax in North Carolina). As a result, changes in this measure are highly collinear

with changes in prices within a given state. In fact, regressing the long-distance smuggling

measure on prices and state and year indicator variables explains 98 percent of the variation in

the smuggling measure (Farrelly et al., 2000).

           Lastly, Chaloupka and Saffer (1992) use prices rather than taxes in their demand model

and their smuggling measures. The cigarette demand literature is equivocal on the choice of

prices versus taxes. We chose to use cigarette excise taxes for two reasons. First, it is the

relevant policy variable that legislators and policymakers can manipulate. Second, we recently

learned more about the methods used by the Tobacco Institute to collect cigarette price data at

the state level and have concerns about the accuracy of the price estimates.2



2
    Despite these caveats, our results were not very sensitive to specifications using prices.


                                                                                                     10
Tobacco-Control Expenditures

       The key explanatory variable in our models is the state per capita expenditure on tobacco

control (we describe the sources of these data in greater detail below). Characterizing tobacco

control programs using expenditure data is challenging given the nature of tobacco control

interventions. As described above, tobacco control programs consist of a variety of

interventions. Unfortunately, we do not have expenditure data broken out by type of intervention

(the majority of tobacco control programs do not track expenditures at this level of detail).

Therefore, overall expenditures are a proxy for state tobacco control activities. Furthermore, we

cannot distinguish from the aggregate expenditures the expenditures that are for program

planning and developing versus those that are for actual program implementation. As a result,

expenditures in any given year may not have an impact on tobacco use until subsequent years.

       Similarly, some interventions, such as media campaigns and education programs, may

initially change attitudes toward tobacco use, which lead to later reductions in tobacco use. For

example, in Florida where the tobacco control program was directed at youth, tobacco use did

not decline until two years after program implementation. However, attitudes toward tobacco

became increasingly negative during the course of the first year of the campaign (Sly, 1999;

Bauer et al., 2000; Florida Department of Health, 2000). This phenomenon is consistent with the

health behavior literature that states that behavior change is a gradual process consisting of pre-

contemplation, contemplation, action, maintenance, and relapse (Prochaska et al., 1983, 1985,

and 1988). As a result, we explore the lag structure of tobacco control expenditures to determine

when expenditures in any given year impact overall tobacco consumption.




                                                                                                      11
       Finally, as education and income variables, we use the high school dropout rate and per

capita disposable income, both measured at the state level. Combining all of these variables into

a demand model yields equation (3) below:

PCCIGSLS =a0 + a1 * RPCEXP + a2 * RTAX + a3 * IMPORT+ a4 * EXPORT + a5 *

            RPCDISINC + a6 * HSDROP + b * STATE + c * YEAR + ε                                       (3)


       where:

   PCCIGSLS          = per capita annual cigarette sales in a state,

   RPCEXP            = real per capita expenditures on tobacco control programs, in dollars,

   RTAX              = the real tax (state+federal) on a pack of cigarettes in the state, in dollars,

   RPCDSINC          = real (1998 dollars) per capita disposable income, in dollars,

   HSDROP            = the state average high school dropout rate,

   STATE/YEAR = vectors representing and state- and year-specific indicators.

       For all demand models, we include state indicator variables to ensure that the estimated

policy effects reflect an exogenous policy change rather than a combination of the effect of the

policy change and some unmeasured characteristic about the state, such as a pro- or anti-tobacco

sentiment or social norms within a state. Failing to control for these unobserved characteristics

may bias the estimate of the effects of the tobacco control expenditure and tax variables.

Specifying Tobacco Control Programs

       To identify the impact of state tobacco control expenditures on state aggregate tobacco

use, we take several approaches that reflect both the historical pattern of funding as well as the

nature of tobacco control programs. Using crude measures of smoking behavior (i.e., cigarette


                                                                                                     12
sales) and of tobacco control interventions (i.e., expenditures) complicates evaluations of the

impact of these interventions. The models we specify below are an attempt to understand both

the immediate and lingering impacts of tobacco control programs on smoking behavior.

       We first estimate models that focus on continuous of tobacco control programs based on

current year per capita expenditures. Second, to reflect the idea that countermarketing efforts,

education programs, and other tobacco control interventions have a gradual effect on behavior,

we estimate a demand model with lagged annual expenditures and one with current and lagged

annual expenditures. Finally, we construct a measure similar to that created by Hu et al. (1995a)

in their evaluation of California’s tobacco control program. These authors created a cumulative

measure of current and past expenditures, discounting previous periods by 5 percent. This

measure is consistent with the notion that tobacco control programs may take time to change

tobacco use, but it does force a structure on the lagged variables.

       Using all of these more continuous measures of tobacco control, we start with models

from 1981 to 1998 that incorporate all states and then re-estimate models incorporating only

Arizona, California, Massachusetts, and Oregon, which have been the focus of early evaluation

efforts. For all models, we include several years of data before the period when tobacco control

programs began in earnest to better establish pre-intervention trends in tobacco consumption. By

including a pre-intervention period, we can better isolate the impact of the program on tobacco

use.

       Finally, as a sensitivity test of the continuous measures of tobacco control programs, we

estimate models with dichotomous indicators of tobacco control programs. We accomplish this

by creating indicators that are equal to one when the tobacco control program begins or reaches




                                                                                                   13
critical mass and that equal zero otherwise. These dichotomous indicators reflect whether or not

tobacco use declines after program funding reaches critical funding levels.

       According to CDC guidelines, minimum adequate funding for a comprehensive tobacco

control program begins at $6 per capita. Therefore, we created an indicator variable that is equal

to 1 if the program reaches that level of funding and that is zero otherwise. However, because

only a few programs have reached that level of funding (CDC, 2001), we also created a less

ambitious goal (admittedly arbitrary) of $1 per capita. One dollar per capita is 10 times the

average level of funding for CDC’s IMPACT program during the 1990s and is equal to the

average funding for FY1998. As a result, we create an indicator variable that complements the

comprehensive program goal ($6 per capita) with an indicator for programs with expenditures

between $1 and $5.99. Finally, we create an indicator variable that is equal to 1 when state

funding is greater than or equal to $1 and is zero otherwise. Using these indicators, we estimate

models with the single indicator for funding greater than or equal to $1 per capita and another set

of models with two indicators—one for programs with expenditures between $1 and $5.99 per

capita and another for programs with $6 or more per capita.

Data Sources

       The key data for our analyses are state aggregate cigarette sales, state and federal

cigarette excise taxes, and state-level expenditures on tobacco control programs. Cigarette sales

and taxes were obtained from annual volumes of the Tax Burden on Tobacco (The Tobacco

Institute, 1998) and are reported corresponding to a July 1 through June 30 fiscal year that is

common in states. The sales data for each state were converted to per capita sales using state

annual population estimates from the U.S. Census (U.S. Census Bureau, 1998a, 1998b).




                                                                                                  14
       State excise taxes are reported in the Tax Burden on Tobacco (The Tobacco Institute,

1998) as of November 1 of each year; however, the effective date of each tax change is also

noted. To create an annual measure of the state tax, we weighted the taxes effective in a given

year by the number of months that they are in place. Similarly, state average prices are reported

as of November 1. To create prices that correspond to the fiscal year of the consumption data,

we weighted the prices accordingly.

       Another potentially important state-level factor is the extent of public restrictions on

smoking in public places. However, because changing the state and local ordinances restricting

public smoking are often a stated goal of tobacco control programs, one can consider them as

part of the set of tobacco control interventions. In addition, collecting comprehensive

information on all public restrictions for the entire study period is extremely time consuming.

Finally, when indicator variables of key restrictions—private and government workplace

restrictions—were included in the models, the coefficient on tobacco control expenditures was

virtually unchanged. Hence, we chose to not explicitly include the restrictions in our models,

allowing the indicators of tobacco control programs and program expenditures to reflect the full

array of tobacco control interventions.

   We gathered comprehensive data on state tobacco control expenditures from the following

sources through state fiscal year 1998 (i.e., June 30, 1998):


       •   CDC’s IMPACT program, which funded 32 states and the District of Columbia from

           fiscal year (FY) 1994 through FY1998;

       •   NCI’s ASSIST program, which began in FY1991 and included 17 states;




                                                                                                  15
       •   RWJF’s SmokeLess States program, which eventually funded up to 29 states, and

           began in FY1994; and

       •   states with cigarette excise tax-funded, tobacco control programs (e.g., Arizona,

           California, Massachusetts, and Oregon).

As noted in the introduction, the ASSIST and IMPACT programs complemented one another so

that between the two programs, all states (with the exception of California) received federal

support for tobacco control interventions by 1994. For states without dedicated funds for

tobacco control from excise tax revenue or other sources, these national programs were the

primary source of revenue. In Arizona, California, Massachusetts, and Oregon, tobacco control

programs are fueled primarily by cigarette excise taxes.

       Data for the three national programs were provided to us by CDC, NCI, and RWJF.

Although the budgeted amount of funding for these programs tended to change very little year by

year, actual expenditures showed a wider range of variation, allowing us to determine more

accurately the effects of funding on cigarette consumption. We also obtained information on

state excise tax-funded and settlement-funded programs from CDC and from state governments.

We have state funding information for Arizona, California, Florida, Maine, Massachusetts,

Minnesota, New York, and Oregon.

       Other states have also funded tobacco control activities, but their efforts have been

limited. The data describing the historical level of effort for programs that have not been funded

by the RWJF, CDC, NCI, or one of the large excise tax-funded programs listed above are

difficult to obtain. In 1990, 1992, and 1994, the Association for State and Territorial Health

Organizations (ASTHO) conducted comprehensive surveys of funding for state tobacco control

programs. ASTHO obtained its funding data from telephone surveys of state government


                                                                                                 16
employees. We compared the data from the ASTHO surveys with the data reported by the major

funding sources and selected states and determined that our current tobacco control expenditure

database provides comprehensive coverage for all states.3

         Several states have fiscal years that differ from that of the federal government. We

adjusted expenditure data so that all of our data correspond to the reporting period of the per

capita cigarette sales (July 1 through June 30) from the Tobacco Institute and the demographic

data from the U.S. Census Bureau.

         Our models include state- and year-specific indicators. This identification strategy

focuses on the correlation between differences in cigarette consumption, taxes and other factors

over time within states, effectively making each state its own quasi-experimental control. We

believe that this approach leads to stronger causal inference for individual covariates and more

accurate predictions of cigarette consumption. Because we rely on changes within states over

time, we omitted other factors that did not vary considerably over time, such as the age and racial

or ethnic composition of the states.

         Income data were obtained from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (U.S. Department of

Commerce, 1999), and state high-school dropout rates were derived from the annual March

Current Population Survey. Our goal was to estimate our demand models from 1980 through

1998; however, the data on high school dropout rates was only available at the state-level from

1981 through 1998. Hence, all models exclude 1980.




3
  During the 1990s when tobacco control programs became more prominent, we compared our data to the data from
the 1990, 1992, and 1994 ASTHO surveys. Differences in average expenditure levels were small, suggesting that
apart from the major national programs, little funding was available to states aside from those with dedicated excise
tax funds.


                                                                                                                    17
Results

          The results for the four models of tobacco control program expenditures that include all

states indicate that increases in tobacco control program expenditures reduce cigarette sales

(Table 2). The results also suggest that this relationship is strongest one year after the

expenditures are made. Annual expenditures are statistically significant at the ten percent level,

whereas the lagged annual expenditures are statistically significant at the five percent level.

Both specifications produce an elasticity of –0.0006.

          Overall, this elasticity may appear to be low, but over the course of several years,

programs may have substantial increases in per capita funding for tobacco control. Between 1988

and 1998, overall per capita expenditures for tobacco control increased by 5,650 percent

nationwide. Based on the estimated elasticity, sales over those ten years would be expected to

decline by three percent whereas cigarette sales actually declined by 17 percent. Considering

that states allocating a large portion of their MSA funding to tobacco control would experience

substantial increases in funding, these findings suggest that such increases would lead to

substantial declines in aggregate tobacco use.

          Although neither the coefficient on current or lagged expenditures in specification (model

3) is statistically significant, the pattern of the coefficients supports the idea that the driving force

behind the changes in consumption is lagged expenditures. Finally, we specify cumulative

expenditures, following Hu et al. (1995a) and find that the elasticity is nearly twice that for

annual expenditures. One way to interpret cumulative expenditures is that it captures the

cumulative effects of expenditures in both current and lagged periods in one construct.

Considered together, models one through three illustrate that the variation in expenditure levels

within states over time may not be sufficient to identify how the effects are distributed over time.


                                                                                                       18
As a result, the cumulative measure is an alternative method for capturing the current and past

effects of tobacco control interventions and avoids collinearity of multiple lag terms. Again,

however, discounting past expenditures by a fixed rate forces a lag structure on the data that may

not be borne out in the data.

         The tax elasticity is robust, equaling –0.22 across the four all-state models. Converting

this figure to a price elasticity by examining the effect of tax changes on price over this time

period yields a price elasticity of –0.59.4 The extensive literature on the effect of changes in

cigarette prices and taxes has been recently summarized by Evans, Ringel, and Stech (1999) and

by Chaloupka and Warner (2000). Evans, Ringel, and Stech (1999) used a variety of databases,

including a database of state-aggregate cigarette sales, and found that the cigarette price elasticity

of demand is –0.30. This result is similar to those in other recent studies (CDC, 1998; Evans and

Farrelly, 1998).

         Controls for cross-border sales are stable across all specifications and are consistent with

the hypothesized signs—states with taxes that are relatively high (low) compared to neighboring

states have lower (higher) tax-paid sales, because residents can purchase in neighboring states.

Both higher per capita incomes and high school dropout rates are associated with lower

aggregate sales. These results are similar to those from individual-level models where higher

incomes are associated with lower consumption, but where higher levels of education are

normally associated with lower, not higher, consumption (Farrelly et al, 2001). However, these

aggregate measures of socio-economic status may be proxies for other factors not captured in the

model.




                                                                                                     19
         To explore how the results from four key states with comprehensive tobacco control

programs may differ from states overall, we repeat our four specifications in for Arizona,

California, Massachusetts, and Oregon in Table 2. The pattern of results for these states is

qualitatively similar to the models with all states, where the strongest relationship is between

consumption and expenditures lagged one year. Expenditures are statistically significant at the

ten percent level in specification (5), statistically significant at the five percent level in

specifications (6) and (7), and at the one percent level in the specification (8). The results from

these key states are striking because the expenditure elasticities are roughly 10 to 50 times as

great as the models with all states. These results suggest that tobacco control programs are more

effective, dollar for dollar, when implemented on a larger scale.

         The elasticities for tobacco control expenditures in the models of current and lagged

annual expenditures are roughly the same, -0.006 and -0.007, respectively. However, the

elasticity for cumulative expenditures is considerably higher in model 8, at –0.025, suggesting

that expenditures in past years have an important impact on current consumption. The tax (price)

elasticity of the cumulative expenditures specification is –0.17 (-0.46) and is statistically

significant. However, in the other three specifications, the coefficient on tax is not statistically

significant. The same is true for many of the other state-level factors in this 4-state regression,

most likely because of insufficient variation within states over time. The results of similar

models using all states provide more precise estimates of all variables.

         We assessed the dichotomous indicators of tobacco control with equation (3), including

data from all states from 1981 through 1998 and with several indicators of tobacco control

4
 Because prices are a function of taxes, the impact of taxes on demand is represented by ∂y/∂t=(∂y/∂p)/ (∂p/∂t).
Therefore, ∂y/∂p=(∂y/∂t)/(∂p/∂t), where y = cigarette consumption, p = cigarette prices, and t = cigarette taxes.




                                                                                                                    20
capacity (Table 3). Model 9 uses only the indicator for programs with at least $1 per capita

funding. Model 10 includes two program expenditure indicators—one for programs with

expenditures between $1 and $6 per capita and another for programs spending at least $6 per

capita. In models 11 and 12, we lag the program indicators to test whether or not the effects of

the program are larger one year after implementation.

         The results across all four models provide consistent evidence that tobacco control

programs have decreased aggregate tobacco use, controlling for the effects of cigarette excise

taxes and other state-level factors. Models 9 and 11 indicate that programs securing at least $1 in

per capita funding have lower per capita sales and that this effect is larger one year after the

program reaches this level of funding. These results are consistent with the notion that tobacco

control interventions take time to change behavior. Furthermore, model 10 indicates that

comprehensive programs funded above $6 in per capita expenditures may result in greater

declines in tobacco use. However, this difference is not statistically significant. In addition,

once we lag both expenditure indicators (model 12), the coefficient on programs with funding

levels of $1 to $6, becomes larger than that of our lagged indicator for comprehensive programs.

         Therefore, although these indicators do not provide a clear pattern of greater declines

among comprehensive programs, they do provide additional evidence that tobacco control

programs decrease aggregate tobacco use. These indicators are also relatively crude measures of

the effect of program size and comprehensiveness on tobacco use, however.

         Finally, to explore how spending for tobacco control may impact states with varying

levels of tobacco consumption, we performed a series of quantile regressions. As opposed to


Regressing real prices on real taxes and state and year indicator variables to estimate (∂p/∂t) from 1981-1998 yields
a value of 1.25.


                                                                                                                    21
regression through the mean, as in ordinary least-squares regression, quantile regression involves

minimizing the differences from a quantile of interest (e.g., median). Making use of the entire

distribution, these regressions can indicate whether excise taxes and tobacco control expenditures

have a larger or smaller impact when tobacco consumption is relatively high (i.e., in the 75th

percentile).

        We began our quantile regressions using the same models used in Table 2. However, our

models that included state and year effects did not converge at all of the various quantiles of

interest. As a result, we reduced the number of indicators to be estimated by including indicators

for 9 census regions, rather than state indicator variables. We present the ordinary least square

results of this specification in the first column of Table 4 for comparison with the results in Table

2. These results indicate that the price and expenditure elasticities are higher when we do not

control for state indicator variables.

        The results from the quantile regressions (Table 4) indicate that increases in tobacco

control expenditures (whether specified as cumulative or lagged annual expenditures) have their

greatest impact when aggregate tobacco use is relatively high. From the lowest to the highest

quantile, the impact of expenditures grows monotonically for lagged annual expenditures (from –

0.0004 to –0.0037) and nearly monotonically for cumulative expenditures (from –0.0009 to –

0.0048). In contrast, the effect of taxes varies little across the distribution of cigarette

consumption.

Discussion

        With the exception of Hu et al. (1995a, 1995b), studies have examined the impact of state

tobacco control programs on cigarette consumption by relying on univariate trend analyses

(Pierce et al., 1998; Florida Department of Health, 2000; CDC, 1996; Connolly and Robbins,


                                                                                                    22
1998; CDC, 1999). In addition, in reviewing the evidence on the effectiveness of comprehensive

tobacco control programs, the recent Surgeon General’s Report on Reducing Tobacco Use

concluded that comprehensive tobacco control programs work. Although these studies have

consistently suggested that state tobacco control programs decrease tobacco use, these studies

could have easily been confounded by changes in excise taxes, cross-border sales, and other

factors. The various models presented in this paper, which control for these confounding factors,

reinforce the findings from the individual state trend analyses and provide strong evidence that

tobacco control programs are effective.
