                                         ABSTRACT

Home-delivered prescriptions have no delivery charge and lower copayments than prescriptions
picked up at a pharmacy. Nevertheless, when home delivery is offered on an opt-in basis, the
take-up rate is only 6%. We study a program that makes active choice of either home delivery or
pharmacy pick-up a requirement for insurance eligibility. The program introduces an implicit
default for those who don’t make an active choice: pharmacy pick-up without insurance
subsidies. Under this program, 42% of eligible employees actively choose home delivery, 39%
actively choose pharmacy pick-up, and 19%make no active choice and are assigned the implicit
default. Individuals who financially benefit most from home delivery are more likely to choose it.
Those who benefit least from insurance subsidies are more likely to make no active choice and
lose those subsidies. The implicit default incentivizes people to make an active choice, thereby
playing a key role in choice architecture.

Introduction

           Revealed preferences are tastes that rationalize an economic agent’s observed actions.

Economists usually assume that these revealed preferences are also normative preferences—

preferences that represent the economic actor’s true interests. In some situations, giving revealed

preferences normative status makes sense. There are many cases, however, in which “choices”

do not reveal a true preference, but reflect the combined influence of true preferences and

decision-making biases. For example, in some situations, economic agents do not actively make

choices. Instead, they passively accept defaults that are chosen by others. Preferences revealed

through passive choice are often inconsistent, since variation in defaults generates large variation

in outcomes (e.g., Madrian and Shea, 2001; Johnson and Goldstein, 2003; Beshears, Choi,

Laibson and Madrian, 2008b). To the extent that the wedge between normative and revealed

preferences is created by inertia around the default, active choice mechanisms that encourage

individuals to explicitly state their preferences may produce outcomes closer to the normative

benchmark.

           However, such active choice mechanisms generally don’t work in practice the way they

are hypothesized to work in theory. 1 In an active choice enrollment system, choice is either

encouraged or even “required,” but not choosing is usually also a de facto option, whether or not

it is officially acknowledged. 2 In an active choice regime, not choosing triggers an “implicit

default.” Our empirical analysis shows that such an implicit default is an important element of

choice architecture.

           We examine the implementation of an active choice regime designed to encourage home

delivery for long-term prescription medications in an employer-sponsored prescription drug


1
    See Sunstein (2015) for a full enumeration of the problems with active choice programs.
2
    Sometimes the option of not choosing is shrouded, as in the active choice regime studied by Carroll et al. (2009).

                                                            2
benefit plan. Under an opt-in regime for home delivery, take-up is very low: only 6% of

prescriptions eligible for home delivery are filled through home delivery. The employer’s

adoption of an active choice regime leads to a sizeable increase in home delivery enrollment.

Under the active choice regime, among those eligible for home delivery, 42% actively choose

home delivery, 39% actively choose retail pharmacy pick-up, and 19% make no active choice

and therefore use retail pharmacy pick-up without an insurance subsidy, which is the implicit

default. Because home delivery is cheaper than retail pharmacy pick-up for many drugs, the

active choice program substantially reduces average out-of-pocket expenditures for individuals

with costly long-term prescriptions.

       Although there is no variation in the implicit default in our setting, we do observe

variation in the cost to individual employees of accepting the implicit default. We find that the

likelihood of not choosing increases as the benefit of choosing decreases: Individuals with the

smallest insurance subsidies are more likely not to make an active choice and thereby

temporarily lose their subsidy. The implicit default generates an incentive to make an active

choice and becomes the default for those who don’t actively choose. For both of these reasons,

implicit defaults are a key design feature in active choice programs. By decreasing the

attractiveness of the implicit default, institutional designers can encourage active choices, albeit

at the cost of decreasing the welfare of those who still refuse to make an active choice.



The Active Choice Intervention

       The employer sponsoring the prescription drug plan we study, Company A, is a large

national U.S. retailer. Full-time, regular employees of the firm are eligible for healthcare and




                                                  3
prescription drug benefits 90 days after hire. 3 Approximately 85% of benefits-eligible employees

at Company A enroll at in the prescription drug plan managed by the pharmacy benefit manager

(PBM) that introduced the active choice intervention.

           Home delivery has several potential advantages over retail pharmacy pick-up for

individuals on long-term maintenance medications. First, home delivery prescriptions are

processed in large automated facilities located where land and labor are cheap, so filling a

prescription through home delivery is cheaper than filling it at a retail pharmacy (Federal Trade

Commission, 2005). These cost savings are shared among beneficiaries, the employer, and the

PBM. Home delivery copayments tend to be lower than retail pharmacy copayments (Appendix

Table A1). Second, home delivery saves beneficiaries the hassle of making trips to the

pharmacy. Third, while retail pharmacy fills for long-term maintenance medications are

generally for 28 or 30 days, home delivery fills are typically for 84 or 90 days, reducing the need

to remember to refill a prescription. Fourth, the automatic dispensing system used in home

delivery has a lower error rate than retail pharmacists counting pills. (However, the error rate is

extremely low no matter how a prescription is filled.)

           Home delivery is not the best option for all individuals. It would be inappropriate for a

short-term prescription needed for an acute condition, such as an antibiotic to treat strep throat.

Although the PBM does have pharmacists available for phone consultation, individuals may

prefer an in-person conversation with a pharmacist. (On the other hand, some individuals may

prefer the confidentiality of speaking to a pharmacist on the phone rather than at the front of a

line in a neighborhood pharmacy.) In urban areas, individuals may be reluctant to have

prescriptions delivered in the mail if packages are dropped off in a public area that may not be

    With a small number of exceptions, part-time and temporary employees are not eligible for benefits.

secure. The convenience advantage of home delivery may also be lower in urban areas where

retail pharmacies are densely located.

         Prior to the active choice intervention, the PBM made home delivery available to its

beneficiaries on an opt-in basis. Beneficiaries could sign up for home delivery by filling out a

paper form, calling a toll-free phone number, or enrolling online. The view of the PBM was that

low take-up of home delivery did not reflect a lack of true demand, but rather a lack of

consideration or follow-through. Thus, the PBM and Company A adopted an active choice

program in 2008.

         The active choice program targeted employees who (a) had a retail claim for a

prescription maintenance medication 4 within the past 30 days, (b) did not have an unexpired

home delivery prescription for that drug on file with the PBM, and (c) had not previously made

an active choice to use retail pharmacy pick-up instead of home delivery. 5 The company applied

these criteria in the middle of November 2008 and again at the end of November 2008 to identify

an initial set of employees to target. Starting on January 1, 2009, the criteria were applied on a

daily basis to target additional employees.

         The PBM contacted employees several times to explain how the active choice program

affected them. In September 2008, letters were mailed to all employees enrolled in the

prescription drug plan describing the general nature of the program. In November and December

2008, the initial set of targeted employees received both letters and automated telephone calls

with details on the drugs for which they would be required to make an active choice about their

  A maintenance medication is one taken on a regular basis to treat a chronic condition, such as insulin or high blood
pressure medication. The PBM was inclusive when defining maintenance medications. For example, ibuprofen was
on the list because it is sometimes used regularly for chronic pain.
5
  This third criterion was not relevant when the program was first rolled out. After the initial roll-out, this criterion
ensured that employees who had declined home delivery were not contacted again.

                                                           5
future refill channel. Targeted employees were asked to affirmatively indicate to the PBM

whether their preference was to continue filling targeted prescriptions at a retail pharmacy or to

switch to receiving those prescriptions by home delivery. The benefits of home delivery were

described to them, and employees were encouraged to choose home delivery. Those wanting to

switch to home delivery could communicate their decision as well as some additional required

information to the PBM by mailing a paper form, calling a toll-free telephone number, or visiting

a website. Employees were also told that if they did not indicate an active choice in advance,

they would have to make an active choice between the retail and home delivery channels after

their first two retail pharmacy fills in 2009.

       Switching to home delivery additionally required authorization from the prescribing

physician(s) for the PBM to fill the relevant prescription(s) by mail. Employees could obtain this

authorization independently, or the PBM offered to contact physicians on behalf of (and with the

consent of) employees. Individuals targeted for multiple prescriptions could elect home delivery

for some and retail pharmacy pick-up for others.

       Targeted employees who did not choose home delivery in advance were restricted to two

retail pharmacy claims for each targeted drug after January 1, 2009. After each of these claims,

the PBM contacted the employee with a letter and an automated phone call telling her of the

need to make an active choice between home delivery and pharmacy pick-up via mail, phone, or

website. If the employee attempted to make a third retail pharmacy claim for a targeted drug

without making an active choice, the insurance claim was rejected at the pharmacy. The

pharmacist was asked to explain that the PBM would not accept the claim unless the employee

called the PBM to make an active choice. If the employee called the PBM and opted for retail

pharmacy pick-up, the employee could proceed with the retail pharmacy fill as intended with the



                                                 6
PBM subsidy. If the employee called the PBM to opt for home delivery, the PBM initiated the

process of switching to home delivery, including contacting the employee’s physician to

authorize the change, and the employee was permitted to receive the PBM subsidy on the

intended retail pharmacy pick-up. 6 If an employee did not call the PBM to make an active

choice, the employee could either decline to pick up the prescription at that time or pay the full

retail cost of the medication out of pocket without any PBM subsidy.

        Other than the new incentive to make an active choice, the PBM did not change the pre-

existing home delivery and retail pharmacy pickup programs. The PBM had the same

mechanisms in place to help individuals with the logistics of switching to home delivery (e.g.,

contacting physicians) before and after the introduction of the active choice program.



Materials and methods

Data

        We use data from two sources. From Company A, we have employee-level demographic

and employment data, including gender, age, and original hire date, as well as monthly snapshots

of employees’ hourly pay, employment category (regular or temporary), scheduled hours (full-

time or part-time), and employment status (active or leave of absence). From the PBM, we have

claim-level data for each employee enrolled in the prescription drug plan. These data include the

National Drug Code (NDC) and Generic Product Identifier (GPI) of the drug, an indicator for

whether the drug is generic, the number of days’ supply dispensed, the supplier (a retail

pharmacy or a PBM mail distribution center), the employee copayment, the cost to the employer



6
 In about 90% of cases, home delivery was successfully set up before the employee needed another prescription fill,
but if there were delays in setting up home delivery (e.g., because of difficulty reaching the physician), the PBM
honored additional retail pharmacy claims from the employee.

                                                        7
(total cost of the prescription minus the employee copayment), and the claim date. We also have

from the PBM data on the implementation of the active choice program, including the date on

which an employee-drug class combination was added to the targeted list and information about

rejected claims, including drug identity and the date on which a claim was rejected.



Empirical Approach

        To measure the impact of the active choice program, we compare employees who were

targeted for the active choice program to a similar group of employees who were not targeted.

We define the Before (control) cohort as employee-drug class 7 combinations that would have

been targeted had the active choice program been rolled out a year earlier in 2007-2008. The

After (treatment) cohort is employee-drug class combinations targeted when the active choice

program was actually implemented in 2008-2009.

        Although we know which employees and prescriptions were actually targeted after the

program was rolled out, identifying the counterfactual Before control group requires creating an

algorithm to select the employee-drug class combinations that would have been targeted had the

program been rolled out in 2007-2008. To ensure that our Before and After cohorts are selected

on a consistent basis, we use this algorithm to identify the employee-drug class combinations

that comprise both cohorts in our analysis.

        The selection criteria we use for inclusion in the cohorts are:




7
  We deem two medications to be in the same drug class if they share the same four-digit Generic Product Identifier
(GPI4); drugs with in a GPI4 have similar chemical properties and are used to treat similar conditions. It is not
uncommon for individuals to switch between different medications within the same drug class. For example, an
individual might switch from a brand-name drug to a generic drug, or from a drug that has proven ineffective to
another similar drug.

             (After cohort)

        •    A retail claim for a maintenance drug was submitted between October 12 and

        •    No claim for home delivery was submitted from May 1 to November 1 of 2007

             (Before cohort) or 2008 (After cohort). The targeting list excludes employee-drug

             class combinations for which an unexpired home delivery prescription was on file

             with the PBM. We do not observe home delivery prescriptions on file with the PBM

             unless they are associated with a home delivery claim, 9 so we use claims as a proxy

             for prescriptions. 10

        •    Employees who had not previously actively indicated that they preferred retail

             pharmacy pick-up over home delivery. This aspect of the PBM algorithm was only

             relevant after the initial target sample was selected.

        Our algorithm successfully identifies 93% of the employees and 90% of the employee-

drug class combinations that were actually targeted in November 2008; of the employees flagged

by our algorithm, 95% were actually targeted in November 2008, as were 95% of the employee-

drug class combinations.

        We make two additional sample restrictions. First, we analyze only 28- and 30-day

targeted prescriptions, which make up 95% of the employee-drug class combinations targeted,



8
  The PBM created its targeting list by identifying employees who, on either November 16 or November 26, 2008,
had a retail claim for a prescription maintenance drug in the past 30 days. October 12 is 35 days before November
16, the first targeting date. The additional five days beyond the PBM’s 30-day look-back period account for data
processing lags and improve the match between the results of our algorithm and the results of the PBM algorithm.

  It is possible for a home delivery prescription not to be associated with a home delivery claim, but all home
delivery claims are associated with a home delivery prescription.
10
   Our results are similar if we choose a somewhat different look-back period for not having a previous home
delivery claim.

                                                        9
since prescriptions of other lengths may differ in important ways. Second, to simplify our

analysis and to make it easier to interpret our results, we restrict the bulk of our analysis to

employees targeted in November 2008 whom we can observe through October 2009, and

employees who would have been targeted in November 2007 whom we can observe through

October 2008. This restriction excludes an additional 13% of employee-drug class observations.

        After applying the algorithm and sample restrictions, the Before cohort includes 20,486

employees and 38,088 employee-drug class combinations, and the After cohort includes 23,752

employees and 45,600 employee-drug class combinations. 11 We measure outcomes from

November of the calendar year in which the cohorts are defined to October of the next calendar

year. We are constrained to a one-year period because the active choice program was supplanted

by an initiative to more strongly encourage home delivery adoption. Starting on January 1, 2010,

employees who had been targeted for the active choice program and had declined home delivery

were restricted to two more retail pharmacy claims for each targeted drug at the 2009

copayment; copayments for subsequent retail pharmacy claims doubled. New employees with

prescription maintenance medications and existing employees who were starting a newly

prescribed maintenance medication were also able to submit two retail pharmacy claims at the

2009 copayment, but they had to pay the full price for subsequent retail pharmacy claims. Details

of the 2010 prescription drug plan were announced during Company A’s annual open enrollment

period, which began on October 26, 2009. Except for a small number of human resources

personnel and senior executives, employees did not learn of these changes before that date.

        Our primary outcome of interest is the choice between retail pharmacy pick-up and home

delivery for each employee-drug class combination. For the After cohort, we additionally

  13,414 individuals appear in both the 2007 and 2008 cohorts, 7,072 are in the 2007 cohort only, and 10,338 are in

analyze whether individuals made no active choice. We control for the following variables that

are measured as of December 1 of the year in which the cohorts are defined: gender; age; tenure

at the company; salary; the number of targeted drugs the employee is taking; and the employee’s

medication adherence in the drug class 12 over the prior six months as measured by a standard

proxy, the proportion of days covered (PDC) calculated according to the approach described in

Leslie et al. (2008). The PDC is the fraction of days in a specific time interval in which an

individual has a prescribed daily dose of medication available given the individual’s refill history

and assuming the individual takes the medication as prescribed when it is available.

        Because individuals may choose home delivery for its lower copayments, we also control

for the potential annual copay savings from switching to home delivery in the case of perfect

medication adherence. Appendix A explains how we construct this measure. We calculate an

average annual potential savings at the employee-drug class level of $41.51 and $39.69 for the

Before and After cohorts, respectively. For generic drugs, potential savings range from $0 (if the

retail price is less than the copay) to $12 (the difference between the annual copayments for a

generic prescription filled through home delivery rather than retail pharmacy pick-up). About

three-quarters of the prescriptions in our data are generics. For other prescriptions, the potential

savings may be much higher.

        Our final control variables are dummies for the most common indication (MCI)

designations, which specify the medical condition that a drug is most commonly used to treat.

For example, the MCI for statins is “High Blood Cholesterol,” while the MCI for ibuprofen is

“Pain and Inflammation.” Note that the MCI does not necessarily designate the medical

condition for which a drug was prescribed for a specific individual. For example, the MCI for

  Calculating PDC at the employee-drug class level ensures that we do not calculate an artificially low PDC if an
individual failed to refill one prescription because he switched to another drug within the same drug class.

birth control pills is “Contraceptives,” but birth control pills may also be prescribed to treat acne.

Each drug has a unique MCI.

         Appendix Table A2 presents sample characteristics for the Before and After cohorts as of

December 1 of 2007 or 2008, respectively. The two cohorts are very similar in terms of share

female (49.9% Before, 49.4% After), average age (46.4 Before, 46.4 After), average salary

($32,191 Before, $32,994 After), and average number of targeted medications (1.86 Before, 1.92

After). The After cohort has higher tenure (5.7 years versus 4.9 years), higher past PDC when it

can be calculated (77.4% versus 71.2%), and more cases where PDC cannot be calculated

(29.9% versus 19.7%). PDCs cannot be calculated if the prescription is very new or if adherence

was extremely low. The last column shows the characteristics of the total employee population at

Company A as of December 1, 2008. Relative to the overall employee population, those targeted

for the active choice program are more likely to be female, are older, and have been employed at

the company longer.



Results

Impact on Home Delivery Take-Up

         Figure 1 shows the fraction of individuals in each cohort who filled a prescription

through either a retail pharmacy (dashed lines) or home delivery (solid lines) within each

calendar month following cohort definition. Less than 2% of the Before cohort uses home

delivery in any month during its 12-month observation period. 13 The After cohort starts at a

similarly low rate of home delivery utilization, but its utilization rate increases from December


13
   We had previously noted that 6% of prescriptions were filled through home delivery before the active choice
program. The home delivery usage rate is lower in the Before cohort because the targeting criteria exclude
prescriptions already being filled through home delivery. In addition, Figure 1 shows the fraction of individuals
filling a prescription through each channel, rather than the fraction of prescriptions filled through each channel.

through March before stabilizing at about 10% of individuals each month for the rest of the year.

The increase in home delivery adoption by the After cohort is offset by a corresponding decline

in its retail pharmacy fills.

        The fraction of individuals with a retail pharmacy fill in any given month declines over

time for both cohorts, a pattern commonly observed in the medication adherence literature. For

the Before cohort, this decline reflects a combination of medical recovery and imperfect

adherence. For the After cohort, an additional source of decline comes from individuals

substituting home delivery for retail pharmacy fills. The decline in the retail fill rate is steeper

than the increase in the home delivery rate for the After cohort because home deliveries occur

less frequently than retail fills due to the 90-day length of home delivery prescriptions versus the

one-month length of retail prescriptions. Indeed, the After cohort’s home delivery rate increase

in excess of the Before cohort’s home delivery rate increase is about one-third of the After

cohort’s retail decline in excess of the Before cohort’s retail decline. In untabulated results, we

find that PDC is not affected on average by the active choice program.

        To understand the correlates of home delivery take-up, we turn to regression analysis.

Table 1 presents coefficients from linear probability regressions. In the first column, the

dependent variable is a binary indicator for home delivery utilization at any point during the 12-

month observation period. The unit of observation is employee-drug class combination. Note that

home delivery adoption is a near-absorbing state; less than 3% of individuals who select home

delivery subsequently revert back to retail pharmacy pick-up within a given drug class. The only

explanatory variable in the first column is an indicator for whether an individual is in the After

cohort. Home delivery utilization is 35.6 percentage points higher for employee-drug class

combinations in the After cohort relative to the Before cohort (p < 0.001).



                                                  13
         The second column adds a rich set of additional covariates to the regression. These

covariates have a negligible effect on the estimated active choice effect; the coefficient on the

After cohort dummy grows slightly to 36.6% and remains significant (p < 0.001). Home delivery

utilization is higher for those who are older, have less tenure, and are more highly compensated.

It is also higher for individuals who have been more adherent in the past (higher PDC)—

hypothetically moving from a 0% PDC to a 100% PDC is associated with a 7 percentage point

increase in take-up—and individuals for whom we do not measure a past PDC. Finally, home

delivery utilization is higher if the potential savings associated with switching to home delivery

are higher, but the magnitude of this effect pales in comparison to the magnitude of the active

choice effect; potential savings would have to exceed $4,000 per year to have the same take-up

effect as the active choice program.

         To examine whether there are heterogeneous effects of the active choice program, the

third and fourth columns in Table 1 together show coefficients from a single regression that adds

interaction terms between the After cohort dummy and the additional covariates. The interaction

terms in the fourth column indicate that active choice has a larger positive impact on those who

are older, more recently hired, more highly compensated, taking more targeted drugs, more

adherent in the past, and not missing a past PDC. 14

         To obtain regression-adjusted estimates of the timing of home delivery adoption, we

expand the regression so that observations are at the employee-drug class-month level. Each

month, the dependent variable is whether home delivery had ever been used for this employee-

drug class combination in this month or prior. The explanatory variables are the controls in the



14
  No significance should be attached to the fact that the coefficient on the uninteracted After cohort dummy falls to
0.135, since this represents the estimated effect of active choice on a hypothetical individual who has a zero value
for all of the interacted controls.

                                                         14
second column plus calendar month dummies. The last column of Table 1 shows some of the

coefficients from this regression, but the main coefficients of interest are those on the calendar

month dummies, which are plotted in Figure 2. The coefficients on the dummies for calendar

months November 2007 to October 2008 comprise the Before cohort series, and those for

calendar months November 2008 to October 2009 comprise the After cohort series.

       Home delivery adoption of the Before cohort increases slowly and steadily over time, so

that it is about 6 percentage points higher than its November 2007 value at the end of the Before

cohort’s observation period. The After cohort’s home delivery adoption rate increases as well,

but most rapidly in February and March of 2009. Figure 3 shows that the number of pharmacy

claims rejected for the After cohort peaks at 4,730 in March 2009. Much of the 11 percentage

point increase in home delivery adoption in March seems likely to be driven by these rejections,

which forced employees to make an active decision about home delivery or pay the full out-of-

pocket cost to get their medication. Waiting until rejection at the pharmacy is consistent with

both inattention and procrastination. However, there is evidence of forward-looking behavior to

preempt rejection in the After cohort as well, since home delivery adoption increased by 5

percentage points in January and an additional 10 percentage points in February, even though

only 1 claim was rejected in January and 263 claims were rejected in February.

       Up to this point, our analysis has not distinguished between those who actively chose

retail pharmacy pickup and those who registered no choice at all with the PBM, thus ending up

with the implicit default of retail pharmacy pickup with no subsidy. An important contribution of

this paper to the literature on active choice mechanisms is to observe that the act of not making a

choice is an interesting outcome in its own right.




                                                 15
       Figure 4 shows the fraction of individual-drug class observations with an active choice of

home delivery in the Before and After cohorts; for the After cohort, we also show the fraction

making an active choice for retail pharmacy pickup, and the fraction who retain retail pharmacy

pick-up by default because they made no active choice. In the Before cohort, only 6% actively

chooses home delivery at some point during the twelve-month observation period; the remainder

use retail pharmacy pick-up by default. In contrast, the active choice program is quite successful

at encouraging active decision-making in the After cohort, achieving an 81% active decision

rate. Active choices are fairly evenly split between home delivery (42%) and retail pharmacy

pick-up (39%). The remaining 22% of the After cohort make no choice. This highlights one

pitfall of efforts to encourage active choice in settings where it is not technologically feasible to

require it: some people may make no choice even when encouraged to do so (and, in this case,

even with financial incentives to do so).

       How do characteristics of individuals in the After cohort vary with their prescription fill

outcomes? In Table 2, we present the average marginal effects from a multinomial logit

regression where the unit of observation is the employee-drug class combination. Those who

make no choice are more likely to be male, younger, more recently hired, lower-paid, taking

fewer medications, and less adherent. Those who choose home delivery are older, have been

more recently hired, are more highly paid, take more medications, and are more adherent. Those

who actively choose retail are more likely to be female, have longer tenure, are lower paid, take

more medications, and are more adherent.

       Table 2 also shows that financial incentives matter for making an active choice. Higher

annual savings from switching from retail to home delivery significantly decrease the likelihood

of making no choice (marginal effect per $100 of savings = -0.0104, p < 0.05) and increase the



                                                  16
likelihood of choosing home delivery, although this latter effect is not significant at the 5% level

in the multinomial framework (marginal effect = 0.0081, p = 0.07). (Recall that in Table 1,

where the outcome variable was a binary indicator for whether home delivery was chosen,

potential cost savings increased the probability of choosing home delivery in a strongly

significant manner.)

        Figure 5 further probes the role of financial incentives in encouraging individuals to

make an active choice. Recall that if members of the After cohort do not make an active choice,

they become liable for the full cost of future prescriptions starting with their third fill of the year.

The difference in out-of-pocket costs between having the prescription covered by insurance and

not covered is the direct incentive to actively choose. To examine the importance of this

incentive, we segment the prescription drug fill choice outcomes for the After cohort by the

insurance subsidy given to the last retail claim filled for that employee-drug class combination

on or before November 25, 2008. We see in Figure 5 that as the penalty for not choosing actively

increases, the frequency of not choosing decreases from 28% (when the insurance subsidy is $0)

to 15% (when the insurance subsidy exceeds $68).



Impact on Aggregate Prescription Drug Expenditures

        The final outcome that we assess is the impact of the active choice program on aggregate

prescription spending by Company A and its employees. The program also likely conferred some

financial benefit to the PBM, but we do not have data with which to estimate this effect. Instead

of calculating the realized savings over the active choice time period analyzed thus far

(November 2008-October 2009), we calculate the annualized cost savings that would accrue to

employees and Company A in steady state.



                                                  17
       Following the methodology described in Appendix B, we calculate aggregate annual

employee cost-savings of $417,001 and aggregate annual employer cost savings of $283,451, for

a total combined cost saving of $700,452. This is a $29.49 savings per capita for Company A

plus its employees.

       These statistics do not account for any non-pecuniary benefits associated with home

delivery (e.g., greater convenience). Nor do they account for the costs of the program to

individuals, their physicians, the PBM, or retail pharmacies. These include the cognitive costs to

individuals of making an active choice and implementing a change to home delivery for those

who decide to switch, the cost to the PBM of operating the active choice program, the cost to

physicians of helping patients transfer their prescriptions to home delivery, and the cost to retail

pharmacies who lose some of their business to home delivery. For the PBM, the unmeasured

benefits presumably outweigh the unmeasured costs, as the PBM has expanded the active choice

approach to home delivery enrollment to many of its other clients.



Discussion

       This paper adds to the small but growing literature on the effects of active choice

mechanisms. Most previous research studies settings in which individuals can be compelled, or

at least strongly coerced, to make a choice (e.g., Carroll et al. 2009, Kessler and Roth 2014,

Montoy, Dow and Kaplan 2016, Keller et al. 2011). In practice, there are many contexts like the

one we study here in which an active choice cannot be required. In these settings, reducing the

fraction of individuals who refuse to choose can increase the effectiveness of such interventions

at changing outcomes.




                                                 18
        We document that in a large-scale implementation of active choice in such a domain that

involved nearly 24,000 individuals scattered across the U.S. and required the coordinated action

of pharmacists, physicians, and call-center workers, it is possible to achieve a high rate of

compliance where 81% of the eligible population makes an active choice. Toft, Schuitema, and

Thøgersen (2014) are able to achieve a 75% active choice rate in a small intervention involving

48 individuals presented with the option to adopt energy efficiency upgrades. Josephs et al.

(2018) are able to get 71% of 1,808 new hires to click on a “Future Healthcare Planning” link

that was presented as mandatory. Putnam-Farr and Riis (2016), who examine click-through rates

to e-mail solicitations regarding workplace wellness programs, get much lower active choice

rates of 7-13%.

        Even though the decision not to actively choose is a relevant outcome, it has received

little attention in the literature on active choice interventions. We contribute to this literature by

examining the determinants of the no-choice outcome. First, we show that the propensity not to

choose is related to observable personal characteristics such as gender, age, salary, and tenure.

Second, we show that the probability of making no active choice responds to financial

incentives. In our study, individuals with the largest financial benefit from choosing are 13

percentage points more likely to make a choice than individuals with no financial benefit from

choosing. Choice architects can thus affect the likelihood of active choosing by selecting the

relative costs and benefits of the implicit default that is implemented in the no-choice scenario. A

very unattractive implicit default will minimize the probability of no active choice, but at the cost

of the ex post welfare of those who still make no active choice. If the penalty associated with the

implicit default is especially harsh, it may be difficult to commit to actually implementing it if

some individuals fail to choose.



                                                  19
       Active choice mechanisms are often implemented in settings where agents are perceived

to not be sufficiently taking up a certain option. Consistent with most of the literature, we find

that active choice increases take-up of the targeted outcome relative to the opt-in regime, in our

case by 36 percentage points. This effect is large compared to the estimated effects of active

choice in other contexts. The study most similar to ours is Keller et al. (2011), who find a 10

percentage point increase in take-up of an automatic drug refill option in a setting where active

choice can be compelled and there is no financial incentive to choose the automatic drug refill

option. Carroll et al. (2009) document that an active choice approach to retirement savings plan

enrollment increases participation by 28 percentage points. Stutzer, Goette, and Zehnder (2011)

report that active choice increases blood donation rates by 5 to 9 percentage points among those

not aware of the importance of donating. Montoy, Dow and Kaplan (2016) find that an active

choice approach increases HIV testing rates by 13 percentage points. Josephs et al. (2018) report

that active choice increases the rate at which legally binding advance healthcare directives are

submitted by 4 percentage points. Toft, Schuitema, and Thøgersen (2014) document that active

choice increases adoption of energy efficiency upgrades by 13 percentage points, but this

difference is not statistically significant in their small sample. Kessler and Roth (2014) is the one

anomaly in this literature, finding that active choice decreases organ donation registration rates

by 2-6 percentage points.

       The active choice implementation we study was bundled together with an extensive

communications campaign. The home delivery take-up effects we observe could in principle be

driven by the communications portion of the intervention rather than the active choice portion.

Alternatively, it could be that any novel policy would have increased home delivery uptake. But

the fact that there is relatively little adoption of home delivery before February 2009 despite



                                                 20
multiple communications in Fall 2008 and a sharp increase in adoption as the active choice

deadline approached points to active choice being the critical driver of the treatment effect.

       Our results suggest that even when home delivery is an option for long-term maintenance

medications, many individuals are either unaware that the option exists, have not considered

whether they would prefer it to retail pharmacy pick-up, or have procrastinated in implementing

their preferences. Stutzer, Goette, and Zehnder (2011), who find that active choice increases

blood donation rates only among those who report being not sufficiently informed about the

importance of donating blood, argue that active choice facilitates preference formation, which is

consistent with the rationale for the active choice intervention that we study in this paper.

       Note that any active choice mechanism will impose decision-making costs on individuals

who choose to choose (Sunstein, 2015). We do not have any information on the magnitude of

those costs in the context that we study here. Ideally, the decision-making costs of active choice

would be considered when assessing whether such interventions are appropriate.



Conclusion

       We evaluate an active choice program that encourages employees on a long-term

prescription to actively choose whether to fill that prescription through home delivery or at a

retail pharmacy. Even though compliance with the requirement to actively choose was

incomplete, it increased the fraction of employees using home delivery by 36 percentage points

relative to a baseline home delivery utilization rate of 6 percent under the pre-existing opt-in

regime. Economic incentives matter: individuals with a higher expected level of cost savings

from switching to home delivery are more likely to choose home delivery. Making no choice is

also an important outcome: 19% of those required to make an active choice to preserve their



                                                 21
pharmacy insurance subsidies fail to do so. Individuals with little financial incentive to make an

active choice are much less likely to do so. The implicit default that is implemented when no

active choice is made is an important part of choice architecture in active choice regimes because

the implicit default serves as an incentive to choose and as the default for those who don’t.

Appendix A: Calculating the Savings to Individuals from Switching to Home Delivery

       To calculate the potential cost savings to an individual from filling a claim through home

delivery rather than at a retail pharmacy, we have to impute what the copay would have been had

the claim been filled through the alternative channel. This is a measure we do not directly

observe. Instead, we impute the counterfactual copay from other similar claims. We now

describe this procedure.

       Some individuals have claims for the same medication via both a retail pharmacy and

home delivery. For these individuals, we could use their own claims history to construct a

counterfactual copay (we call this “individual imputation”). However, many individuals in our

data only fill claims through either retail or home delivery. For these individuals, we do not have

the data necessary for individual imputation. As an alternative, we could construct a

counterfactual copay from the average of claims filled by everyone in our data who takes the

same medication but uses the other delivery channel (we call this “average imputation”). This

approach will result in fewer missing values for our “counterfactual copay” variable, but also

likely introduces greater measurement error at the individual level.

       One approach to imputing the counterfactual copay would be to do the imputation at the

highest level of specificity possible—that is, to impute at the individual level if possible, and at

the average level otherwise. This approach is problematic because the Before and After cohorts

would not be treated symmetrically. Many more individuals in the After cohort have both retail


                                                 24
and home delivery claims, so there would be a dramatically higher individual imputation rate for

the After cohort. To make the imputation comparable across both cohorts, we instead use

average imputation to calculate counterfactual copayments for everyone.

       A limitation of this second approach is that if an individual is taking an uncommon

medication, there may not be anyone else in the data who fills that medication in the same

formulation and dosage through the other delivery channel. For these claims, we impute the

copay using the nearest similar claim or claims in the data, where we define similarity from

either the NDC or GPI code for the medication. An NDC (National Drug Code) is a unique 10-

digit code assigned to each medication. Each code is divided into three segments. The first

segment identifies the drug labeler (e.g., the manufacturer or distributor). The second segment

identifies the strength, dosage form, and formulation of the drug. The third segment identifies the

package form and size. The GPI (Generic Product Identifier) is a 14-digit hierarchical drug

classification code with increasingly specific information contained in each pair of digits. The

first six digits identify the drug’s group, class, and subclass. Digits 7-10 identify the drug’s

generic name and extension, and digits 11-14 identify the drug’s dosage and form.

       We impute counterfactual copayments using the highest level of specificity available. We

are able find a retail match for the vast majority of home delivery claims and vice versa using

either an exact NDC (which we look for first) or an exact GPI code. If we lack an exact NDC or

GPI match, we turn to drugs in our data that share the same 12-digit GPI code. If we still lack a

match, we then turn to drugs that share the same 10-digit GPI code, and so on, until we reach a

level of GPI aggregation that allows us to compute a copayment in the counterfactual delivery

channel for nearly all observations.




                                                  25
       Because individuals in the After cohort are more likely to have claims filled through both

retail and home delivery than those in the Before cohort, they are also more likely to have a

claim for which we can find an exact NDC match with which to compute a counterfactual copay:

we can simply use their own claim. Thus, taking an average of the copayments over all claims at

a given level of drug comparability might result in less measurement error in the imputation

process for the After cohort than the Before cohort. To make the imputation process more

comparable across the two cohorts, we exclude an individual’s own claims filled through the

other delivery channel when calculating the average counterfactual copayment for a given claim.

       To avoid introducing measurement error from the fact that retail drug prices change over

time, we only impute copayments for the Before cohort from claims submitted in 2007-2008, and

for the After cohort from claims submitted in 2008-09.

       Potential savings for a home delivery claim are then derived by first calculating the

imputed retail copay minus the actual home delivery copay for each claim. We then average this

measure across all the claims submitted during the relevant observation period for each

individual-drug class combination. Finally, we take this measure of average savings and

annualize it, assuming perfect adherence, to obtain the ultimate measure of potential savings

used in our analysis.



Appendix B: Calculating the Aggregate Employee and Employer Savings from the Active

Choice Program

       We calculate the aggregate reduction in prescription drug expenditures for both

employees and their employer as a result of the active choice program. Consumers benefit from

lower home delivery copays, while the employer benefits from the lower average prices net of



                                                26
copays of prescriptions filled through home delivery. For the aggregate savings calculation, we

use all home delivery claims submitted from November 1, 2008, through December 31, 2009, for

drugs targeted by the active choice program.

       The approach we use to calculate employee cost savings is more straightforward than that

described in Appendix A because we are calculating cost savings only for the After cohort, for

whom we have a complete and accurate copayment schedule. We thus do not need to maintain

consistency with calculations for the Before cohort.

       For individuals for whom we observe both a retail and a home delivery claim for a

prescription with the same NDC, we use the individual-level average of the retail claim prices as

the counterfactual retail price for the home delivery claims. We split the total counterfactual cost

between the employer and employee using the copay schedule shown in Table A1. When we

don’t have an individual-specific retail NDC match for a home delivery claim, we use a

modification of the imputation procedure described in Appendix A.

       Possible imputation methods combine (1) the choice between using only an individual’s

own retail claims versus retail claims from everyone else in the sample with (2) the level of drug

identification specificity that is used (NDC, GPI, or substrings of GPI). For each drug, we rank

the imputation methods by accuracy as follows. We first only look at the home delivery claims

for which we have an individual-level retail NDC match. For those claims, we can calculate the

average counterfactual retail costs on an individual-NDC level, which we will call the

“benchmark.” We then see what counterfactual retail cost would be calculated under each

imputation method if we did not have an individual-level retail NDC match available. We rank

the imputation methods, separately for each NDC, by the absolute average deviation between the

benchmark retail price and the imputed retail price.



                                                 27
       Having ranked the imputation methods, we impute counterfactual retail costs of each

home delivery claim for which we do not have an individual-level retail NDC match, using the

highest-ranked imputation method that can be used for that claim. Note that this means the

imputation method can vary across drugs within an individual.

       With the imputed counterfactual retail price and copayment for each home delivery

claim, we compute the employer and employee savings for each home delivery claim, convert

this to a savings per day, add up the daily savings for the period of time since an employee

switched to home delivery for a given drug class, and then annualize this amount to compute a

yearly measure of savings attributable to the active choice program.

       There are three further adjustments that we make in arriving at our final cost savings

measure. The first is an adjustment for prescriptions that are not completely used up by the end

of the year and the possibility that some individuals are stockpiling prescriptions. For example, if

an employee filled a 90-day home delivery prescription on December 1, 2009 and took it as

prescribed, there would be a two-month supply left at the end of the year, although this employee

may not be stockpiling. If an employee filled a home delivery claim every two months of the

year instead of every three months of the year starting at the beginning of the year, and took the

medication as prescribed, there would be a 6-month supply left at the end of the year and this

employee would appear to be stockpiling. In either case, it would be inaccurate to assign the

entirety of the cost savings associated with the leftover medication at year-end to the period over

which we are calculating cost savings. For medications for which there is less than a month’s

supply left at the end of the year, we make no adjustments to the home delivery cost savings,

since filling prescriptions through the retail channel could lead to similar amounts of excess

supply. For medications for which there is more than a month’s supply left at the end of the year,



                                                28
we scale down our cost savings estimate proportionally so that we attribute savings to no more

than one month of excess supply.

       The second adjustment we make accounts for employees who were already using home

delivery before the implementation of the active choice program. The cost savings associated

with their home delivery claims should not be attributed to the program. We therefore drop the

home delivery claims of individuals who submit only home delivery claims in the six months

prior to November 1, 2008, when the initial targeting for the active choice program was done.

       The third adjustment accounts for the fact that some individuals would have switched

from retail to home delivery even in the absence of the active choice program. The analysis

shown in Figure 2 suggest that roughly 15% of the After cohort who switched to home delivery

would have done so in the absence of the active choice program. We simply reduce the total cost

savings measure that we calculate by 15% to account for the switching that would have occurred

in the absence of the program.

       Our estimate of the total cost savings after all adjustments are made is $417,001 for

employees and $283,451 for the employer, for a total cost savings of $700,452.

delivery, (2) actively chooses retail pharmacy pickup and never receives a home delivery, or (3)

subsidy for the last retail claim filed for the employee-drug class combination before November
26, 2008. The bins are chosen so that each contains approximately the same number of
observations. Source: Authors’ calculations.
               Table 1. OLS Regression Results for Home Delivery Adoption

The firstfour columns of the table report coefficients from OLS regressions where the dependent
variable is a binary indicator for home delivery utilization at any point during the 12-month
observation periods for the Before and After cohorts. The unit of observation is the individual-
drug class combination. The last column reports coefficients from an OLS regression where the
unit of observation is the employee-drug class-month combination. The dependent variable is a
binary indicator for whether home delivery had ever been used for this employee-drug class
combination in the current month or prior. The third and fourth columns are reporting
coefficients from a single regression; the fourth column shows the coefficients from interacting
the main explanatory variables in the third column with the After cohort dummy. Standard errors
are clustered at the individual level.
