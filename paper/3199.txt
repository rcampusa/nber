                     SEIGNORAGE AND POLITICAL INSTABILITY


                                   ABSTRACT

     The importance of seignorage relative to other sources of government

revenue differs markedly across countries. The main theoretical implication

of this paper is that countries with more unstable and polarized political

systems rely more heavily on seignorage. This result is obtained within the

context of a political model of tax reform. The model implies that the more

unstable and polarized the political system, the more inefficient is the

equilibrium tax structure (in the sense that tax collection is more costly

 to administer), and the higher therefore, the reliance on seignorage. This

 prediction of the model is tested on cross-section data for 79 countries.

 It is found that, after controlling for other variables, political instabil-

 ity significantly contributes to explain the fraction of government revenue

 derived from seignorage. This finding is very robust. We also find that

 seignorage is positively related to political polarization, even though here

 the evidence is weaker because of difficulties in measuring polarization.

1. Introduction

     Over the years economists and other social scientists have recurrently

wondered why inflation rates and seignorage have, over long periods of time,

differed so markedly across countries. How can we explain, for example.

that during the period 1971-82 inflation in Chile was on average l7% per

annum, in Indonesia 17%, in Burnundi 10% and in Germany only 5%? Some of

the more popular explanations have relied on the obvious, arguing that more

inflationary countries have exhibited more lax fiscal and monetary policies
                                I
than the more stable nations.       But this begs the obvious questLon of

some countries are able to maintain fiscal and monetary discipline while

others are unable (or unwilling) to do it. A different approach has focused

on the characteristics of the tax system, arguing that for institutional or

technological reasons the less developed countries are unable to build

sophisticated tax systems, and thus have to rely heavily on inflation to

finance government expenditure. This line of thought however fails to

explain the significant inflation differentials in many countries with

roughly the same level of development or the same economic structure. For

instance, contrary to popular mythology, not all Latin American countries

are highly inflationary.2

     In this paper we accept the traditional explanation that seignorage

reflects high costs of administering and enforcing the collection of regular

taxes. But we argue that the evolution of the tax system of a country also

depends on the features of its political system, and not just on those of

its economic structure.

     The central idea of the paper can be stated as follows. An inefficient

tax system (i.e., one that facilitates tax evasion and imposes high tax

collection costs) acts as a constraint on the revenue collecting policies of
                                     2




the government. This constraint may be welcome by those who disagree with

the goals pursued by the current government. In particular, previous

governments or legislative majorities) may deliberately choose to maintain

(or create) an inefficient tax system, so as to constrain the behavior of

future governments (or majorities) with which they might disagree. Of

course, this is more likely to happen in countries with more unstable and

polarized political systems. This argument is formalized and made more

precise in Section 2 of the paper.

     This idea leads to an obvious empirical implication. Namely that,

after controlling for the stage of development and the structure of the

economy, more unstable and polarized countries collect a larger fraction of

their revenues through seignorage compared to more stable and homogeneous

societies. This conjecture is tested in Section 3 of the paper.    In the

remainder of this section we present some empirical evidence that motivates

our investigation.


1.1 Cross Country Differentials in Inflation and Seiznoyaze; The Emoirical.
     Evidence

    Table 1 shows average inflation and seignorage over 1971-82 for 79

countries for which data are available.3 Inflation is defined as the rate

of change of the consumer price index, while seignorage is defined as the

ratio of the increase in base money to total government revenues.4 This

table points to a very wide range of inflationary experiences. While some

countries, even some very poor ones, have been very stable, others have had

extremely high rates of inflation. Also, the table shows that the extent to

which countries use money creation to finance their expenditures varies very

widely, with some countries relying on seignorage to cover over 28 percent

of their revenues.5

    How much of this cross-country variability can be explained by economic

variables alone? To answer this question, we estimate some cross country

linear equations that relate seignorage to a set of structural variables

suggested in the literature.6 All variables are averaged over the period

1971-82, except if otherwise noted. Seignorage is the dependent variables.

The independent variables fall into three categories:   (1) The sectoral

composition of gross domestic product, to account for differences in admin-

istering tax collection across sectors. We expect the agricultural sector

to be the hardest to tax, and thus to have a positive coefficient in the

regressions. The mining and manufacturing sector are assumed to be the

easiest to tax, and thus to have a negative coefficient. We also include

the ratio of foreign trade to CNP, since in many developing countries

imports and exports are a cheap tax base; hence its coefficient too is

expected to be negative.   (2) Two measures of economic development: GDP

per capita, and a dummy variable taking a value of I for the industrialized

countries and 0 otherwise. We expect both variables to have a negative

coefficient, since the technology for enforcing tax collection is likely to

be more inefficient in less developed countries. (3) A measure of urbaniz-

ation, since tax collection costs are likely to be smaller in urban areas

than in rural areas; this leads us to expect a negative coefficient.7 These

variables are defined more precisely in the Data Appendix.

     The results are reported in Table 2, for alternative specifications of

the regressions. The first three columns refer to all the countries in the
                                                                  8
sample. The last two columns refer to developing countries only.        Most of

 the coefficients have the expected sign. One exception is the share of

manufacturing and mining which is positive in equation (5). Its coefficient

 is, however, insignificant. A second exception refers to the coefficient of
urbanization, which is always positive and highly significant. We interpret

this as preliminary evidence in favor of a political explanation of seignor-

age differentials. As noted by political scientists, political awareness

and political conflicts are likely to be more prominent in urban areas than

in rural societies. We return to this point below, in Section 3.

     In column (3) of the table we added two dummies that group countries

into continents. The Latin America dummy is positive and significant at the

5 percent level. This is further evidence that non-economic variables play

a role in explaining cross country inflation differentials.

     These regressions account for 33% to 42% of the variance in the data,

irrespective of whether or not the industrialized countries are included.

(These figures refer to the regressions R2, rather than the        depicted

in the table.) This result is not discouraging, given how different these

countries are. However, it Leaves a large margin for improvement. This is

what we attempt to do in the remainder of the paper. In the next section we

analyze a simple model of tax reforms that has implications for cross

country differences in seignorage. We then show that this theoretical

explanation is consistent with the data.


2. A Political Model of Tax Reforms

     The central feature of the model of this section is a distinction

between fiscal policy and tax reforms. A fiscal policy is the choice of tax

rates, and of the level and composition of government spending. A tax reform

is the broad design of a tax system that determines the available tax bases

and the technology for collecting taxes. Even though in practice it may be

difficult to decide where to draw the line, at a conceptual level this

distinction has important implications. A tax reform that changes the tax
                                     5




system will, typically take time and resources, since it requires investment

in the acquisition of information and in infrastructure. A fiscal policy, on

the other hand, can be implemented more swiftly. Thus, at any given moment

in time, the existing tax system acts as a constraint on the fiscal policy of

the current government. This suggests that tax reforms are also determined

by strategic considerations: a tax system is designed by taking into account

how it will constrain the fiscal policies of future governments. The central

idea of this section is that, if there is political instability and political

polarization, these strategic considerations may induce the current govern-

ment to leave an inefficient tax system to its successors.9

2.1 The Model

     To focus the analysis on the political determinants of the tax system,

the economy is described only by two simple equations: the budget

constraint of the government (eq. (1)) and of the private sector (eq. (2)).

                   +                                                         (1)
                          'tt-l + St
                c 1 -       -    -         -y(s                              (2)


Subscripts denote time periods. Each individual is endowed with one unit of

output in each period. g and          are two different public goods in per

capita terms and c is private consumption, also per capita. The govern-

ment collects from each individual an amount s in the form of "seignor-

age", and an amount       of tax revenue. The main difference between taxes

and seignorage is that a fraction         of the tax revenue is wasted due to

tax collection Costs, whereas seignorage Carries flO administrative costs.

Both taxes and seignorage impose deadweight losses on the private sector,

equal to 6(r) and 1(s) respectively. These distortions increase at an

increasing rate. Thus:
                                             6




                8'(.) >0,      8"(.)   >0
                '(.)   >0,     -'(.) > 0


The assumptions about 9, 8(•)          and       y(.) can be altered without affecting

the main qualitative result.

     Here, 0t1 is a rough measure of the efficiency of th tax system. A

lower value of 9 implies a more efficient tax system. Thus, in this

simple model, a tax reform amounts to a choice of 9, whereas a fiscal

policy is a choice of g, f, r and s. To capture the greater inertia in

reforming the tax system than in changing fiscal policy, we assume that 9,

but not the other policy variables, must be chosen one period in advance.

Thus, 9 is chosen at time        t but exerts an influence on tax collection

costs only at time t+l (cf., eq. (1)). In a previous version of the

paper, we generalized all the results to alternative ways of modelling the

inertia of the tax system (such as with lump sum costs) .            In   the empirical

analysis of the next section we also allow 9 to be partially determined by

technological features of the economy, like those proxied by the variables

of Table 2.10

     There are two possible policymaker types, L and R, who randomly

alternate in office. The policymaker of type i,              i —   L,R maximizes:

                   —
                       E(E k[U(c) +                                  I > fi   > 0        (3)



where E(.) denotes the expectation operator, U(•) is a concave and twice

continuously differentiable utility functions, and Hi(.')               is defined as

follows. If i —

                HL(g,f)   —        Min[ag,(l.a)f],          1 > a > 0                   (3')


and if i — R,    then HR(.)     is defined as in (3'), but with a replaced by
                                                 7




(1-a).       Thus, these two policymakers differ only in the desired composition

of the public good. For simplicity, their disagreement is parameterized by

a. The more distant is a from 1/2, the more they disagree. By const-

ruction, the overall weight given to private versus public consumption does

not depend on a.

       The political system is described as a Markov process with transition

probabilities           ir   and (1-ic):    the government who is in office at time t

has a fixed probability (1-ic) of being reappointed next period. iJith

probability       ic,        it is thrown Out of office and the other policymaker type

is appointed. These simplifying assumptions can be extended in several

ways. All the results go through if the political process is modelled as in

Alesina and Tabellini (1987), where rational voters elect the policymaker

type at the beginning of each period. A previous version showed that, under

appropriate conditions, the results generalize to a concave H(s) function

in (3). Similarly, the symmetry of the model and the fact that both

government types assign the same weight to private versus public consumption

simplify the exposition but do not effect the nature of the results.

           In our model, then, the political system has two important features:

its instability, represented by the probability of losing office,               ic.    And

the degree of polarization between the alternating governments, represented

by the disagreement parameter a. As we shall see below, these two features

determine the equilibrium efficiency of the tax system.

 2.2 Economic Policy Within a Given Tax System

           This subsection characterizes the equilibrium choice of                           and
                                                                                st.

       for a given value of                   The choice of       is studied in the next

 subsection. Since 9               is   the only state variable, the equilibrium values of

 r,   s,     g and I as a function of 8              are found by solving the static
                                            8




problem of maximizing [U(c)+H1(gf)]             subject to (1) and (2). Time

subscripts are omitted when superfluous. We only describe the equilibrium

when type L is in office; for concreteness, we assume m >                  1/2.   By symmet-

ry, the opposite case of R in office is obtained by replacing g with f.

     Let x — g   +   f   denote the total amount of government spending. After

some transformations, the first order conditions of this problem give11


                 gL — (l-m)x,      fL — ax                                             (6a)


                 1 —   U'(c)(l+-y'(s))                                                 (4b)



                 (l+y'(s)) -     l+5(r)                                                (4c)



Equation (4a) describe the optimal allocation of public consumption. The L

superscripts remind us that type L is in office. Equation (4b) compares

the marginal utility of public and private consumption. With distortionary

taxes, at an optimum the marginal utility of public consumption (unity)

exceeds the marginal utility of private consumption. Equation (4c) is the

Ramsey rule: it equates at the margin the distortions associated with the

last dollar collected from each source of revenue. These three conditions

underscore that the identity of the government only matters for the

composition of public consumption. Both government types choose the same

level of overall public spending and the same tax policy, irrespective of

the value of a.

     Together with (l)-(2), equations (4) implicitly define the equilibrium

values of all variables as functions of the efficiency of the tax system,                     9:


                 c* —    C(9),   x* —   X(9),   s* —   S(8),   i* — T(S)                 (5)


Applying the implicit function theorem to (1), (2) and (4) yields (the proof

is available upon request):
                                                9




ProDosition 1

                   X'(9) < 0            S'(9) > 0       C'(O) > 0         T'(9) < 0

Thus, as intuitive, a more inefficient tax system discourages public

spending and forces the government to rely more on seignorage and less on

regular taxes as a source of revenue. Also, a more inefficient tax system
                                   12
raises private consumption.

2.3 Choosing the Efficiency of the Tax System

       We now turn to the question of how the efficiency of                    the   tax system is

determined in equilibrium. Since, by assumption, 9 has to be set one

period in advance and there is no cost in changing it, to characterize the

infinite horizon equilibrium it suffices to look one period ahead. With

probability (1-it),          tomorrow    type L is     reappointed in office. In this

case, by (4a) and (3), his utility is:

                   U(c(9)) + X(8)                                                              (6a)


With probability it,          tomorrow type        R is appointed. By symmetry, gR — fL
and       —
              gL   Hence, by (4a) and (3), and since                >   1/2,     type L utility
if   Out of   office is:
                   IJ(C(9)) +     (l X(8),                < 1                                  (6b)

Thus          is chosen so as to maximize the following expected utility

function (because of the symmetry of the model, this is also the utility

function of type R, when in office):


     (l.ir)[U(C(9))+X(8)]+1r      [U(C(6))1 x(9)1_u(C(e))+s(ir,)x(et)                        (7)



where    (1c,a) —   (I-it)    + ir(l-a)/a     1.
        The equilibrium value of 9 satisfies the first order condition:3
                                                    1.0




                   U' (C(9flC'     (8) +    ,8(ra)X'(8)         0                                 (8)


with (8) holding as an equality if 8 > 0.                      Time subscripts are omitted from

now on, since all, periods are alike. The first term on the left hand side

of (8) is the marginal gain of raising the inefficiency of the tax system;

since C'(9) > 0,          this gain takes the form of higher private consumption.

The second term is the expected marginal cost of a more inefficient tax

system, that takes the form of reduced public consumption (recall that

X'(9) <   0)).
       According to (8) ,      the magnitude of this expected marginal cost depends

on 8(a,1T).       The following facts about fl(.)                   are worth noting:

                    ir
                         (r,a) <   0,      $a (r,a) <     0,    urn       $(ira)   —   0,         (9)
                                                                a—I
                                                                '-.   I
where a subscript denotes a partial derivative. Thus, the expected marginal

cost of having an inefficient tax system is lower: (i) the more unstable

and (ii) the more polarized is the political system. In the limit, this

marginal cost tends to zero as the political system becomes extremely

unstable and polarized.

       By (8) and (9), the equilibrium efficiency of the tax system,                        9*,   is

a function of the stability and polarization of the tax system:

9* —   8(ir,a).    We have:


ProDositign 2:       (i) 9(0.a) —          9(,r.)    — 0

(ii)      There exists a pair               < I and a.. <           1     such that 8(i',a) > 0   for


          any ,r>,r0, a>a0.
(iii) If 9* > 0,            then e > 0 and 9 > 0.

    The first statement follows by combing (4) and (8), and noting that fl(0,a)
—   (r,½)   — 1.    The rest of the proof is obtained applying the implicit
                                         11




function theorem to (8), and invoking (9) and the second order conditions.

     This Proposition summarizes the central theoretical result of the

paper. If the current government is certain of being reappointed, or if

there is no polarization, then it always brings about the most efficient tax

system. However, with a sufficient degree of political instability

polarization, a more inefficient system may be preferred. More generally.

the lower is the probability that the current government will remain in

office and the greater is polarization, the more inefficient is the tax

system left as a legacy to its successors. This happens for a purely

strategic reason, and even though it is costless to improve the efficiency

of the tax system: A more inefficient tax collection apparatus discourages

future governments from collecting taxes and spending them on goods that are

not valued by the incumbent policymaker. The equilibrium value of 9            is

chosen so as to equate the expected marginal benefit of constraining future

governments to the marginal cost caused by inefficient taxation. Jhen

decreases or      approaches         the marginal cost of an inefficient tax

system rises, since the current government is more likely to be reappointed,

or if not reappointed it does not care much since it is more similar to its

opponent. As a result, 9* decreases.

     Finally, the equilibrium inefficiency of the tax system that emerges

when 9* > 0    can, in some sense, be socially efficient. By construction,

     maximizes the expected utility of the government in office at time          t.

tax   collection capacity of future governments, reduces the variance in the

composition of public spending and increases private consumption. The

optimality for society as a whole of having high tax collection costs may

seem surprising. But it is really in the nature of a third best result.

Political instability and polarization create a distortion, in the form of        a

high variance in the composition of public spending. High tax collection

costs   offset this distortion, and hence are socially efficient. 14

      Combining Propositions 1   and   2 yields the following central empirical

implication: Countries with more unstable and oolarjzed political systems

rely more heavily on sei2norae as a source of revenue than more stable and

homozeneous societies. The remainder of this paper tests this positive

implication.


3. The Evidence

      In this section we extent the cross-sectional investigation of Table 2.

Section 1. by adding explanatory variables that refer to the political

system. Each observation corresponds to a time average for a specific

country. Our goal is to estimate an equation of the following general form:

                 sQ+flzj+7p+u                                                (10)


where the subscript refers to country i;       s denotes the level of seignorage
as a fraction of total government revenues (including seignorage); z is a

vector of variables measuring the economic structure of country        i; p is
a vector of political variables designed to capture the degree of instabil-

ity and of polarization of the political system; and      u is an error term.
We are interested in the sign of the estimated coefficient      .i.


      The economic variables are the same as in Table 2.     They account for

economic and structural factors affecting the cost of administering and
                                       13




enforcing tax collection. The measurement of the political variables

presents several difficulties. Even though the notions of political instab-

ility and polarization are conceptually well defined, they do not have an

obvious measurable counterpart. We deal with this problem in the next sub-

section, where we estimate a probit model to obtain a measure of political

instability. We defer the discussion on polarization to subsection 3.3.

Subsection 3.2 provides a general description of the data. The estimation

of equation (10) is carried out in Subsection 3.3. Finally, Subsection 3L4

shows that the results are robust to alternative specifications of the

model, to alternative measurements of some of the variables, and to the

possible presence of errors in variables.

3.1 Measures of political Instability and Polarization

     The theoretical model isolates a central feature of the political

 system: the degree of political instability, defined as the probability of

 a government change as perceived by the current government. This feature is

 unobservable. As a proxy, we construct a measure of political instability

 from the data of Taylor-Jodice (198..      -   These data contain yearly observa-

 tions on regular and irregular (i .. coups) government transfers unsuccess-

 ful coup attempts, executive adjustments, and other political events.

      We proceed as follows. First, we estimate a yearly probit model on

 time series data, or on pooled time series and cross country data, over the

 period 1948-82. At this stage we do not discriminate between regular and

 irregular government changes - -   even    though we do it below, in the cross

 country regressions. The dependent variable takes a value of 0 for the

 years in which there is no government change (regular or irregular),        and a

 value of 1 otherwise, Changes in the composition of the executive are not

 considered to be changes in government.15 The explanatory variables in the
                                       14




probit model fall, in three broad classes: economic variables, designed to

measure the recent economic performance of the government; political

variables, accounting for significant political events that may signal the

imminence of a crisis; and structural variables, accounting for institution-

al differences and country specific factors that do not change, or that

change only slowly over time. These structural variables consist of three

dummy variables that group countries in three categories, according to their

political institutions:   (1.)   democracies; (ii) democracies in which the

election date is determined by the constitution; and (iii) democracies

ruled by a single majoritarian parry. Even though these three groups are

too broad to account for the variety of existing political institutions at

least they discriminate between very different constitutional environments.

All these variables are defined in Table 3A below.

     Table 3B reports the results of the probit regression when all

countries are pooled together in the same data set and a constant dummy for

each country is added. Most variables have the expected sign, even though

only a few are significant. In particular, government change is made more

likely by unusual inflation in the previous year, and by unusually low

growth of private consumption over the current and previous two years.     (As

explained in Table 3A, these variables are measured in deviation from their

country means.) Moreover, riots, political repressions, adjustments in the

composition of the executive, and unsuccessful attempts to change the

government all signal the imminence of a political crisis. Two of the

institutional dummies are significant: democracies have more frequent

government changes than non-democratic regimes. And coalition governments

or minority governments are less stable than majoritarian governments.

Several of the country specific dummies (not reported in the table)    are also
                                       15



significant.    indicating that there are additional factors contributing to

instability of the political system which are not fully captured by our

explanatory variables. These estimates are very robust to changes in the

model specification. This same regression has been estimated on each

country separately (except that the structural variables have been dropped

and all lags of the same variables have been constrained to have the same

coefficient, in order to save degrees of freedom).

     Using the pooled time series-cross country and the country specific

probit regressions, we compute two estimated frequencies of government

change in each country during the period 1971-82. They are obtained by

averaging the estimated probabilities of government change over that time

period. These two estimated frequencies of government change provide two

alternative measures of political instability. We label them P and PS

respectively.

     As a third measure, we also compute the actual frecuencv (F) of

government change. As shown in Maddala (1983, pp. 25, 26), for any logit

regression that includes the intercept, actual and estimated frequencies in

the sample always coincide. Hence the actual frequency also provides a

measure of the expected frequency of government change. As shown in Table

4, these three measures of political instability are highly correlated with

each other. They are also correlated with other measures, estimated from

alternative specifications of the probit model.

     There are two possible sources of error in these estimates. First, they

contain more information than was available to the governments at the time,

since they are estimated form data up to 1982. Second, they omit relevant

information that was available to the governments but is not reflected in our

explanatory variables. Presumably the most important omitted information
                                     Lb




concerns institutional detail not observable or not easy to quantify.

     We deal with the first problem by also estimating the cross country

regressions. equation (10), by instrumental variable methods. As argued in

subsection 3., the chosen instrument is likely to be uncorrelated with this

source of error. We deal with the second problem in subsection 3.5. by

showing that the results are robust to errors in variables.

     Besides political instability, the theoretical model of Section 2

emphasizes the importance of another political variable: the degree of

polarization between the current government and its likely future contenders.

Measuring this form of polarization is a significantly more difficult task.

In the next subsection we discuss the inclusion of variables that may proxy

for it.

     The remainder of the paper investigates whether these measures of

political instability and polarization can explain the facts described in

the Introduction, as predicted by our theory.

3.2 Data Description

     The sample of countries, determined by data availability, is the same

as in Tables 1 and 2. The data sources are described in the Data Appendix.

The variables are averaged over the time period 1971-82, except if otherwise

noted -- see also footnote 3.   In Subsection 3.4 we report the results of

experimenting with other periodizacions.

     The means, variances and simple correlation coefficients of the

relevant economic and political variables are reported in Tables 5A and 53.

It is apparent from these tables that the political variables are not highly

correlated with most of the economic variables (including seignorage). This

may contribute to explain why the results reported below are very robust to

alternative specifications of the cross section regressions and to
                                     17




alternative measures of political instability.

     However, once we control for the effect of the economic variables,

seignorage and political instability are more highly positively correlated.

Table 6 reports the Spearman Rank correlation coefficients between the

various measures of political instability and the residuals of the equations

in Table 2, Section 1. For all measures of political instability and for

all residuals, the rank correlation coefficient is positive. It is often

significant for the measure of instability estimated from the probit regres-

sions. The same is true of the Pearson simple correlation coefficients (not

reported in the table).

     This is prima facie evidence that the predictions of the theory are

consistent with the data. We now turn to a more systematic investigation of

this issue.


3.3 The Cross Country Rezressions

     Table 7 reports the estimates of equation (10) on the cross country

data. In the first three columns, the measure of political Instability

estimated from Table 38,   F,   is added to the explanatory variables in the

first three columns of Table 2. This variable is positive and highly

significant. It remains so even after including dummy variables that group

countries into continents. Compared to Table 2, the estimated coefficients

of these dummies drop significantly and the p.2's improve considerably.

The same results emerge if we replace P with the other two measures of

political instability discussed in the previous subsections, or if we

estimate the equation on developing countries only.16 These results then

provide clear support to our view that, after controlling for structural

variables, countries with a more unstable political system rely more heavily

on seignorage as a source of revenue.17
                                     18




     Our model suggests that the degree to which countries rely on

seignorage not only depends on political instability but also on political.

polarization. A problem with this proposition at the empirical level is

that it is not easy to find indexes of polarization. To tackle this issue

we considered a number of proxies for polarization. We first note that the

variable P in equations (l)-(3) in Table 7 does not discriminate between

regular government changes and those originated by coups. This distinction

however may be important as an indicator of polarization: a government

change taking the form of a coup is likely to be a much more radical change

than one occurring through regular democratic procedures. Hence, according

to our theory, seignorage should be positively related to the expected fre.

quency of coups, even after controlling for other measures of instability.

This prediction is borne out by the regression analysis. In the fourth

column of Table 7, the actual frequency of coups is included among the

explanatory variables. Its estimated coefficient is positive and highly

significant. In equation (5) in Table 7 we further refine the idea that the

frequency of coups captures polarization. There we include the actual

frequency of regular government changes in 1971-82, RF, and the actual

frequency of coups as separate variables. Roth variables have a positive

and significant estimated coefficient. Rut the estimated coefficient of

coups is much larger than that of regular government changes, which is

consistent with the view that in addition to instability the frequency of

coups also proxies for polarization. This provides preliminary evidence

suggesting that both instability and polarization positively affect the

reliance on seignorage.

     Highly polarized societies are also likely to have totalitarian

political systems, in which it is difficult to transfer political power.
                                      19



Democracies   are more likely to be viable in societies with a higher degree

of internal cohesiveness (Usher (1981)). Thus, democracies are likely to

have lower levels of polarization than totalitarian regimes.       Hence our

theory suggests that, controlling for political instability, seignorage

should be larger in more totalitarian countries. To test this conjecture,

we replaced the coups variable in column 4 of Table 7 by a dummy taking a

value of I in democratic regimes, and 0 otherwise; its estimated coefficient

(not reported in the table) is negative and highly significant; it      remains
negative (even though it becomes barely significant) if the coups variable

is also included. In addition to this dummy variable, we also used a rank.

ing of totalitarianism compiled by Freedom House (higher numbers

corresponding to more totalitarian regimes -   - see   the data appendix for

detail). This index of totalitarianism is qualitative, and it does not make

much sense to include it in the regressions as an explanatory variable.18

To overcome this difficulty, we compute the Spearman rank correlation

coefficient between this index of totalitarianism and the residuals of each

of the equations in Table 7. This coefficient, denoted by p at the bottom

of Table 7, is always positive, but almost never significant.

     As an alternative way to capture the role of polarization, we

incorporated in our analysis an index of income distribution as an addition-

al independent variable. To the extent that societies with more unequal

income distribution are more polarized, we would expect them to have higher

seignorage. Unfortunately data on income distribution are available for a

very limited number of countries. In spite of this, an index of income

distribution was constructed for 37 countries. The index is defined as the

proportion of total income received by the 20% richest relative to that

received by the 20% poorest fraction of the population. Thus a higher value
                                    20




of this index indicates a more unequal income distribution. As expected,

for the limited sample of 37 countries, the coefficient of income inequality

turned out to be positive although not significant at conventional levels.19

     Finally, as we noted in the Introduction, the positive and significant

estimated coefficient of urbanization is also an indication that seignorage

is higher in more polarized countries. As remarked by several political

scientists, political conflicts are generally more intense and disruptive in

urban areas than in rural societies.2°

     A possible objection to the results presented in Table 7 is that they

could be due to reverse causality: governments that create excessive

inflation lose popular support, and are more likely, therefore, to be thrown

out of office. Hence, inflation can lead to political instability rather

than the other way around. indeed, the probit estimates of Table 38 indi-

cate that previous inflation, although not significant, reduces the

probability of reappointment.

     One way to cope with this problem would be to jointly estimate a time

series process of seignorage and government changes, along the lines of a

recent study on economic growth and coups by Londregan and Poole (1988).

However, our theoretical model has no predictions for the time series prop-

erties of seignorage. More importantly, even if we account for the effect

of past economic performance on the likelihood of reappointment, political

stability also reflects other, permanent or slowly changing, features of a

political system: political institutions, culture, tradition, underlying

conflicts, cleavage of the population in organized groups, extent of

political participation and involvement of the citizens, are all semi-

permanent features of a country that affect its political stability.
                                     21




     These considerations suggest an alternative line of attack: to

estimate equation (10) by an instrumental variable method. The economic

variables are used as instruments for themselves. And as an instrument for

political instability we use the expected frequency of government change in

the previous decade, estimated by truncating the probit regressions of Table

3B in 1970 and computing the expected frequency in the decade 1960-70. This

variable is highly positively correlated with the estimated frequency for

the period 1971-82, used in Table 7, confirming that political instability

is a semi-permanent feature of a country. The Appendix discusses under what

conditions this instrument is uncorrelated with the error term of (10) ,   for
the 1971-82 period. Essentially, these conditions require that the error

term of (10) not be highly correlated across different decades.

     Besides correcting for a possible simultaneity bias, this instrumental

variable procedure is also likely to correct for one of the two likely

errors in measuring political instability that were mentioned in subsection

3.2. Our estimate of P incorporates more information than was available

 to the governments at the time. Now, this error is corrected because the

 instrument is based on probit estimates up to 1970, and thus excludes any

 information incorporated in P but not available to the governments.

      The results of this instrumental variable estimation are reported in

 Table 8. The first three columns are the analogue of the first three

 columns in Table 7. The results are very similar to those of the previous

 tale. The fourth column adds the dummy variable for democracies (in place

 of the coups frequency which may also be correlated with the error term)

 The results confirm those of Table 7.    Finally, the fifth column replaces

 the estimated probability from Table 3B with that estimated on each country

 separately; the same procedure is used to obtain an instrument. The results
                                         .1 )




are very similar, even though the fit deteriorates and the estimated

coefficients on some of the economic variables become insignificant. This

occurs because the instrument has a low correlation with the variable it      is
replacing. These results too are very robust to alternative specifications

of the model and to alternative measures of political instability.

     Finally to evaluate the relative importance of the different

independent variables, for each regression we computed the standardized
                                  21
estimates of each coefficient.         The results suggest that, for our sample

and time period, political instability is one of the most important vari-

ables affecting seignorage. For example, in equation (I), Table 8, the

following standardized estimates were obtained: agriculture, 0.415; foreign

trade, -0.206; GD? per capita, -0.287; urbanization, 0.466; industrializa-

tion dummy,   -0.571;   political instability, 0.593.

     Summarizing, the data are strongly consistent with the predictions of

the theory: more unstable countries collect a larger fraction of their

revenue in the form of seignorage. Moreover, the evidence is not inconsist-

ent with the view that political polarization also leads to more seignorage.

     We turn now to a systematic analysis of the robustness of these

results, and to a discussion of some possible econometric problems.

3.4 Sensitivity Analysis

     Perhaps the single most important question is whether the previous

findings are robust to possible errors in measuring the explanatory

variables.22 Three :riables in particular are likely to be measured with

error: political instability, GDP per capita and urbanization.23

     To answer this question, we compute consistent bounds on the

coefficient of the variable of interest, political instability. Under the

traditional hypothesis of the errors in variables literature, the true
                                       23




coefficients that maximize the likelihood function of the measured data lie

within these bounds.24

     Our procedure exploits the results of Kiepper and Learner (1984)

First, we estimate the coefficients of each of the three variables that are

measured with error by alternatively interchanging each of them with seig-

forage, thus including seignorage as a regressor. We thus obtain four sets

of estimates for each coefficient, one of which corresponds to that reported

in Table 7. The signs of the various coefficients are the same across the

four steps of estimators. As shown by Klepper and Learner (1984), we can

then conclude that the true maximum likelihood coefficients lie within the

convex hull of these four estimates.

     Table 9 reports the bounds on the coefficient of political instability

for equations (1) and (4) in Table 7; political instability is measured by

the pooled probit estimate, P. In both cases, the lower bound is positive.

Equivalent results are obtained for urbanization and if we measure political

instability in the two other ways discussed in subsection 3.1. We infer

 from this table that the findings of the previous subsection are robust to

 the possibility of measurement error in political instability, urbanization

 and per capita income.

      A second important question is whether the results are robust to

 alternative specifications of the model. We already commented on the fact

 that alternative specifications of the probit model all yield results similar

 to those reported in Tables 7 and 8. In addition, we tried several alterna-

 tive specifications of the cross country regressions, again with no influence

 on the result that seignorage is positively related to political instability.

      Specifically, we changed the economic variables by adding other sectors

 of the economy (manufacturing and mining in isolation), or dropping some of
                                    24




the variables in Table 7. None of this matters for the sign and significance

of the political variables, even though it matters for some of the economic

variables. e also tried adding other social and political variables that may

reflect political polarization. Dropping urbanization matters for some of the

economic variables, but again not for the political variables.

     Je also replaced the dependent variable (change in reserve money scaled

by total government revenue) with three alternative measures of seignorage:

(a) inflation times reserve money at the beginning of the period divided by

the total revenue (including inflation times reserve money) of the central

government;   (b) change in reserve money divided by GNP; (c) change in

reserve money over tax revenues inclusive of the change in reserve money.

All measures yielded the same qualitative results as those described In the

previous subsections.

     The results are also robust to alternative specifications of the sample

of countries. No qualitative change occurs if the industrialized countries

are dropped from the sample (see column 6, Tables 7 and 8), or when other

countries are dropped because of missing data on some of the variables

reported in the previous paragraph. An analysis of the estimated residuals

reveals the presence of five outlier countries.25 When these countries are

dropped from the sample, the results are virtually unchanged. Finally, the

same results emerge if we reestimate the model by averaging the data over

time periods shorter than the 1971-82 interval.

     The White (1980) test on the covariance matrix of the residuals rejects

the hypothesis that there is no heceroscedasticity. However, when the covari-

ance matrix of Table 7 is estimated using White (1980) consistent estimator,

 the t-statistics are not substantially different from those reported in the

 table and all the political variables remain significant.26 In addition, when
                                    25




the equations in Table 7 are reestimated by weighting each observation with

per capita income, the results are virtually unchanged (except for

agriculture that becomes insignificant) and the regression fit improves.


4. Conclusions

     Seignorage is an optimal source of government revenue if there is

widespread tax evasion or in the presence of large tax collection costs.      In

the existing literature, the nature of these costs is left unspecified, or

it is postulated to depend exclusively on exogenous features of a country,

like its stage of development or the structure of the economy. In this

paper we argue that the efficiency of the tax system also reflects deliber-

ate political decisions. In particular, the equilibrium efficiency of the

tax system, and hence seignorage, also depend on political stability and

polarization. The evidence supports this implication: more unstable

countries rely relatively more on seignorage to finance the government

budget than stable and homogeneous societies.

     This empirical finding could have other explanations besides that

advanced in this paper. Political instability for instance could reflect

the fact that the collective decision process is temporarily blocked.

Seignorage would then reflect the inability to reach any policy decision,

rather than being due to costs of enforcing and administering tax collec-

 tions. Alesina-Drazen (1989) have recently studied a theoretical model with

 this property. But their model implies that after the identity of the

weaker party in the struggle over shares is revealed, the use of seignorage

 should subside. It seems therefore that their framework is more appropriate

 for explaining temporary bursts of seignorage whereas our framework is bet-

 ter suited for explaining persistent cross country differences in seignorage
of the type illustrated by the data in Table I.

     Discriminating between these alternative political explanations     is


importaflt since they are likely to have different normative implications.

According to the theory formulated in this paper,   it may be ex ante effic-

ient for a politically unstable and polarized country to maintain an

inefficient tax system: such a system reduces the variance in the structure

of public spending or of redistributive tax policies. Put this normative

conclusion would probably not follow from alternative political explanations

of why countries collect revenue in the form of seignorage.    Further

investigation of these issues promises to be an exciting task for future

research.

      See, for example, Vogel (1974). Fischer (1982) reports substantial
cross country differences in the relative amount of seignorage.

     2See Edwards (1989)

     3For a number of countries data on seignorage are available only for a
subinterval during 1971-82. In this case, the average is taken over the
longest time period within 1970-82 for which data are available. The
countries for which more than 3 years of data are missing are: Trinidad and
Tobago, Cameroon, Botswana, Central African Republic, Chad, Gabon, Cote
d'Ivoire, Lesotho, Mauritania, Niger, Zimbabwe, Ruanda, Somalia, Togo, Papua
New Guinea.

     4The denominator in this ratio is total revenue inclusive of
seignorage. That is, it   is defined as the sum of tax revenue plus money
creation.

     5Alternative ways of measuring seignorage basically provide us with the
same picture. In addition to the measure used in the text we have defined
seignorage as H/E, ,rH/Y, rH/E, where H is high powered money, E are
total government expenditures,  is inflation, and Y is nominal income.

Goode (1984) presents a survey of the more recent literature.

     7Urbanization is the average of two years: 1965 and 1985.

     8The non-developing countries have been defined as those that the IMF
classifies as industrialized, plus Greece, Portugal and Turkey.

     9This same idea is at the core of some recent research that views
public debt as a strategic variable used by the current government to
influence its successors -- see the survey by Persson and Tabellini (1989,
Ch. IX). Rogers (1989) also studies tax reforms in this way.

     10This specification of the economy abstracts from two possible
complications. First, it presumes that neither the government nor the
private sector have access to a capital market. Second, by not explicitly
modelling the distortionary effects of seignorage and regular taxes, it
abstracts from the time-inconsistency problems associated with both
instruments. These two complications have already been extensively
investigated in the literature, and their effects are well known - - see
Persson and Tabellini (1989). Here we neglect them in order to focus on the
novel issue of how the political system of a country governs the evolution
of its taxing institutions.

        Because of the concavity of IJ(.) and the convexity of 6(•) and
-i(•), the second order conditions are always satisfied.

     12Because the Hi(.) function is linear, all the income effects of a
more inefficient tax system fall on public consumption.  If H(.) was
concave, this would no longer be true, and we would need additional
conditions CO sign C'(8) and T'(9).

     13We assume that the second order conditions are satisfied. As in all
optimal taxation problems, this involves some hypothesis on the third
derivatives of U(•) and H(s).
            finding is similar to those of Brennan and Buchanan (1980);
except that here the government is not modelled as a revenue-maximizing
Leviathan, but as ideologically motivated. The source of the political
distortion is not in the nature of the government objectives, but rather in
their instability over time.

     15jodice-Taylor (1983) define a regular government change as a change
in the office of national executive from one leader or ruling group to
another that is accomplished through conventional legal or customary
procedures.
     16The variable P is a generated regressor. As such, our estimates of
the standard errors may be biased in general. However, this problem does
not invalidate the t-statistics for the null hypothesis that the estimated
coefficient of P is zero, since under the null the standard errors are
unbiased -- see Pagan (1984). Since we are interested in testing precisely
this hypothesis, we do not attempt any correction. However, this may be a
problem in interpreting the t-statistics of the remaining variables.

      170f course there is a possibility of reverse causality - -        from
 inflation to instability. Je deal with this issue in Table 8.

      18Doing so results in a positive and barely significant coefficient in
 most regressions.

      19The following is an example of the results obtained when income
 distribution was added to the analysis:

 s —   0.0408 +    0.0010   Mining & Manufacturing -   0.041 Foreign trade
       (0.0388) (0.0012)                               (0.0157)

       (0.52E-5)             (0.0004)                      (0.0326)

   +    0.0723 P   +   0.0011     Income inequality            N2 —
       (0.0594)        (0.0010)                                a   — 0.557

             point of view is stressed for instance in Berg-Sachs (1988) and
 Huntington (1968).

          standardized coefficient is the estimated coefficient divided by
 the size of its standard error.

     22The dependent variable, seignorage as defined in Table 1, is also
most certainly measured with error. However, this fact merely increases the
standard error of the regression, without introducing any bias in the
estimates.

          noted above, the instrumental variable estimation can remove a
component of the error in measuring political instability. But a large
margin of error is likely to remain unaccounted for, since we have little
confidence about the correct specification of the probit regressions.

     24The hypothesis is that the measurement errors are orthogonal to each
other and to the unobserved correctly measured regressors.

     25The outliers are: Portugal, Bolivia, Mexico, Ghana and Uganda.

     26W'hite (1980) estimator does not rely on a formal model of the
structure of heteroscedasticity.

                                            APPENDIX



      This section outlines the identifying assumptions implicit in the

instrumental variables procedure of Section 3.4. According to the

theoretical model, seignorage in country i at time                t should be:          —


              where the function S(9) has been discussed in the text.
S(S
Presumably, the observed data on seignorage also reflect other country and

time specific shocks due to policy mistakes or exogenous events. Thus,


                    s             +
                                      v                                                (Al)

where          is observed seignorage and                 is a shock. For any variable

        let x — 1/12         E971             Thus, x is the average of x. during
the 1971-82 period. We assume that the function S(9) can be approximated

as follows:

                        —     +        + 'i'r + e                                      (A.2)


where x is a vector of observed economic variables that measure the

structure of the economy (the variables in Table 2), .                is   the indicator

of political instability, and e. is an unobserved error term, Combining

(Al) and (A.2), we have:

                        —     + $xi ÷        +                                         (A.3)
                                                 (v+e1)

The null hypothesis is: H0: -y — 0.

        The problem is that               is unobserved. Our two stage procedure can be

described as follows. In the first stage, we assume that                      can be

estimated using a probit procedure from annual data. Thus, we postulate:

                            — prob(0                                                   (A.4)


where         and       are coefficients to be estimated, z. is a vector of
                                        31




observed variables, and u is an error term. Besides observing                          we
                                                                                z.t.
also observe whether or not the inequality in (A.4) holds. The interpreta-

tion is that a government change is triggered by specific realizations of

the explanatory variables in (A.4) or of the error term          u.. By (Al) the
shocks v t-l can       be interpreted as competence shocks, along the lines of

Rogoff-Sibert (1988) and Rogoff (1990): an incompetent government one with
a high v. t-1'    is punished by the voters through a higher probability of

losing   office. This is the first important identifying assumption. It is

not seignorage oer se that causes a government change. It is a higher

seignorage than warranted by the efficiency of the inherited tax system.                In

the empirical implementation of (A.4), we proxy
                                                        v         by the observed

inflation rate in previous years, in deviation from the country specific

mean. The remaining variables corresponding to the vector                   are listed

in Table 3. They, as well as the error term                  are assumed to be

uncorrelated with the error term of (A.3), (v.+e.).

     By estimating the coefficients          and p in (A.4) with a probit

model, we obtain an estimate of jt'                The average of               is thus a

complicated nonlinear function of past values of
                                                                   z and u:
                   —
                       F(vji.zi,uj;      t   —   1948-82).                          (AS)

     In the second stage, we estimate (A.3) by replacing
                                                                   ir.
                                                                         with   .      The

OLS procedure of Table 7 is consistent under the additional identifying

assumption that p — 0      in (A.4). That is, the competence shocks do not

effect the probability of government change. Incidentally, this assumption

is consistent with the findings of Table 3.

     If however p       0, then OLS   estimation    of (A.3) gives inconsistent

estimators, since by (A.5)         and v are correlated with each other. To
                                                32




deal   with this problem. we estimate (A.3) by means of               the   following

instrumental variables procedure. First, we truncate the probit estimation

                         Then, we take the average of the estimated                     over the
of (A.4) in 1970

period 1960-70         Let us denote this average " iS' where the s reminds

us of the different subperiod. We have

                          —                          t   — 1948-70)                        (A 6)


.        is   our instrument for i.I_   .    Clearly,     it is correlated with .1. .     By
 1_s


(A. 6)        it is not correlated with the error term of (A.3) ,             (v+e.)     if v.

is a statistically independent process or, more weakly, if the realizations

of the competence shocks V.,                during   the 1970s are statistically independ-

ent from their realizations during the 1948-70 period.                      This is our second

 identifying assumption. Obviously this identifying restriction remains the

 same if we interpret the vs more broadly as any deviation between s.

 and             rather than just as competence shocks. This assumption is

 consistent with a lot of serial correlation in inflation. By (A.1), this

 serial correlation is due to inertia in the tax system, and hence to the

 variable .,          but   not to the "competence shocks" of the government.

otes: umber of observations: 79. All observations are yearly averages,
          over the period 1971-82.
          p is the estimated frequency of government change obtained from
          Table 3 for the 1971-82 period.
          RF is the actual frequency of regular government transfers in
          1971-82.

          p is the Spearrnan rank correlation coefficient between the estimated
          residuals and the index of Totalitarianism (averaged over 1971-82).
          Standard errors are in parentheses. The numbers inside the
          parentheses below the p estimate give the significance probabiLity
          of the estimate under the null: p — 0.
          An asterisk denotes significance at the 5% confidence level: two
          asterisks at the 1% level.

Notes: Number of observations: 78 (Papua New Guinea became independent
        after 1970 and hence is omitted from this sample)
        Method of estimation: instrumental variables.
        The instrument for F is the estimated frequency of government
        change for the period 1960-70, estimated by truncating the probit
        model in 1970.
        The instrument for F is the actual frequency of government change
        during the period 1960-70.
        P and F are as defined in Table 6. Democracy is defined as in
        Table 3.
        p  is the Spearman rank correlation coefficient between the
        estimated residuals and the index of Totalitarianism (averaged over
        1971-82).

                                                                                          (A.4)


                        T'(9) —             (1+1')(-"u'+(l+')2u) < 0


    Next, differentiate the government budget constraint, equation (1), with
                                               W-2



respect to 9,      recalling that          +
                                                g    —   X(8).   We have:

                        —   -r + S'(9)   +     (l-9)T'(O)                   (A.5)


Inserting A4) and (A.l) in (AS), it can be shown that X(9) < 0.

        Similarly, differentiating the private budget constraint, equation (1),

with respect to 9, we obtain

                  C'(8) —   -(l+8')T'(9)         (l+7')S'(G)                (A6)

Inserting (A.4) and (Al) in (A.6) and simplifying we obtain that

C'(9)   > 0.
