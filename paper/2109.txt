             Real Business Cycles and the Lucas Paradigm


                                    ABSTRACT




      When the   Lucas paradigm is generalized to include real effects, the

 effects of real factors and monetary factors on the business cycle are always

 interrelated. Furthermore, in such models monetary factors can affect the

 long—run behavior or real output, contrary to the commonly held view that they

 cantt. Real business cycle models and Lucas—type models are different

 paradigms not in the sense of real versus monetary, but in the interrelation-

 ships between real and monetary factors intrinsic to the Lucas paradigm as

 contrasted to the dichotomy between real and monetary factors implied by the

 real businss cycle literature.

     Business cycle theory in recent years has tended to stress
the importance of monetary or nominal disturbances. Prominent in
this tradition are models of the type originally proposed by Lucas
(1972, 1973, 1975)) These models have come to be generally
viewed as monetary models, driven by transitory nominal aggregate

demand disturbances. Other recent research views business cycles
as arising from variations in real factors in the economy suct as

shifts in government purchases or tax rates or technical and
environmental conditions [Kydland and Prescott (1982), Long and

Plosser (1983), and King and Plosser (1984)]. These real business
cycle models are proposed as [King and Plosser (1984), p. 378] "a
coherent alternative framework to the monetary theories of the
business cycle advanced by Lucas (1973) and Fischer (1977)."
     However the basic framework of Lucas—type models can be
generalized to include real effects- Our purpose here is to show,

first, that a significant property of this broader class of Lucas--
type models is that real factors in the business cycle cannot be
isolated from monetary                  effects of the two are always
interrelated. (This is a property of this ire of model, but of
course not of models driven solely by real factors such as those
of Kydland and Prescott (1982), Long and Plosser (1983), and King

and Plosser (1984).) Second, another significant property of this
brander class oJ model is that monetary factors can affect the
long—run, or secular behavior of real output via the variability
of                  channel suggested by Friedman (1977), among
others.    This   is contrary to ". . .a commonly held view that
monetary   disturbances should have no permanent effects on real
                                                                  2


output, and thus disturbances that are of a permanent nature must
he associated with real rather than monetary sources (King and

Plosser, 1984, p. 374)—--the view underlying the statistical
analysis of macroeconomic time series in Nelson and Plosser

(1982), for example. More generally we demonstrate here that real
business cycle models and Lucas—type models are different

paradigms not in the sense of real versus monetary, but rather in
the interrelationships between real and monetary factors :intrinsiC

to the Lucas paradigm in contrast to the dichotomy between real
and monetary factors implied by the real business cycle
literature.
     In section I we specify the generalized form of the Lucas—
type framework used in our analysis. Section II shows how
monetary and real factors are interrelated in the determination of
transitory, or cyclical, real output behavior, while section III
indicates how monetary, as well as real, factors affect the long—

run behavior of real output in this generalized framework.

Section IV concludes the paper.



I. The Paradigm c'Jith Both Real and Monetary Factors

     The familiar Lucas (1973) model is driven by nominal
:Iigregate demand. This :;ction presents a generalized Lucas—type
model that includes real factors as well. The monetary factor in
the business cycle still enters via the demand side, though not

exclusively; in addition teal factors now come in through the

supply side, though again not exclusively. We emphasize at the
                                                                    3
outset   that there are other ways to generalize this framework and
that there have been previous versions of the Lucas iiodei that
include real factors [e.g. Barro (1976), Cukiermari (1982), Froyen
and Waud (1984)]. The particular model developed here merely
serves to elucidate the interrelationships between real and

monetary factors present in the Lucas paradigm but absent in real
business cycle models.

       Following the tradition of the incomplete information

paradigm, we assume that the economy consists of a large number,

ni, of "scattered, competitive markets." We derive output supply
schedules for each of these markets, and then specify the demand

schedules, along with expectations formation. Then the reduced
form aggregate output equation for this economy is derived.


l.A. arket supply Equations
       Individual market supply equations are derived from factor
demand equations for a resource input (such as a raw material or

energy input) and a labor input, as well as labor supply functions
at the individual market level. The supply equations are short
run because the capital stock is taken to be given. The derived
factor demand equations take the following form:
                                                                             4

                                              Kt(v)




where v indexes the market and for each market,

     Qt(v) =     quantity   of resource input

     Nt(v)       number of labor hours

     Pt(v) =     market—specific product price
     Wt(v) =     market—specific money wage
             =   market—specific price of resource input
     Kt(v)       quantity of capital


where all variables are in logs.

     The factor demand equations (1) are derived in the usual way

by assuming that firms maximize profits subject to the production
function constraint. The log linearity of (1) would follow either

from the assuming that the production function is Cobb—Douglas or,
more genera]. !.y, as an approximation to factor demand equations

based on production functions of the generalized CES type (see R.

Sato [1972]).
     It is assumed that labor suppliers know the market-specific

money wage, Wt(v). but must form an expectation of the economy—
                                                                          5



wide aggregate price level Pt (conditioned on information in
market v) .      Labor suppliers are further assumed to be risk averse
and to maximize expected utility received from income and leisure.
It can be shown that expected utility maximization gives a

specification for labor supply that can be approximated by the
log-linear function.2



        Nt(v) = d0 +   dipt   +
                             d2Wt(v) + dcr                         (2)

          2
where         is the variance of aggregate price and the
formulation of the expected price p will be modeled below.

According to (2) labor supply is an increasing function of the
expected real wage (d1 < 0,       d > 0),   assuming that the
substitution effect from a change in the expected real wage

dominates any income effect. A change in the variance of
aggregate price can be shown (see Evans (1978) or Snow. and Warren
(1986)) to have an
ambiguous effect on the quantity of labor supplied (d3          0); the
direction of the effect can be shown to depend on workers'
relatjve risk aversion.

    When (2) is used to substitute Wt(v) out of (1) we can
express the quantities of labor and the resource input as

functions of the product price, the expectation of the aggregate

specific real output, and x. is economy—wide aggregate demand
taken to be nominal income. Demand is unit elastic as in Lucas
(l973). The market—specific and economy—wide demand shocks,

zt(v) and x,            are   assumed to be distributed as follows:4

           Zt(v)      N(O, o)                                                       (6)

           The information conditioning expectations in market v is the

current market specific product price pt(v), the distributions of
market specific and aggregate demand shocks, zt(v) and
respectively, and the lagged values of aggregate demand. The

expectation of the economy—wide aggregate price p is modeled
consistent with the way actual aggregate price is determined in
the model. This expectation is given by

             =
                   (i—e)pt(v)    + apt                                              (8)


where Pt is the expectation of aggregate price conditioned on

information prior to time period t, i.e., conditioned on available
aggregate information, and a is a function (to be explained below)
of the variances of market specific and aggregate demand shocks as
                                                                           8

well as other variances and parameters to be introduced below.

There is a separate equation (8) for each market, conditioned on

the individual Pt(v). The assumption that the expectation of
aggregate price is conditioned on information prior to period t
implies that the aggregate resource input price is not observed
contemporaneously. For some kinds of resources there might be
contemporaneous observations of their aggregate price——crude oil
for example.5 The implications of allowing, the aggregate resource
input price to be observed contemporaneously will be discussed
below.

     To find p we first equate market supply, equation (4),
and demand, equation (5), and assume      =            which means
that a proportional increase in product price and the prices of
each of the two variable factors of production leaves desired
output unchanged. We then eliminate P1 from the resulting
equation by use of equation (8) and obtain the equilibrium

     Next we make the following assumptions about resource input

prices


           =    +                                                   (10)

 and, quite generally,


         =          +   (t)   + Ut                                        (11)

the resource input price would move proportionally with the price
level, aside from the other factors in (11). If )..            1 it   can be
shown that anticipated changes in aggregate demand would, by
affecting the price level, have an effect on the relative price of
the resource input and thereby affect real output. This provides

a channel by which anticipated aggregate demand changes affect
real output. An alternative way for anticipated aggregate demand
;hangod to have rea. effects is to introduce labor contracts as in
Fischer (1977) and Taylor (1980). In the ensuing discussion we
assume X =   1   because the anticipated versus unanticipated issue is
riot pertinent t:o our concerns in this paper. For the same reason,
we do riot extend the model to include labor contracts. Our
                                                                                      10

concern is with the interrelationship between monetary and. real

factors (either anticipated or unanticipated) in explaining the
behavior of real output.

       Using assumptions (6), (7), (10), (11), (12), and (13),
aggregating (9) across markets gives

underpinnings of such an aggregation procedure see appendix A,

p. 607, of Cukierman and 7achtel [1979]). Taking the expectation

of p. conditional on information through period t-1 gives the
expression for p.

IC. gggate Output
       To derive the aggregate output equation we proceed as
follows. Using the assumption that              =          +
                                                    -(62       83)1
substituting for p. from (8) and for             from the expression Just
derived, the market-specific supply equation (4) can be rewritten


      Yt(v) =

               +               —
                   83(q(v)         pt(v))+84Kt(v)+65                             (4')



Now   rewrite the expression for P(v) by substituting x.       +

       into (5). Also substitute (11) for    in (10), assuming X
                                                                            11
1.       Then substituting these expressions for Pt(v) and q(v) into

(4t)     and aggregating the i'esulting equation for Yt(v) across
markets (again see appendix A of Cukierman and Wachtel [1979J)

gives aggregate output t as

II.        tyCyclical Effects of Monetary and Real Factors
      This section shows how monetary and real factors are
interrelated in the determination of transitory, or cyclical, real

output behavior in this Lucas-type, limited information paradigm.
Section III considers how monetary factors, as well as real, play
a role in the secular behavior of real output.

      The coefficients in (14) are functions of supply equation
parameters (the s) and the parameter $ which characterizes the
information structure of the model. That is, e can be shown (see

appendix, section A.II) to be a function of the variances of
economy—wide and market--specific disturbances


                                                                    (15)

where A=(1—82e)2 and B=(1_82e_83)2. While (15) is not an explicit
expression for e, it can be shown by use of the implicit function

theorem (see appendix, section A.II) that o is an increasing
funci:ion of the ii     t'ket—specific variances (2 and    and a
decreasing function of the variances of the aggregate demand arid

resource input price distu.H'ances         and o-, respectively).
Since e is a funct:ion of t:hse variances, the coefficients in (14)
                                                                  13

which contain $ also depend on the market—specific and aggregate

variances. Specifically, the coefficient on (xt — 6) which
characterizes the output response to a nominal aggregate demand
shock (a monetary factor) and that on     which characterizes the
output response to a resource input price shock (a real factor)
depend on market—specific and aggregate variances of both monetary
and real shocks.



II.A.1 Output_Response to Nominal Agggte Demand Shocks
     Examination of the coefficient —82e/(1—2e) on (xt—6) in
(14) indicates that the response of real output to nominal
aggregate demand shocks is a declining function of the variability
of such shocks, the variance , and an increasing function of the

va'iabi.lity of market--specific demand disturbances, the variance
    (since a rise in    lowers e while a rise in     increases
a, as described above) a familiar result analogous to that in

previous Lucas—type models. When the framework is extended to
include a resource input price shock, it is apparent from
inspection of the coefficient on (xt—&) in equation (14) that the
real output response to a nominal aggregate demand shock is also a
declining function of the variability of aggregate resource input
peice shocks (the variance ),, a real factor, and an increasing
function of the variability of market—specific resource price
shocks (the variance ), also a real factor (since a rise in
   lowers e while a rise in o- increases e). Hence in the
                                                                         14

extended Lucas—type framework the real output response to nominal

aggregate   demand shocks, a monetary      factor, is a function of the
variability   of both monetary (nominal) and real factors-—
specifically, the variability of both        nominal demand and real
supply—side shocks.

     The economic interpretation of this result is expedited by
reference to aggregate demand and supply curves in aggregate

price—output space. Increases in the variability of either
aggregate real or nominal shocks (relative to the variability of
market—specific shocks) will cause the aggregate supply curve to
become more steeply sloped with the effect that a given aggregate

demand shock, represented by a horizontal shift in the aggregate

demand curve along the aggregate supply curve, will cause output
to change less. Increases in either aggregate demand or aggregate
supply shock variability cause agents to attribute a larger
portion of any price movement in their market to a change in the

aggregate price level and therefore they change output less in

response.



II.A.2 Output Response to Resource pFrice Shocks
     Examination   of the coefficient 83/(1_820)            in (14) shows
thrit: the response oi real. output   to   an aggregate resource input
price shock, a real factor, is an increasin2 function of the
variability
of the nominal aggregate demand shock, the variance O, a monetary
factor, and a decreasing function of the variability of the
                                                  2
                                                                     15

market—specific demand shock, the variance ,     (again,   because

a rise in      lowers e while arise in     increases e). The
coefficient also indicates that the response is an increasing

function of the variability of aggregate resource input price
shocks, the variance tr2, and a decreasing function of the

variability of market—specific resource input price shocks,
the variance r, (again, because of the effects on 8 noted
above) .    Thus in the extended Lucas—type framework the real

output response to aggregate resource input price shocks, a
real factor, is a function of both monetary (nominal) and real

factors. Again in terms of aggregate demand and supply curves,
increases in the variability of aggregate resource input price
shocks (relative to the variability of market specific shocks)
will cause the aggregate supply curve to become more steeply
sloped with the effect that a given aggregate resource input price

shock, represented, by a horizontal shift in the aggregate supply
curve along the aggregate demand curve, will cause output to
change more.1° The intuition for this is as follows. Individual
firms lower output in response to an increase in the resource

input price. (The market—specific supply curves therefore shift
left.) As all firms cut back output, prices in all markets rise.

The positive output response to Lhis price rise (the movement up
the leftward shifted supply curve) will be smaller the higher the

variances of either aggregate demand or supply shocks (that is,
the steeper the supply curves).
                                                                      16

II.A.3 The Role of Second Moments
     The presence of the variances of both monetary (nominal) and
real shocks in the coefficients on (xt_6) and            in (14) is what
makes it impossible to attribute the behavior of real output to

separately identifiable monetary and real factors. If we define a
gven regime as a period of time when ,
                                              cT,   o,   and   and hence
o and the coefficients on     and Ut are unchanged, it might be•
argued that the transitory movements in real output y. can be
separately attributed to either the monetary or the real shock—--to
either     or Ut in (14). However even this interpretation cannot
ignore the fact that the given magnitudes of the second moments of
both monetary and real shocks will determine the size of the
coefficients on     and u., and hence the degree of the response
of real output y to any given monetary or real shock.
     In particular it is interesting to observe that the greater
the variability of nominal aggregate demand shocks (),         a
monetary factor, the larger will be the impact on real output of

an aggregate input price shock U, a real factor. On the other
hand, the greater the variability of aggregate input price shock

(cr2), a real factor, the smaller the impact on real output of a
nominal aggregate demand shock        a monetary factor, as
xp1ained above.


 I B P   sis                     ies s ycle
    To this point our discussion has focused on the single—
period effects of real and monetary (nominal) shocks. But
                                                                      17

business cycles exhibit multi-period persistence. A legitimate
criticism o1    equation   (14) as it stands is that it contains no
mechanism for generating such persistence. There are however
several ways in which persistence can arise in a Lucas—type
framework. Here we briefly note these and show specifically how
persistence could arise in     (14).
       Lucas (1973) introduced such persistence by appealing to
adjustment lags, which would be represented by the inclusion of
the lagged value of the dependent variable in (14).      Sargent
(1979, Chapter XVI) constructs a model where persistence of the
effects of aggregate demand shocks emerges endogenously due to
costs of adjustment in the labor input. Along a somewhat
different line, persistence of the effects of aggregate demand
shocks in f,ucas (1975) is due to information lags combined with an

accelerator effect: on investment. Within the models of Fischer
(1977) and Taylor (1980), the existence of long—term contracts
provides an additional reason for the persistence of the effects

of nominal aggregate demand shocks. Blinder and Fischer (1981)
are able to induce persistence in the effects of aggregate demand

shocks by use of gradual inventory adjustment. In Cukierman
(1982) persistence is caused by the inability of economic agents
to   dist1ngush beteon perminent- and transitory shocks. Both
inventory    adjustment and confusion between permanent and
transitory   shocks   induce persistence in the model of Brunner,
Cukierman,and   Melt:zer (1983).
                                                                             18

         Another possible source of persistence is introduced if there

is   serial correlation in the aggregate resource input price shock
         For example, suppose the input price shock u. is specified

as


         Ut
              =
                  Put_i   + Ct,      1   >   p > 0                        (16)


c'Jith   this modification, the term containing Ut        Ofl the   right hand
                                                     12
side     of (14) would be replaced by




         83 u1 +                             t                            (17)
                              i82e
                          2


         In   contrast to nominal aggregate demand shocks, (17) implies
that for an aggregate input price shock both the anticipated and

unanticipated components will affect real output (because input
price shocks are relative price shocks and therefore not neutral).

The anticipated component, in addition to its direct effect on

output, will also increase labor suppliers' expectation of the

aggregate price level with consequent upward pressure on the money
wage and, therefore, a further effect on output. Note that while
the impact of the anticipated component of (17) is not a function
of the variances of the real and monetary shocks, that of the

unanticipated component still is by virtue of the presence of .13

         The expanded vers;ion of Le Lucas—type paradigm represented
by (14) admits a long—run role for monetary, as well as real

factors, Our discussion is expedited by separating equation (14)
into those variables which cause cyclical or transitory
fluctuations in output,                               consisting of the stationary
variables, and those nonstationary variables which affect the
long—run, or natural rate of output,                                  It   is quite reasonable
to assume that the capital stock follows a nonstationary process,
and that the variance of the price level, T2, is also

nonstationary to the extent that it is subject to periodic regime
shifts.14 Breaking up (14) in this way we have


                                .                                                      (18)

     According to (19) the long-run or natural rate of output is a
function of the real factors represented by the time trend

component q,(t) of the aggregate resource input price, given by
(11), and the capital stock        It is also a function of the

variance of the aggregate price level cr which, by (21) is a
function of the variance of nominal aggregate demand disturbances

    a monetary factor, and the variance of the resource input
price disturbances cr2, a real factor, as well as e which is a

nonlinear function (see (15)) of aggregate and market—specific
variances, representing both monetary and real factors.

III.A Conventional Views on Long-Run Monetayjacto
     It is Consistent with conventional views that real factors
are a determinant of the long—run or natural rate of output, as is
the case in (19) .   However it is not conventional to view monetary
factors as playing a long-run role in the familiar Lucas—type
incomplete information model. As Nelson and Plosser (1982, p.

139) observe, somewhat more generally:



          It is common practice in macroeconomics to
          decompose real variables such as output, and
          sometimes nominal variables, into a secular or
          growth component and a cyclical component. In
          the case of output, the secular component is
          viewed as being in the domain of growth theory
          with real factors such as capital
          accumulation, population growth, and
          technological change as the primary
          detc.'minants.
                                                                    21

        In the expanded Lucas—type framework derived here we see

that, contrary to this common vLw, monetary factors do play a
role in the determination of the long—run or natural rate of

output, indicated in (19) by the presence of      as defined by

(21).       entered the model in the derivation of equation (2),
via maximization of expected utility under the assumption that
workers are risk averse, as previously noted. As we emphasized
at the outset, one of our objectives was to illustrate how

generalization of the Lucas—type incomplete information
paradigm can give rise to a long—run (nontransitory) role for
monetary factors. Our derivation is merely illustrative—-other
variations on this generalization would likely yield this
result.


111.8. Price Level Variability and       gime Change
        The idea that variability in the aggregate price level or
the inflation rate has long--run effects on the level of output
has been suggested and examined by a number of economists.15

Marshall (1886) and Keynes (1924) suggested a relationship between
output and aggregate price y)6 Friedman (1977) and
Okun (1981) have hypothesized a relationship between price
variability and output or employment. In Friedman's view price
variability affects the natural rate of output partly through the

creation of price uncertainty, but perhaps through broader
channels as well.17'18 Tests of Friedman1s hypotheses such as
those by Levi and Makin (1980), MuJ.lineaux (1960), Makin (1982),
and Froyen and Waud (1987), have employed measures of price
                                                                       22

uncertainty,   relying on the close relationship between variability

and uncertainty, while Froyn and Waud (1984, 1985) have tested
the Friedman hypothesis using a variability measure (see also the

closely related study by Evans (1983)). The evidence from these
studies tends to support the notion that price uncertainty and/or

variability affects the long—run or natural rate of output.
       It might be argued that the role of the monetary factor as a
determinant of the natural rate via (21) and the presence of cr in
(19) are only important when there is a regime shift. In this
regard one would be concerned to identify changes in the
variability of the aggregate price       level. The behavior of
the   wholesale price index in the United Kingdom and the United
State, shown in Charts 1 and 2, suggests that such regime
shifting does exist)9


IV. Conclusion

       The view that the Lucas-type incomplete information paradigm

is essentially a monetary model of the business cycle is an

unnecessarily narrow view. The framework can be generalized to
include real factors as well. Significantly, such generalization

gives rise to models in which real factors cannot be isolated from

moni:;ry   factorc; In I-he bu iness   oycle   the   two always have
interrelated  effects on the transitory or cyclical behavior of
real output. Moreover, monetary factors can affect the secular
behavior of rca]. output through their effect on the variability of
the   aggregate price level in such models.20 Within this expanded

Lucas—type framework, one can not attribute long—term changes in
real output solely to real   factors.   Finally, the contrast between
real business cycle models and Lucas—type models can be seen not

in terms of real versus monetary, but rather as a contrast between
the interrelationships between real and monetary factors

intrinsically present in the Lucas paradigm but absent from real
business cycle models.

     tOther models in this tradition include Barro (1976), Fischer
(1977), and Taylor (1980), where in the latter two models labor
contracts are a key feature.

           is shown for example in Evans (1978) and in Snow and
Warren (1986). Tax and/or transfer variables might also be
included in the labor supply function. This would open up an
additional channel through which real variables (e.g., the
marginal tax rate) could affect real output. Azariadis (1981) has
shown how the second moments of both nominal and real disturbances
can affect the labor—leisure decision in a two—period overlapping
generations model.

     31n this model aggregate demand x is nominal in the sense
that all shocks (i.e., x..) represent shifts in a rectangular
hyperbola in price-real output space; that is, they represent
shifts (or changes) in total nominal expenditures. Of course, in
more complicated models real factors (for example, real government
spending) can also affect aggregate demand.
     This simple specification does preclude several channels by
which price uncertainty might affect aggregate demand. In
particular, in models where there is outside money, or if
government bonds are part of net wealth, then wealth effects
associated with price uncertainty may play a role.
     4
       It should be noted that the mean  of     could be a
function of time without changing the ensuing analysis in any
significant way.

     5Some resource input prices (for example, import prices) can
be observed only with a lag or with error. (An example of the
latter would be newspaper reports of "the" price of oil). It is
these kinds of cases that motivate the specification in the text.

     6More complicated specifications for the behavior of    are
of course possible, a point which we will return to below.
     7Alternatively, we could specify a less than perfectly
elastic resource input supply function, subject to stochastic
shocks, without affecting our central conclusions.

     8For simplicity, the capital stock is assumed to be fixed in
our analysis. Effects on the stock of capital are clearly a
channel by which real factors affect real output. Additionally
there may be other shocks to the production function in the form
of technological change; see for example Kydland and Prescott
(1982), Long and Plosser (1983), and King and Plosser (1984).
     9As noted earliei, we have assumed that the aggregate
resource input price is not contemporaneously observable. We also
have considered the case where the aggregate resource input price
is contemporaneously observable. In our model, as in Blinder
(1981), observing the aggregate resource input price is riot the
same as observing the real shock u., see (11), so there is still a
signal extraction problem even when the aggregate resource input
price is contemporaneously observable——neither Pt nor     are
directly observable. Consequently eien with this modified version
of (14) the output response to changes in u,, via the coefficient
n ' still     depends on ratios of variances of market—specific and
aggregate real and nominal shocks, though in a more complex manner
than in (14) . A case where a, or its analogue, would not appear
in the coefficient on     would be where real shocks themselves
were directly observable. For more on the implications of
contemporaneous aggregate information in the Lucas—type framework
see King (1981).
     10Note however that the impact of the resource input price
shock is smaller in the incomplete information case than when
there is full information, in which case the aggregate supply
curve is vertical (since the coefficient on    becomes 83 > 83/(1
826)
     An examination of data measuring either energy price or
import price shocks, as proxies for the resource input price, for
the 1957—1980 period for the United States suggests a significant
pattern of first—order autocorrelation in ut——see FroyerL and Waud
(1983).
            the aggregate resource input price shock given by
(16), the lagged value of that input price now conveys information
about the current input price, and therefore about the current
aggregate price level. The equation for Pt must be recomputed
taking account of this fact. The expression for a now contains cr
instead of    .  The modified form of (14) containing the
expression (17) is not derived simply by substituting (16) into
(14).

      131f the capital stock were allowed to vary in (14), an
additional source of persistence of output movements could be the
time—to—build requirement considered by Kydland and Prescott
(1982) .  Persistence of output movements occurs in the model of
Long and Plosser (1983) via shocks to the production function.
        14Technological change could also come in through the natural
rate.

     15Within the model derived here, since the lagged value of
the price level is given, the variance of the inflation rate can
be shown to equal the variance of the aggregate price level.
     '6As expressed by Marshall (1886, p. 9) a century ago, "A
great cause of the discontinuity of industry is the want of a
certain knowledge as to what a pound is going to be worth a short
time hence."
     11Okun (1981) argued, along somewhat different lines, that
increased variability of aggregate demand would both steepen the
Phillips curve and cause the curve to shift upwards, increasing
the "inflation rate associated with the cycle average unemployment
rate."

     18More formally rigorous models developed by Azariadis (1981)
and Stultz and Wasserfallen (1985) also show how the behavior of
nominal magnitudes such as the money supply can affect the trend
or natural growth rate of output.
     19A. C. Harvey (1985) examines five of the same time series
previously examined by Nelson and Plosser (1982)—-real GNP,
Industrial Production, Unemployment Rate, Consumer Prices, and
Common Stock Prices. Harvey concludes among other things that the
properties of the series over the 1948—1970 period are "very
different;" from the properties of the same series before 1948.
Froyen and Waud (1980) find evidence of significant regime shifts
in aggregate price variability between the periods 1957-1966 and
1967-1976 in Great Britain, the United States, and several other
industrialized countries. Froyen and Waud (1987) also find
evidence of substantial shifts in a measure of price uncertainty
for Canada, Great Britain, and the United States during the 1970s
and early 1980s. Cukierman and Wachtel (1979) found evidence of
several shifts in a survey—based measure of expected inflation
over the 1947—1975 period in the United States.
     20We have estimated models of this type [Froyen and Waud
(1984, 1985)1 for the United Kingdom and the United States.
Bernanke (1983) estimates a model for the U.S. in the Great
Depression period which combines elements of the Lucas incomplete
paradigm together with a real factor (disintermediat.ion due to the
financial collapse).

A.II Expectations Formation
     We now derive the optimal expectation of the aggregate price
given by (8), and show how e is a function of the market—specific demand

and resource price variances (o—2 and o- respectively), the aggregate

demand and resource price variances (o-2 and o- respectively), and the
parameters '2 and 133. The information conditioning the expectation                          t
in market v is assumed to be the current market. product price Pt(v) and

the disiributions given by (6), (7), (12) and (13). The optimal

expectation of the aggregate price p conditioned on this information is
then given by (see for example Hogg and Craig, pp. 211-13, Introduction
to Mathematical Statistics, Macmillan, New York, 1959).

Substituting (9 ) and (9' ) for Pt(v) and t respectively and using (10)

that the variance of market—specific price about the aggregate price
depends upon the variance of the market—specific demand disturbance and
the variance of the market-specific resource input price disturbance, as
well as the aggregate resource price and demand variances (via 0).
Substituting (ii) and (iv) into (iii) gives

Since

and therefore, since E(pt(zt(v)_1331h(v))] = 0,

Hence

Letting      a =

reasonable values of '2 and 83. Hence from (vii), (viii), and (ix) it
follows that
