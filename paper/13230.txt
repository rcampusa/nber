Legal rules governing the employer-employee relationship are many and varied. Economic analysis
has illuminated both the efficiency and the effects on employee welfare of such rules, as described
in this paper. Topics addressed include workplace safety mandates, compensation systems for workplace
injuries, privacy protection in the workplace, employee fringe benefits mandates, targeted mandates
such as medical and family leave, wrongful discharge laws, unemployment insurance systems, minimum
wage rules, and rules requiring that employees receive overtime pay. Both economic theory and empirical
evidence are considered.

       In a modern economy, individuals usually rely on paid work to meet their basic material

needs. The present paper is concerned with the economic analysis of laws governing this

ubiquitous employer-employee relationship. Such laws have proliferated in both number and

scope across nations, and economic analysis of these laws’ desirability and effects has

accordingly attracted significant attention.

       Within a pervasively unionized economy, the body of what is referred to in the United

States as “labor law” plays an important role in regulating the employer-employee relationship.

This body of law governs the practices and treatment of labor unions. In countries with only

moderate levels of unionization, however, the central responsibility for legal regulation of the

employer-employee relationship falls to what is referred to in the United States as “employment

law.” Employment law governs the treatment of individual employees regardless of their union

status. Areas of regulation include workplace safety and privacy, employee fringe benefits,

workplace leave, job security, and the payment of wages. The present paper is concerned with

the economic analysis of these employment law rules.

       An obvious but critical starting point in the economic analysis of employment law is that

legal regulation of the treatment of employees typically takes place against the backdrop of a

market relationship. This market relationship often imposes significant limits on the prospects

for using employment law purely for the purpose of transferring power, wealth, or other

entitlements to employees – although employment law is often enacted with such motives as the

law’s declared purpose. In the area of mandated leave from employment, for instance, if

employment law seeks to better employees’ situation by specifying minimum entitlements to

leave from work, it is possible that the end result will be to worsen employees’ situation as

wages or employment levels adjust in response to the new legal requirements. Because of the




                                                                                                   1
way in which the market constrains the prospects for using employment law purely to effect

transfers of resources, the economic analysis of employment law in this paper gives primary

emphasis to market failures in the employer-employee relationship. In the presence of a market

failure, legal intervention through employment law may both enhance efficiency and make

employees better off.

       This paper situates the major areas of employment law within this market-failure analytic

framework; importantly, it also identifies certain areas in which legal intervention may help

targeted employees even in the absence of market failure (sections VI and IX below). At the

broadest level, the paper seeks to describe both theoretically and empirically the degree to which

major forms of legal regulation of the employer-employee relationship may enhance efficiency

and make employees better off. Section I of the paper briefly presents the basic framework used

throughout much of the paper. Sections II-X consider specific areas of employment law,

including workplace safety regulation, privacy protection in the workplace, fringe benefits

mandates, targeted mandates such as medical and family leave, wrongful-discharge laws,

minimum wage requirements, and rules requiring overtime pay. A separate chapter of the

Handbook of Law and Economics (chapter 18, by John Donohue) considers antidiscrimination

requirements in employment law and other domains such as housing and education.



                                       I.     Framework

       As suggested above, the analysis in this paper rests on the assumption that employment

law operates to regulate market relationships between employers and employees. Obviously, it

is possible to organize an economy in which wages and conditions of employment are set not by




                                                                                                 2
private actors in employment markets but instead by a central planner; such non-market settings

would naturally require a different analysis.

       Within a market setting, when wages and conditions of employment are determined by

the interaction of labor supply and labor demand, legal intervention not tied to an identified

market failure will often, although not always, reduce both efficiency and employee welfare

(section I.A). However, a number of important market failures may characterize the employer-

employee relationship (section I.B).



A.     Employment law in the absence of market failure

       Most of the rules of employment law considered in this paper reflect the imposition of a

legally prescribed term governing the conditions of work into the parties’ employment contract.

This subsection describes the typical effects of such rules in the absence of market failure.

Section VI below shows how the analysis differs for rules that target the work conditions of

discrete, identifiable subgroups of employees. Note that the framework described here does not

apply to the rules establishing minimum wage and overtime pay requirements or to the rules

governing discharge of employees because these forms of legal regulation directly operate on the

wage or employment level in the regulated employment markets rather than on the conditions of

work; these forms of legal regulation are covered separately in sections VII - X below.

       In speaking of legally prescribed terms within a contract, it is important to distinguish

between mandatory and default terms. Mandatory terms are ones that cannot be changed by the

parties even if they express a desire to do so. For instance, if the Occupational Safety and Health

Act (OSHA), which regulates workplace safety in the United States, requires that a particular

safety measure be adopted, employers and employees may not avoid the requirement simply by




                                                                                                   3
agreeing through contract that it does not apply. Default terms, by contrast, are terms that apply

unless the parties reach a contrary agreement. Most employment law rules are mandatory rules,

and the analysis to follow assumes that the rule in question is a mandatory one. The specific

employment law rules discussed in the reminder of this paper are all mandatory ones.

       The legally prescribed terms that employment law specifies for the employer-employee

relationship typically require employers to provide something of value – a safer workplace;

privacy; certain fringe benefits; leaves from work in specified circumstances – to employees.

Accordingly, within a simple labor supply and demand framework with no market failure of any

sort, these rules will produce a downward shift in the labor supply curve by the amount of the

value of the mandated benefit and a downward shift in the labor demand curve by the amount of

the cost of the mandated benefit (Summers 1989). These effects are depicted graphically in

Figure 1.

       Within this simple framework, it is obvious that the effects of a particular employment

law rule on efficiency and employee welfare turn on the relative magnitude of the labor supply

and labor demand shifts. If the downward shift in the labor supply curve (S° to S' in Figure 1) is

less than the downward shift in the labor demand curve, then the wage will fall by more than the

value of the legally mandated benefit to employees in the employment market in question, and

employment (and, with it, efficiency and employee welfare) will fall (Figure 1, top panel). If, by

contrast, the downward shift in the labor supply curve is larger than the downward shift in the

labor demand curve, then the wage will fall by less than the value of the legally mandated benefit

to employees, and employment (and with it, efficiency and employee welfare) will rise (Figure 1,




                                                                                                     4
bottom panel). But if that were the case, then, given the assumed lack of any form of market

failure, employers would have offered the benefit without any need for a legal mandate. 1

       Thus, in the absence of market failure, employment law rules will generally reduce both

efficiency and employee welfare. However, employment markets may fail for a variety of

reasons. Section I.B below describes the most commonly discussed market failures in the

employer-employee relationship.



B.     Market failures in the employer-employee relationship

       As described above, market failures provide an organizing paradigm for the analysis of

many major areas of employment law. A number of market failures may occur in the employer-

employee relationship, as described below.



       1.      Information failures

       Of central importance in the employment setting are possible information failures.

Information failures occur when some market participants lack information that bears upon their

decisions in that market. In employer-employee relationships, both parties may suffer from

information failures.




1
  This analysis assumes that there is no binding legally specified minimum wage in the employment
market in question. At least in the United States, the minimum wage is sufficiently low in most
jurisdictions that it is not binding in most employment markets. With a binding minimum wage (meaning
the market wage is near or below the legally prescribed minimum wage) the effects of legally mandated
terms would be felt in employment levels rather than wages.


                                                                                                    5
               a.      Employee-side information failures

       Some aspects of the employment relationship are likely to be relatively transparent to

employees. Wages, for instance, are an aspect of the relationship about which employees will

usually have good information. By contrast, the magnitude of the risk of long-term occupational

disease is something about which employees will often not be well informed.

       Employee-side information failures may be modeled in two distinct ways. One

possibility is that employees with limited information are aware of their informational limits and

take rational steps in response to those limits. As described below, this type of modeling

assumption is often adopted in analyzing employer-side information failures. A second

possibility is that employees with limited information either are not aware of their informational

limits or do not change their behavior in response to such awareness. This is the usual modeling

assumption adopted in analyzing employee-side information failures and is the assumption used

in this paper for analyzing such information failures.

       If employees are unaware of some aspect of the employment relationship that would

affect their willingness to supply labor, then observed labor supply will differ from employees’

“true” willingness to supply labor. In the case of workplace safety, for instance, employees may

lack adequate information about risks and harms and, as a result, may oversupply labor at a given

wage rate. In terms of Figure 1 above, the labor supply curve is shifted toward S', and

employees behave as if their workplace were covered by an employment term fostering safety

even though it is not. In such cases, the information failure means that some transactions that

take place are inefficient – because the cost of supplying labor (measured by S° in Figure 1) in

these transactions exceeds the marginal revenue product of labor (measured by D°); it also means

that employees are worse off than they would be in a well-functioning market – because they are



                                                                                                     6
engaging in some transactions in which the cost of supplying labor exceeds the wage they earn.

Employee-side information failures are discussed further in sections II (workplace safety) and IV

(workplace privacy) below.



               b.      Employer-side information failures

       Employers will frequently have only imperfect information about the attributes of their

employees. This is particularly likely to be true at the point of hiring but may be true later on as

well. A large literature in labor economics examines the consequences of such employer-side

imperfect information for labor markets (e.g. Greenwald 1986; Gibbons and Katz 1991).

       As noted above, the usual modeling assumption in the case of an employer-side

information failure is that employers are aware of the limits on their information and respond

rationally to these limits. Thus, the employers’ information problem is typically modeled as a

situation of adverse selection. Employer-side information failures and the resulting adverse

selection problems are discussed further in sections V (fringe benefits mandates) and VII

(wrongful discharge law) below.



       2.      Monopsony

       A second failure in employment markets is monopsony power. (Because this paper is

focused on employment law rules that protect employees and does not examine labor law, the

paper does not discuss the alternative scenario of market power or monopoly on the employee

side.) If an employer is a monopsonist in the market for a particular type of employee, then

instead of taking the wage as given as in a competitive labor market, the individual employer

will face an upward-slowing labor supply curve. This employer will choose its employment




                                                                                                       7
level E to maximize R(E) – w(E)E, where R(E) is the employer’s revenue and w(E) is the labor

supply curve. Under the associated first-order condition for the employer, it is clear that the

wage under monopsony falls short of the marginal revenue product of labor R′(E). This outcome

is inefficient, as well as detrimental to employee welfare, because some employees who would

produce more value than the cost of their labor are not hired. Section IX below notes the

familiar argument that minimum wage laws may respond to such monopsony-based market

failure – a point that, while of theoretical interest, is generally believed to have limited practical

importance.



       3.      Externalities

       A third potential failure in employment markets arises from the external effects of some

decisions by market participants. If, for instance, an employee is killed or injured on the job, it is

not only the employee (and possibly employer) who may suffer harm. Family members will

typically suffer, though employees may usually take such effects into account. Systems of social

support will often be affected as well. Although externalities are obviously a classic form of

market failure, they have received less attention than information failures and monopsony in the

existing literature on the economics of employment law and, thus, receive relatively limited

attention below.



       4.      Employee-side cognitive bias

       Information failures, market power, and externalities are the traditional forms of market

failure within conventional economic analysis. A separate set of potential market failures,




                                                                                                         8
however, arises from the possibility that employees will exhibit distorted labor supply decisions

as a result of various forms of cognitive bias.

        Of natural relevance to employment law is a substantial literature showing that many

individuals exhibit optimism bias, adjudging their personal probability of facing bad outcomes to

be lower than the average probability of facing such outcomes (Weinstein 1980). Many people,

for instance, believe that their chances of having an auto accident are significantly lower than the

average person’s chances of experiencing this event (DeJoy 1989), although of course these

beliefs cannot all be correct, for if everyone were below “average,” then the average would be

lower. There is also evidence that people underestimate their absolute as well as relative (to

other individuals) probability of experiencing negative events such as auto accidents (Arnould

and Grabowski 1981:34-35; Camerer and Kunreuther 1989:566).

        From a modeling standpoint, optimism bias among employees is similar to the employee-

side information failures discussed in section I.B.1 above. Parallel to the case of such

information failures, the most natural assumption, and the one that will be utilized in this paper,

is that employees with optimism bias either are not aware of the bias or do not change their

behavior in response to the bias. 2 Thus, as with information failures, if employees exhibit

optimism bias in relation to some aspect of the employment relationship that affects their

willingness to supply labor, then observed labor supply will differ from employees’ true

willingness to supply labor. In the case of workplace safety, for instance, optimism bias may

lead even employees who have full information about the general risks and harms in their

workplace to underestimate the probability that they personally will experience negative

2
  Akerlof and Dickens (1982), by contrast, analyze workplace safety under the assumption that employees
are aware of their tendency to believe (in Akerlof and Dickens’s model, because of cognitive dissonance)
that the workplace is safer than it is. Because of such awareness, employees in their model take action in
response to their biased tendencies.


                                                                                                        9
outcomes, and, as a result, they may oversupply labor. The effects of this were discussed in

section I.B.1 above. Optimism bias is discussed further in sections II (workplace safety) and IV

(workplace privacy) below.



                                II.     Workplace Safety Mandates

        This section and the sections that follow analyze the major forms of legal regulation of

the employer-employee relationship, beginning with the legal regulation of workplace safety. A

few of the topics included in the sections to follow are already treated in some depth in the

Handbook of Labor Economics or the Handbook of Public Economics and, thus, are mentioned

only briefly here, with cross-references to the longer treatments in the existing Handbook

volumes. 3 Throughout, work published in law review, as opposed to economics journal, format

is described at greater length, on the theory that the typical degree of background and detailed

exposition provided in a law review article creates a form of barrier to entry that is not present

when reference is made to work published in economics journal format.

        Because many individuals spend a substantial fraction of their waking hours at work and

often encounter risks in the course of work, workplace safety is a central issue of public policy.

Many features of employment law are concerned with enhancing workplace safety. Legal

regulation in this area includes both direct mandates of safe work conditions, as under the

Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) in the United States, and indirect channels for

  In areas not already covered in other Handbook chapters, the treatment offered below seeks to describe
and synthesize the most influential economic analyses in each major area of employment law, rather than
to catalogue in a comprehensive manner all existing economic analyses in each area.


                                                                                                      10
improving workplace safety through the employer incentives created by mandated compensation

for workplace injuries. This section and section III consider these two basic approaches in turn. 4

        The general starting point for economic analysis of workplace safety regulation is the

observation that in the absence of market failure, less safe working conditions should be fully

compensated by higher wages – an application of the theory of equalizing wage differentials. 5

Viscusi (1978) and Viscusi and O’Connor (1984), among others, present evidence of adjustments

in wages in response to workplace risks. The evidence on risk-based adjustments in wages,

however, is limited in two important ways. First, without some independent way of monetizing

the cost of a higher-risk job, at most the empirical evidence can tell us that wages move in a

particular direction in relation to risk; it cannot tell us whether wages adjust by the right amount

(given the employee’s underlying preferences) in light of workplace risks. Movement in one

direction or the other is ultimately a fairly weak test of the theory of equalizing wage

differentials. The second limitation is that sources of credible identification of empirical effects

are extremely difficult to find in this area because employees who select into different types of

jobs with different levels of associated risk may differ along important dimensions that are not

observed by the analyst; and moreover, the jobs into which employees select may also differ

along dimensions that are not observed by the analyst. If either individual or job characteristics

that are unobservable by the analyst are correlated with job risks, then correlations between risks

and wages may be entirely spurious. Employment law, not satisfied that equalizing wage




4
  In addition to workplace safety mandates and mandated compensation for workplace injuries, general
tort law may have some effect on workplace safety incentives; however, such effects are limited by the
fact that, at least in the United States, workers’ compensation (discussed in section III) preempts most tort
liability for workplace injuries. See chapter 2, by Steven Shavell, in this Handbook for further discussion
of the economic analysis of tort law.

  Brown (1980) offers a general treatment of the topic of equalizing wage differentials.

differentials fully address the issue of workplace safety, has chosen to regulate workplace safety

in both the direct and indirect ways noted above.



A.     Theoretical analysis of workplace safety mandates

       The most direct form of workplace safety regulation is workplace safety mandates.

These mandates require particular workplace practices intended to enhance workplace safety. In

the United States, as previously noted, OSHA imposes a range of such mandates, which are

described in detail in Smith (1976) and Mendeloff (1979).

       Within economic analysis, workplace safety mandates are typically justified on the

ground that either information failures or optimism bias on the part of employees leads them to

oversupply labor at a given wage rate. Frequently employees will not be aware of the risks of a

particular workplace, and even employees who have good information about the general risks of

their workplace may overoptimistically assume that those risks do not apply to them personally.

       As noted in section I.B above, an oversupply of labor because of information failures,

optimism bias, or both means that some inefficient transactions are taking place and that

employees are worse off than they would be in a well-functioning market. Workplace injuries

may also have important externality effects, but the informational and cognitive problems have

been central in the existing literature. In the presence of such problems, workplace safety

mandates can in theory improve both efficiency and employee welfare by eliminating the

inefficient and detrimental (to employees) transactions described in section I.B. If observed

labor supply under a mandate matches the “true” willingness to supply labor (because the

workplace is safe, consistent with employees’ belief), then only efficient transactions will occur,

and employees will accept employment only to the extent that the wage equals or exceeds their




                                                                                                 12
“true” cost of supplying labor. Of course, in the real world the mandated levels of workplace

safety may not match employees’ beliefs or may be exorbitantly expensive; responding to even a

genuine employee-side informational or cognitive problem does not guarantee that efficiency

and employee welfare will rise under a workplace safety mandate. Ultimately, the effects of a

workplace safety mandate are an empirical question. 6



B.      Empirical analysis of workplace safety mandates

        As just noted, the central question about workplace safety mandates concerns their

empirical effects on wages, employment levels, and, of course, workplace safety. A large

empirical literature has attempted to identify such effects. 7 This literature has focused on

workplace injuries (in the sense of immediate negative health effects), as distinguished from

longer-term health risks from work; this focus is reflected in the discussion below. As the

discussion below will make clear, the overall body of empirical evidence suggests modest (at

best) effects of workplace safety mandates on observed levels of workplace safety, and,

presumably because of the limited evidence of effects on the basic level of workplace safety,

wage and employment effects of workplace safety mandates have generally not been studied.

Most of the empirical evidence on the effects of workplace safety mandates comes from the

United States, and that focus is reflected in the discussion below.

        In sharp contrast to the workplace injury compensation systems noted in section III

below, workplace safety mandates in the United States operate at the federal level, and, as a



6
  Not addressed in this discussion is the possibility that workplace safety mandates may affect the degree
of precautionary behavior by employees. Rea (1981) offers related discussion, although his analysis is
primarily focused on compensation systems for workplace injuries (the topic of the next section) rather
than on workplace safety mandates.
7
  For a comprehensive survey of this literature through the early 1990s, see Smith (1992).


                                                                                                        13
result of OSHA’s status as a federal law, state law variation generally cannot be used to identify

OSHA’s effects. 8 Limited exceptions to this statement about OSHA are Ruser and Smith (1988)

and Morantz (2005). Ruser and Smith examine the effects of the initiation of a records-check

procedure in some but not all states on the level of reported workplace injuries; they find a lower

level of reported injuries with the records-check procedure in place, but they are unable to

determine from their data whether this results from a true reduction in injury rates or (the

interpretation they emphasize) an increase in the frequency of underreporting because under the

records-check procedure underreporting would reduce the likelihood of costly safety inspections.

Ruser and Smith’s study is largely concerned with effects on reporting levels rather than the

more basic issue of effects on workplace safety. Meanwhile, Morantz’s (2005) work examines

how injury rates among construction workers vary with federal versus state enforcement of

OSHA’s substantive provisions and finds significantly lower injury rates in states with federal

enforcement. Although the injury rate data do not go back far enough to allow Morantz to

examine changes over time with the move from federal to state enforcement (so that, in contrast

to Ruser and Smith, identification is based on cross-state variation only, rather than variation

across both states and time), Morantz’s empirical approach does attempt to control

comprehensively for other cross-state differences, apart from federal versus state enforcement,

that could be influencing injury rates.




8
  Much empirical work in employment law, including the work described in several of the sections below
as well as much work in the employment discrimination area (e.g., Neumark and Stock 1999; Jolls 2004a;
Jolls and Prescott 2006), exploits variation in legal innovation across states to identify the effects of legal
rules. With change over time but no cross-state variation – as with a federal law such as OSHA – it is
often difficult to disentangle the effects of the law’s enactment from other unobserved changes occurring
at the same time. Indeed, as Smith (1992) notes, even a simple national-level before-after comparison of
injury rates in relation to OSHA’s enactment is not possible because OSHA significantly changed the
manner of collecting data on workplace safety.


                                                                                                            14
        Other empirical work on OSHA has examined variation in its enforcement over time or

across industries (rather than across states) as a source of identification of the law’s effects on

workplace safety. In light of the low financial penalties for the typical OSHA violation and the

low likelihood of OSHA inspections (Viscusi 1979; Weil 1996), many have questioned whether

OSHA is likely to have any effect on workplace safety at all, regardless of variation in

enforcement within the low observed ranges of penalties and inspection frequencies. Viscusi

(1979) and Bartel and Thomas (1985), for instance, find limited or no relationship between

measures of OSHA enforcement and injury rates, while Viscusi (1986) finds at best a modest

relationship. 9

        Scholz and Gray (1990) have suggested, however, that the limited effects of OSHA on

injury rates in many empirical studies reflect the overly generalized approach of these studies.

Scholz and Gray focus on the firms most likely to be affected by OSHA – large, frequently

inspected firms – and find significant effects of OSHA enforcement on injury rates in their

sample. Unlike earlier studies, Scholz and Gray’s study uses plant-level rather than industry-

level data on OSHA enforcement levels and injury rates. However, a recent study by Gray and

Mendeloff (2005) using a methodology similar to that in Scholz and Gray (1990) found that the

significant effects of OSHA on injury rates lasted only through the early 1990s and were not

apparent in data for most of the 1990s.

        While the central variable of policy interest in studying OSHA’s effects is the workplace

injury rate, several studies have examined the relationship between the level of OSHA

enforcement and the degree of firms’ observed compliance with OSHA’s requirements. Bartel

and Thomas (1985) and Weil (1996), for instance, find evidence of significant effects of

period just after OSHA’s enactment.


                                                                                                      15
enforcement on compliance with OSHA’s requirements, notwithstanding the general evidence,

noted above, of very limited levels of OSHA enforcement. By contrast, Weil (2001) finds only

limited effects of enforcement activity on compliance in the construction industry.

       Ultimately, the existing empirical work provides relatively little evidence of effects of

OSHA on injury rates, with slightly more evidence of compliance effects. The lack of variation

across states has, not surprisingly, impeded efforts to pin down the effects of OSHA’s workplace

safety mandates more definitively. Although the theory suggesting the likelihood of market

failure in the workplace safety context seems strong, direct empirical evidence on the effects of

OSHA has, at least thus far, not provided a clear basis for concluding that this law has enhanced

efficiency and employee welfare or, even more basically, that the law has decreased workplace

injuries. As described below, the empirical picture on compensation systems for workplace

injuries – the other major employment law mechanism for improving workplace safety – is at

least somewhat more positive.



                    III.    Compensation Systems for Workplace Injuries

       Employment law seeks to enhance workplace safety not only through direct safety

mandates, as under OSHA, but also through the deterrent effects afforded by legally mandated

systems of compensation for those injured on the job. In the United States, state workers’

compensation programs are a major source of such legally-mandated compensation. Injured

workers in the United States may also be eligible for compensation through the federal disability

insurance program, but the absence of any experience-rating component in this program means

that it does not create any particular deterrent effects for employers. The disability insurance

program, which is funded through compulsory payroll deductions by employers, is nonetheless a




                                                                                                   16
significant additional source of compensation for employees injured at work and, thus, is usually

included in analyses of compensation systems for workplace injuries.

       Both the theory and the empirical evidence relating to workers’ compensation systems

are developed in chapter 33 (by Krueger and Meyer) of the Handbook of Public Economics, and

the federal disability insurance program is also extensively discussed in that chapter; thus the

reader is referred to Krueger and Meyer’s treatment for further discussion of the economic

analysis of these programs. In brief, Krueger and Meyer conclude that the empirical evidence

suggests longer periods out of work with more generous workers’ compensation benefits (a

finding with ambiguous welfare consequences, as noted by Krueger and Meyer); they also note

the work by Gruber and Krueger (1991) suggesting no statistically significant reduction in

aggregate employment levels from increases in the generosity of workers’ compensation

programs (a finding suggestive of the absence of significant welfare costs from these programs,

although not of affirmative efficiency gains from the programs). Meanwhile, with respect to the

federal disability insurance program, Krueger and Meyer emphasize the unresolved question of

what causes the observed major changes in the size of the population receiving federal disability

insurance payments, a topic of ongoing research (e.g., Autor and Duggan 2003).



                              IV.    Workplace Privacy Mandates

       A very rapidly growing area of employment law – particularly with the increasing

presence of computers and the associated monitoring possibilities in the workplace – is

workplace privacy. Issues of workplace privacy span a broad array of domains. Questions

include the degree to which employers may videotape or audiotape their employees’ activities in

the workplace, the restrictions (if any) on drug and alcohol testing of employees, the degree to




                                                                                                   17
which employers may engage in various forms of monitoring of employees’ activities on

computers, and the limits on employers’ disclosure of medical and other personal information

about employees. Workplace privacy mandates require employers to conduct activities of this

sort in specified ways, if at all. This section briefly highlights the central issues in the economic

analysis of such workplace privacy mandates.



A.     Theoretical analysis of workplace privacy mandates

       From an economic standpoint, the possible market failures in the workplace privacy

setting parallel the main potential market failures in the workplace safety context. One potential

market failure is an employee-side information failure; for some forms of privacy-related

employer behavior, the employee may simply have no idea that the behavior is occurring.

Employees may assume that their privacy is protected at work, just as they may assume that their

workplace is safe. Examples in the privacy context include video or audio monitoring and the

monitoring of employees’ computers – practices of which employees may be entirely unaware.

In other settings, by contrast, an employee may know when a particular invasion of privacy

occurs; an example is urine testing for drug use – an employer practice that obviously cannot be

done without the employee’s knowledge.

       Even employees who have accurate information about an employer’s general practices in

relation to workplace privacy may be led by optimism bias to underestimate the likelihood that

the at-issue employer behavior will be undertaken in relation to, or have a negative effect upon,

them as opposed to other employees. The analysis is again parallel to the workplace safety

context, in which employees may underestimate their personal likelihood of workplace risks.

Note that in the workplace privacy context, the risks of market failure related to optimism bias




                                                                                                   18
will tend to be greater when there is more uncertainty in the employer’s policy. For instance,

employees may underestimate the likelihood that they will be subjected to a drug test under an

employer policy permitting drug testing of employees involved in a workplace accident, simply

because employees may tend to underestimate the likelihood that they will be involved in such

an accident. By contrast, if an employer policy provides that employees will be subjected to

ongoing video or audio monitoring as a matter of course, then optimism bias is likely to be less

important – though optimistically biased employees could still underestimate the likelihood that

the monitoring will detect a prohibited behavior on their part.

       Parallel to the discussion of workplace safety in section II.A above, a workplace privacy

mandate may address an employee-side information failure or cognitive bias by eliminating the

gap between observed labor supply and the “true” willingness to supply labor (because privacy is

now protected at the workplace, consistent with employees’ expectation). Of course, as above,

whether any given workplace privacy mandate actually has positive effects on efficiency and

employee welfare is ultimately an empirical question.



B.     Empirical analysis of workplace privacy mandates

       Very little empirical evidence currently exists on the effects of workplace privacy

mandates. However, in the case of the United States, the existence of variation in these

mandates across states and time suggests the potential value of empirical inquiry in this area.

Whether wages and employment levels would ever move to a discernible degree in response to

workplace privacy mandates is unclear, but effects on observable outcomes other than wages and

employment levels may be easier to detect. Jacobson (2003), for instance, presents evidence of

better safety outcomes in safety-sensitive occupations in states that enacted legislation clarifying




                                                                                                  19
the permissibility of drug testing for safety-sensitive positions than in states that did not enact

such legislation. There is some suggestion of preexisting trends in the enacting states, so the

results should be viewed with some caution, but Jacobson also finds improved safety outcomes

after the imposition of federally mandated drug testing for certain safety-sensitive positions.

Jacobson’s findings suggest that some forms of workplace privacy mandates (especially in the

drug testing context) may have the unfortunate effect of worsening safety outcomes. Additional

empirical work on the effects of workplace privacy mandates is likely to appear as these

mandates become increasingly common.



                                   V.       Fringe Benefits Mandates

        Employers may be responsible not only for improved workplace conditions – including

safety and privacy – but also for the provision of important fringe benefits. Fringe benefits are

usually understood to include such benefits as health insurance and pensions. The present

section focuses on the legal regulation of health insurance, the great majority of which is

provided through the employment relationship (although this is less true outside the United

States). Pension-related mandates are not considered in this paper because there is very little

existing literature on the effects of such mandates on wages, employment levels, or other labor

market outcomes. 10

        With respect to health insurance mandates, the Medicare program in the United States

requires compulsory payroll deductions by employers and offers government-provided health



10
     The central law governing pensions in the United States is the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act, a federal law that broadly displaces potential state-level regulation of pensions and, thus, leaves little
opportunity for credible identification (through state-level variation in legal innovation) of the effects of
legal regulation of pensions. See Ippolito (1988) for further discussion of the effects of the pension-
related mandates imposed at the federal level.


                                                                                                            20
insurance to (primarily) retirement-aged individuals. Under this program, individuals see a

deduction from their paychecks during their working years and then are entitled to health

insurance financed by the federal government during their retirement. 11 The Medicare system is

discussed in chapter 50 (by Currie and Madrian) of the Handbook of Labor Economics and

chapter 31 (by Cutler) of the Handbook of Public Economics, and the reader is referred to those

volumes for further discussion of this system. Because the Medicare system is covered in those

volumes, the focus of the present section is other types of health insurance mandates.

        Both federal and state law in the United States play a role in structuring the system of

health insurance mandates considered in this section. The federal role here is two-fold. First, the

Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) broadly “preempts,” or renders

inapplicable, all state-level health insurance mandates insofar as employer-provided health

insurance is concerned, unless the employer-provided insurance is procured from an insurance

company. Thus, any employer that self-insures – as many now do – is not subject to any health

insurance mandates imposed at the state level. Second, federal law imposes a few limited

mandates on health insurance plans. One such mandate is contained in the Consolidated

Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA), which requires that, above a certain employer-

size threshold, employees be allowed to continue purchasing health insurance through their

former employer for up to 18 months after leaving that employer. A second source of federal

health insurance mandates is the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA),




11
  By contrast, the Medicaid program in the United States is targeted to the needy and is not linked to the
employment relationship in any way.


                                                                                                        21
which imposes a variety of requirements on employers and other health insurance providers,

including mandated coverage for preexisting conditions.12

        State-level health insurance mandates, to the extent that their application is not preempted

by ERISA, also impose a variety of requirements on health insurance plans; for instance, some

state laws impose continuation coverage mandates similar to the mandate in COBRA (see

Gruber and Madrian 1994). State-level regulation is discussed briefly below where its mandates

overlap with federal requirements, but, because of the preemption issue noted above, the focus of

this section is on federal health insurance mandates. 13



A.      Theoretical analysis of fringe benefits mandates

        Several potential market failures, including employee-side information failures and

cognitive biases, may be relevant to analysis of the health insurance mandates noted just above,

but perhaps the most obvious labor market failure in this context involves employer-side

imperfect information. (For discussion of the broader issue of provision of health insurance

through, rather than independently of, the employment relationship, see chapter 50 (by Currie

and Madrian) of the Handbook of Labor Economics.) For instance, an individual employer

opting unilaterally to offer continuation coverage of the sort required by COBRA might

disproportionately attract employees who are less likely to remain employed (especially those

who simultaneously have concerns about their future health) and, thus, who are particularly


12
   Moreover, recently enacted HIPAA regulations impose a series of privacy-related requirements on
employers concerning the disclosure of medical information; those requirements may be analyzed under
the framework set forth in section IV (workplace privacy) above. An additional federal law regulating
health insurance is the Mental Health Parity Act. For the reasons given in section VI below, this law is
best viewed as a targeted mandate and, thus, is discussed in section VI rather than here.
13
   Economic analyses of the effects of various state-level health insurance mandates include Gruber
(1994b), Kaestner and Simon (2002), and Simon (2005). Chapter 31 (by Cutler) in the Handbook of
Public Economics also contains discussion of these mandates.


                                                                                                       22
focused on the issue of continuation coverage. In broad terms, the problem of adverse selection

here is similar to the problem – described in detail in section VII.A below – faced by an

individual employer opting to offer protection against discharge from employment without just

cause. In both cases, offering the benefit may make the employer disproportionately attractive to

less desirable employees. 14

       In the health insurance context, if the value to employees of a particular form of health

insurance coverage (such as continuation coverage) exceeds the cost of providing such coverage,

then mandating such coverage may efficiently respond to the adverse selection problem just

described. Of course, in the case of continuation coverage, employers in an ideal world might

offer not this type of coverage but, instead, employee-specific packages of wages and health

insurance tailored to each employee’s individual costs and needs (Gruber and Madrian 1994).

However, as Gruber and Madrian note, the barriers to such an approach – whether achieved

voluntarily or through legal regulation – in the real world are clear, and thus mandated

continuation coverage, as under COBRA, may be a good second-best solution. Empirical

evidence on the effects of both mandated continuation coverage and mandated coverage for

preexisting conditions is noted in the next section.



B.     Empirical analysis of fringe benefits mandates

       Empirical evidence on the effects of continuation coverage mandates on a variety of

employment-related outcomes is discussed in chapter 50 (by Currie and Madrian) of the

Handbook of Labor Economics; the discussion there of the studies by Gruber and Madrian

(1994, 1995, 1996, 1997) of both COBRA and state-level continuation coverage mandates is

14
  Aghion and Hermalin (1990) offer general discussion of the problem of adverse selection in employer-
employee and other contracting releationships.


                                                                                                    23
especially relevant. On balance, continuation coverage mandates appear to increase both

separation and retirement from work by employees; effects on overall wage and employment

levels (which would permit conclusions about the welfare effects of continuation coverage

mandates) presumably were not large enough to be studied empirically.

        With respect to preexisting conditions coverage mandates, chapter 31 (by Cutler) of the

Handbook of Public Economics discusses the effects of various state-level health insurance

mandates, including preexisting condition coverage mandates, on health insurance coverage

rates. In addition, in the time since this volume of the Handbook of Public Economics was

published, studies by Kaestner and Simon (2002) and Simon (2005) have also examined the

effects of state-level health insurance mandates, including preexisting condition coverage

mandates, while recent work by Sanz-de-Galdeano (2006) studies the effects of HIPAA, which

(as noted above) includes a preexisting conditions coverage mandate. The body of existing

empirical work suggests that these mandates have limited or no effects on insurance coverage

rates, wage and employment levels, or other outcomes. 15



                                     VI.     Targeted Mandates

        While the employment law mandates discussed in sections II through V above are

mandates predominantly directed to employees as a whole rather than to any discrete subgroup

of employees, other employment law mandates are targeted to particular demographic

subgroups. Indeed, many employment law mandates – including certain aspects of employment
15
   Note that although the primary focus of the empirical literature on health insurance mandates is on
outcomes other than overall wage and employment levels, insofar as overall wage and employment levels
are concerned, the framework described in section I.A above may require some adjustment when
analyzing the effects of health insurance mandates. This is so because the cost of health insurance is
likely to vary with the number of employees rather than, as depicted in Figure 1 above, with the number
of total worker-hours; in other words, the distribution of worker-hours over employees may matter greatly
in the health insurance context. Cutler and Madrian (1998) offer further discussion of this point.


                                                                                                      24
discrimination law as well as employment law rules such as mandated workplace leave

(emphasized below) – are targeted in this way. The direct effects of these targeted mandates will

be felt primarily or exclusively by demographic subgroups of employees, such as individuals

with disabilities, women, or members of particular racial groups, rather than by employees as a

whole (Gruber 1994a).

        Of course, no benefits mandate may be entirely untargeted; many mandates, including at

least some of those discussed above, may tend to benefit some demographic groups within a

given employment market more than others within this market. Thus, the difference between

general and targeted mandates is probably best viewed as a difference in degree rather than a

difference in kind.

        The importance of distinguishing between general and targeted mandates arises from the

fact that the subgroups to which targeted mandates are directed are generally groups whose

wages and employment opportunities are legally required to match those of the nontargeted

employees. In the absence of such requirements (or if such requirements were not binding), 16 the

targeted subgroup could simply be treated as a separate labor market, and the same basic sort of

analysis as was discussed in sections II through V above would continue to apply. However, in

the presence of binding restrictions on differential treatment across groups, the analysis of

targeted mandates proves to be quite different from the analysis employed until this point in the

paper. As described more fully below, employment law mandates targeted to demographic

subgroups of employees constitute an important exception to the general focus in this paper on

market failures as a necessary condition for employment law regulation to enhance employee

welfare. If the goal of a targeted mandate is to enhance the welfare of targeted employees – as it

16
  More precisely, if restrictions on wage differentials between the two groups were not binding. See Jolls
(2000) for further discussion.


                                                                                                       25
often is – then the desired result may obtain wholly apart from any sort of market failure – a

point obscured by the common focus in the literature on the standard mandated benefits

framework even when analyzing targeted mandates. 17 In light of this observation, and for the

sake of analytic clarity, the present section will analyze targeted mandates on the assumption of

no market failure of any sort. The analysis below could readily be adjusted to incorporate

market failure in combination with a targeted rather than general mandate. As above, empirical

analysis follows the theoretical analysis.



A.      Theoretical analysis of targeted mandates

        With a targeted mandate and no market failure of any sort, labor supply with the mandate

in place will shift exclusively or disproportionately for the targeted employees, rather than (as in

section I.A above) for employees as a whole. Meanwhile, on the employer side, the total

marginal revenue product of labor (reflecting, among other things, the cost of the mandated

benefit) will shift exclusively or disproportionately for the targeted group. If, for instance,

employers are legally required to provide leave from work following the birth of a child, as they

are in many countries, then both the willingness to supply labor and the total marginal revenue

product of labor are likely to shift disproportionately for female employees. 18

        Because of the differential effects of a targeted mandate across groups of employees, it is

important for purposes of the analysis of such mandates to separate out two distinct labor

markets: the market for employees targeted by the mandate and the market for the remaining


17
   See Jolls (2000) for further discussion of this point.
18
   For expositional ease, the analysis below will assume that the mandated benefit has value only to the
targeted group and imposes costs only in connection with that group. However, the conclusions offered
below would remain qualitatively uncharged if the mandate had some value beyond the targeted group
(although less than the value to the targeted group); the same is true if the mandate imposed some cost
beyond the targeted group (although less than the cost for the targeted group).


                                                                                                       26
employees. Each market will have its own labor supply and demand functions (although, as

described below, the demand functions will end up being the same if restrictions on wage and

employment differentials are binding). And, because the demand for employees of one type

will depend, among other things, on the demand for employees of the other type, it will no

longer be possible to represent everything of interest on a single, two-dimensional labor supply

and demand diagram, as in Figure 1.

       The following notation will be used below:

       Et = employment level of targeted employees;
       Wt = wage level of targeted employees;
       En = employment level of nontargeted employees;
       Wn = wage level of nontargeted employees;
       C (> 0) = per-worker-hour cost of providing mandated benefit to targeted employees;
       V = per-worker-hour value of mandated benefit to targeted employees;
       MRPL = per-worker-hour marginal revenue product of labor from production.

       Prior to the imposition of a targeted mandate, the wages earned by targeted and

nontargeted employees will be given by Wt = Wn = MRPL(Et + En). Meanwhile, labor supply

for the two groups of employees prior to the imposition of a targeted mandate may be written as

follows:

       Et = St(Wt)
       En = Sn(Wn)

Let (Wt°, Wn°, Et°, En°) with Et° > 0 and En° > 0 denote an interior solution to this system.

       After the imposition of a targeted mandate, labor supply for the two groups of employees

will be given by the following equations:

       Et = St(Wt + V);                                                             (1)
       En = Sn(Wn).                                                                 (2)

However, labor demand after the imposition of the mandate will depend on the degree to which

restrictions on wage and employment differentials are binding. One possibility is that




                                                                                                27
restrictions on wage differentials are not binding (and restrictions on employment differentials

are or are not binding); in this case, as noted above, a targeted mandate may be analyzed within

the basic type of framework used in sections II through V above. 19 A second possibility is that

restrictions on wage differentials are binding while restrictions on employment differentials are

not; in this case targeted employees will effectively be more expensive to employ (as they must

earn the same wage but cost the employer more), and employers will thus tend to reduce their

hiring of targeted employees. The most interesting possibility, and the one that will be

examined in the remainder of this section, occurs when restrictions on both wage and

employment differentials are binding. In this case there must not be any difference between the

wages or employment opportunities of targeted and nontargeted employees within a given

employment market; employers must pay each type of employee the same wage and must

demand each type in proportion to its willingness to supply labor at that wage.

           With binding restrictions on wage and employment differentials, the common wage W

for the two groups of employees after the imposition of the mandate will be given by:

           W = [Et/(Et + En)][MRPL(Et + En) – C] + [En/(Et + En)]MRPL(Et + En).

Rewriting:

           W = MRPL(Et + En) – [Et/(Et + En)]C.                                       (3)

The equation in (3), together with the labor supply equations in (1) and (2), yields a system of

three equations in three unknowns; let (W*, Et*, En*) denote a solution to this system.

           As (3) shows, a targeted mandate will affect labor demand both as a result of the

mandate’s effect on MRPL through changes in Et + En and as a result of the direct cost C of the

mandated benefit. With respect to the former effect, it is straightforward to show that because

                                                                                                   28
of the downward pressure on labor demand as a result of the cost of the mandated benefit, the

employment level of nontargeted employees will fall with the mandate: En* < En°. 20

Intuitively, the mandate, by requiring employers to incur costs for targeted employees that

nontargeted employees will have to share as a consequence of the binding restrictions on wage

and employment differentials, induces marginal nontargeted employees to exit the market. This

relationship between En* and En° in turn allows one to depict the effects of a targeted mandate

on the wages and employment of targeted employees in simple graphical form in a figure

(Figure 2) similar to Figure 1 from above.

           In Figure 2, the curve Dt° is the pre-mandate labor demand curve for targeted employees

at the pre-mandate equilibrium level of nontargeted employment (En°). Thus, the curve Dt° is

given by W = MRPL(Et + En°). Meanwhile, the curve Dt' is given by the following equation:

            W = MRPL(Et + En°) – [Et/(Et + En*)]C.

The curve Dt' thus depicts the effect of the shift due to the cost of the mandated benefit after the

mandate is imposed; the MRPL term is ignored by assuming that the marginal revenue product

of labor from production as a function of targeted employment (Et) is the same pre-and post-

mandate (MRPL(Et + En°) in both cases). Because, as noted above, En* < En°, it is

straightforward to see that the ultimate post-mandate labor demand curve for targeted

employees, with En = En*, must lie above the curve Dt' in Figure 2.

           We are now in a position to assess the effects of a targeted mandate on the wages and

employment levels of targeted employees. As the discussion in section I.A above suggests, it is

useful to separate the analysis into distinct cases based on the relationship between the value

and the cost of the mandated benefit. The straightforward case is the one in which the value of


20
     See Jolls (2000) for details.


                                                                                                   29
the mandated benefit equals or exceeds its cost. 21 In this case, not surprisingly, the targeted

employees’ wage will fall by less than the value of the mandated benefit, while their

employment level will rise, as depicted in Figure 2.

        The more interesting case is the one in which the value of the mandated benefit is less

than its cost. In this case it is no longer certain that targeted employees will be better off after

the mandate is imposed, but it remains likely; as long as the fraction of nontargeted individuals

in the qualified population is not too small, and the gap between the value and the cost of the

mandated benefit is not too large, a targeted mandate will always make targeted employees

better off. If, for example, nontargeted employees constitute the vast majority of the

employment market in question, then the fall in the total marginal revenue product of labor for

all employees in that market with the imposition of a targeted mandate will be small, as the

average cost of the mandated benefit across the employment market will be small. And the

smaller the downward shift in the total marginal revenue product of labor as a result of the

mandated benefit cost, the smaller the gap between the curves Dt° and Dt' in Figure 2, and hence

the lower the likelihood that this gap will exceed the downward shift in the labor supply curve

(St° to St'). As long as the downward shift in the labor supply curve equals or exceeds the gap

between Dt° and Dt' over the relevant range of employment levels, the wage of targeted

employees will fall by less than the value of the mandated benefit, while their employment level

will rise.




21
  In the absence of any market failure – the assumption maintained throughout this section – a benefit
whose value equals or exceeds its cost might, but conceivably would not, be provided in the absence of a
mandate. Because the benefit accrues exclusively or disproportionately to targeted employees, it seems
possible that the benefit would not be provided (with binding restrictions on wage and employment
differentials) even if the value of the benefit exceeded its cost. This issue is not analyzed rigorously here,
however.


                                                                                                           30
        Thus, targeted mandates may be justifiable on distributive grounds even when the cost of

the mandated benefit exceeds its value. 22 In the case of general mandates, by contrast,

distributive considerations cannot justify legal intervention when the cost of the mandated

benefit exceeds its value because, as noted in section I.A above, the employees’ wage will fall

by more than the value of the benefit to them. This effect occurs because there is no other group

to whom to shift costs. But with targeted mandates, even if the value of the mandated benefit is

less than its cost, the mandate may make targeted employees better off because nontargeted

employees will bear some of the associated cost.

        The point about potential distributive gains wholly apart from market failure is especially

important because the fact that the value of a mandated benefit is less than its cost may reflect

precisely the undesirable distributive situation that employment law seeks to remedy. The

reason is that “value” in this framework is measured by employees’ willingness to pay for the

benefit by accepting lower wages, and the distributive situation of targeted employees might

preclude them from accepting lower wages (see generally Dworkin 1980). If, for instance, a

mandate requires employers to provide medical leave to employees with serious medical

problems, the value (measured by willingness to pay) of this benefit to the targeted employees

may be limited not by the utility of the leave to these employees but by their financial position.

Mandated medical leave is discussed further in the next section.




22
  Of course, distributive goals might alternatively be achieved through a tax-and-transfer regime (Kaplow
and Shavell 1994).


                                                                                                      31
B.      Empirical analysis of targeted mandates

        As suggested above, some targeted mandates arise under employment discrimination law

and, for that reason, are not analyzed further in this paper. 23 The primary employment law

application of the analysis of targeted mandates is workplace leave mandates, which at least in

the United States arise under employment law outside of what is generally considered

employment discrimination law. 24 Workplace leave mandates in the United States

disproportionately target both disabled employees (through mandated entitlement to medical

leave) and female employees (through mandated entitlement to leave following the birth of a

child). 25 These two aspects of mandated workplace leave are considered in turn below. 26



        1.      Mandated medical leave

        As noted above, the wage and employment effects of a targeted mandate depend

significantly on the degree to which restrictions on wage and employment differentials between

targeted and nontargeted employees are binding. Starting with restrictions on wage differentials,

such restrictions are likely to be binding in the absence of significant occupational segregation

23
   Disability discrimination law, for instance, requires employers to make “reasonable accommodations”
for disabling conditions – a mandate targeted to employees with disabilities (Acemoglu and Angrist
2001). Similarly, to the extent that sex discrimination law requires health insurance coverage of
maternity-related medical costs, it imposes a mandate targeted to female employees (Gruber 1994a)
24
   The Family and Medical Leave Act, which requires employers to provide employees with leave from
work under specified conditions, is not part of any of the employment discrimination statutes in the
United States and is administered by the Department of Labor rather than the agency (the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission) that administers employment discrimination statutes.
25
   Mandated leave following the birth of a child is targeted to female employees even though leave is
typically available to male employees because female employees who have biological children will
require at least a brief period of time off from work after a birth to recover from the temporary disability
associated with giving birth and, thus, will almost certainly (for purely biological reasons) be more likely
than male employees to take leave.
26
   Another targeted mandate in the United States is the Mental Health Parity Act, which requires that
coverage of mental and physical conditions under health insurance plans be comparable in certain
respects. Because this law is generally believed to be of modest practical impact, it seems unlikely to be
the source of observable empirical effects.


                                                                                                          32
between targeted and nontargeted groups. Legal restrictions on wage differentials are generally

fairly easy to enforce (e.g., Posner 1987), and, moreover, employers may have incentives to

adhere to norms of pay equity wholly apart from legal restrictions because of the potential

morale problems that can result from inequity in wages between different groups performing the

same work.

        In the case of mandated entitlement to medical leave, the group of employees

disproportionately (though of course not exclusively) targeted by such a mandate is employees

with disabilities, some of whom will be significantly more likely to require leave than

nondisabled employees. With respect to occupational segregation, at least in the United States

employees with disabilities are not significantly segregated, so restrictions on wage differentials

between employees with and without disabilities are likely to bind.

        Likewise, with respect to restrictions on employment differentials, while these

restrictions are unlikely to bind directly for employees with and without disabilities because of

the difficulty of enforcing such restrictions (e.g., Posner 1987), the ultimate effect may be the

same in analyzing mandated entitlement to medical leave because many of the conditions for

which such leave will be required are unobservable to employers at the time of hiring and, thus,

cannot be the basis of differential employment decisions (Jolls 2006). In this case, the analysis

in section VI.A above predicts that mandated entitlement to medical leave will increase both

wages and employment levels of employees with disabilities, unless either the fraction of

targeted individuals in the qualified population is too large or the cost of the leave significantly

exceeds its value. In the United States, because medical leave under the Family and Medical

Leave Act (FMLA) is unpaid, it seems unlikely that the cost of this benefit significantly exceeds

its value.




                                                                                                    33
       A straightforward empirical measure of the wage and employment effects of mandated

entitlement to medical leave under the FMLA on employees with disabilities is a comparison of

wages and employment levels of such individuals before and after the FMLA went into effect –

ideally with an additional comparison between states in which mandated entitlement to medical

leave under the FMLA was an innovation and those in which it was not. Both approaches

suggest neutral to positive effects of mandated entitlement to medical leave on disabled

employment levels (relative to nondisabled employment levels), with the most credible evidence

suggesting positive effects (Jolls 2006). This evidence underlines the prospects for positive

effects of targeted mandates on the employment opportunities of targeted employees, consistent

with the theoretical analysis offered in section VI.A above.



       2.      Mandated leave following the birth of a child

       As noted above, relatively limited degrees of occupational segregation (as in the case of

employees with and without disabilities in the United States) suggest that restrictions on wage

differentials will be binding. But in the case of male and female employees – the groups likely

to be disparately affected by mandated entitlement to leave following the birth of a child –

employment markets remain quite segregated. 27 With substantial occupational segregation,

restrictions on wage differentials will tend to be of little force because the only comparisons that

are drawn in the law are those between employees within the same employment market (or, more

technically, those performing the same or similar work). As noted above, in the absence of




27

occupational segregation by sex.


                                                                                                   34
binding restrictions on wage differentials, an analysis similar to that used in sections II through V

above remains applicable to the case of a targeted mandate. 28

        Mandated entitlement to leave from work following the birth of a child exists in a wide

array of countries and has been extensively studied. Waldfogel (1999), for instance, examines

female employees’ wages and employment levels in the aftermath of the FMLA’s enactment in

the United States and finds no consistent pattern of statistically significant results. The lack of

clear results may stem in part from the fact that, as Waldfogel notes, many female employees

were entitled (by state legislation or firm policy) to FMLA-type benefits following the birth of a

child even prior to the FMLA’s enactment.

        Another test of the effects of mandated entitlement to leave following the birth of a child

comes from looking at the effects of European leave laws. Ruhm (1998), for instance, finds that

the length of the leave period under these laws generally is negatively related to the wages of

female employees and positively related to their employment levels. Note that because

employees’ leave is paid, in contrast to the situation under the FMLA, positive employment

effects are more likely under the European laws, which are presumably valued more by

employees than the FMLA because of the paid nature of the leave. (Negative labor demand

effects of paid leave are blunted by government rather than employer financing of the leave.)

An exception to the general pattern of Ruhm’s findings is that the effect of having some

mandated leave versus none – as distinguished from the effect of having a short mandated leave

versus a long mandated leave – has no statistically significant effect (rather than a statistically

significant negative effect) on wages of female employees. This may result from the fact that a

28
  Of course, very few employment markets are actually perfectly segregated, so that there is absolutely
no opportunity to compare targeted and nontargeted employees’ wage levels. Jolls (2000) provides
further discussion of the reasons that markets with significant segregation are nonetheless most naturally
modeled as markets in which restrictions on wage differentials are not binding.


                                                                                                         35
short leave, as opposed to a long leave, imposes relatively few costs on employers, and thus

provides little occasion for a wage adjustment. 29

        Overall, the empirical evidence on mandated entitlement to leave following the birth of a

child suggests neutral to positive employment effects – the same broad pattern as with mandated

entitlements to medical leave. Wage effects, by contrast, appear more negative with mandated

leave after the birth of a child – a likely consequence of the degree of occupational segregation

by sex. Note, however, that because sex (in contrast to many medical conditions) is easily

observable to employers, decreasing occupational segregation by sex over time is more likely to

generate job losses from mandated entitlement to leave following the birth of a child (as wage

adjustments are precluded by decreased segregation) than to produce the benefits for targeted

employees that may come from mandated entitlement to medical leave.



                                  VII.     Wrongful Discharge Laws

        One of the most fundamental issues in employment law involves the general conditions

under which employers may engage in “the industrial equivalent of capital punishment” by

discharging an employee. 30 In many countries, a pervasive set of laws limits the conditions

under which employees may be discharged without attendant legal obligations (e.g., Blau and

Kahn 1999). In the United States, by contrast, a sharply different approach prevails; an

employee may generally be fired at any time, without identification of any reason whatsoever for

the discharge and without any attendant employer obligations, unless either the employee’s


29
   An important subtlety in discerning the effects of mandated entitlement to leave following the birth of
a child is that, as Waldfogel (1998, 1999) emphasizes, such mandates may have a sort of composition
effect, moving female employees into, or keeping them in, better, higher-level jobs. If this is so, then the
aggregate effects of the mandates may be more mixed and more complex than the effects suggested by
the theoretical framework described above.
30
   The quoted phrase comes from Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Reis, 451 U.S. 401 (1981).


                                                                                                          36
contract specifically provides otherwise or the discharge reflects unlawful discrimination or

some other unusually arbitrary or abusive basis for decision (Kim 1997). Only one of the fifty

United States (Montana) departs from this regime of “at will” employment. The United States

does have an unemployment insurance system, which is a limited form of employment protection

and is discussed in the next section, but (outside of Montana) there is no general requirement that

employers offer any sort of justification when discharging an employee and no general set of

employer financial obligations attending such discharges. 31

        The issue of the scope of wrongful discharge laws – defined for purposes of this paper as

laws requiring a threshold level of justification before employers may discharge employees –

does not fit well within the framework described in section I.A above because, in contrast with

the legal rules discussed in the preceding sections, the legal regulation here is directly linked to

the employment level. (In the case of the legal rules governing workplace safety, workplace

privacy, and various types of employee benefits such as health insurance and workplace leave,

the rules affect the wage and employment levels only indirectly through the shifts in labor supply

and marginal revenue product of labor they will produce.) The analysis below first provides

theoretical discussion of the labor market effects and the efficiency of wrongful discharge laws;

it then notes evidence from empirical studies of these laws.



A.      Theoretical analysis of wrongful discharge laws

        1.      Labor market effects of wrongful discharge laws

        In general, wrongful discharge laws have competing potential effects on the employment

level. On the one hand, they potentially increase employment because they impose barriers to

Kim (1997).


                                                                                                        37
firing. On the other hand, these very barriers may discourage the hiring of employees in the first

place. Models of these types of competing effects are discussed in chapter 25 (by Blau and

Kahn) in the Handbook of Labor Economics, and the reader is referred to that volume for further

discussion of the theoretical analysis of the labor market effects of various forms of employment

protection law.



        2.        Efficiency analysis of wrongful discharge laws

        At least in theory, several market failures may justify legal rules requiring a threshold

level of justification before employees are discharged. Two leading arguments are noted

below. 32



                  a.     Employee-side information failures

        The most straightforward justification for wrongful discharge laws is that in the absence

of such laws, inadequate employee-side information about the ability of an employer to

discharge employees without offering an adequate justification for the discharge leads employees

to oversupply labor at a given wage rate. Empirical evidence on this form of market failure is

discussed in section VII.B below.

        If, in the absence of wrongful discharge laws, many employees incorrectly believe that

they can only be discharged after a threshold level of justification has been met, then wrongful

discharge laws can improve both employee welfare and efficiency by eliminating the gap

between employees’ observed and “true” willingness to supply labor. With a wrongful discharge

law in place, the governing regime is consistent with employees’ belief – although of course in

32
  Levine (1991) notes additional potential market failures in this context, including cognitive bias and
externalities.


                                                                                                           38
the real world the mandated level of justification for discharge may not match employees’

beliefs, or its imposition may impose very large costs. As described below, the available

empirical evidence on employee-side information failure in the wrongful discharge context –

while strongly supportive of the existence of such information failure – does not allow any

inference about whether existing wrongful discharge laws are ultimately a welfare-enhancing

response to employee-side information failure in this context.



       b.      Employer-side information failures

       Alongside employee-side information failure, Levine (1991) develops the argument that

employer-side information failures may also justify wrongful discharge laws. Intuitively, an

individual employer may not offer wrongful discharge protection on its own, even if such

protection, adopted universally, would increase both efficiency and employee welfare, because

the individual employer who offers the protection may become a magnet for less desirable

employees.

       In Levine’s model, employees are of two different types, and discharge occurs either on

an at will basis – where employers need not provide any reason for discharge – or on a “just

cause” basis – where employers must prove employee malfeasance in order to justify a

discharge. Note that, by contrast to the focus in sections II through VI above on models in which

employees are paid in accordance with the marginal revenue product of labor, Levine’s model is

a species of efficiency-wage model, in which employees may earn rents in order to discourage

shirking. Levine shows that a single firm may not profit from adopting just cause when its

competitors do not adopt it, even if such an approach, adopted universally, would be efficiency-




                                                                                                39
increasing. Because of the phenomenon of adverse selection, a mandated just cause requirement

may enhance both efficiency and employee welfare.



B.     Empirical analysis of wrongful discharge laws

       1.      Labor market effects of wrongful discharge laws

       The evidence on the labor market effects of various forms of employment protection law

is discussed in chapter 25 (by Blau and Kahn) in the Handbook of Labor Economics. In

addition, in the time since this volume of the Handbook of Labor Economics was published,

studies by Miles (2000), Autor (2003), and Autor, Donohue and Schwab (2006) have further

examined the wage and employment effects of wrongful discharge laws in the United States.

Both Miles (2000) and Autor (2003) find a significant positive relationship between more

restrictive wrongful discharge laws and the substitution of temporary for regular employees.

Meanwhile, Autor, Donohue and Schwab (2006) find negative employment effects of some,

though not all, types of wrongful discharge laws.



       2.      Efficiency analysis of wrongful discharge laws

       The available empirical evidence on the efficiency of wrongful discharge laws bears most

strongly on the first potential market failure discussed above – employee-side information

failure. Kim (1997, 1999) presents evidence that most individuals in the United States are not

aware of the fact that employers need not meet some threshold level of justification in order to

discharge their employees. Kim surveyed a total of 921 recently discharged employees at

unemployment benefits offices in California, Missouri, and New York in the late 1990s. To file

a claim for unemployment benefits, claimants in these states must appear in person at a benefits




                                                                                                   40
office. In Kim’s study, claimants were approached while waiting for assistance at benefits

offices and asked if they would complete a written survey. Presumably because the claimants

were already waiting and did not have the option to be elsewhere, response rates were high –

85% in California and Missouri and 69% in New York.

       The surveys in Kim’s study asked respondents to consider specific scenarios in which

individuals were discharged without a good reason and then to indicate whether they believed

such discharges would be found to be lawful by a court of law. For instance, one question asked

about the lawfulness of a termination based upon personal dislike of the employee; another asked

whether it was lawful to terminate an employee based on a mistaken belief that the employee had

stolen money (a belief that the employee could prove was incorrect). While such discharges are

unquestionably permitted under the law in the United States (outside of Montana), the vast

majority of respondents believed that the discharges were unlawful. Table 1 below summarizes

Kim’s main findings.

       One issue with Kim’s findings is whether unemployment insurance claimants are

representative of the overall employee population in the United States. On the one hand, as Kim

notes, individuals who recently lost their jobs may be more likely than the average employee to

have some familiarity with the legal regime governing discharge, precisely because of their

recent experience with being discharged. In addition, because eligibility for unemployment

benefits requires both that the claimant have some prior attachment to the labor market (in the

form of a minimum number of weeks employed) and that the claimant undertake an active search

for new employment, claimants’ beliefs should provide a good measure of what a job seeker with

labor market experience knows at the moment at which a decision is made about accepting a job

offer from a particular employer. On the other hand, unemployment benefits claimants may be




                                                                                                  41
less informed than the average employee about the legal rules governing termination because

those who are better informed – and thus realize that they have no legal protection against

discharge without an adequate justification – may better protect themselves from involuntary

termination. Balancing these various factors, there does not appear to be a strong a priori reason

to believe that unemployment benefits claimants will be systematically less aware than other

employees of the United States rule of at will employment, thought only additional empirical

study can definitively resolve the question.

       Note that because unemployment benefits claimants are disproportionately individuals

who earned low to moderate, rather than high, wages prior to their discharge from employment,

Kim’s evidence bears most directly on the existence of employee-side information failure in

employment markets other than those involving highly compensated employees. However, Kim

finds that erroneous beliefs about the legal rules governing discharge are common regardless of

education level. In Missouri, for instance, respondents with college degrees still exhibited

strongly mistaken beliefs about the legal rules governing discharge (Kim 1997).

       Kim’s findings suggest that employees often do not have good information about the

United States rule of at-will employment. While in some search models a limited proportion of

informed actors may eliminate the effects of information failure in markets (e.g., Wilde and

Schwartz 1979), Kim’s evidence suggests that the proportion of United States employees

suffering from information failure is extremely large. While the empirical support for employee-

side information failure is thus large, it is, as noted above, not clear exactly what legal reform

would bring the treatment of discharge in the United States in line with employees’ expectations

or what the costs of such reform would be.




                                                                                                     42
                           VIII. Unemployment Insurance Systems

       Unemployment insurance, briefly noted in the preceding section, is an extremely

common, although limited, form of employment protection. Unemployment insurance requires

the payment of benefits in lieu of wages upon discharge from employment, typically (at least in

the United States) without regard for the reason for the discharge except in extreme

circumstances. Under the United States system, benefits are financed by a payroll tax that

employers must pay on a per-employee basis.

       Both theory and evidence relating to unemployment insurance are developed at length in

chapters 13 (by Atkinson) and 33 (by Krueger and Meyer) of the Handbook of Public

Economics, and, thus, the reader is referred to that volume for further discussion of the

economics of unemployment insurance. In brief, Krueger and Meyer, in the more recent of the

two chapters, conclude that the empirical evidence suggests longer periods out of work with

more generous unemployment insurance benefits – a finding, like its counterpart in the workers’

compensation context from section III above, with ambiguous welfare consequences.



                                 IX.     Minimum Wage Rules

       Among the most extensively discussed rules within the economic analysis of employment

law are minimum wage rules. Under these rules, employers must pay a legally-specified

minimum wage to employees. An important opening observation about these rules is that, akin

to the analysis in section VI above, the usual role of market failure in justifying employment law

rules is altered. Even in the absence of market failure, a minimum wage rule may increase total

employee income and, thus, at least by this measure, may enhance employee welfare.




                                                                                                43
       For minimum wage rules to increase not only total employee income but also efficiency

and the income of each individual worker, market failure is necessary. It is often observed in

discussions of minimum wage rules that market failure in the form of monopsony may justify

such rules. This is so because, as discussed in section I.B above, under monopsony the wage is

set below the marginal revenue product of labor. Anything that moves the wage closer to the

marginal revenue product of labor will both enhance efficiency and make all employees better

off.

       Both theory and evidence relating to minimum wage rules are developed in chapter 32

(by Charles Brown) in the Handbook of Labor Economics, and the reader is referred to that

volume for further discussion of these rules and their effects on efficiency and employee welfare.



                              X.     Overtime Pay Requirements

       The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) in the United States imposes both minimum wage

rules – discussed in the preceding section – and overtime pay requirements, which are the focus

of the present section. Under overtime pay requirements, employers are legally required to pay a

wage premium for hours above a specified weekly or other threshold. In the United States,

employers generally must pay one and a half times the normal wage for hours worked above 40

hours per week. This section describes both theoretical and empirical analysis of overtime pay

requirements



A.     Theoretical analysis of overtime pay requirements

        Overtime pay requirements, like the employment law rules discussed in the preceding

sections, represent a legally prescribed term in the employment relationship. However, there is




                                                                                                 44
an important analytic difference between overtime pay requirements and the rules considered in

all of the preceding sections. In the case of overtime pay requirements, the legally prescribed

term simply concerns the form within which dollars are paid to an employee, rather than some

other aspect (such as the safety, privacy, or wage level) of the job. In principle, then, it may be

possible for employers to undo completely the effects of overtime pay requirements (Ehrenberg

and Schumann 1982, pp. 36-37). To borrow Trejo’s (1991) example, suppose that in the absence

of overtime pay regulation, an employee works 50 hours per week and earns $11 per hour. The

employer in this circumstance could satisfy the FLSA by reducing the employee’s straight-time

wage to $10 per hour and then paying time and a half for the 10 hours in excess of the 40-hour-

per-week cutoff. The employee would be in an identical situation, working 50 hours per week

for $550 in pay. By contrast, when, for instance, a particular workplace safety mandate is put

into effect, employers in the new equilibrium must provide the new safety feature (possibly

compensated by lower wages) and cannot directly replicate the prior equilibrium.

       Of course, there are limits on the foregoing account of the undoing of overtime pay

requirements. To the extent that straight-time wages are at least somewhat sticky, employers

may not be able to adjust such wages continuously over time in response to the number of

desired overtime hours. In addition, adjustment will be either impossible or limited for

employees whose straight-time wages are at or near the legal minimum wage level prior to any

requirement of overtime pay. Both of these points are emphasized by Trejo (1991). Ultimately,

then, empirical evidence is necessary to determine whether the theoretical account of the

irrelevance of overtime pay requirements is true in practice.

       To the extent that overtime pay requirements are not completely undone – as a result of

various forms of wage stickiness or other factors – is there a market failure to which overtime




                                                                                                  45
pay requirements might be thought to be responsive? The conventional view is that intensive use

of a smaller set of employees, instead of reliance on a broader group of employees, has a

negative externality effect on those individuals who are unable to obtain employment when a

smaller group of employees is used intensively. To the extent that overtime pay requirements

increase employment levels to some degree, it is possible that these requirements represent an

effective response to the negative externality just noted.



B.     Empirical analysis of overtime pay requirements

       In an effort to determine whether overtime pay requirements are effectively undone by

changes in base wages, Trejo (1991) studies differences in base wages across employees covered

and not covered by the overtime pay requirements of the FLSA. The noncovered employees

used in Trejo’s analyses – who are comparable to covered employees in being paid on an hourly

basis – include nonsupervisory agricultural workers, many transportation employees, and certain

retail and services employees. (The largest group of employees not covered by the overtime pay

requirements are employees who are paid on a salary rather than an hourly basis, but these

individuals would, for obvious reasons, provide a weak control group for examining the effects

of overtime pay requirements on covered, hourly wage employees.) Using a sample of repeated

cross sections, Trejo finds that the hourly wages of covered employees are significantly lower

than the hourly wages of noncovered employees. According to Trejo, this evidence provides

some suggestion that overtime pay requirements are partially, although not completely, undone

by adjustments in straight-time wages. Potential limits on Trejo’s empirical analysis include the

fact that the results are somewhat sensitive to the measure of wages used (with weekly earnings

yielding results different from those just described) and the limited degree of identification




                                                                                                 46
resulting from possible unobservable differences across individuals in hourly wage jobs within

covered versus noncovered sectors. In contrast to Trejo, Hunt (1999), examining evidence from

Germany, finds increases rather than decreases in wages in response to strengthened overtime

pay requirements negotiated between unions (which are industry-wide in Germany) and

employers; wages may well be less flexible in Europe than in the United States. Hunt’s

identification strategy has the virtue of employing both cross sectional and time series variation.

       In addition to examination of whether base wages adjust to offset overtime pay

requirements, empirical work has directly studied the linked question of whether workweeks

longer than 40 hours in the United States are less frequent with overtime pay requirements in

place. (Only with imperfect wage adjustments should such workweeks be less frequent with

overtime pay requirements in place.) Costa (2000) examines changes in the frequency of

overtime hours with the passage of the FLSA and finds a significant reduction in the proportion

of employees working such hours. Costa also finds much greater reduction in the South – in

which more employees were at the minimum wage level and, thus, could not be subjected to

wage adjustments in response to overtime pay requirements – than in the North. By contrast,

Trejo (2003), using as a source of identification variation over the 1970s and 1980s in the

proportion of employees within an industry who are subject to the overtime pay requirements of

the FLSA, finds no effect of overtime pay requirements on the frequency of workweeks longer

than 40 hours in specifications that include industry time trends. However, as Trejo notes, the

coefficients on coverage changes are imprecisely estimated, making it difficult to discern

whether the absence of a statistically significant effect suggests no underlying effect or simply

the limited power of the empirical approach. Hamermesh and Trejo (2000) study not the FLSA

but a California state law expanding the set of employees covered by a strict form of overtime




                                                                                                    47
pay and find significant negative effects on the level of overtime employees work. None of these

studies, however, offers any evidence that, in response to a decline in long work hours, aggregate

employment rises in the employment market in question – although it is obvious that a decline in

workweeks longer than 40 hours is a logical predicate for such an increase. Using German data

and examining the effects of industry-specific changes in overtime pay requirements, Hunt

(1999) finds that, if anything, aggregate employment levels fall rather than rise in response to

strengthened overtime pay requirements.



                                           XI.      Conclusion

        This paper has offered economic analysis (or, at times, referred to economic analysis in

the Handbook of Labor Economics or the Handbook of Public Economics) of the major topics in

employment law. Topics addressed above include workplace safety mandates (section II),

compensation for workplace injuries (section III), workplace privacy mandates (section IV),

fringe benefits mandates (section V), targeted benefits such as mandated medical and family

leave (section VI), wrongful discharge laws (section VII), unemployment insurance (section

VIII), minimum wage rules (section IX), and overtime pay requirements (section X). 33 There

remains much interesting work to be done on many of these topics, including the effects of some

of the relatively new laws mentioned above. Moreover, while the focus of most existing

employment law is on mandating particular features within the employer-employee relationship,

recent legal scholarship in employment law has given increased emphasis to prospects for using

“default” rather than mandatory rules. Relatively unexplored in existing work is theoretical and

empirical analysis of the effects of default versus mandatory rules in the regulation of the

  A separate area of inquiry concerns the causes (rather than the desirability and the effects) of
employment law rules. This question is analyzed by Botero et al. (2004).


                                                                                                     48
employment relationships. In this and other areas, there are important potential future synergies

between legal scholarship on employment law and economic analysis of this body of law.

        As noted above, this paper has focused on employment law rather than labor law.

However, it bears emphasis that the two fields of law do not operate in any way independently of

one another. The contours of labor law, in affecting the prevalence and power of unions, may

greatly affect what sorts of employment law rules are enacted and, perhaps most importantly, the

degree to which employment law rules are effectively enforced against employers. 34 With

respect to the importance of enforcement, it is difficult to disagree with Pound (1910, pp. 16, 34-

35), who noted long ago that employment law “in action” may look quite different from

employment law “on the books.”
