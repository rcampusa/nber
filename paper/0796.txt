                                        ABSTRACT




    This paper provides a formal      analysis   of the current account balance in a

dynamic model with optimizing agents. Two         analytical    ideas are stressed.

First, an econonr's current account balance depends as much on             future    econonic

trends   as on the current economic environment. A shift in fiscal policy, for
example, will have one effect on      the   current account if    it   is perceived to    be

temporary   and another if   it is   seen to be permanent. Second, temporary distur-
bances in the econorrw have permanent       effects, by    altering the entire      future path

of the   economy's international indebtedness.

Introduction

    Macroeconomic adjustments to changes in the economic environment are impor-

tantly conditioned by the interteniporal choices of economic agents. Pirely

transitory disturbances, for exanple, can have persistent effects when they

cause agents to recalculate plans over an extended planning horizon. For an

open economy linked to a wQrld market, one important aspect of intertemporal

plans is the tthe path of net indebtedness of domestic agents to the rest of the

world. When agents face an intertemporal budget constraint, a decision to alter

current indebtedness implies changes in future consumption possibilities, and so

will be based on expectations of the entire future path of key variables, and

not just today's variables. For this reason, an economy's current account,

which measures changes in national net indebtedness, depends as such on future

economic trends as on the current economic environment.

    In the first section of this paper, I present a formal model to show how

today's current account is a function of both current and future economic

variables. A given shift i fiscal policy, for example, will have one effect on

the current account if' it is perceived to be temporary and another if it is seen

to be permanent.      rioreover, when   temporary disturbances alter the current

account   today,   they also affect the future values of consunption, prices and

output, as agents adjust future spending in line with changing indebtedness.

These future changes are often neglected in analyses of the effects of a policy

change. As a side point, it will be clear that "external balance" or a zero

current account position is not, in general, a valid policy target. Household

welfare is improved by the possibility of running current account surpluses and

deficits in response to exogenous shocks.

      This paper stresses the determination of the current account under classical

assumptions of market clearing and continuous full employment. Without doubt,

the impact of various disturbances on the current account will be different under

Keynesian, or non—market clearing conditions, But even in the Keynesian case,

the importance of the intertemporaJ. dimension jn current account determination

will remain unchanged.


The Nature of' Current AccQunt Determination

      The current account measures the extent of an epononr's net borrowing or

lending vis—a—vis the rest of the world in a given period, and thus is the out-

come of savings and investment decisions. Static models that write the current

account as a fqnction of export and import often blur the intertenporal con-

siderations inherent in savings and investment behavior. I will approach the

current account from the other extreme, modelling it as an outcome of behavior

of far—sighted, intertenporally optimizing households and firms.

      The intertemporal choices reflect, of course, the interaction of intertem—

poral hudet constraints and tastes. The budget constraints can be stated two

ways, and each is  insightful. From a national perspective, financial              claims on

the rest of the world B change according to the relationship:

(U         BCAQ+r*B_CG
Here CA stands   for curernt account, Q   is gross   domestic   product   (hence     +   rB
is   gross national product), C is household consumption and G is government
                                                  —3—




fiscal   expenditure. (I ignore investment until the concluding section.) When

B >   0, the country is a creditor, and when B < 0, it is a debtor. For
simplicity, we suppose that all financial assets are short—term, with instan-

taneous real yield (in terms of nurneraire commodity) r*, with r* fixed.

      One way to impose an intertemporal budget constraint is to posit that in the

long—run, the country is neither a creditor nor debtor in present value terms:


           lim e*tB 0
           t +


That is, claims or debt vis—a—vis the rest of the world must grow more slowly

than the rate of interest. Imposing this condition on (1) yields immediately:!!



(2)
                     0
                         e_r*t (C +    G)dt     B(O) +   f e_*tQdt
Thus, the discounted value of domestic absorption must equal the sum          of   initial

net claims on the rest of the world and the discounted value of domestic

production. Note that by transposing G in (2), we have the budget constraint

for household spending;




                 f       er*tCdt   =   B(O) +   f e"(Q      -   G)dt = w(o)

Here, w(o) is initial household human and financial wealth. If an infinite—

lived household takes (3) as its budget constraint, its consumption possibili-

ties are affected by the present value of government expenditures, but not by

the path of taxes.' For this reason, a "Ricar'ian equivalence proposition"
                                                           4—


will   apply in the models that follow, so that consumer expenditure, the trade

balance and current account             will         be invariant to the path   of   taxes and govern-

ment deficits, given the path of government expenditure, (G(t)                               (I will use

the notation {x(t)} to signify the time path of x.)

       If we rearrange (2) once again, we get a second way                    to   view the intertem—

poral budget constraint:



()            f0e_r*t(Q
                          -   G   -   c)dt   =       - B(O).

According to this expression, which is stressed by Krugman [1981] ,                        the
discounted value of trade surpluses (Q—C—G) must exactly balance the initial net

indebtedness of the econonr, —B(O). Thade deficits in early years, for

example, must be matched in present value terms by surpluses in later years, if

B(O) =   0.       Policies which increase borrowing in early years imply a fall in

absorption relative to output in later years.

       It is convenient       to define the "permanent" or "perpetuity equivalent" of                a

variable X, which we will denote XT'(t), by the relationship:




(5)           5 e_r*(Tt)Xp(t)dT          =   5 e_r*(T_t)X(T)dT
                                                 t
              t




or X(t) =         r*Je*(T_t)x(T)dT.                   With this definition,- the household constraint


becomes:

(6)           fe_r*tc(t)dt
               0
                                  =   B(0) + [QP(0) - GP(O)l/r*

or

(6')          c(t)   =   r*W(t)
                                         —5—




Also,   with the trade balance Q—C—G denoted as TB, we have TB(O) = _r*B(O) =

QP(O)CF'(O)..GP(Q)

     This last expression suggests an intuitive approach to trade balance and

current account determination..±1 Since TB =        Q—C—G   and   =   QP.4PP   we know

that Th—TB = (Q_QP)    —   (c—ce) — (G—G).     The intertemporal budget constraint

implies TBP =         and since CA = TB +    r*B,   we can write CA    (Q_QP) — (c—Ce)

—   (GG).   In the model that follows, C—Ce resufts from the consumer's intertern—

poral allocation problem. The basic result of the consumer decision is that

consumption is smoothed relative to income, as in the permanent income model.

In the extreme case of smoothing, C E    C",    so CA = (Q_QP) — .(G—G).   More

generally, C—Ce will depend on wealth, the interest rate, and the rate of time

preference. For the utility function presented below, C—Ce = (&_r*)W, so CA =

(Q_QP) + (r*_6)W — (G—G).      Also, in the model below, Q_QP is determined

endogenously, as a function of foreign demand shocks and domestic productivity

shocks.

     From this simple expression for CA, we see that at least three phenomena

give rise to current account deficits, all related to household preferences for

certain consumption paths and to the intertemporal budget constraint.

     First, when current income is low relative to permanent income, (Q_QP) <        0,
households dissave in order to maintain consumption. Absorption remains higher

than temporarily—depressed income, and a deficit results. Thus, a temporary

decline in world demand for home goods that reduces the terms of trade, or a

temporary decline in domestic productivity that reduces real income tends to
                                        —6—



give rise to trade and current account deficits. Permanent demand or supply

shocks, on the contrary, need not induce a deficit, if both current and per-

manent income are reduced in equal proportion by the shocks. Household consump-

tion drops by the extent of the reduction in (permanent) real income.

    Second, a divergence of the rate of return to savings and the rate of time

preference gives rise to external imbalance: (r*_6)W. Even with a flat real

income profile, households may have an incentive to tilt their consumption

streams relative to income streams because of the rewards or costs of postponing

consumption.

    Third, when fiscal expenditure is high relative to its permanent level, the

current account will tend to be in deficit, by (G—G). Note that in (6), the

household budget constraint is a negative function of G, but for a given G is

unaffected by the path of G. Thus, farsighted households will adjust consump-

tion downward according to the permanent level of government spending, not the

current level.2/ When G >   G,   total absorption C +   G   will also tend to be above

average, so that a current temporary fiscal expansion will tend to cause trade

deficits now and surpluses in the future.

    Later, in the second section, we will see that shifts in investment demand

are a fourth factor in current account determination.


A Formal Model of the Current Account

    Now I turn to a model of the current account and dynamic responses to supply

and demand shocks. In general, dynamic models with optimizing agents are not

easily solved analytically, and recourse to simulations is often necessary. Th

facilitate the discussion, then, I focus on a specific model that can be ana—
                                             —T—


J..ytically solved, and describe how various modifications would affect key

results.

      National Output Q is assumed to be the sum of outputs of two productive

sectors, a pure traded good sector, producing qT, and a semi—tradeable sector,

producing Q3. The pure traded good is in perfectly elastic supply on the world

market, and is taken as numeraire. The semi—tradeable good is exported on the

world market subject to an export demand schedule that is downward sloping in

its relative price u(t). For simplicity, the instantaneous demand schedule is

assumed to be W*(t)/1T(t), where W* is an external and exogenous foreign demand—

shift variable. (The unitary elasticity helps to preserve linearity in the

model.)

      Households consume both goods, in amounts cT and C6. The value of total

consumption in traded goods units is c = cT + irc3.        The government also consumes

both goods with G        GT + nG6.    For simplicity, I will assume that G is divided

in fixed proportion among the two goods, with ITGS =           GT   (l....A)G.


Equilibrium in the S—market requires:



(7)         Q6(t) =   cS(t) + GS(t)   +


      Household demands are derived from an intertemporal optimization problem of

the form:




(8)        max Je_6tU(CT,CS)dt
          cT,cS 0
                                                  —8--




subject to the budget constraint in (14).                Here, utility is additively separable,

with the important implication (and simplification) that households can use a

two—step procedure: first select CR), and then divide CR) among CT(t) and

C3(s) as a function of n(t).             I also assume that 6, the pure rate of time

preference, is fixed.             (i return to this assumption later.)

       To get a tractable model it is useful to specialize utility further, by

writing LJ(CT, CS) as log(CT)CSC). This form has a number of helpful

features. First, total expenditure C(t) is linear in household wealth w(t).

This linearity is a property of a class of "intertemporally honothetic" utility

functions, of which log() is a member.1 Second, CR) is divided in constant

expenditure shares on TICS and CT respectively.

       When this assumption is maximized subject to (Lt), the optimal consumption

path is governed by the relationships:



            CT =     (r*   —
                               &)CT

            1TC5 =
                      [a/(l—a)]Crp
(9)
            and the budget constraint


            I
             0
                 efC           + lTC5jdt = W(O)




Solving the differential equation in (9),                it   is easy to show that


            CT(t) =        (l—a)6w(t)
            i'(t)C5(t) =        aq(t)
(io)
            W(t) =     e(*tW(0)
            CR) = e(1*6)tC(o)
                                                  —9—


Thus, both wealth and consumption expenditure rise according to the divergence

of r* and 6, with households accumulating wealth whenever the rate of return

exceeds the rate of time perference. Expenditures are linear in wealth, as

noted above, with constant of proportionality S. Note that (10) is not a final

form of consumption since W depends on Q (rr QT + nQS), which in turn depends on

{y(t)}, {lr(t)},   etc.
       To complete the model, the supply side must be further laid out.               I chose a

convenient production possibility frontier of the formM-"

(11)             QS =    (y(t)L     -   QT)
Here 1(t) represents an exogenous productivity shift variable, and L is exoge-

nous (and fixed) labor supply. With perfect competition dQT/dQS =                   ir(t), which
implies that QT =       i(t)L   —   QS•       Since Q =   QT    +   QS,   we have



(12)             Q =    y(t)L   +   (l—)nQ5

       To solve the model, we first find w(o). The trick here is that the value

of production itself depends on demand through demand effects on the relative

price u. We know from the definition of W that:


(13)             w(o) = [QP(Q) —         GP(0)1/r*   +   B(0)


Now, Qr'(0) = LIL +      (1_),S1P,        by equation (12), and the definition of the F—

operator, defined in equation (5). By market clearing, 11QS a + )G +                      W,
which we can substitute into the expression for QP(0)• Note also that w'(o) is

w(o)/6.2' Using the linearity of the P—operator, and the definition of QP(Q), we
                                                —10—



can rewrite (13) as


(lii)               w(o)   = r* [l-(i-) 3_i {Ly(0) + (l_)W*P(O)
                                                  —    [l—(1—)XJG(o)   +   r*BN(0)}


Equation (14) also holds for all t.

        Now from the consumer demand equations, cT and lT(t)CS(t) depend only on

wealth, and not on current values of any variables, with CT(t) = 6W(t) =

                    and w(o) given in (in).       ir(t)CS(t) is similarly found.

       We can summarize current account behavior in two ways. First, CA(O) = Q(0)

+   r*B(0)   —   G(0) — C(0).       Substituting yL +   (1_)S(0)    for Q(0), invoking

market clearing, and using (10) in the consumer demand expression, we find:


(15)                CA(O) =   (r*_6)W(0) + (1_)[W*(0)_w*P(O)j
                                -   Ll-A(i-)J LG(0)-G(0)I + Lii    (o)-i"(o)]


This is the general equilibrium version of the CA equation that was motivated

heuristically in the first section.            It differs from the earlier formula by

allowing for the general equilibrium feedbacks of W* and G on Q. Once again, we

see a time—preference motive in the first RHS term in (15) and a consumption—

smoothing motive in the next three terms. When r* exceeds the rate of time

preference, households accumulate wealth. Next, when world demand is above its

permanent level, or productivity is above its permanent level, then households

also accumulate. Finally, when G exceeds GF', total absorption is temporarily

high and the country runs a deficit. As before- equation (15) holds for any

time    t.
                                              —11—


       A related way to summarize current account behavior is to measure the cuts—

niulative deficits between 0 and t.          Since CA = B, we have that

                 Bk) - B(0) =         ftfl
                                       0

To find Bk), we may use the differential equation (i). Thus



                 Bk) = e*tB(0) + er*tft(Q_C_G)e_r*tdt.


Now we substitute 6W for C, and IL + (l—8)nQ5 for Q.              After tedious manipulation,

we end up with the expression:



(16)        JtCA(T)dT =   3(t) - 3(0)
             0

                      =   Fe   *_6)tl]W(Q) +
                                                  Ler*t1er11(t)1)1dT
                           +   (l_S)er*tJeh1W*(t)_w*101t

                               -   [l—(l-ft) Aler*tfte_r*TLG(
                                                     0
                                                                t)(o)jdt

The cumulative current account deficit between 0 and t is             thus: (i)   proportional

to w(o) with a positive dependence if and only if r* > 6; (2) increasing in the

discounted cumulative deviations of A and W from 1F'(0) and W*(O); and (3)

decreasing in the discounted cumulative deviation of G(T) from G(0). Once again,

cumulative deficits depend on the average deviations of actual from permanent

income over the interval.
                                                         1.

       To some extent, these results depend on specific household utility function
                                                  —12—




that we are examining. Obstfeld [1980, l981J among others has recently modelled

the current account under the Uzawa formulation that the households' rate of

time preference varies according to the level of instantaneous utility, with

          >   0.   When this alternative assumption is made, the level of w(o) has

the additional role of influencing the magnitude of '5 along an adjustment path.

A high value of initial wealth w(o), by itself, will tend to induce current

account deficits, by raising 5[u(c(Ufl] relative..to r*.

    Finally, let us now turn to some comparative dynamic exercises. Consider

three types of perturbations:


    (a) a temporary shock:

          x(t) becomes x(t) + 0          0 <      t   < T


                         x(t)           T<t
    (b) a permanent shock:

                         x(t) + 0   T<t

Such shocks to W, 6, or G affect the current account both through the wealth

term in (16), and the consumption—smoothing terms. In general, a temporary rise

in S, or W, or fall in G, will lead to a rise in CA, unless 6 is much greater

than r*. In that case, the positive wealth effect following such a shock leads

households to borrow even more against their now higher wealth, causing deficits

to rise.!21' A permanent shock that raises wealth improves the current account if

and only if r > 6. An anticipated shock that raises wealth typcially worsens

the current account, and does so necessarily if r* C 6.

       Perhaps more interesting are the comparative dynamic effects of various per-

turbations on ir(t), QT(t), and Q5(t). Here we find explicit expressions for the

long—run effects of temporary disturbances in 0, 6, and W. First, note from

the market equilibrium conditions that:


                 nQ5(t) =   ct*i(t)       + )C(t) + w*(t)

                Q5(t) = K0[cL6W(t) + G(t) +
(17)
                            K1[ct6W(t) + c(t) +
                 irk)   =

                 QTk) = 6(t)r4        —    8a6w(t) —    ?G(t)   —

                                                          where K0, K1 are constants


We see that semi—tradeable production and its relative price are increasing

functions of w(t), w*(t), and G(t). QTk) is, in turn, a declining function of

        From (17), it is clear that production and prices at tine t > T, are

affected by temporary shocks during 0 C t                 T according to the effects of these

shocks on W(t). Since W(t) =              et*_6)tW(o),    any temporary shock which reduces

w(o) will lead, after time T, to a lower profile of Q5(t), Tr(t), and a higher

profile of QT(t)

       As an example, consider a temporary fiscal expansion. The change in 0F'(0) is

given by:


                                  — (l_er*T)O.            C
                _jTe_r*tet =
                                         _1'4




Thus, according to (i), w(O) is given by _r*_1[l_(l_))_1(l_)(l_e_r*T)O.

Since w(t) is given by e(*_tw(O), we have:


(18)               Aw(t) = _r*   [1-.a(l_)]_h[l_(l_)X1(1_e_x*T)e*_tO,            for all   t


Thus, w(t)    is   necessarily reduced. Since G(t) is unchanged for t > T, it is

clear from (18) that the temporary fiscal expansion unambiguously reduces 17(t)

QS(t), and raises QT(t), for t > T. The effects on production and relative pri-

ces before time T depend on two offsetting effects. Demand for qS at given IT,

rises by Xe, while household demand falls by a&AW(t). The relative magnitude of

these offsetting effects depends on:      (i) the marginal productivities to consume

QS out of G and C; and (2) the duration of the temporary expansion. If the

expansion is very short (T0), then w(O) is also small, and 17(t) and QS(t) are

positively affected. In the benchmark case r* =        t,   we find that S > 0 and

Mr > 0 for t < T if and only if X > (l_e*T)c.

       It is useful to remember how these results differ in the case of no capital

mobility. With a zero current account balance, tC(t) =           —®   for   t < I and LC(t) =

0 for t > T, rather than c(t) =       _6e*_5)t&1(0).        That is, the fiscal expansion

crowds out consumption one—for—one. The general expressions for TTQ3, it, Q, and

QT become:
                                                    —15


                                 =   (l—a)1y(t)L          + (A—a)G(t) +   w*(t)1
                   QS(t)         =   (aó(t)L   + (A—a)G(t) +
 (19)
                                 =   [a(t)L    +   (X—a)G(t) +    w*(t)](1)
                   QT(t)         =   (1—aY1t(l-a)(t)L         -   (l-)(   A-.a)G(t)

                                     —
                                                                      where           are constants

First,    notice that temporary shocks during t < T have no effect on resource

allocation for t > T.        Households, in the aggregate, cannot reallocate their

consumption streams to smooth the effects of &. If they try, the domestic

interest rates adjust until households are satisfied with the path governed by

 C(t) =   — &(t).      Second, notice that the direction of the fiscal effect is now

given by A —   a, rather than A —         a(l_e*T).          This difference again reflects the

fact that with no capital mobility the drop in consumption is the opposite of

the rise in G.

    As a final exercise, let us examine the current account and resource alloca—

tional effects of a 1TReagantypeT announcement of future cuts in government

spending. (Remember that in our analysis, announced tax cuts have no effect

unless they presage cuts in government spending.) To simplify the illustration,

we set r* = 6.      Then:


           Aw(O)   = &i(t)   =   r[l—a(l—)-l [fT e*TEIT1 [1(l—)                 A].



We see that C(t), which equals 6tW(t),                is necessarily positive, with the implica-
tion that for t <     T, vr(t) rises along with QS(t while QT(t) falls. The trade
                                      —i6—



balance   and current account deteriorate initially. After time T, the change in

the current account is zero, while the trade balance goes into surplus to: sup-

port a service account deficit. Note that &Ir(t) is either positive or negative

for t > T, with the sign again depending on the relative magnitudes of a and A.

Specifically, for t > T, AJT(t) > 0 if and only if x <   _r*T For large T, the
long—run effect is almost surely a depreciation.


Extensions and Conclusions

    This paper has illustrated some of the intertenporal aspects of current

account determination, and the role of the current account in macroeconomic

adjustment. Given the difficulties inherent in working with intertemporal opti-

mizing models, the paper relies heavily on a simple framework, and a specific

set of functional forms. The principle that farsighted behavior by house-

holders and firms makes the current account a function of current and future

expected variables is certainly robust to changes in model specification. So too

is the notion that temporary disturbances have long—run effects through their

impact on the optimal intertemporal consumption path of households.

    Certain key results do, however, depend on the specific assumptions laid out

in the model.   I have already mentioned how the introduction of a time—varying

discount factor in the utility function can change the likelihood of surpluses

and deficits following shocks to real income. A second type of modification, in

which households have a finite rather than infinite planning horizon, has even

stronger effects on some of our conclusions±'. In this case, government tax
                                      —17—




and debt policy can have important effects on the level of the current account
balance and the path of resource allocation. Government can reallocate welfare
between alternative generations (defined by their planning horizons), raising
the   possibility of an optimal current account policy that maximizes an interge-

nerational social welfare function.

      Perhaps the most important deficiency of the simple model is the absence of

investment in physical capital. Shifts in irwstment opportunities over time

give rise to strong current account effects in   theoretical models, and empirical
work seems to confirm the strong, even dominant, role of investment in cross—

country current account behavior (cf. Sachs [198la, 198lb]). Investment is

important because under high capital mobility all domestic   investments are
undertaken   that exceed the world cost of capital, regardless of domestic savings

rates. If new domestic investment opportunities arise that just meet the world

market rate of return, the domestic current account worsens one—for—one with the

rise in investment.

      Adding optimal investment plans to an iritertemporal model enormously compli-

cates the algebra, and typically forces a retreat to simulations (cf. Sachs

[1980, 1982j .   The simulation exercises point to the following conclusions.

First, permanent increases in world demand are likely to induce deficits

initially, as the demand increases spur domestic capital formation and hence

foreign capital inflows. Similarly, a fall in world demand can actually result

in surpluses. Second, the resource a.llocational   effects of   temporary disturban-

ces tend   to be magnified when capital accumulation is permitted, since the long—

run supply elasticities of the various sectors are raised by the possibility of

sectoral   capital accumulation.

    Solving Ci), we have that


      B(t) =   B(O).er*t   +   er*t   f e*T[Q(t)_c(T)_G(T)]dT

    Multiplying both sides of this expression by e_r*t, and taking limits,

    we have


      0 = B(O) +   f e_T[q(T)_C(T)_G(T)]dT

    From this, (2) is immediate.

2 Of course, the government's budget constraint implies that the discounted

     value of taxes equals the discounted value of government expenditures net of

     initial government claims on the private sector and the rest of the world.


3 See Barro [l9T4] for a discussion of this doctrine. In addition to the

     assumption of infinite—lived households, the equivalence proposition requires

     that taxes be non—distorting, as is assumed in this model.


4    I   thank Michael Bruno for suggesting this simplified approach for deriving

     the current account equation.


5 The complete independence of C and G, for given G, depends on the assumption

     that the household utility from G and C is strongly separable.

T Specifically, the constant relative risk aversion function u(C) =

   (cl—I   —    y)1(1—i) all result in c(t) linear in w(t). Only in the case of log

   (), however, is the constant of proportionality between c(t) and w(t)
   invariant to the future path of interest rates. For a useful discussion of

  the utility function in current account behavior, see Svennson and Razin
