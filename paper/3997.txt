      THE EFFECT OF THE MINIMUM WAGE ON THE FAST FOOD INDUSTRY



                                          ABSTRACT


       Using data from a longitudinal survey of fast food restaurants in Texas, the authors

examine the impact of recent changes in the federal minimum wage on a low-wage labor market.

The authors draw four main conclusions. First, the survey results indicate that less than 5 percent

of fast food restaurants use the new youth subminimum wage even though the vast majority paid

a starting wage below the new hourly minimum wage immediately before the new minimum

went into effect. Second, although some restaurants increased wages by an amount exceeding

that necessary to comply with higher minimum wages in both 1990 and 1991, recent increases

in the federal minimum wage have greatly compressed the disuibution of starting wages in the

Texas fast food industry. Third, employment increased relatively in those firms likely to have

been most affected by the 1991 minimum wage increase. Fourth, changes in the prices of meals

appear to be unrelated to mandated wage changes. These employment and price changes do not

seem consistent with conventional views of the effects of increases in a binding minimum wage.

    After nearly a decade without change, legislation increased the federal

minimum wage from $3.35 to $3.80 on April 1, 1990, and increased it again to

$4.25 on April 1, 1991. The amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act

(FLSA) further permitted employers' to pay teenage workers a subminimum or

"training" wage equal to 85% of the minimum wage. Employers may currently

pay teenage workers as little as $3.61 per hour for up to 6 months under these

subminimum wage provisions. How have these changes to the minimum wage

affected the low-wage labor market? This paper examines the impact of recent

changes in the federal minimum wage on the fast food industry.

     Five main questions are raised in this paper. First, what is the utilization

rate of the teenage subminimum wage? Second, what determines whether a

restaurant will utilize the subminimum wage? Third, how has the minimum wage

affected wage dispersion? Fourth, what effect has the increase in the minimum

wage had on the level of employment at firms affected by the increase? Fifth,

how has the minimum wage increase affected the price of fast food items?

     To answer these questions we conducted a longitudinal survey of fast food

restaurants in Texas in December 1990 and July/August 1991. The Texas

economy experienced a prolonged downturn starting in the mid-1980s that
continued through 1991. The weak labor market in Texas should have
magnified the impact of the minimum wage. Moreover, the minimum wage is

a significant constraint on fast food establishments. Our survey of Texas fast

food restaurants finds that one-third of restaurants started workers at the

 minimum wage prior to the April 1990 minimum wage increase, whereas half of
                                       2

restaurants started workers at the minimum wage shortly after the 1990
minimum wage increase, and over three-quarters of restaurants started workers

at the minimum wage shortly after the April 1991 increase. Finally, the fast

food industry is generally regarded as a highly competitive industry, with little

firm attachment and high labor turnover. Thus, the fast food industry offers a

near ideal market to test the predictions of the textbook model of the minimum

wage.



                  Texas Fast Food Restaurant Survey Design



     To study the impact of recent changes in the minimum wage on a labor

market where we would expect the minimum wage to have a large impact, we

conducted a survey of fast food restaurants in Texas. We selected Texas

because it is a large state with relatively many low-paid workers. In 1989, for

example, the average hourly wage rate of retail trade workers in Texas was

$5.85, compared to a national average of $6.52. For teenage workers, the

average wage in Texas in 1989 was $4.19 compared to $4.61 nationwide, and

37.6% of teenage workers in Texas were paid between $3.35 and $3.79 per

hour, compared to 25.7% nationwide.1 Furthermore, Texas does not have a

state minimum wage law that would override the FLSA.2

     Moreover, the fast food industry is a low-wage industry even within retail

trade. The industry has lobbied against increases in the minimum wage and has
                                       3

been a staunch supporter of a subminimum wage for youths (Bureau of National

Affairs, 1985). And the fact that the fast food industry has extremely high
turnover, and hires many first-time workers, makes it more likely that fast food

restaurants can take advantage of the youth subminimum.3

     Figure 1 outlines the timing of our surveys, and of changes in the minimum

wage. In 1990 we designed an initial questionnaire to collect retrospective (pre-

minimum wage increase) and current information on starting wages, as well as

information on the utilization of the new subminimum wage and on nonwage

responses to the minimum wage. This survey was administered in December

1990. In 1991 we revised the questionnaire, retaining most of the questions

from the original survey, and adding new questions on prices of standard goods

at the restaurants and wages of workers already at the firm. The second

questionnaire was administered between July 8, 1991 and August 2, 1991.

      We conducted the survey as follows. We first collected the phone numbers

of every Burger King, Wendy's, and Kentucky Fried Chicken outlet listed in the

 Yellow Pages of the metropolitan phone books for Texas for January 1990.

 We then drew a systematic sample consisting of every other phone number

 listed in the Yellow Pages. After deleting duplicate numbers, disconnected
 numbers, and wrong numbers, this yielded a universe of 294 potential
 observations.0 We then attempted to interview the manager or assistant

 manager of these restaurants by phone between December 12 and December

 18, 1990. If a restaurant did not respond on the first call, we called back as

many as two more times to try to elicit a response. We obtained a total of 167

responses, for a response rate of 57 percent from the 1990 survey.7

     For the follow-up survey we attempted to interview every restaurant listed

in the 1990 phone books for Texas, including those that were originally sampled

in 1990 and those that were not. A total of 330 restaurants were interviewed

between July and August 1991 in the second wave of the survey; 110 of these

firms were previously interviewed in the first wave of the survey. The overall

response rate in the second wave of the survey was 56%, whereas the response

rate was 66% for the subset of firms that responded in the first wave of the

survey.8 We collected additional information about the local labor market in

which each restaurant was located (e.g., the unemployment rate and size of the

city) using the County and City Data Book, 1988.

     To assess the reliability of responses to key questions on the survey, we

randomly selected 30 restaurants that responded in the second wave of the

survey, and re-interviewed them in August 1991. The sampled firms were asked

the same Set of questions regarding wages, prices, and employment that they

were asked previously. We then calculated the correlation between responses

on the original survey and on this re-interview survey. These correlations are an

estimate of the ratio of the true variance of the variable to the total reported

variance, under the assumption that reporting errors are uncorrelated with each

other and with the true variable in each measurement. The correlations were

generally in the .70 to .80 range. For example, the correlation between the two
                                       5

measurements was .76 for starting pay, .76 for log employment, .65 for the

price of french fries, .72 for the price of soda, .85 for the percent of workers

who are black, and .93 for the percent of workers who are hispanic. Table 1

presents a cross-tab of the starting wage for part-time workers of sampled

restaurants before and after the April 1990 arid April 1991 increases in the

minimum wage.° The table indicates that 71.4% of these restaurants were

compelled to increase their starting wage by the 1990 rise in the minimum wage

from $3.35 to $3.80. Furthermore, one-third of the restaurants moved their

starting wage from exactly the old minimum to exactly the new minimum. In

December 1990, 47% of restaurants were starting workers at exactly the

minimum wage ($3.80).
     The April 1991 increase in the minimum from $3.80 to $4.25 had an even

larger effect on restaurant wages. Some 95% of restaurants were forced to

increase their starting wage by the 1990 increase in the minimum wage, and

75.8% of restaurants paid new hires exactly the minimum wage ($4.25) in the

summer of 1991. Notice also that the fraction of restaurants that paid exactly

the old minimum wage ($3.80) was slightly higher in July/August 1991 than in

December 1990 (47% vs. 55.4%). This finding suggests that the labor market

in Texas was slipping before the 1991 higher minimum wage took effect,
perhaps due to the onset of the 1991 recession. The increase in the minimum

wage in 1991 would be especially binding if the Texas labor market would have

continued to decline. These tabulations indicate that our survey has identified

a universe of employers that is likely to be affected by the minimum wage, and

that has potential to use the youth subminimum.



                  Utilization of the Youth Subminimum Wage



     Our initial survey found that a very small percentage of fast food
restaurants took advantage of the teenage subminimum wage provisions (see

Katz and Krueger, 1991). For example, only 1.8% of fast food restaurants in

our survey used the subminimum wage in December 1990. This estimate is

consistent with Freeman, Gray, and lchriiowski's (1981) finding that only 3% of

students' work hours were covered by the subminimum wage permitted for full-

time students in the late 1970s. The youth subminimum or "training" wage that

we investigate is much easier to use than the full-time student exemption.

Notably, the new youth subminimum applies to all teenage workers (not just full-

time students), and requires less cumbersome restrictions on employees' hours.

Moreover, under the new law, no additional training is required for the first 90

days, and only a minimal amount of training is necessary if the subminimum is

to be used for an additional 90 days.

     Our second survey finds that utilization of the youth subminimum increased

to 4.8% of restaurants in July/August 1991. The small increase in the share of

restaurants' utilizing the subminimum wage between 1990 and 1991 is on the

margin of being statistically significant (t=1.90). Interestingly, only 34.1% of
                                        7

managers responded that they were unaware of the subminimum wage law in

December 1990, and roughly the same fraction (31.5%) responded that they

were unaware of the subn,inimum in the summer of 1991.

     In our initial survey of fast food restaurants in 1990 we described the

subminimum wage law to managers as a preamble to our question on
subminimum wage use. Since we interviewed a random sample of restaurants

in 1990, and then interviewed a wider sample in 1991, we can test whether

informing managers about the existence of the subminimum wage increased the

restaurant's awareness of this option. We find no relationship between whether

a manager responds that he or she is aware of the subminimum wage law and

whether the restaurant was interviewed in our initial survey. We also find that

the firms that were included in the initial survey were slightly more likely to use

the subminimum wage (4.2% vs. 5.6%), but that this difference is not

statistically significant (t=0.53). Thus informing restaurant managers about the

subminimum wage law in 1990 appears to have had no discernable effect on

their restaurant's propensity to use the subminimum in 1991.

     Another possible reason for the increase in the utilization in the
subminimum wage is that the benefit to employers of using the subminimum

wage was greater in 1991 than in 1990.             First, the gap between the
subminimum wage and the minimum wage is greater in absolute value and in

percentage terms in 1991 than it was in 1990.10 Second, the substantial

increase in the minimum wage on April 1, 1991 means that the minimum was
                                         8

likely to be farther above the equilibrium wage in the summer of 1991 than in

late 1990. Indeed, our survey results suggest that relatively more workers in

Texas would accept a fast food job at a subminimum wage if offered. In 1991,

37.9% of managers of restaurant that were not using the subminimum wage

believed they could "attract qualified teenage workers at a subminimum wage."

In 1990, this figure was just 17.5%.h1

     In spite of the increase in the percentage of managers who believe they can

attract teenage workers at a rate below the minimum wage, the majority of

respondents said they believed that they could not attract teenage workers a

rate below the minimum wage. Because 95% of these firms were offering new

workers an hourly wage rate below $4.25 just before the minimum was
increased to $4.25, it is quite surprising that a large majority of respondents

believes that they could not attract workers at a subminimum wage. One

explanation for this finding is that restaurants were "supply-constrained" when

they offered a wage below $4.25, and thus could not attract enough workers

at the former wage. Alternatively, managers may feel that relative pay is
important to workers, and that workers will not accept jobs if they are paid less

than others doing the same work. Workers may also be unwilling to accept jobs

at the subminimum wage if it is easier to search for a job paying the new higher

minimum wage from unemployment than from employment.

     About 20% of managers at firms that are not using a subminimum wage

said they believed it is not fair to use a subminimum wage, and about half of
                                       9

managers who offered a response said that they believed that if the submir,imum

wage could be paid to all workers, not just teenage workers, their restaurant

would use the subminimum wage. On the other hand, 23% of managers
responded that the difficulty of applying for the subminimum wage is at least

one reason why their restaurant does not offer a subminimum wage. This figure

is up from 7.3% In 1990. Finally, about one-third of managers who offered a

response said that their restaurant would use the submirilmum wage if it were

easier to administer; for example, if the time limitation or training requirement

were eliminated.
     To better understand the reasons for the low utilization of the subminimum

wage, we have estimated logit models to predict which restaurants use the

subminimum wage. In particular, we are interested in whether the gap between

the store's starting wage prior to the minimum wage increase in April 1991 and

the new minimum wage (84.25) is positively related to the likelihood it uses the

subminimum wage. One would expect that firms will find it more attractive to

offer a subminimum wage if the minimum wage forces them to raise their wage

by a large amount. Our analysis is based on data collected in the 1991 survey.

Table 2 summarizes the logit estimates.

      The explanatory variables in the logit models are not very successful at

explaining utilization of the subminimum wage. For example, the reported chi-

 square tests of the hypothesis that the independent variables jointly have no

 effect have prob-values ranging from .34 to .02, depending on the model.

Nevertheless, some tentative conclusions can be drawn from the logit estimates.

First, although the amount by which a restaurant falls short of the new minimum

wage is positively associated with utilization of the subminimum wage, this

variable has a statistically insignificant effect. Second, restaurants that have a

higher proportion of workers who are hispanic or black are more likely to utilize

the subminimum wage. Moreover, these findings for the proportion of minority

workers hold up after we include dummy variables for 7 regions of Texas. Third,

restaurants that employ a workforce consisting of over 90% teenage workers are

more likely to use the subminimum wage, but this variable does not have a

statistically significant effect.



           The Effect of Minimum Wage Increases on Compensation



     Table 3 presents averages of several measures of compensation, broken

down by whether the restaurant started workers at $3.80 per hour, between

$3.81 and $4.24 per hour, or at least 84.25 per hour just before the minimum

wage increase took effect on April 1, 1991. Restaurants that paid the minimum

wage ($3.80) prior to April 1991 increased their starting wage by 12% (46

cents), on average, to just over the new minimum wage (84.26), by July/August

1991. In contrast, over the same period restaurants that were initially above the

new minimum wage increased their starting wage by just 4.6% (20 cents), on

average. There are two potential explanations for why firms that were already

Proportion maintaining the wage hierarchy is the proportion of restaurants that
after April 1, 1991 paid a wage above the restaurants new starting wage to
workers who prior to April 1, 1991 had earned between the restaurant's starting
wage and $3.80. Proportion with spillover to workers earning $4.50 per hr. is
the fraction of restaurants that increased the pay of workers earning $4.50
once the minimum wage increase took effect.
                                      11

paying above the new minimum wage increased their starting wage after the

minimum wage increased. First, as Grossman (1983) and Akerlof and Yellen

(1990) contend, relative wages may influence work effort so firms already above

the minimum wage may adjust their wages to maintain effort levels. Second,

it is possible that market forces would have led to a small increase in wages in

the fast food industry in Texas even in the absence of the minimum wage

increase.

     In Table 4 we report estimates of regressions of the log of the starting

wage on several independent variables, using data from both waves of our
survey. The 1990 and 1991 increases in the minimum wage led to a substantial

reduction in the dispersion of starting wages across restaurants. For example,

the standard deviation of the log wage decreased from .074 in April 1 990, to

.046 in December 1990, to .032 in April1991, and to just .022 in July/August

1991.

    The decline in wage dispersion is reflected in the wage regression estimates.

For example, the regressions show that before April 1990 company-owned

restaurants paid a higher starting wage than franchisee-owned restaurants (see

also Krueger, 1991), and that restaurants in areas with a higher unemployment

 rate have lower wages. However, both of these effects are roughly halved after

 the minimum wage increased to $3.80 (December 1990), and the coefficients

 continued to shrink after the minimum wage increased to $4.25. Similarly, the

 Kentucky Fried Chicken chain offered a 6% (t=3.5) higher wage rate than

Burger King before April 1990. and this differential was insignificant by
July/August 1991. And the differentials in pay across regions of Texas were

virtually eliminated by the increases in the minimum wage. For example, before

the April 1990 increase in the minimum wage, restaurants in Dallas paid 8%

more than restaurants in the Rio Grande area, but this gap became insignificant

in July/August 1991.

     Our survey also collected information on how within-firm wage policy
responded to the increases in the minimum wage. In particular, suppose a firm

paid $3.80 per hour to new workers before April 1990, and then increased its

starting wage to $4.25. What did such a firm do to the pay of incumbent
workers whose wages had risen to a rate of say 84.00? Our results indicate

that 16 percent of firms in this situation increased the wage of the worker

earning $4.00 to above the new starting wage, and thus maintained their wage

hierarchies; the remainder compressed whatever wage differentials existed

between long-service workers and new hires. We asked a similar question in the

first wave of the survey (e.g., what happened to the earnings of someone whose

wage rate rose from $3.35 to $3.50 once the minimum wage increased to

$3.80?), and found that 41 percent of restaurants maintained their wage

hierarchy. Thus firms were much more likely to preserve wage differentials
between new workers and long-service workers after the 1990 increase in the

minimum wage than after the 1991 increase. Less concern for internal equity

in 1991 may result because the rise in the minimum wage to $4.25 is likely to
                                       13
have conferred more rents to infra-marginal workers than the rise to $3.80.

     A related question is whether firms increased the pay of workers who were

already earning above $4.25 an hour before the minimum wage increase took

effect. We find that firms were less likely to increase these workers' relative

earnings than they were to increase the relative earnings of someone earning

between $3.80 and $4.25 (see row 5 of Table 3). Not surprisingly, there is less

of a spillover effect of the minimum wage increase further up the wage

hierarchy.

     Finally, we examined whether firms delayed the time until workers receive

their first pay raise or reduced the amount of the first raise in response to an

increase in the minimum wage. Rows 6 and 7 of Table 3 provide some
information on these questions. Although restaurants that were forced to

increase their starting wage by the rise in the minimum wage are more likely to

delay the first raise they give to workers, and to reduce the amount of the first

raise, only a small proportion of firms took these actions. Furthermore, 91 % of

restaurants offered at least some fringe benefits to workers, but relatively few

restaurants reduced fringes.



                  Employment Effects of the Minimum Wage



     We next examine the effects of recent increases in the Federal minimum

wage on employment in the Texas fast-food industry. The conventional
                                      14
competitive model of the low-wage labor market predicts that, ceteris oribus,

a mandated wage increase from a change in the minimum wage should reduce

employment in affected establishments. We examine this issue by comparing

employment growth of establishments classified by the likely degree of impact

of minimum wage changes.           By comparing employment changes of
establishments in one industry and state, we eliminate the effects of industry

and state shocks to employment that may be correlated over the period
examined with the extent of wage changes induced by the minimum wage. Our

methodology is similar to the approach used by the U.S. Department of Labor

(1959) and Lester (1964) in earlier establishment-based studies of the

employment effects of minimum wage laws.'2

     We first analyze the employment effects of the minimum wage increase

from $3.80 to $4.25 in April 1991 using the matched sample of establishments

that responded to both our December 1990 and July/August 1991 surveys. For

100 establishments, we have complete data on the number of full-time

employees, number of part-time employees, and on the average starting wage

for nonmanagement employees both several months before (in December 1990)

and several months after (in July/August 1991) the most recent increase in the

Federal minimum wage. We measure the likely impact of the minimum wage

 increase on an establishment's level of employment by the proportional increase

 required in the firm's starting wage for the firm to minimally comply with the

 new minimum wage of April 1, 1991. The log minimum wage gap is defined as
                                       15

min(0, log(4.25/W) where W is the establishment's starting wage for
nonmanagemeflt employees in December 1990. The log minimum wage gap

ranges from 0,11 ($0.45 in levels) for firms at the old minimum wage of $3.80

to 0 for those already paying at least $4.25 prior to the most recent minimum

wage increase.

     Table 5 presents regression estimates of the effects of wage changes

mandated by the minimum wage increase of April 1 991 on employment growth

from December 1990 to July/August 1991 for our sample of matched
establishments. The table presents both the OLS estimates of reduced form

models linking employment changes directly to the log minimum wage gap, arid

two stage least squares estimates of models in which the actual change in the

log starting wage is instrumented for by the log minimum wage gap. The first

two columns present estimates of equations where the dependent variable is the

change in log total employment in bodies (with full-time and part-time workers

counted equivalently). The reduced form model indicates that, contrary to the

predictions of the conventional competitive labor market model, employment

growth was positively related to the size of wage increases mandated by the

minimum wage.13 The instrumental variables estimates in column (2) show a

similar story. The estimates of positive minimum wage effects on employment

are statistically significant at the 10 percent level (prob-values of approximately

0.07) in both models. The estimates are also moderately large with an elasticity

of 1.70 to 1.85.

    Columns (3) and (4) of Table 5 present analogous employment change

equations with employment measured in full-time equivalent units (FTEs).14

The results are even more striking than those using employment in bodies.

Employment in FTEs increased by substantially more in establishments with

larger mandated wage increases and the estimates are highly statistically

significant. A 10% mandated wage increase is predicted to raise relative
employment in FTEs by approximately 25%. The estimated effects of minimum

wage induced wage changes on employment presented in Table 5 are not very

sensitive to the choice of covariates. For example, it we include seven region

dummies along with the covariates in column (4) of Table 5 the coefficient on

the change in log starting wage is 2.19 with a standard error of 1.10.15

     The positive relationship between the wage increase required by the new

minimum wage and change in employment is displayed in a scatter diagram in

Figure 2. Although some outliers are apparent, the figure illustrates that log

employment growth in FTEs was higher on average in establishments with large

minimum wage gaps ($0.45) in December 1990 than those with starting wages

at or above $4.25. Average log employment growth varied from -.168 (n = 11)

for establishments with wages of $4.25 or higher in December 1 990, to .058

(n=23) for establishments paying exactly $4.00 initially, to .168 (n=40) for

those paying the old minimum wage of $3.80 initially. The corresponding

median values for employment growth are: 0, .05, and .15, respectively.

Because of concern over the possible effects of outliers, we have estimated the

employment growth models by minimizing the sum of absolute deviations (LAD),

in addition to the OLS estimates. The LAD estimates of the employment effects

of wage increases are smaller than the OLS estimates but still positive. For

example, the coefficient on the log minimum wage gap is 1 .16 with a standard

error of .55 if the model in Column 3 of Table 5 is by LAD instead of by OLS.le

This finding suggests that our positive employment effect is not merely a result

of undue influence from outliers.

     The estimated positive effects of wage changes on employment are larger

if employment is measured by FTEs than by the total number of workers,
implying that the share of total employment accounted for by full-time
employees increased in establishments with large mandated wage increases

relative to other establishments. This finding suggests that minimum wage

increases induced firms to substitute full-time for part-time employees. In fact,

the overall level of employment (in bodies) per establishment in our entire survey

samples remained fairly stable from December 1990 to July/August 1991, but

full-time employment per establishment increased from 6.91 to 8.91 and part-

time employment per establishment fell from 15.41 to 12.89.17

     A couple of caveats should be noted in interpreting our finding of a positive

effect of the higher minimum wage on employment in the fast food industry.

First, our sample is limited to restaurants that were in operation before and after

the minimum wage increased. It is possible that the higher minimum wage

caused restaurants to close, thereby reducing total employment in the industry.
                                     18

Further, the rate of formation of new restaurants might have slowed down
because of the minimum wage. Both of these forces might have caused

employment to grow at the set of restaurants that remained in operation.
Second, although our estimated coefficients for the wage variable in the

employment equations are statistically significant, they have relatively large

standard errors.

     These caveats aside, a model in which the employers of low-wage workers

are assumed to have market power and act as monopsonistic buyers of labor

(Stigler, 1946; Sullivan, 1989) is potentially consistent with the findings
presented in Table 5 and Figure 2. In the standard monopsony model, a binding

minimum wage can both increase employment and wages. Our estimates in

Table 5 are consistent with a model of monopsony with an elasticity of supply

of labor to individual fast-food restaurants ranging from 1.70 to 2.65. These

elasticities indicate a substantial amount of monopsony power in the short run

(over an eight month period).

     A possible interpretation of this type of monopsony model is that low-wage

employers have some degree of monopsony power over their existing employees

and do not increase wages to attract further outside employees because internal

equity concerns essentially require them to raise the wages of all existing

employees to the level of wages of new recruits. The cost of raising the wages

of infra-marginal workers outweighs the benefits of attracting new employees

with higher starting wages. The responses to both of our surveys of Texas fast-
                                      19
food restaurants indicates much employer concern with the fairness of the

internal wage structure. The same equity concerns that appear to make

establishments reluctant to use the subminimum wage may make them reluctant

to raise wages when they have some monopsony power over a subset of

workers. The major problem with this monopsony interpretation of our
employment findings is that a large degree of monopsony power seems
somewhat implausible in the high-turnover labor market of the fast-food industry.

     An alternative interpretation is a model with two types of labor with

different productivities (e.g. teenagers and adults or part-time and full-time

workers) and an internal equity constraint that forces firms to pay both groups

the same wage (or limits the wage gap between the groups). Such models have

been proposed by Akerlof and Yeller'i (1990) and Grossman (1983). Firms may

choose to pay a low wage and attract workers of type one (teenagers, part-

timers) and no workers of type two (adults, full-timers), or perhaps only a small

number of type two workers over whom they have some monopsony power. A

binding minimum wage could increase the wage to a level that could attract

more type two workers. This appears consistent with our finding that wage

increases mandated by changes in the minimum wage law appear to be

positively related to employment growth and that the growth in employment is

concentrated among full-time workers.

     Our failure to find conventional negative effects of minimum wage increases

on employment is consistent with earlier research using establishment data.
                                      20
Lester (1964, PP. 507-27) reviews a series of studies of the effects of the

minimum wage increases of March 1, 1956 (from $0.75 to $1.00 on
employment changes in establishments in low-wage industries and regions.

These studies compared employment growth in specific industries and regions

among establishments classified by the percentage increase in average hourly

wages mandated by the change in the law. The studies show a wide range of

patterns of employment changes classified by minimum wage impact. Lester
(1964, pp. 523-24) concludes that, "The statistics ... do not lend much support

to the notion that a forced increase in the minimum wage will soon lead to a

reduction in a firm's employment in proportion to the relative size of the wage

increase."

     More recently, Card (1991) has examined the effect of a substantial
increase in the state minimum wage in California (from $3.35 to $4.25). He

finds that the employment rate of teenagers in California increased both

absolutely and relative to the employment rate of teenagers in other
"comparable" states after the minimum wage increase took effect.18 Thus we

conclude that studies based on cross-section comparisons of changes in
employment of affected and unaffected groups from changes in minimum wage

laws in the United States do not seem to find the conventional negative

employment effects apparent from many time-series studies (e.g. Brown, Gilroy,

and Kohen, 1983).'° Future work should attempt to reconcile the different

findings from these alternative methodologies.
                                      21

     Further information on employment changes is available from our two

surveys of Texas fast-food establishments. In the first survey on the effects of

the minimum wage increase of April 1990, we asked each firm whether the

number of workers on a shift or the number of shifts per day were reduced

because of the minimum wage increase. We find little difference in responses

between those directly constrained by the minimum wage increase and those

already paying starting wages above the new minimum wage prior to April 1990.

The vast majority of constrained and unconstrained firms reported not having

employment affected by the minimum wage increase. We asked similar question

in our July/August 1991 survey of the effects of the April 1991 minimum wage

increase. In this case, the response work mildly in favor of the conventional

model: 10.5% of firms constrained by the new minimum (those previously

paying under $4.25) responded that they had reduced the number of
nonmanagement workers on a shift since April 1, 1991, whereas six percent of

firms initially paying an hourly wage of $4.25 or above responded that they had

reduced employment since April 1, 1991.

     We conclude that our surveys provide little evidence of significant adverse

effects of minimum wage increases on employment. Direct measures of
employment and wages at the survey dates indicate that employment increased

substantially more rapidly from December 1990 to July/August 1991 in firms

where the minimum wage increase of April 1991 had a substantial bite than in

firms less constrained by the minimum wage increase. Establishment responses
                                       22
to questions concerning the direction of changes in employment of
nonmanagement employees lead to more ambiguous findings.



                      Price Effects of the Minimum Wage



     The final issue we examine using our survey data is the effect of the April

1991 minimum wage increase on the prices of meals at fast food restaurants.

The conventional model of the effect of a binding minimum wage implies the

increase in labor costs should translate into an increase in product prices. To a

first order approximation the increase in price should be proportional to minimum-

wage labor's share of factor costs. In contrast, some monopsony models predict

that a small increase in the minimum wage will increase industry employment

and output and reduce industry product prices.

     In our survey of July/August 1991, we asked about the prices of three

standard items at each restaurant: a medium soda, a small order of french fries,

and a main course. The main course was a basic hamburger at restaurants in

the Burger King and Wendy's chains, and six pieces of chicken in the Kentucky

Fried Chicken chain. The survey included questions about both current prices,

time since the last price change, and the price in January of 1991.

     Table 6 presents estimates of the effects of wage changes induced by the

April 1991 increase in the minimum wage on the prices of a full meal, soda,

french fries, and a main course.2° The dependent variable in each model is the

log price change from January to July/August 1991 of the relevant item. Each

equation is estimated by two stage least squares with the change in log starting

wage treated as endogenous and instrumented for by the log minimum wage gap

measured in prior to April 1, 1991. The table provides little evidence of relative

prices increasing in those establishments with larger mandated wage increases.

The results indicate that the price of a full meal tended to decline in restaurants

with large mandated wage increases relative to restaurants not much affected

by the minimum wage change. The price effects are not large and are fairly

imprecisely estimated. The reported equations include region dummies to control

for local demand shocks. The basic results are not very different (small and

insignificant price effects) when the region dummies or the other covariates are

omitted from the models.



                                   Conclusion



     Several tentative conclusions can be drawn from our analysis. First, it

appears that relatively few employers use the youth subminimum wage, even in

an industry where many employers could probably readily attract teenage
workers at a subminimum wage. The subminimum training wage program is

experimental and due to expire in on April 1, 1993. Since a small minority of

employers has taken advantage of the subminimum wage, we see little grounds

for strong support or opposition to the subminimum wage. Second, we have
                                     24
found evidence that several fast food restaurants increased wages for workers

by an amount exceeding that necessary to comply with the higher minimum

wage in 1990. However, there was less of a spillover of the minimum wage to

other wages after the 1991 increase in the minimum wage than after the 1990

increase.

     Finally, the evidence on employment and price changes does not seem

consistent with a conventional view of the effects of increases in a binding

minimum wage. Our results indicate that employment increased at firms most

affected by the minimum wage increase, while price changes appear to be
unrelated to changes in wages resulting from the minimum wage increase. Of

course, larger increases in the minimum wage may well result in employment

decreases and price increases. Indeed, Castillo-Freeman and Freeman (1992)

find that the relatively high minimum wage in Puerto Rico has resulted in

substantial employment losses. Under certain conditions, monopsony models

predict that a small increase in the minimum wage leads to an increase in

employment, whereas a large increase in the minimum wage leads to a decrease

in employment.

     The behavior that we have documented in this article seems difficult to

explain with the standard model that economists use to evaluate the impact of

a minimum wage. It would be useful to know if our empirical findings hold up

in other establishment-based analyses of the impact of the minimum wage.21

Finally, since our analysis is based on a subset of employers that remained in
                                         25
continuous operation before and after an increase in the minimum wage, it would

be useful to study whether increases in the minimum wage lead to an increase

in the failure rate of existing firms and a reduction in the birth rate of new firms.

                                     Notes

1. We are grateful to David Card for providing these statistics to us. The
statistics are based on data from the Current Population Survey.

2. The state minimum wage in Texas is $3.35 per hour, and there is no
provision for a subminimum. Therefore, the Texas state minimum wage law is
irrelevant for jobs that are covered by the federal minimum wage. In some other
states, the state minimum wage is high enough to prevent employers from
utilizing the federal youth subminimum wage.
3. Indeed, Love (1986) estimates that 1 in 15 workers obtained their first job
from McDonald'sl Although we're not sure whether this estimate is accurate,
it must undoubtedly be the case that many young workers obtain their first job
in the fast food industry.
4. Copies of the 1990 and 1991 questionnaires (including mean responses) are
available from the authors upon request.
5. Burger King, Kentucky Fried Chicken and Wendy's are the second, third and
fourth largest restaurant chains nationwide. We initially intended to also include
McDonald's, the nation's largest chain. But because none of the McDonald's
restaurants would respond to our pre-test survey we dropped them from our
sample.
6. Of the restaurants listed in the phone book, 25 were unreachable because of
closings, transcription errors or some other reason for a disconnection, and 10
were wrong numbers.

7. Although there may be some concern about possible differences between
respondents and nonrespondents, our tabulations did not reveal any systematic
differences between restaurants that responded on the first call and those that
required at least one follow-up phone call before responding.
8. Restaurants that paid a higher wage in December 1990 were more likely to
respond in the second wave of the survey, but the relationship between wage
and attrition was statistically insignificant. If low-wage restaurants were more
likely to close because of the increase in the minimum wage, we would expect
this pattern of attrition.
9. We use the wage of part-time workers if the restaurant reports a part-time
wage, and the wage of full-time workers if the part-time wage is missing. In
1991, all restaurants in the sample that provided wage information paid the
same wage to full- and part-time workers. In April 1990, 97% of restaurants
paid the same wage to full- and part-time workers, and in December 1990 93%
                                      29
of restaurants paid the same wage to full- and part-time workers. Table 1
includes information on all the restaurants that provided data on starting wages.
In each subsequent table, we use the maximum possible sample of restaurants
that have information on all the relevant variables for that table.
10. Although the subminimum wage is set at 85% of the minimum wage, the
subminimum was fixed at $3.35 (11.8% below the minimum wage) for the first
increase in the minimum wage.
11. Another possible reason for this trend is that the supply of teenage
employees to fast food restaurants is likely to be more plentiful in the summer
(when the 1991 survey was conducted) than in the winter (when the 1990
survey was conducted).
12. See also Cullen (1961) for a thoughtful evaluation of the evidence on
minimum wage effects based on the early literature.
13. At the suggestion of a referee, we also estimated specifications that
included the proportionate gap between the minimum wage and the restaurant's
starting wage just prior to the April 1991 increase in the minimum wage (i.e.
proportionate increase to reach $3.80). This new variable could be thought of
as a lag of the minimum wage gap that we have included. The log minimum
wage gap was highly correlated both periods. Nevertheless, both log minimum
wage gaps were estimated to have a positive effect if they were included
together in the model, and the coefficient was larger for the December 1991 log
wage gap.
14. The number of full-time equivalents equals the number of full-time
employees plus 0.57 times the number of part-time employees. This definition
is based on our tabulations of data from the 1982-83 survey of employees in the
fast-food industry conducted by the National Institute for Work and Learning
(NIWL). We find in this data a ratio of average weekly hours of part-time to those
of full-time employees of 0.57. See Charner and Fraser (1984) for a discussion
of the NIWL survey.
15. One could argue that region dummy variables should be included to capture
possible correlations between local labor market shocks during our sample period
and initial wage levels.
16. The standard error was estimated by bootstrapping the model, using 50
replications.
 17. We note, however, that seasonality in full-time employment may also
 account for the relative increase in full-time employment between December
 1990 and August 1991.

18. Card (1992) similarly fails to find conventional negative employment effects
of the 1990 federal minimum wage increase in an analysis that uses regional
variation in the likely impact of the increase on the low-wage labor market.

19. A comparison of employment changes across industries by the likely degree
of impact of the minimum wage does seem to follow the negative correlation
predicted by a standard competitive model for the large increases in the
minimum wage in Puerto Rico studied by Castillo-Freeman and Freeman (1992).

20. A full meal, for our purposes, consists of a soda, french fries, and a main
course.

21. We note that a preliminary analysis of a new data set on restaurants in
Mississippi and North Carolina by Spriggs, Swinton and Simmons (1992) finds
results generally similar to ours.
