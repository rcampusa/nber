                                             ABSTRACT

In the U.S. teen mothers are more likely to give birth to low birth weight babies than non-teen mothers.
There is also substantial evidence that smoking is a risk factor correlated with low birth weight. Low
birth weight is a costly outcome in both the short and long term for parents, children, and society at
large. This paper examines the causal link between teen age smoking behavior and low birth weight.
We use a variety of empirical techniques including fixed effects and a matching estimator to identify
the impact of smoking on babies of teen and non-teen mothers. We find that both OLS and matching
estimator results yield large impacts of smoking on birth weight for teens and adults. However, when
we control for unobservables through a fixed effects model, the impact of smoking on birth weight
is diminished and there are relatively small differences in the impact of smoking on birth weight between
teens and non-teens.

I. Introduction

         The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that the incidence

of low birth weight births (infants weighing less than 2,500 grams at birth) is on the rise,

and that very young mothers (those 15 and under) are 2 to 3 times more likely to have a

low birth weight baby than their counterparts aged 24-34. The incidence of low birth

weight for all teens is 23 percent higher than for the population as a whole (CDC 2006a).

A recent study by Chen et al. (2007) concludes that low birth weight and other adverse

birth outcomes observed in teen pregnancies cannot be fully attributed to known risk

factors such as low socioeconomic status and inadequate prenatal care.

         Low birth weight is correlated with a number of adverse outcomes for children

including future health problems and poorer educational outcomes. Low birth weight

infants account for large public health expenditures —studies show that more than one

third of the total dollar amount spent in the U.S. on health care during the first year of life

can be attributed to low birth weight even though low birth weight infants account for

less than 10% of all births in the U.S. (Lewitt et al. 1995).1

         The presence of a link between birth weight and smoking has long been accepted.

In 2001, the Surgeon General stated that “Infants born to women who smoke during

pregnancy have a lower average birth weight and are more likely to be small for

gestational age than infants born to women who do not smoke. Low birth weight is

associated with increased risk for neonatal, perinatal, and infant morbidity and mortality.

The longer the mother smokes during pregnancy, the greater the effect on the infant’s


1
 It is worth noting here that while low birth weight is clearly a health risk to the infant, high birth weight
babies are also at risk (Wei et al. 2003, Law 2002). Previous research has not shown any connection
between maternal smoking and abnormally high birth weights. Part of our empirical strategy controls for
high birth weight births.


                                                       1
birth weight” (Center for Disease Control and Prevention 2001). Multiple studies have

shown that tobacco use during pregnancy is correlated with lower birth weights, see, for

example, Evans and Ringel (1999), Abrevaya (2006), and Abrevaya and Dahl (2007).

Shiono and Behrman (1995) report that smoking during pregnancy accounts for 20

percent of low birth weight births, making it the single most important modifiable risk

factor for low birth weight in developed countries (Kramer 1987).

          We also observe that the incidence of teen smoking is relatively high—in 2004,

21.7 percent of all high school students reported smoking cigarettes while the incidence

of cigarette smoking among non-teens was 20.9 percent.2 Data from Georgia (1994-

2002) indicate that approximately 22.1 percent of nonblack teen mothers report that they

smoked during their pregnancies whereas only 11.7 percent of nonblack older mothers

report smoking (see Table 1).

          Could the observed differences in birth weights for babies born to teen mothers

and babies born to non teens be attributable, at least in part, to differences in the effects

of smoking on infant health for these two groups? The issue is complicated by several

factors. First, there are the physiological effects of nicotine on the fetus; medical

research indicates that nicotine itself is a neuroteratogen, affecting nervous system

development (see Roy et al. 2002, Slotkin 1998, and Law et al. 2003). Smoking also

interferes with the function of the placenta, which may lead to malnutrition (Law et al.

2003). Then, too, teen mothers will not have sustained the same physical damage from

smoking as adult women, simply because the teens have not had the same length of

exposure to tobacco. These causal effects do not suggest any reason to suspect substantial

differences in the impacts on babies born to smoking teens or smoking adults.

                                               2
       However, smoking during pregnancy not only has a direct physical effect on the

health of the fetus, but it also serves as a possible signal for other unhealthy behaviors

that are not usually measured in our data sets. Although not all studies use methods to

account for the possible correlation of maternal tobacco use with these other

unobservable influences, in recent work, researchers do recognize the endogeneity of

tobacco use in birth outcome models, see Almond et al. (2005) or Abrevaya (2006), for

example. Simply stated, the hypothesis is that women who choose to smoke during

pregnancy, despite the considerable evidence that relates smoking to poor birth outcomes,

could be likely to engage in other risky behaviors. Use of tobacco could provide a signal

of the mother’s attitude or concern for a healthy birth and these unobservable factors

could also affect the pregnancy outcome.

       Perhaps some fraction of the difference in birth outcomes for teens and non-teens

results from systematic differences in either the extent of these unobserved behaviors or

the correlation of these behaviors with tobacco use. Thus, obtaining empirical evidence

of the causal effect of maternal tobacco use on birth weight for both teen mothers and

older mothers could provide some useful information on the signal provided by tobacco

use. In this paper, we provide estimates of the impact of maternal tobacco use on birth

outcomes for teen mothers and older mothers, using a unique data set of the entire

population of births in the state of Georgia over the period 1994 to 2002. We use three

different estimation methods that rely on different assumptions regarding the unobserved

components of maternal behavior, in the hope of obtaining estimates of the causal effect

of smoking on birth weights. The results of the alternative estimators suggest that both

OLS and matching estimators which rely on observable characteristics to estimate the




                                              3
causal link between birth weight and smoking may overstate the impact of smoking on

birth weight. The fixed effects estimates, which control for unobservables, suggest that

there are some differences of the impact of smoking on birth weight for teen and non-teen

mothers, but that the effect is substantially smaller than found in the other estimations.

       Evidence that the impact of smoking on birth weight for teens and non-teens

differs can inform future research into both teen smoking and teen pregnancy, as well as

the policies and programs aimed at the teen population. Currently, many of the anti-

smoking campaigns and programs are focused on teenagers. For example, the national

campaign, “Healthy People 2010” lists tobacco use as one of its 10 high-priority public

health issues, targeting a 50 percent reduction in tobacco use for teens. Evidence to

justify and reinforce these efforts could be useful in the general policy debate regarding

tobacco use.

       The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II reviews the

literature. Section III discusses the empirical strategy. Section IV introduces the data

used in the analyses. Section V presents the results and section VI concludes the paper.



II. Previous Literature

       Across the U.S., teen births are on the decline. The southern states continue to

have the highest teen birth rates in the nation. In 1990, the national teen birth rate (births

per 1,000 females ages 15-17) was 37 and in Georgia it was 50. In 2004, these figures

were 22.1 and 29.3 respectively (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2006a).

More detailed data on births in Georgia reflect some startling statistics regarding teen

pregnancies. If we consider all births to mothers below the age of 19, 4% of those births




                                              4
are to mothers younger than age 15 (at time of delivery) and 26% to mothers ages 15-16.

In 2002, 9.0 percent of live infant births were of low birth weight, an increase from 8.5

percent in 1998. Of teen births in 2000, 82 percent were covered by Medicaid.3

          The previous literature most relevant to our work are the recent studies that

recognize the endogeneity of tobacco use in birth outcome models and use various

techniques to account for this estimation problem. In a randomized experiment, Permutt

and Hebel (1989) considered the impact of ‘stop smoking’ counseling on birth weights

for a group of smoking mothers. The control group for comparison was a group of

smoking mothers who did not receive counseling. The authors found a negative effect of

smoking on birth weight of about 400 grams, using a sample of 935 mothers. This is

quite a large effect given that the normal birth weight is 3,500 grams. This study is

unique in its natural experiment approach, but the causal effect of smoking is estimated

imprecisely due to a small sample size.

          Abrevaya (2006) estimates the causal effect of smoking during pregnancy on birth

weight and gestation length in weeks using panel data techniques. This study is an

interesting departure from the rest of the literature as it employs a panel data analysis

using a sample of mothers with multiple births during the sample period. Since there are

no individual identifiers in the data set that would allow the author to uniquely identify a

mother (e.g. social security number), he employs a matching strategy to determine which

individual mothers experienced multiple births during the time period considered. The

results from the fixed-effects models indicate that the effect of smoking on birth

outcomes is smaller than those obtained from the OLS models, suggesting a strong

negative correlation between the omitted variables and the smoking indicators. Our study

is similar to this one in that one of our identification strategies relies on the variation in

the smoking behavior of mothers who give multiple births during the period analyzed.

Because our data are drawn from administrative records, we identify each mother

perfectly. We are also able to control for a much larger set of variables.

        Almond et al. (2005) is another recent study on the effects of maternal smoking

during pregnancy on health outcomes of singleton births controlling for a wide set of

background characteristics. The authors compare the hospital costs, health outcomes, and

infant mortality rates between heavier and lighter infants from all twin pairs born in the

U.S. In order to identify the causal effect of smoking on birth weight, they use a

propensity score matching estimator. The authors’ analysis of the effect of smoking on

birth weight uses data from Pennsylvania between 1989 and 1991, although the authors

indicate that they found similar results for Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Michigan, North

Carolina, and Ohio. However, this study does not distinguish between teen mothers and

non-teen mothers.

        Evans and Ringel (1999) examine the effect of cigarette taxes on birth outcomes

using data from the 1989-1992 Natality Detail Files. The results suggest that excise

cigarette taxes are associated with a decrease in smoking participation among pregnant

women and with an increase in birth weight. The smoking participation price elasticity is

estimated to be -0.5. The authors use a dataset of over 10 million births, much larger than

other studies. They employ an instrumental variables method to identify the causal effect

of smoking on birth weight. Specifically, they use the changes in state cigarette taxes to

identify the causal effect of smoking on birth weight. A potential problem with this




                                               6
estimation strategy is that the time period, 1989-1992, was not a period when changes in

cigarette taxes were frequent. Their results indicate that smoking causes a decrease in

birth weight by 350-600 grams. However, their results from the instrumental variables

method are not statistically different from those from the OLS estimation, perhaps due to

low variation in their instrument.

       Abrevaya and Dahl (2007) estimate the effect of birth ‘inputs’ including smoking

on birth weight. The authors use samples of natality data for the states of Washington

and Arizona. In both states, births were maternally linked based on available information

(for Washington: mother’s name, mother’s date of birth, mother’s race, and mother’s

state of birth and for Arizona: mother and father’s date of birth, mother’s race, and

mother’s state of birth). The subsample chosen for estimation is the first and second

births to white mothers. A quantile estimation approach is used to address the impacts of

birth inputs over the entire distribution of birth weight. The authors find that smoking

reduces birth weight throughout the birth weight distribution by between 26.2 and 82.5

grams in the panel estimation, and the impact is larger in the middle of the birth weight

distribution. They also estimate a cross-section model and find much larger impacts of

smoking, which they attribute to a failure to control for unobserved characteristics.

       Our analysis focuses on Georgia and uses recent data that include the entire

population of births over a longer period than used in most previous studies. The

resulting sample is much larger than those of many other studies in this literature. We

focus on the difference between teen and non-teen mothers and also focus on differences

in outcomes by race. We pay careful attention to identifying the causal effect of teen

smoking on birth weight by employing a variety of estimators that make different




                                             7
assumptions. Our identification strategy for the fixed effects estimator relies on a sample

of mothers with multiple births during the period considered and we report OLS,

matching, and fixed effects results.



III. Empirical Strategy

       Our goal is to estimate the effect of smoking during pregnancy on birth outcomes

and to assess whether this effect differs between teen mothers and adult mothers. Suppose

that the true data generating process can be written as:

        outcomeit = α1Sit + xit β + α 2 zit + ε it ,                                               (1)


where outcomeit is the outcome for the baby for mother i for birth t (first, second, etc.).

The vector xit contains all the mother, father, and location level characteristics that

affect birth weight. The variable zit measures other risky behaviors of the mother that

affect the birth outcome of the infant, but are unobservable. Sit is an indicator of

whether the mother smoked during the pregnancy. The random variable ε it represents

random shocks to birth weight. The parameters to be estimated are given by α1 and β .

       Because the zit variable is not observable, its effects are reflected in the error term

and the model that is actually estimated can be written:

                 outcomeit = α1Sit + xit β + uit ,                                           (2)

where uit now absorbs the unobservable variable. It can easily be shown that the OLS

estimator for α1 can be written:          α%1 = αˆ1 + αˆ 2δ%, where α̂1 and α̂ 2 represent the OLS

estimators from equation (1) and δ% represents the slope estimator from a regression of



                                                       8
zit on Sit and xit .4 Because we anticipate that both α̂1 and α̂ 2 will be negative and that

Sit and zit are positively correlated, on average, the estimates of α1 that we obtain will

usually be larger (in the negative direction) that they should be.5 The greater the

discrepancy between α%1 and α̂1 , the larger the impact of zit on bwit and/or the closer the

correlation between smoking and the unobservable zit .

         The first set of estimates we obtain for equation (2) are OLS estimates; this

estimator is consistent under the conditions that either zit has no effect on outcomeit or

the sample covariances between zit and both Sit and xit are zero.

         A second possible estimation strategy is to assume that the selection into tobacco

use by pregnant women is determined by observable variables. That is, if the relevant

characteristics that determine smoking behavior are observable, we can use this

information to control for the endogeneity of tobacco use. We use these observable

characteristics to sort our data into “matched” samples of smoking and non-smoking

women. We can then compute the impact of tobacco use on birth weight as the average

difference in birth weights of infants in the matched samples of smokers and non-

smokers. Unlike regression techniques, matching estimators do not impose any

functional form restrictions nor do they assume a homogenous treatment effect across

populations (Zhao 2005). The assumption of ‘selection on observables’ is quite strong,

however; it implies that the density of infant health outcomes is independent of smoking

behavior, once observable variables have been conditioned on. More formally, this is

written:
4
  See Wooldridge (2002), p. 62.

  Note that estimated values of δ would also depend on the other covariates in the model and their
relationship to Sit .


                                                     9
                                    pdf (bw1 | x, S ) = pdf (bw1 | x)
                                    pdf (bw0 | x, S ) = pdf (bw0 | x).


Although these assumptions cannot be tested directly, some indirect evidence can be

obtained through estimating the treatment effect on a subsample that cannot have been

affected by the treatment; we compute these tests and discuss the results below.6

        The third estimation strategy relaxes the assumption that conditioning on

observable characteristics that determine tobacco use makes infant health outcomes

independent of smoking behavior. We turn to a fixed effects specification that requires a

sample of mothers who gave birth multiple times during our data period. In order to

implement this estimator, we specify:

                  outcomeit = α Sit + xit β + μi + ε it ,                                         (3)

where μi is an individual effect associated with the ith mother. Because mothers’ social

security numbers were available, we can uniquely identify mothers with multiple births

over the period of our sample. Thus any time invariant observed or unobserved

influence on infant health outcomes will be controlled for by the fixed effect, only factors

that change over time will be included in the vector of control variables. Some of these

will include marital status of the mother, mother’s age, mother’s education, infant’s sex,

possibly the place of birth, the number of prenatal care visits, mother’s weight gained

during pregnancy, and Medicaid status.

        Identification of the treatment effect in this approach relies upon mothers who

change their smoking behavior between births. Our data cover a relatively long period of

time so that a substantial number of teenager and adult women do change their smoking
6
 Further details on the estimator that we use and the specification tests can be found in Abadie and Imbens
(2002) and Imbens (2004).


                                                     10
behavior as noted in Table 2. This estimator is attractive as it eliminates any mother

specific time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity. However, if there are time-varying

unobserved characteristics of the mother that are correlated with her smoking behavior,

this approach would still yield biased estimates. Abrevaya (2006) considers the bias that

could result from time-varying unobserved characteristics. He analyzes the simple

correlation of changes in observed behavior with changes in smoking behavior. He finds

that reduced smoking is associated with increased prenatal care and speculates that

reduced smoking would also be correlated with reduced alcohol consumption and poor

nutrition. From this analysis he concludes that the direction of bias of the potential time-

varying characteristics is negative.



IV. Data

          Our data come from Georgia’s Department of Human Resources birth records.7

Georgia is an interesting state to analyze due to the state’s above average incidence of

teen births (noted above) and above average teen smoking behavior during our sample

period. In 2002, the incidence of tobacco use in Georgia was 22.8 percent for the adult

population and 23.7 percent for the high school aged population. The U.S. averages for

that period were 22.5 percent and 22.9 percent for these groups, respectively.8

          The data include detailed information on the birth of a child, the health status of

the mother and child, and basic demographic information including the race and ethnicity

of the mother, and age of the mother. Our data cover 1994-2002, which provides a

substantial number of births. This is also a period long enough to observe enough

                                                    11
numbers of multiple births for our fixed effects model. We have a total of 941,746

observations (births) in the entire file and 138,500 incidents of teen births, where teen

births are live births to girls aged 19 and younger at the time of birth. The number of teen

births per year fell over the sample period, ranging from a minimum of 13,544 births in

2002 to a maximum of 16,353 births in 1995.

       We subdivided the data a number of ways. First, we separated African-American

women from others. In keeping with much of the health literature, we estimate separate

models for blacks and non-blacks. In the non-black sample, the only substantial ethnic

subgroup is Hispanic women. In the subsamples that include mothers who have

experienced two or more live births within the sample period, the teen data set includes

teens who gave birth at least twice as teenagers (aged 19 or younger). Similarly, the

subsample of non-teen multiple births includes women 20 or older who have experienced

two or more live births. Among non-black teens, the maximum number of live births to a

single mother during the sample period was 4; for non-black non-teen women, the

maximum was 7. For black teens and women, the maximum number of live births was 5

and 8, respectively.

       We consider two infant health outcome measures. The first is the actual birth

weight of the child, measured in grams, for full-term births and the second is the

gestation-adjusted birth weights as computed by Oken et al. (2003). The gestation-

adjusted birth weight is measured in percentile rankings so that infants that are relatively

heavy for the gestational age are assigned a high percentile ranking whereas small infants

are assigned lower percentile rankings. When actual birth weights are used as the

outcome measure, we limit the sample to only full term births, meaning those with weeks




                                             12
of gestation recorded as more than 37. This avoids the comparison of unusually small

full-term infants with those that are pre-term.

       Table 1 documents smoking behavior reported in the vital statistics records for all

women in our data, and also reports low birth weight incidence along with average birth

weight and gestation. Table 2 summarizes smoking patterns for mothers with multiple

births. Overall, teen mothers are somewhat more likely to use tobacco during pregnancy,

but there appear to be fewer teens who report heavy smoking over all the years of our

data. Teen mothers do have lighter babies and this effect is, not surprisingly, most

pronounced for the black subsample.

       There are interesting differences among the mothers in terms of the time profile of

their smoking behavior. We break the data into groups by teens and non-teens, first

births and subsequent births, and by smoking behavior. Smoking behavior is classified

into four mutually exclusive categories. They are “never smoked”, “always smoked”,

“quit smoking after the first birth”, and “started smoking after the first birth”. In Table 3,

we show the average birth weight and gestation length for these groups for teens and non-

teen mothers. As displayed in the table, the highest birth weights for teens and non-teens

generally occurs when there is no tobacco use just prior to the birth (“never,” “started

after first birth,” and “quit after first birth”). Teens who never smoked have first babies

that are about 93 percent of the birth weight of non-smoking, non-teen moms

(3,110/3,334). Smoking behavior brings the teen and non-teen moms slightly closer

together in terms of the birth weight ratio for first and subsequent births. When teen

mothers quit smoking, we see an increase in the birth weight of their subsequent babies,

while there is little change for non-teen moms in this category (actually, a slight decrease




                                             13
in birth weight for non-teen moms). For teen moms who begin smoking after the first

birth, we notice a decrease in birth weight between the first and subsequent births of 34.9

grams (3,121.6-3,156.5) compared to a non-smoking teen mom who sees, on average, an

increase between first and second births of 49 grams (3,159-3,110).

         A full list of variable names and definitions, plus summary statistics for both teen

and non-teen mothers, is provided in Table 4. As displayed in Table 4, teen mothers are

more likely to be black and are more likely to be using Medicaid. They are much less

likely to be married or report a father. Furthermore, they have fewer prenatal care visits

than non-teen mothers but they also are less likely to be smokers.



V. Results

         The results we focus on are based on the models using full term births. Results of

the gestation-adjusted birth weight estimation are available from the authors.9                  In the

estimation, prenatal care is measured with two variables; the number of visits and the

number of visits squared. A dummy variable to indicate whether the infant represents the

mother’s first live birth is included. Mother’s age and mother’s education are entered as

continuous variables.

         We experimented with using demographic information on the father, based on the

idea that the father’s characteristics might proxy for otherwise unmeasured socio-

demographic characteristics of the mother and the mother’s environment. For a

substantial portion of the sample, however, the father characteristics were missing. When

included in the models, these variables had virtually no impact on the outcome measures.

  The gestation adjustment controls for the gender of the infant, with different percentiles for males and
females.


                                                     14
Finally, we constructed a binary variable that is equal to one when all demographic

information on the father is missing; again, we hypothesize that this provides a signal on

the socio-economic characteristics of the mother. A variety of other control variables

were included, but they had little impact on the estimation results in a variety of

specifications.10 Dummy variables were included for year and county of birth (these

coefficients are suppressed in the tables).

         We have chosen not to test whether the effect of smoking differs between teens

and non-teens by pooling the data and using dummy variables for teenage mothers in

equation (1), this method would impose the restriction that all other variables have

identical effects for the two groups.11 We prefer to allow for the possibility that there are

substantive differences between these two groups in the way birth outcomes are

determined for the reasons discussed earlier. Therefore, we will estimate equation (1)

separately for teen and non-teen mothers.

         The consistency of the OLS estimator depends on the assumption that smoking is

uncorrelated with the unobservable factors reflected in the errors. The results are

presented in Tables 5 (adults) and 6 (teens). The OLS results suggest some sizeable

impacts of smoking on birth weight, but the impact is somewhat larger for non-teen

women—which is not what we expected. Among all of the subgroups and categories of

smoking, the impact of smoking on birth weight ranges from 109 to 275 grams (the

omitted category of smoking is “no smoking”). At all three levels of smoking intensity,



10
   These variables include: presence of a father, mother’s education, county of birth, and various medical
conditions.
11
   We did estimate a model that used interaction terms between the teen dummy and the other variables to
distinguish the coefficients for the two groups. The joint hypothesis that the coefficients were the same for
the two groups was soundly rejected, even for subsets of coefficients that did not include the smoking
variables.


                                                     15
the point estimates for adult women exceed those for teens, and the point estimate for

adults is nearly double the impact for teens in the highest smoking category. Thus, based

on these estimates, maternal smoking has more deleterious effects on non-teens than on

teens.

         The second estimator involves sorting both teen and non-teen samples into

matched groups of smokers and nonsmokers based on a number of observable variables,

using the matching estimator suggested by Abadie and Imbens (2002). As described

above, this estimator relies on the assumption of selection on observables. Although this

assumption cannot be directly tested, Imbens (2004) suggests that some information can

be gained by estimating the treatment effect on an outcome that could not have been

affected by the treatment. If this treatment effect is found to be not significantly different

from zero, it lends some plausibility to the unconfoundedness assumption and hence the

consistency of the matching estimator.

         A form of this test was implemented by estimating the effect of smoking behavior

on birth weight, using samples of first births to women (either adults or teens and

stratified by race) where the treatment group consisted of women who did not smoke

during the first pregnancy, but smoked during subsequent pregnancies. The control

group consisted of women who did not smoke during either the first or subsequent

pregnancies.12 Results from these tests indicate that the assumption of unconfoundedness

cannot be rejected only for the sample of black teen mothers. Nonetheless, matching




12
  Clearly, this test procedure is not fully adequate as we cannot know whether women who did not smoke
during first pregnancies had actually never smoked before or had smoked then stopped. Similarly, the
women in the control group, who never reported smoking during pregnancy, could have been smokers at
some previous period.


                                                  16
estimator results are reported for all subsamples in order to compare to our other

empirical results.

       The covariates used for matching include length of gestation, number of prenatal

visits, mother’s age, mother’s education, mother’s weight gain categories, marital status,

and first birth and year dummies. The estimator uses the four ‘closest’ matches to the

treated individuals, where closeness is defined by the vector norm given by ( x 'Vx )
                                                                                       1/ 2
                                                                                              ,

with x representing the vector of covariates and V defined as the diagonal matrix of the

inverse variance matrix of x . We also used the bias adjustment suggested in Abadie and

Imbens (2002) due to the large number of covariates.

        The treatment effect on the treated is computed by averaging the difference

between the birth weight of children of smokers and non-smokers within the matched

groups. Note that these model results are based only on the mother’s use of tobacco,

rather than the intensity of tobacco use, as in the other models. These results, given in

Table 7, suggest that smoking has a detrimental effect on birth weight, but that the effect

is larger for non-teen women than for teens. The effect for non-black teens is estimated as

-164 grams and the effect for non-black non-teens is -211 grams, both effects have very

small standard errors. For blacks, the teen estimate is -106 grams and for non-teens it is -

176 grams. It is interesting to note that these results are similar to an average of the

coefficients for the three smoking intensity categories used in the OLS model.

       The results from the fixed effects model that uses the sample of mothers with

multiple births and full term babies are presented in Table 8 (non-teens) and 9 (teens).

The substantial changes in the measured impact of smoking support the notion that




                                             17
smoking is an indicator of other unhealthy behaviors which are not measured in the OLS

or matching estimation strategies.

         The difference in the impact of smoking on birth weight between adults and teen

moms is subtle. At the lowest level of smoking (l0 cigarettes per day or less), children of

smoking, non-black teen moms are 9.695 grams lighter than children of smoking, non-

black adults. This difference decreases to 3.739 grams for non-blacks smoking more than

10 to 20 cigarettes per day. For black women and teens, the differences in the effects of

smoking on birth weight are larger. At the lowest level of smoking, black teen mothers

give birth to babies that are 42.922 grams lighter than black adult women in the same

smoking category. In the highest smoking category (more than 20 cigarettes per day), the

difference is quite large - black teen mothers give birth to infants that are nearly 300

grams lighter than black adults. There are very few black teen mothers who report heavy

smoking, however, so that although the large effect is striking, we cannot expect that it is

representative of this population.

         Are the differences in the impact of smoking on birth weight between teens and

adults important? Clearly the differential impact of smoking on birth weight for teens

and adults is not sufficient to explain the gap in average birth weights for teens and

adults. Non-black teens give birth to infants who are, on average, 128 grams lighter than

infants born to adult non-black women.13 The different sizes of the causal effects of

smoking accounts for between 7 and 18 percent of that 128 gram gap. For black teens

and adults, the average birth weight gap is smaller, about 113 grams. For these women,




13
  This difference is based on calculations from the Georgia Vital Statistics data file, using full-term births
only.


                                                      18
the differential impact of smoking is somewhat larger; the difference accounts for 44

percent of the difference in average birth weights.

         Overall, the differences between the teen and non-teen mothers are relatively

small for most of our subsamples. Recall that because teen smokers, by virtue of their

youth, will have smoked fewer years, on average, than adult smokers, they will have

sustained less physical damage from smoking than long term smokers. This yields some

ground to argue that the effects on infants born to teen mothers should be smaller. Our

finding of a negative impact of smoking on teen and non-teen’s babies, and a slightly

stronger impact for teens, once the impact of unobservable factors is accounted for, is

very interesting.14



VI. Conclusions

         In this paper, we have used three different estimation strategies to analyze the

impact of smoking on birth weight of teen and non-teen mothers. Our results suggest that

the unobservables that influence behavior and correlate with tobacco use during

pregnancy play a large part in the previously reported impacts of smoking on birth

weight. When we control for unobservables (model 3, fixed effects), we find that

smoking is still an important factor in infant health, but the marginal impact of smoking

is much smaller than typically estimated. Both our IV estimates (model 1) and our

estimates from our matched sample (model 2) result in larger coefficients for smoking.

         The differences in the estimated impact of smoking on birth weight for teens and

non teens are somewhat surprising. We actually anticipated that while the causal effects

                                                     19
of smoking would be similar for teens and adults, the signal provided by tobacco use –

that is, the correlation of tobacco use with other unhealthy behaviors – would be stronger

for teens than non teens. We had expected that the signaling model would help explain

more of the well documented result that teens to give birth to relatively lower birth

weight children. Instead, our results indicate that the signal effect provided by tobacco

use is stronger for adults than for teens whereas the causal effects are somewhat stronger

for teens. The differences in the causal effects, however, are modest. For non-blacks, 7

percent of the difference in average birth weights of infants born to teens and non-teens

can be explained by smoking behavior for those in the low smoking category. For blacks,

about 40 percent of the difference can be explained by low levels of smoking.

       From a policy perspective, successful smoking cessation campaigns (all else

constant) should have similar impacts on the health of children of teen and non-teen

mothers. The difficulty, of course, is that similar cessation programs will probably not

have the same level of success on smoking cessation for teens and non-teens. The choice

of appropriate policy is confounded by the lack of empirical results that explain the

differences in teen and non-teen birth weight. As discussed by Chen et al. (2007) and as

found here, it is very difficult to make headway into an explanation of the differences in

birth weight between teens and non-teens. Further research is needed regarding the

impact of unobservable variables such as teen attitudes toward pregnancy and associated

behaviors (physiological, social, and emotional). Survey data may be an interesting

supplement to currently available administrative data in this regard.
