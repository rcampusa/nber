                                          ABSTRACT

In the midst of epidemics such as COVID-19, therapeutic candidates are unlikely to be able to
complete the usual multiyear clinical trial and regulatory approval process within the course of an
outbreak. We apply a Bayesian adaptive patient-centered model—which minimizes the expected
harm of false positives and false negatives—to optimize the clinical trial development path during
such outbreaks. When the epidemic is more infectious and fatal, the Bayesian-optimal sample
size in the clinical trial is lower and the optimal statistical significance level is higher. For
COVID-19 (assuming a static R0 – 2 and initial infection percentage of 0.1%), the optimal
significance level is 7.1% for a clinical trial of a nonvaccine anti-infective therapeutic and 13.6%
for that of a vaccine. For a dynamic R0 decreasing from 3 to 1.5, the corresponding values are
14.4% and 26.4%, respectively. Our results illustrate the importance of adapting the clinical trial
design and the regulatory approval process to the specific parameters and stage of the epidemic.

1 Introduction

With growing public concern over the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),
significant efforts have been undertaken by global biomedical stakeholders to develop
effective diagnostics, vaccines, antiviral drugs, medical devices, and other therapeutics
against this highly infectious and deadly pandemic. While in the past, the traditional
randomized clinical trial (RCT) and regulatory approval process often took several years (U.S.
Food & Drug Administration, 2018)—longer than the typical duration of an epidemic
outbreak (Pronker et al., 2013)—recently the FDA has responded with actions such as the
Breakthrough Devices Program, Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) authority, and
Immediately in Effect guidance documents to prevent novel diagnostics and therapeutics
from lagging behind the urgent needs of the population. In this article, we propose adapting
yet another tool that the FDA has already been exploring for medical devices (Chaudhuri et
al., 2018, 2019) to therapeutics for treating COVID-19 that are currently under development.
In recent years, Bayesian adaptive RCT protocols have been increasingly used to expedite
the clinical trial process of potentially transformative therapies for diseases with high
mortality rates (Berry, 2015). Currently, these protocols have mainly been applied within
the oncology domain, such as I-SPY for breast cancer (Barker et al., 2009) and GBM AGILE
for glioblastoma (Alexander et al., 2018). These studies use Bayesian inference algorithms
to greatly reduce the number of patients needed to assess the therapeutic effects of a drug
candidate, without lowering the statistical power of the final approval decision, as measured
by Type I and II error rates. As a result, therapeutic candidates can progress more quickly
through the regulatory process and reach patients faster and at lower costs.
For severe diseases with no curative treatments, such as pancreatic cancer, patients tend to
tolerate a higher Type I error of accepting an ineffective therapy in exchange for a lower Type
II error of rejecting an effective therapy as well as expedited approvals of potentially
effective treatments. Based on this observation, a patient-centered Bayesian protocol was
proposed (Isakov et al., 2019; Montazerhodjat et al., 2017) that incorporates patient values
into clinical trial design and identifies the optimal balance between the possibilities of false
positives (Type I error) and false negatives (Type II error). For more severe diseases, this
protocol sets a tolerated Type I error rate much larger than the traditional 5% threshold,
which leads to higher rates of approvals and expedited approval decisions.
However, the original Bayesian adaptive RCT framework does not take into account patient
risk preferences. To address this gap, Chaudhuri and Lo (2018) developed an adaptive
version of the Bayesian patient-centered model that achieves an optimal balance between
Type I and Type II error rates, significantly reducing the number of subjects needed in trials
to achieve a statistically significant conclusion. A key feature of this model is the time
evolution of the loss function of the Bayesian decision algorithm. This mechanism favors the

13 May 2020                © 2020 by Chaudhuri, Lo, Xiao, and Xu                   Page 1 of 32
                                   All Rights Reserved
expedited approval of diagnostic or therapeutic candidates that show early positive effects,
since patients place a lower value on delayed approval of an effective diagnostic or therapy.
There is a natural but subtle analog to this dilemma in the case of therapeutics for an
infectious disease during the course of an epidemic outbreak. Approving an effective
therapeutic early will prevent future infections and deaths, while approving it later will save
fewer people from infection. On the other hand, approving an ineffective therapeutic early
will not prevent any future casualties. Worse still, it may prevent people from taking
adequate precautions against infection, since they will falsely believe that they are safe from
the disease after the advent of the ineffective therapy.
Moreover, the cost of Type I versus Type II error can differ from therapy to therapy. A novel
vaccine that could trigger a significant immune response such as a cytokine storm has a much
higher cost of a Type I error than a medical device such as an air filtration system designed
to destroy virions through intense ultraviolet light. Therefore, the appropriate statistical
threshold for approval should depend on the specific therapy, as well as the circumstances
of the current burden of disease.
In this article, we apply the Bayesian adaptive protocol to anti-infective therapeutic
development using a loss function that evolves over the course of an epidemic outbreak. We
achieve an optimal balance between Type I and Type II errors for therapeutics that treat
infectious diseases and identify the optimal time to reach the approval decision based on the
accumulation of clinical evidence. Our results show that when the epidemic is more
infectious, the necessary sample size of the RCT decreases, while the tolerable Type I error
increases. This confirms our earlier intuition that potentially effective therapies that are
known to be safe should receive expedited approval when an epidemic is spreading rapidly.


2 Multigroup SEIR Epidemic Model

The starting point for our analysis is the Susceptible-Exposure-Infective-Removed (SEIR)
epidemic model, which has been applied to model the outbreak of COVID-19 in China in a
number of recent studies (Wu et al., 2020; Yang et al., in press). The population of N subjects
is partitioned into four distinct groups: susceptible (S), exposed (E), infectious (I), and
removed (R). The time evolution of the epidemic is specified by the following group of
ordinary differential equations:


              𝑑𝑆               𝑑𝐸                   𝑑𝐼                 𝑑𝑅
                     𝛽𝑆𝐼,            𝛽𝑆𝐼   𝑎𝐸,           𝑎𝐸    𝛾𝐼,           𝛾𝐼 .        (1)
              𝑑𝑡               𝑑𝑡                   𝑑𝑡                 𝑑𝑡




13 May 2020                 © 2020 by Chaudhuri, Lo, Xiao, and Xu                   Page 2 of 32
                                    All Rights Reserved
Here we use the convention that 𝑆 𝑡 , 𝐸 𝑡 , 𝐼 𝑡 , and 𝑅 𝑡 are the proportions of the
susceptible, exposed, infectious and removed populations, respectively, satisfying the
conservation constraint for all 𝑡:


                             𝑆 𝑡    𝐸 𝑡     𝐼 𝑡     𝑅 𝑡     100% .                       (2)


The parameters 𝛽, 𝑎, and 𝛾 denote the average rates of infection, incubation, and recovery,
respectively, and 𝜇 ∈ 0%, 100% denotes the mortality rate of the epidemic. For example,
if 𝜇 5%, we expect 5% of infected subjects will die from the disease. At time 𝑡, 𝜇𝑅 𝑡 𝑁
subjects will have died, and 1 𝜇 𝑅 𝑡 𝑁 will have recovered.
A critical measure of the infectivity of an epidemic is its basic reproduction number, defined
as 𝑅     𝛽/𝛾 in the SEIR model. This is the expected number of secondary infections caused
by each infected subject in a population with no public health measures (such as quarantine,
social distancing, or vaccination).
A number of studies have used different statistical schemes to estimate 𝑅 for COVID-19
during its initial outbreak period in central China in January 2020. These estimated values of
𝑅 range from 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9) (Li et al., 2020) to 3.58 (95% CI, 2.89 to 4.39) (Zhao et
al., 2020). Given the large uncertainty in the value of 𝑅 , we simulate therapeutic
development under scenarios with constant 𝑅 values of 2 and 4.
In addition, to model the impact of governmental nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs)
on containing the spread of the epidemic, we consider a dynamic transmission SEIR model
where the infection rate, 𝛽 𝑡 , monotonically decreases over time as a result of the NPIs.
Specifically, we assume that 𝛽 𝑡 takes the sigmoid functional form:


                                       𝛽    𝛽∞
                           𝛽 𝑡              𝑡 𝑡        𝛽∞ .                              (3)
                                   1    exp
                                              𝜏


Here 𝛽 and 𝛽 denote the infection rates in the initial and final stages of the epidemic (with
𝛽     𝛽 ), respectively, 𝑡 denotes the half-life of the decay in infection rate, and 𝜏 the length
of the time window when this decay occurred. A larger difference between 𝛽 and 𝛽 (𝛽
𝛽 ) corresponds to a more significant reduction of epidemic transmission, a smaller value
of 𝑡 corresponds to a speedier decision to enforce the NPIs, and a smaller value of 𝜏
corresponds to more strict enforcement of the NPIs since 𝛽 𝑡 decays more rapidly. We
calibrate the values 𝛽       3 and 𝛽       1.5 based on the estimates of the dynamic
transmission rate of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, from December 2019 to February 2020

13 May 2020                 © 2020 by Chaudhuri, Lo, Xiao, and Xu                   Page 3 of 32

(Kucharski et al., 2020). We consider different values of 𝑡 and 𝜏 to reflect the variability in
timing and stringency of NPIs enforced by governments around the globe. Under this
dynamic transmission model, the basic reproduction number is given by 𝑅 𝑡             𝛽 𝑡 /𝛾,
which monotonically decreases from 𝛽 /𝛾 to a constant value 𝛽 /𝛾 as 𝑡 increases.
To model the significant variability in mortality rates of COVID-19 for patients in different
age groups, we extend this basic model to a multigroup SEIR model, where the population is
partitioned into five age groups, (1) below 49, (2) 50 to 59, (3) 60 to 69, (4) 70 to 79, and (5)
above 80. We use 𝑆 , 𝐸 , 𝐼 , and 𝑅 to denote the corresponding type in each group (and
continue to use 𝑆, 𝐸, 𝐼, and 𝑅 for the total proportion of each type in all groups). The
dynamics of the epidemic are specified by the modified ordinary differential equations:


           𝑑𝑆                  𝑑𝐸                        𝑑𝐼                 𝑑𝑅
                   𝛽𝑐 𝑆 𝐼,           𝛽𝑐 𝑆 𝐼       𝑎𝐸 ,         𝑎𝐸    𝛾𝐼 ,         𝛾𝐼 .   (4)
           𝑑𝑡                  𝑑𝑡                        𝑑𝑡                 𝑑𝑡


Here 𝑐 denotes the contact rate of the susceptible subjects in the 𝑖 th age group with the total
infected population, 𝐼, of all groups. This contact rate is measured relative to group 1, which
we normalize to 𝑐      1. In the case of COVID-19, although the mortality rate is much higher
for senior populations (Onder et al., 2020), elderly people also tend to have less frequent
contact with the infected population outside the household (Walker et al., 2020).
We solve the differential equations in the multigroup SEIR model using the ODE45 solver in
MATLAB 2019a with initial conditions for each age group:


        𝑆 0 ,𝐸 0 ,𝐼 0 ,𝑅 0             1      1     𝑟 𝐼 ,𝑟 𝐼 ,𝐼 ,0   𝑃 .                   (5)


The parameter 𝐼 denotes the proportion of the initially infected population, 𝑟 is the ratio of
initially exposed and infected subjects, and 𝑃 is the percentage of the 𝑖 th age group in the
population. The assumed demographic, contact rate, and mortality rate values are
summarized in Table 1.


3 A Bayesian Patient‐Centered Approval Process

Similar to Chaudhuri and Lo (2018), we develop a Bayesian patient-centered decision model
for RCT approval that minimizes the expected loss (or harm) incurred on the patients by
optimally balancing the losses of Type I and Type II errors. Here the loss does not refer to
financial costs afforded by the patients, but rather the loss in patient value (i.e., how much
patients weigh the relative harms of infection and death). We assign the losses per patient of

13 May 2020                  © 2020 by Chaudhuri, Lo, Xiao, and Xu                  Page 4 of 32
                                     All Rights Reserved
being susceptible, infected, and deceased. Since Bayesian decision thresholds are invariant
under the rescaling of the losses, we normalize by setting the loss per patient infection to 1
(𝐿    1). We then assign the loss per patient death relative to 𝐿 as 𝐿 , and the loss due to
susceptibility to the disease as 𝐿 . The parameter values we assume, summarized in Table 2,
are meant to represent one reasonable valuation of the relative losses. However, in practice,
patient value will differ from one patient group to another, especially given the large
variability of the mortality rate of COVID-19 in different age groups (Onder et al., 2020). Here
we report the main results of optimal sample size and statistical significance (Tables 3 and
4) assuming 𝐿       100. The results for 𝐿    10 are provided in the Appendix.
We simulate the multigroup SEIR model over a time period of 𝑇 weeks, where 𝑇 is the
duration of the epidemic outbreak. Let 𝜅 denote the weekly subject enrollment rate in each
arm of the clinical trial. We assume that the value of 𝑅 is known (or well-estimated) at initial
time 𝑡 0 and stays constant during the course of the outbreak. At time 𝑡 ∈ 0, 𝑇 , the
Bayesian loss, 𝐶 𝑡 , of choosing action 𝐻 𝑖 under 𝐻 𝑗 is defined as:



                            𝑯    𝟎 𝐝𝐨 𝐧𝐨𝐭 𝐚𝐩𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐯𝐞                  𝑯      𝟏 𝐚𝐩𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐯𝐞

 𝑯    𝟎 (ineffective)                   0                           𝑆 𝑡     𝑆 𝑇 𝑁𝐿




  𝑯     𝟏 (effective)           𝑅 𝑇 𝑁 𝐿      𝜇𝐿                  𝐶𝐼 𝑡 𝑁𝐿     𝜇𝑅 𝑡 𝑁𝐿




where we define the cumulative number of infected patients, 𝐶𝐼 𝑡 , until time t:


         𝐶𝐼 𝑡     𝐸 𝑡    𝐼 𝑡    𝑅 𝑡 .                                                   (6)


By design, this loss function penalizes Type I errors early in the epidemic by the susceptible
term, 𝑆 𝑡       𝑆 𝑇 𝑁𝐿 . We subtract the base level 𝑆 𝑇 from 𝑆 𝑡 since the multigroup
SEIR model predicts that 𝑆 𝑇 𝑁 subjects will not be infected by the epidemic. A Type I error
at an earlier time will expose more currently susceptible populations to the epidemic, since
members will falsely believe that they are safe from the disease after the advent of the
ineffective therapeutic. On the other hand, the loss function also penalizes correct approval
decisions made at later stages of an epidemic via the cumulative infected and death terms,


13 May 2020                © 2020 by Chaudhuri, Lo, Xiao, and Xu                   Page 5 of 32

𝐶𝐼 𝑡 and 𝜇𝑅 𝑡 . A correct but delayed approval decision for the therapeutic is less valuable
since it will save fewer susceptible people from infection and death.
The Bayesian decision model considers the null hypothesis, 𝐻 0, that the anti-infective
therapeutic (or vaccine) has no clinical effect, against the alternative hypothesis that it has
positive clinical effect with signal-to-noise ratio 𝜌 (Chaudhuri & Lo, 2018). We use 𝑝 and 𝑝
to denote the Bayesian prior probabilities of 𝐻 0 and 𝐻 1, respectively.
This patient-value model imposes higher losses for incorrect approvals at earlier stages and
correct approvals at later stages of an epidemic. Under these constraints, the Bayesian
decision algorithm yields the sample size and statistical significance threshold of the RCT
that optimally balances Type I and Type II errors.

4 Results

We simulate an epidemic outbreak over a time period of 𝑇 weeks, where 𝑇 is the duration of
the outbreak. For an epidemic with higher infectivity, its duration is shorter, which creates
more pressure to reach a timely approval decision. To avoid numerical instability, we
formally define 𝑇 as the time when the number of cumulative infected subjects first reaches
99.9% of total infections predicted by the SEIR model. We assume an age-specific mortality
rate 𝜇 at the level of COVID-19 (Onder et al., 2020; World Health Organization, 2020), and
incubation and recovery periods of 7 days each (Yang et al., in press). These estimated
parameters can all be challenged to varying degrees, depending on the specific drug-
indication pair under consideration and the particular circumstances of the epidemic, but
they are meant to be representative of a typical anti-infective therapeutic during the midst
of a growing epidemic.
We also assume that it takes 7 days after injection to assess the efficacy of the therapeutic on
each subject. We adopt the optimization scheme of Montazerhodjat et al. (2017) to find the
optimal Type I and Type II error rates of the nonadaptive Bayesian RCT. To represent typical
practice of the pharmaceutical industry, we optimize under the upper bound on the model’s
power, Power          90% (Isakov et al., 2019). We then use these optimal error rates as our
stopping criteria to simulate the sequential decision process of a Bayesian adaptive RCT via
Monte Carlo simulation (Chaudhuri & Lo, 2018). The simulation results are summarized in
Tables 3 and 4.
We separate the results into two distinct types of therapeutics—nonvaccine anti-infectives
(Table 3) and vaccines (Table 4)—because of the differences in their historical probabilities
of success. Vaccine development programs have an estimated probability of success 𝑝
40% as of 2019Q4 (https://projectalpha.mit.edu), whereas the corresponding figure for
nonvaccine anti-infectives is 𝑝    23% (Wong et al., 2020).

4.1 Nonvaccine Anti‐Infective Therapeutics

Static Transmission Rate

We first analyze the case in which the infectivity 𝑅 remains constant over time (e.g., in the
absence of effective NPIs). For the fixed-sample Bayesian RCT of a nonvaccine anti-infective
therapeutic, as 𝑅 increases from 2 to 4 (rows 1 to 2 of Table 3), the optimal sample size of
each experimental arm decreases from 242 to 158 and the optimal Type I error rate
drastically increases from 7.1% to 17.3% (Figure 1), much higher than the traditional 5%
threshold. As the epidemic spreads across the population more rapidly, the Bayesian RCT
model exhibits greater pressure to expedite the approval process and a much higher
tolerance of false positive outcomes.
For the Bayesian adaptive RCT, when the therapeutic is ineffective (𝐻 0), the average
sample size required to reject the therapeutic is much smaller than that of the nonadaptive
version (columns 7 and 8 of Table 3). Also, the required sample size decreases with the
infectivity 𝑅 in both mean and quartiles, yet always achieves a Type I error rate (𝛼) below
that of the nonadaptive version (column 11). The adaptive Bayesian decision model is able
to reject an ineffective therapeutic with a relatively small sample size and a bounded false-
positive rate.
On the other hand, when the therapeutic is effective (𝐻 1), as 𝑅 increases from 2 to 4, the
average sample size required by the Bayesian adaptive RCT decreases from 148 to 98
(columns 9 and 10 of Table 3). The Bayesian adaptive model places more weight on
approving an effective therapeutic earlier to prevent future infections when the epidemic is
more infectious. Despite the smaller sample size, the model still retains an empirical power
above 91.0% for all values of 𝑅 (column 12). The Bayesian adaptive model simultaneously
expedites the approval of an effective therapeutic and retains a bounded false-negative rate.
The results are illustrated in Figure 2.
Furthermore, as the proportion of the initially infected population 𝐼 decreases from 0.1% to
0.01% (rows 4 to 6 of Table 3), the optimal sample sizes for nonadaptive and adaptive RCTs
both increase, while the optimal Type I error rates decrease. Beginning the clinical trials for
a therapeutic during the earlier stages of an epidemic outbreak reduces the need to expedite
the approval process in order to contain its future spread. Clinicians and researchers have
more time to evaluate the efficacy of a therapeutic and record adverse effects by testing it on
a larger number of subjects, which leads to a lower Type I error rate.
Finally, when the mortality rate 𝜇 increases from the level of COVID-19 (Onder et al., 2020;
World Health Organization, 2020), to the level of SARS (World Health Organization, 2003),
and further to the level MERS (World Health Organization, 2019), the optimal sample sizes
for both nonadaptive and adaptive Bayesian models decrease and the optimal Type I error
rates increase (rows 7 to 12 of Table 3). When the epidemic is more lethal, the Bayesian

13 May 2020                © 2020 by Chaudhuri, Lo, Xiao, and Xu                  Page 7 of 32
                                   All Rights Reserved
adaptive model requires fewer subjects in the RCT, since both Type I and Type II errors will
lead to greater losses due to death by infection. The higher death tolls provide significantly
more incentive in the Bayesian adaptive framework to approve the therapeutic in the hopes
of saving more people from future infection and death.
One interesting feature of the Bayesian decision model is that the optimal Type I error rate
is not a monotonic function of 𝑅 , but rather has a minimum around 𝑅            1.7 for COVID-19,
as shown in Figure 1. As 𝑅 decreases below 1.7, the optimal Type I error rate increases. The
intuition for this result that we define the loss of Type I error as the excess risk of being
susceptible to infection, 𝑆 𝑡      𝑆 𝑇 𝑁𝐿 , where 𝑆 𝑇 is the fraction of the population that
remains uninfected throughout the epidemic outbreak. When 𝑅 is small, 𝑆 𝑇 is close to
100% and the excess risk, 𝑆 𝑡        𝑆 𝑇 𝑁𝐿 , is small compared to the benefit of preventing
future deaths. Therefore, when the epidemic is not very infectious, the Bayesian decision
model expedites the approval decision. This also confirms the intuition that smaller sample
sizes are required in adaptive trials for diseases that affect a small fraction of the population.
If we instead define the loss of Type I error as the absolute risk of being susceptible, 𝑆 𝑡 𝑁𝐿 ,
we find that the optimal Type I error indeed monotonically increases with 𝑅 , as shown in
Figure S3 in the Appendix.

Dynamic Transmission Rate

The results for the dynamic transmission model with 𝛽         3, 𝛽∞    1.5, 𝑡   3 weeks, and 𝜏
1 week are also summarized in Table 3. For COVID-19 (rows 3 and 6 in Table 3), we find that
the Bayesian optimal sample size and Type I error rate of the dynamic transmission model
lie in-between the corresponding values under scenarios 𝑅       2 and 𝑅    4. This suggests
that timely and effective government interventions will protect more subjects from infection
and allow more time for the RCT.
However, for the more fatal SARS and MERS (rows 9 and 12 in Table 3), the dynamic
transmission model sets higher optimal Type I errors and smaller sample sizes than 𝑅        4.
This is due to the U-shaped curve of optimal 𝛼 vs. 𝑅 , shown in Figure 1. When the NPIs
reduce 𝑅 𝑡 below a certain threshold, the optimal 𝛼 starts to increase. For highly fatal
epidemics, when the government adopts NPIs to protect most of the susceptible population
from infection, the regulatory priority should be to expedite potentially effective treatments
that can help current patients since the loss of Type I error is much lower than that of the
Type II error.
In addition, we investigate the impact of the timing and stringency of NPIs enforced by the
government with different values of 𝑡 and 𝜏. The results are summarized in Table 5. We find
that the optimal Type I error is larger for 𝑡   3 weeks than 𝑡    6 weeks. Therefore, if the
government adopts well-enforced NPIs early on (such as the lockdown in Wuhan, China) to
protect the susceptible population, this will reduce the loss associated with Type I error,

                                    All Rights Reserved
leading to expedited approvals of potentially effective therapeutics. Furthermore, the sooner
an effective therapeutic is approved, the sooner will NPIs be lifted.

4.2 Vaccines
We repeat the above analysis for an RCT of a vaccine using a prior probability of having an
effective vaccine 𝑝      40% as reported at https://projectalpha.mit.edu for 2019Q4. The
simulation results are summarized in Table 4. Overall, we observe the same pattern in the
optimal sample size and Type I error rates on infectivity, mortality, and proportion of initial
infections. However, since 𝑝 is higher for vaccines, the Bayesian decision model requires
fewer subjects, on average, in the RCT to ascertain the positive effects of the vaccine,
compared to the case of anti-infective therapeutics in Table 3. We find that vaccines should
receive even more expedited evaluation.

4.3 Five‐Factor Sensitivity Analysis
To assess the robustness of our model’s predictions against the assumed values of model
parameters, we perform a five-factor sensitivity analysis for the static transmission rate
model with 𝑅      2. The baseline and alternative parameter values are summarized in Table
S1. The scatterplot of optimal Type I error (𝛼) vs. sample size of Bayesian nonadaptive RCT
model is shown in Figure 3 (related summary statistics are shown in Table S5 in the
Appendix). We find that the scatterplot consists of several curves. To clearly identify the
effect of any given parameter, we show the results for the most important parameters in
separate scatterplots in Figures 4 to 6 (additional results are provided in the Appendix).
We find that the different curves in Figure 3 result from different values of 𝜌, the signal-to-
noise ratio (SNR) of treatment effect (Chaudhuri & Lo, 2018), as shown in Figure 4. For a
given significance level 𝛼, a smaller value of 𝜌 leads to larger optimal sample size. If the
efficacy of the anti-infective therapeutic is insignificant (small 𝜌), the distributions of z-score
under the null hypothesis, 𝐻 0 (no effect), and alternative hypothesis, 𝐻 1 (positive
effect with SNR 𝜌), are difficult to distinguish statistically. Hence, a larger sample size is
needed to evaluate the efficacy at the given significance level, 𝛼.
In addition, with a fixed SNR, the magnitudes of 𝛼 and sample size are mainly determined by
𝑝 , the Bayesian prior probability of having an ineffective anti-infective therapeutic. A
larger value of 𝑝 leads to a smaller 𝛼 and a larger sample size (Figure 5). When past drug
development outcomes in the anti-infective domain strongly suggest that the current anti-
infective therapeutic is unlikely to be effective (large 𝑝 ), the Bayesian framework requires
many more observations to shift the posterior distribution in order to prove its efficacy. For
notational convenience, we denote 𝑝 by 𝑝 in Figure 5.
A similar but less significant effect on the magnitudes of 𝛼 and sample size is generated by 𝜅,
the weekly subject enrollment in each arm of the RCT. A larger value of 𝜅 leads to a smaller

13 May 2020                 © 2020 by Chaudhuri, Lo, Xiao, and Xu                    Page 9 of 32
                                    All Rights Reserved
𝛼 and a larger sample size (Figure 6). When the RCT enrolls patients at a faster rate, clinical
researchers may evaluate the efficacy of the treatment based on more observations earlier
on during the epidemic outbreak. Hence, the approval decision may be reached with lower
false positive error.
In Figures S1 and S2 of the Appendix, we show that the five-factor sensitivity analysis reveals
no significant dependence of 𝛼 and sample size on ∆𝑡 , the time needed to assess the
treatment efficacy, as well as 𝑎, the incubation period of the disease. However, the analysis
does show that extreme values of the Bayesian optimal Type I error rate are generated by
large values of 𝑝 and small values of 𝜌. These regions of parameter space can be avoided if
the anti-infective therapeutic under investigation has promising preclinical evidence to
support its efficacy (reducing 𝑝 ) and the RCT is designed to verify reasonably significant
treatment effects over the control arm (increasing 𝜌).
To provide readers with greater transparency and intuition for our Bayesian decision model,
we provide the source code at https://projectalpha.mit.edu/resources, allowing users to
input their own parameter values of interest to see how the results change. We also
encourage users to adapt our code to their own contexts, as well as to experiment with
alternate epidemiological models of infection and loss functions.


5 Discussion

A natural consequence of using a patient-centered framework for determining the approval
threshold is, of course, more false positives—and the potential for a greater number of
patients with adverse side-effects—in cases where the burden of disease is high. These false
positives can be addressed through more vigilant postapproval surveillance by regulatory
agencies and greater requirements for drug and device companies to provide such patient-
level data to the regulator following approval. Failure to provide such data or evidence of an
ineffective therapy can be grounds for revoking the approval.
However, past experience shows that withdrawing an approved drug can be challenging and
disruptive for several reasons (Onakpoya et al., 2019). Therefore, implementing the patient-
centered approach may require creating a new category of temporary approvals for crisis
situations involving urgent needs at national or international levels, similar to the FDA’s EUA
program. Such a program might involve provisional approval of a candidate therapy
consisting of a one- or two-year license—depending on the nature of the drug-indication
pair—to market the therapy to a prespecified patient population, no off-label use of the
therapy, and regular monitoring and data reporting to the regulator by the manufacturer
and/or patients’ physicians during the licensing period (Lo, 2017). At the end of this trial
period, one of two outcomes would occur, depending on the accumulated data during this
period: (a) the ‘urgent needs’ license expires; or (b) the license converts to the traditional

regulatory license. Of course, at any point during the trial period, the regulator can terminate
the license if the data show that the therapeutic is ineffective and/or unsafe.
While such a process may impose greater burdens on patients, manufacturers, and
regulators, it may still be worthwhile if it brings faster or greater relief to patients facing
mortal illnesses and extreme suffering. In this respect, an urgent-needs program may be
viewed as a middle ground between a standard clinical trial and an approval, similar in spirit
to the adaptive designs of sophisticated clinical trials with master protocols such as I-SPY 2,
LUNG-MAP, and GBM-AGILE, in which patient care and clinical investigations are
simultaneously accomplished. Also, because the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
(CMS) has demonstrated a willingness to cover the cost of certain therapeutics for which
evidence is still being generated (see, for example, CMS’s “coverage with evidence” programs
listed at https://go.cms.gov/2v6ZxWm), additional economic incentives may be available to
support such temporary licenses.
Finally, we note that the age-group specification in our SEIR model mainly focuses on older
populations, whose mortality risks with COVID-19 are much higher than younger
populations (Onder et al., 2020). More refined age-group specifications are needed to
differentiate the transmission rates of COVID-19 among children, teenagers, and young
adults, as well as to reflect the different societal benefits each age group will receive from the
approval of an effective anti-infective therapeutic or vaccine.

6 Conclusion

We apply the Bayesian adaptive patient-centered model of Chaudhuri and Lo (2018) to
clinical trials for therapeutics that treat infectious diseases during an epidemic outbreak.
Using a simple epidemiological model, we find that the optimal sample size in the clinical
trial decreases with the infectivity of the epidemic, measured by the basic reproduction
number 𝑅 . At the same time, the optimal Type I error rate increases with 𝑅 . Lower levels
of initial infection increase the number of subjects required to verify the therapeutic efficacy
of the therapeutic under investigation, while higher levels of mortality increase the optimal
sample size. The results confirm our intuition that clinical trials should be expedited and a
higher false positive rate should be tolerated when the epidemic spreads more rapidly
through the population, has a higher mortality rate, and has already infected a sizable
portion of the population at the beginning of the RCT.
To provide transparency for how a patient-centered approach differs from the traditional
statistical framework in the anti-infectives context, we use a relatively simple mathematical
model of epidemic disease dynamics to estimate the societal loss in an outbreak. More
sophisticated epidemiological models can easily be incorporated into our framework at the
cost        of     computational          tractability     and        transparency      (see
https://projectalpha.mit.edu/resources for details).
One interesting trade-off to be explored is the difference between a COVID-19 vaccine and
an antiviral treatment that can cure an infected patient. While prevention through
vaccination is the ultimate goal, a successful treatment for the disease using repurposed
drugs that have already been approved for other indications (and whose safety profile has
already been established) may be even more valuable, especially if they can be deployed in
the nearer term and reduce the growing fear and panic among the general population. In
such cases, the approval threshold should clearly reflect these cost–benefit differences.
Of course, in practice, regulators consider many factors beyond p values in making their
decisions. However, that process is opaque even to industry insiders, and the role of patient
preferences is unclear. The proposed patient-centered approach provides a systematic,
objective, adaptive, and repeatable framework for explicitly incorporating patient
preferences and burden-of-disease data in the therapeutic approval process. This
framework also fulfills two mandates for the FDA, one from the fifth authorization of the
Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) for an enhanced quantitative approach to the
benefit–risk assessment of new drugs (U.S. FDA, 2013), and the other from Section 3002 of
the 21st Century Cures Act of 2016 requiring the FDA to develop guidelines for patient-
focused drug development, which includes collecting patient preference and experience data
and explicitly incorporating this information in the drug approval process.

for infectious disease therapeutics and contribute to the timely development of effective
treatments and vaccines for COVID-19 in particular.

Figure S3. Optimal Type I Error vs. 𝑹𝟎 for Absolute Risk of Being Susceptible. Optimal Type I error rate
𝜶 of nonadaptive Bayesian randomized clinical trial monotonically increases with the basic
reproduction number 𝑹𝟎 (assuming 𝑰𝟎 𝟎. 𝟏% , 𝑳𝑫 𝟏𝟎𝟎 and disease mortality of COVID‐19) if we
define the loss of making a Type I error as the absolute risk of being susceptible 𝑺 𝒕 𝑵𝑳𝑺 . This
alternative definition is not very realistic. For an epidemic with 𝑹𝟎 𝟐 , the loss of Type I error
converges to a large positive value 𝑺 𝑻 𝑵𝑳𝑺 as time approaches the end of the epidemic outbreak.
However, at the end of the outbreak, there are no more infected patients and thus no susceptible
subjects. Therefore, the loss of Type I error should approach zero as 𝒕 → 𝑻. This is the case for the excess
risk of susceptibility 𝑺 𝒕    𝑺 𝑻 𝑵𝑳𝑺 but not for the absolute risk of susceptibility 𝑺 𝒕 𝑵𝑳𝑺 .
