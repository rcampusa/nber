Implementing Structural Reforms in Abenomics: How to Reduce the Cost of Doing Business
in Japan

                                             ABSTRACT

Improving the environment for business is an important part of the growth strategy of Abenomics.
As the goal for this effort, the Abe Administration aims to improve Japan’s rank in the World Bank
Doing Business Ranking to one of the top three among OECD. This paper clarifies what it takes for
Japan to achieve the goal. By looking at details of the World Bank Doing Business ranking, we identify
various reforms that Japan could implement to improve the ranking. Then, we classify the reforms
into six groups depending on whether the reform requires legal changes and on political resistance
that the reform is likely to face. By just doing the reforms that do not require legal changes and are
not likely to face strong political opposition, Japan can improve the ranking to 13th. To be in the top
3, Japan would need to implement all the reforms that are not likely to face strong political resistance.
The conclusions, however, are based on the assumption that the conditions in the other countries do
not change, which is unrealistic. Thus, Japan would need to carry out all the reforms including those
with high political resistance to be among the top three.

1. Introduction

Abenomics made a good start. After the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) came back to power in
December 2012 and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced the new economic policy package
dubbed “Abenomics,” the economic conditions in Japan improved. More aggressive monetary
policy introduced by the Bank of Japan under the leadership of Governor Haruhiko Kuroda
seemed to be ending the chronic deflation. The GDP growth was substantially higher than it was
expected before the start of Abe administration.1 After the consumption tax rate increase by 3%
(from 5% to 8%) on April 1, 2014, however, the economic slowdown was more serious than
many expected. In the fall of 2014, the BOJ further expanded the monetary policy to help the
ailing economy. Abe Administration also decided to postpone another consumption tax increase
(from 8% to 10%) that was planned for October 1, 2015.

       Will the slowdown in 2014 turn out to be just a temporary setback for Abenomics? Can
Abenomics eventually pull the Japanese economy out of the low growth that has characterized
most of the last 20 years? The answer hinges on the success of the growth strategy part of
Abenomics, which is referred to as the third arrow. Even if the first two arrows of Abenomics
(bold monetary policy and flexible fiscal policy) eventually turn out to be successful, the best
they can achieve is to fix the demand shortage and eliminate the output gap. The growth strategy
is supposed to address issues for Japan’s long-term growth. In order for Japan to escape the long-
term stagnation and achieve a higher potential growth, the growth strategy part of Abenomics
needs to be successful.

       The growth strategy is not a new invention of the Abe administration. Two
administrations (led by the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ)) that immediately preceded the Abe
administration also formulated their own growth strategies. In both cases, the prime ministers
were forced out before the growth strategy was fully implemented.

        There is one thing new about the growth strategy in Abenomics: the planned use of Key
Performance Indicators (KPIs). KPIs are assigned to policy goals in the growth strategy and are
used to measure the progress. Although many KPIs that have been proposed for Abe’s growth
strategy are vague as Hoshi (2014) points out, there are a few that are clearly specified. The
growth strategy has gone through two revisions, once in June 2014 and the most recent in 2015.
In each revision, the status of existing KPIs was reviewed and several new KPIs were added.

        This paper takes up a clearly specified KPI and examines what it would take for Japan to
achieve the KPI. The KPI that we focus on is the goal of improving Japan’s ranking in the World
Bank Doing Business Ranking to increase “Japan’s international competitiveness.” The KPI
states “Japan will be one of the top three countries (currently 15th) in the business environment

ranking for the developed countries reported by the World Bank in “Doing Business Report” by
2020.”2

       Focusing on the business environment makes sense since there is a growing consensus in
economic research that the quality of business regulation and the institutions that enforce it are a
major determinant of employment creation, private sector development, and economic
prosperity. 3 For example, Haidar (2012) examined the link between regulatory reforms and
economic growth in 172 countries using World Bank Doing Business data, and found that each
regulatory reform is associated with a 0.15 percent increase in the real GDP growth rate on
average. For Japan, Hoshi and Kashyap (2012) list reduction of cost of doing business as one of
the important policy options to restart the growth.

        This paper clarifies how much reform Japan needs to make to move from its 2015
ranking of 19th (among 31 high income OECD economies) to top three. To do this, we use the
information in the 2015 Doing Business Report. Although the KPI was originally based on the
2013 Report, which ranked Japan as 15th among 31 high income OECD economies, Japan’s
ranking dropped to 19th in the latest (2015) report. Since the government has not changed the
original goal of moving to top three in the ranking, we analyze what it takes to achieve the goal
based on the latest information.

        The paper is organized as follows. The next section studies where Japan is ranked in the
2015 Report in each of the ten areas that the World Bank Doing Business Project looks at to
come up with the ranking. We also identify potential regulatory reforms in each area that would
improve Japan’s ranking. Section 3 then examines the identified regulatory reforms from two
perspectives: whether the reform requires any legal changes and whether the reform is likely to
face strong political resistance. The reforms that are primarily administrative and are not likely to
be political can be accomplished quickly. The reforms that require changes to prevailing laws
and/or are likely to be political would take more time. Section 4 concludes.

by the World Bank every year by looking at ten areas of doing business, many of which are
critically influenced by government regulations. Japan is ahead of other countries in some areas
such as protecting minority investors, trading across borders, enforcing contracts, and resolving
insolvency. As shown in Table 1, Japan is ranked 17th, 14th, 16th, and 2nd among OECD
economies respectively in these areas.5 Japan can do better, however, in the other areas. In the
ease of starting a business, getting credit, registering property, and paying taxes, Japan is ranked
27th, 22nd, 23rd, and 30th among the 31 OECD economies respectively. This section reviews
Japan’s ranking in each of the ten areas and identifies some regulatory reforms that Japan can
implement to improve its ranking.

2-1. Starting a business

Japan currently ranks 27th out of the 31 OECD economies on the ease of starting a business. It is
estimated to cost 7.5% of Japan’s income per capita (of 2013) to formally start a business in
Tokyo. The process takes 8 procedures and requires11 days in Tokyo. In comparison, an
entrepreneur can start a business by following just one procedure, in a half day, and at a cost of
0.3% of income per capita in New Zealand. Similarly, starting a business requires only 3
procedures and 2.5 days in Australia. It costs only 0.4% of income per capita to start a business
in Canada.

        Table A1 in Appendix 1 shows the details of the information collected by the World
Bank to evaluate the procedures, time, and costs required to start a business in Tokyo. There are
several reforms that Japan can implement to reduce the number of steps, the monetary cost, and
the time to start a business in Japan. The major ones are the following four.

       Eliminate the requirement for a company seal (reform 1)

       Make business registration administrative rather than judicial (reform 2)

       Create one-stop shop for business registration (reform 3)

       Cut registration fees (reform 4)

Eliminate the requirement for a company seal: Currently, an entrepreneur is required to make a
company seal and register it. These two procedures take about 4 days. The company seal is
required, per Article 20 of the Commercial Registration Act. The associated fee is about ¥10,000
for machine-carved seal or ¥20,000 for hand-carved seal. The entrepreneur or a company
representative must register the company seal and obtain the certificate of seal registration from
the Ward office in person. The certificate then must be submitted to the Legal Affairs Bureau at
the Ministry of Justice. The fee is approximately ¥400 per certificate of seal registration but

 Throughout the paper, we refer to OECD as the set of 31 OECD high income countries, not to the set of 34 OECD
members. The latter (34 member) group includes Chile, Mexico, and Turkey.

                                                                                                            3
varies from ward to ward. The requirement is a legacy of the old business practice where a seal
symbolized the legal identity of a business and authenticated all its contracts.

Make business registration administrative rather than judicial: To apply for registration, an
entrepreneur submits a duly completed application form, along with supporting documents
including the certificate of seal registration and the Articles of Incorporation to the Legal Affairs
Bureau headquarter or any of its branch offices in major cities (Tokyo, Yokohama, Osaka,
Nagoya, Kobe, and Fukuoka). Once the filed documents are reviewed and approved, the
company applies for the issuance of a company registration certificate. Normally, a judicial
scrivener completes the registration on behalf of the company. The whole process takes 4 days in
Japan. The 2004 amendment to the Commercial Registration Regulations has made it possible
for entrepreneurs to submit company registration applications online, but the time this legal
process takes has not been shortened. Japan can reduce the time for business registration by
making it a simple administrative process rather than judicial process. This changeover is
straightforward and has been done in many countries less developed than Japan, including
Serbia, Uganda, Bulgaria, and Honduras.

Create one-stop shop for business registration: Currently, the eight procedures that must be
completed to start a business in Japan require an entrepreneur to visit many regulators including
the Ward Office (to obtain the certificate of seal registration), Ministry of Justice, District Tax
Office, Municipality, Labor Standards Inspection Office, Japan Pension Service, and Public
Employment Security Office. Cumbersome registration procedures mean more hassle for
entrepreneurs. Creating one-stop shops for company registration has been a popular reform over
the last decade in many countries. For example, Portugal combined company, tax and social
security registrations in one building. A one-stop shop in Tokyo would allow entrepreneurs in
Japan to register with all the above agencies in a single visit and can open their businesses faster.

Cut registration fees: It currently costs 0.7% of the official stated capital or ¥60,000, whichever
is higher, to register the company at the Legal Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Justice in Japan.
This amount (¥60,000) is equivalent to 7% of Japan’s income per capita. The cost in Denmark is
only 0.2% of its income per capita. Registration fees account for the bulk of the direct monetary
cost to start a business in Japan. By reducing registration fees to ¥1,700 (0.2% of income per
capita: level of Denmark), Japan can substantially cut the cost to start a business.

        Many authors have taken interest in the impact of business entry reforms. For example,
Branstetter et al. (2014) evaluated the consequences of a recent regulatory reform in Portugal,
which substantially reduced the cost of firm entry. They found that the reform resulted in
increased firm formation and employment. Also, Bruhn (2011) estimated the economic effects of
a reform that simplified business entry regulation in Mexico. Using micro-level data, she found
that the reform increased the number of registered businesses by 5%.6

6
    Djankov (2009) included an earlier literature survey on the effects of making business entry easier.

                                                                                                           4
2-2. Dealing with construction permits

Japan stands at 19th out of 31 OECD economies on the ease of dealing with construction permits.
This indicator measures what it takes to comply with formalities to build a warehouse in Japan.
These formalities currently require 12 procedures compared to 7 in Sweden, 197 days compared
to 29 days in Korea,7 and direct monetary cost of 0.6% of warehouse value compared to 0.1% in
Slovak Republic. Instead of making the process cheaper, Japan made dealing with construction
permits more costly by increasing inspection fees in 2012.

        It would not be acceptable to do away with construction permits completely because
sound regulation of construction helps protect the public from faulty building practices.
Moreover, enhancing public safety, well-functioning building permit and inspection system can
also strengthen property rights and contribute to the process of capital formation.8

       Table A2 shows the details of the information collected by the World Bank to evaluate
the procedures, time, and costs associated with dealing with construction permits in Tokyo.
Japan can reduce the cost for entrepreneurs to deal with construction permits without
compromising building safety. The major reform measures to improve the ranking in the ease of
dealing with construction permits are:

          Reduce number of procedures to get a construction permit (reform 5)

          Reduce the time to issue a construction permit(reform 6)

Reduce number of procedures to get a construction permit: A company in Japan must complete
12 steps to legally build a warehouse, according to the World Bank Doing Business database
through information collected from experts in construction licensing, including architects, civil
engineers, construction lawyers, construction firms, utility service providers and public officials
who deal with building regulations. These procedures include acquiring permits/consents from
local authority, neighborhood, Building Department of Government of Tokyo, Labor Control
Office, Japan Building Center, and Land and Building Registry.

        Some of these procedures are redundant and can be merged with other ones. For example,
currently the builder needs two separate procedures to receive intermediate and final inspections
from Japan Building Center and another procedure to obtain completion certificate.

        Japan can benefit from the experience of various OECD countries that reduced the
number of construction licenses. In Germany some simple construction projects no longer
require a permit. Instead, the builder only notifies the municipality when construction starts.
Inspectors show up at the site once the project has begun. After this reform the time to comply
with licensing and permit requirements fell from 165 days to 133. In France the number of

                                                                                                                  5
licenses required for construction projects was reduced from 11 to 9. In Sweden, only 9
procedures are required, too. Elsewhere in Europe, Spain no longer requires an installation
license on top of the building license, cutting the number of procedures by one.

Reduce the time to issue a construction permit: Japan can reduce the number of days to deal
with construction permits by (1) introducing statutory time limits and (2) scaling back
inspections for small construction projects. The procedures to get approvals from the Japan
Building Center and Labor Control Office account for the bulk of time required -- 130 out of 197
days -- to deal with construction permits. Two other procedures to get approvals from Japan
Building Center and Water and Sewage Services add another 45 days. Japan can reduce the
number of days to deal with construction permits by introducing statutory time limits.

        In France, the average amount of time to get a construction permit was reduced by one
month by requiring the building inspectorate to visit and issue a declaration of work completion
within 3 months. In addition, the government can introduce “silence is consent” rules for issuing
building licenses. For example, Spain set the maximum time for approval at 90 days and adopted
the “silence is consent” rule at the same time. Similarly, the Netherlands introduced a 45-day
limit.

       Another reform that will reduce the time it takes to issue a permit is to adjust inspections
to the size and nature of the project. Smaller projects could receive less scrutiny, lowering
compliance costs and allowing regulators to focus their energy on more complex projects. Korea
implemented such reform in 2006. It exempted small construction projects from the requirement
to apply for an advance building permit.

2-3. Getting electricity

Japan currently ranks 9th on the Ease of Getting Electricity indicator. This indicator tracks the
number of procedures, the time, and the direct monetary cost necessary for a business to obtain a
permanent electricity connection for a newly constructed warehouse. Getting access to electricity
to a warehouse in Japan requires 3 procedures, takes 105 days although it costs a negligible
amount of money. It takes only 17, 18, and 22 days in Germany, Korea, and Iceland,
respectively.9

        Table A3 shows the details of the information collected by the World Bank to evaluate
the procedures, time, and costs associated with obtaining access to electricity in Tokyo. While
Japan performs well on the number of procedures and the direct monetary cost, it can implement
the following reform to improve its ranking:

        Reduce the number of days it takes to get electricity by 80 days by improving efficiency of
         the process (reform 7)

9
  Germany, Korea, and Iceland currently rank 2 nd, 1st, and 5th, respectively, on the Ease of Getting Electricity
indicator.

                                                                                                                    6
Reduce the number of days it takes to get electricity by 80 days by improving efficiency of the
process: Japan can reduce the time between submitting application to TEPCO and getting
connection works. After an initial contact with TEPCO on construction date and effective date of
contract, it currently takes 93 days before electricity connection works start. After an average of
93 days of waiting, TEPCO takes 11 more days to carry out connection works and install a
meter.10

         Examples from the rest of the world show that it is possible to increase the efficiency of
utilities’ internal processes and reduce the electricity connection delays. Malaysia, Mexico, and
Turkey made getting electricity easier by improving communications with contractors,
introducing electronic document management systems and increasing staff and resources for
inspections. In Burundi the electricity utility Regideso ended its monopoly on the sale of
transformers and other equipment needed for electricity connections. Since June 2012 the change
has decreased the time to obtain a connection by 30 days because customers can now import
materials instead of buying them from Regideso if the materials are not in the company’s stock.
The utility also opened a center that combines all the internal services of the utility involving
new connections. Mexico’s electricity utility, Comisión Federal de Electricidad, streamlined the
process for obtaining electricity, offered training to contractors and implemented a geographic
information system (GIS) that maps the electricity network. This commitment has paid off: the
time to obtain a new electricity connection in Mexico City dropped from291 days in 2009 to 85
in 2013.

2-4. Registering property

Japan is currently ranked 23rd on the ease of registering property. Doing Business records the full
sequence of procedures necessary for a business to purchase property from another business and
transfer the property title to the buyer’s name. The transaction is considered complete when it is
opposable to third parties and when the buyer can use the property, use it as collateral for a bank
loan or resell it.

        Registering property in Tokyo requires 6 procedures, takes 13 days and costs 5.8% of the
property value. More than 30 countries made it easier to register property since 2006. Japan was
not one of them, although its property registration process is relatively complicated compared to
other OECD countries. It is easier to register property in New Zealand than anywhere else in the
world. The entire process can be completed in 2 online procedures at a monetary cost of 0.1% of
the property value. Lawyers certify land transfer documents for their clients and submit them
electronically for registration. Confirmation is returned within minutes. In general, the cost of


10
  Since the data were collected in 2013 and 2014, one might wonder if the long delays in Japan may reflect
TEPCO’s troubles after its nuclear power plant accidents following the earthquake and Tsunami of March 2011. But
it is not the case. The delay was already long before 2011. For example, in the 2010 ranking, the total number of
days it typically took from application to the end of connection works were 105 days.

                                                                                                                7
registering property is lower by 26% on average in common law compared with civil law
countries, a result largely driven by differences in non-notary costs of registering property.11

       Table A4 shows the details of the information collected by the World Bank to evaluate
the procedures, time, and costs associated with registering property in Tokyo. To improve its
ranking in this category, Japan can:

          Reduce the time to register property by 7 days by introducing fast-track procedures
           (reform 8)

          Combine and eliminate some procedures for registering property (reform 9)

          Lower property registration fees (reform 10)

Reduce the time to register property by 7 days by introducing fast-track procedures: An
entrepreneur currently spends 7-10 days to file an application for registration at the Legal Affairs
Bureau. The Legal Affairs Bureau registers the title under the name of the new owner. As
registration is a requirement for perfection against third parties, reviewing the certified copy of
the real property registry is generally sufficient for identifying any existing encumbrances over
the real property. The parties may apply for registration by themselves. However, because of the
complexity of filing, usually they retain a judicial scribe for registration.

        The Legal Affairs Bureau may be in need of some structural reforms to reduce their
respective delays but such reforms might require long-term efforts. In order to speed up
registration in the meantime, the Legal Affairs Bureau could offer clients a choice of expedited
procedures: pay a slightly higher fee and the registration is completed faster. It could offer
expedited processing of 1-2 days, instead of waiting 7-10 days. Cases would be prioritized in a
transparent manner, and those that prefer not to wait would be given an official way to speed up
the process by 8-9 days in total. This type of scheme is offered in a number of countries around
the world, from Singapore to Netherlands. Singapore introduced an online fast-track registration
process for single transfers, enabling property transfers to be completed in one day.
Simultaneously, the Legal Affairs Bureau can work on further reforms to reduce time for
everyone – for example, by adopting shorter time-limits to process applications.

Combine and eliminate some procedures for registering property: Each party of the transaction
must obtain a corporate registry certificate that has been issued within 3 months before the
application. It can be obtained from a corporate registry office where the party is registered. The
cost is ¥600 per copy (¥480 if obtained online). The seller also must obtain a certificate of its
seal used for execution of the registration documents (issued within 3 months). It can be obtained
from the Legal Affairs Bureau. The cost is ¥450 per copy (¥390 if obtained online). These two
procedures can be combined, especially as the seller also needs to obtain yet another certificate

of evaluation for property tax at a local tax office. Japan can also cut the requirement to obtain
stamps for stamp duty at a post office. Instead, the payment, if needed, can be made at the Legal
Affairs Bureau.

Lower property registration fees: Currently, an entrepreneur in Tokyo must pay a registration
and license tax of 1.75% of property value and a property acquisition tax of 4% of property
value. The cost to register could be reduced significantly by replacing these taxes by a fixed fee.
High percentage-based taxes may lead some entrepreneurs to resort to underreporting their
property value to avoid paying the full amount or to avoid registration completely. As a result of
such reform, Japan would be able to make the cost of registering property as low as 0.1% of
property value, as in New Zealand, which is ranked 2nd in this category.

        Many governments have reduced the cost of property registration by establishing a low
fixed registration fee rather than charging entrepreneurs a percentage of the property value. In
2005, Slovakia abolished its 3% real estate transfer tax and set a low fixed fee for expedited
registration at 8,000 Koruny ($286). In 2007, Egypt and Poland adopted similar reforms. These
reforms also ended up reducing fraud in reporting the value of property and increased tax
revenues. Six months after Egypt replaced its 5.8% registration fee with a fixed fee of 2,000
Egyptian pounds ($323), the revenues rose by 39%.12

2-5. Getting credit

Two types of frameworks can facilitate access to credit and improve its allocation: credit
information systems and laws on collateral and bankruptcy. Credit information systems enable
lenders to view a potential borrower’s financial history (positive or negative). And they permit
borrowers to establish a good credit history that allows an easier access to credit. Sound
collateral laws enable businesses to pledge their assets as security to raise funds. Past research
found strong creditors’ rights specified in collateral and bankruptcy laws are associated with
higher ratios of private sector credit to GDP.13

        The World Bank Doing Business ease of getting credit index assesses the sharing of
credit information and the legal rights of borrowers and lenders with respect to secured
transactions using two indices. The depth of credit information index examines rules and
practices affecting the coverage, scope and accessibility of credit information available through
public credit registries and private credit bureaus. The strength of legal rights index measures
whether certain features that facilitate lending exist within the collateral and bankruptcy laws of
the country.

       How well do the credit information system and laws on collateral and bankruptcy in
Japan facilitate the access to credit? Japan has a score of 6 (out of 8) on the depth of credit

information index and a score of 4 (out of 12) on the strength of legal rights index. Higher scores
indicate more credit information and stronger legal rights for borrowers and lenders. Japan is
ranked 22nd among OECD economies on the ease of getting credit.

         Table A5 shows the details of the information collected by the World Bank to evaluate
the strength of credit reporting systems and the effectiveness of collateral and bankruptcy laws in
facilitating lending in Tokyo. To improve its ranking on the ease of getting credit indicator,
Japan can:

          Create a unified legal framework for secured transactions including creation,
           publicity and enforcement of security interests in movable assets (reform 11)

          Create a collateral registry in which all functional equivalents can be registered
           (reform 12)

          Reform bankruptcy law (reform 13)

          Establish a public credit registry for corporations (reform 14)

Create a unified legal framework for secured transactions including creation, publicity and
enforcement of security interests in movable assets: Japan can improve collateral laws to make
it easier for businesses to use their assets, especially movables, to secure credits. In what is
considered to be the best practice, the businesses would be allowed to grant a non-possessory
security right in a single category of movable assets (such as “machinery” or “inventory”)
without requiring a specific description of the collateral. Security right also should extend to
future or after-acquired assets and to the products, proceeds or replacements of original assets
automatically. This reform would increase the strength of legal rights index by 3 points.

Create a collateral registry in which all functional equivalents can be registered: Japan can
improve the system of registering collateral by creating a collateral registry in which all
functional equivalents to security interests in movable assets (fiduciary transfer of title, financial
leases, assignment or transfer of receivables, and sales with retention of title). The collateral
registry should cover both incorporated and non-incorporated businesses, unified geographically,
and with an electronic database indexed by debtor’s names. The collateral registry should also
allow secured creditors to register, search, amend or cancel security interests online. This reform
would increase the strength of legal rights index by another 3 points.

Reform Bankruptcy law: Japan can also improve the security rights of lenders in court-
supervised restructuring by changing the bankruptcy law. More concretely, Japan can introduce
automatic stay for creditors in court-supervised reorganizations (Corporate Reorganization or
Civil Rehabilitation). Japan can also allow secured creditors to be paid first even before tax
claims and employee claims when a business is liquidated. This reform would increase the
strength of legal rights index by additional 2 points.

                                                                                                   10
Establish a public credit registry for corporations: Japan has private sector credit bureaus that
collect and distribute credit information on individuals, but does not have those for credit
information of corporations. To fill the gap, the government can create a public credit registry
that collects and distributes credit information on corporations. With this change, the depth of
credit information index for Japan will rise by 1 point. If Japan’s credit bureaus also start
providing credit scores as a value-added service to help banks and financial institutions to assess
the creditworthiness of borrowers, that would increase the index by another point and bring it up
to the full score (8/8). However, it is unclear what an effective government policy to achieve this
can be.

        By completing these 4 reforms, Japan would achieve full scores in strength of legal rights
index (12/12) and increase depth of credit information index to 7/8. This would make Japan jump
to the second among the OECD countries (and in the world) on the ease of getting credit.

        Various recent studies have focused on the importance of creditor protection and credit
information sharing. For example, Djankov et al. (2007) found that both creditor protection
through the legal system and information sharing institutions are associated with higher ratios of
private credit to GDP. In addition, Doblas-Madrid and Minetti (2013) investigated the impact of
lenders' information sharing on firms' performance in the credit market using rich contract-level
data from a U.S. credit bureau. They found that information sharing reduces contract
delinquencies and defaults, especially when firms are informationally-opaque.14

2-6. Protecting minority investors

         The “protecting minority investors” indicator measures the transparency of related-party
transactions, liability for self-dealing, and shareholders’ ability to sue officers and directors for
misconducts. Japan currently ranks 17th among the OECD countries on the strength of investor
protection index. It scores 7/10 on the extent of disclosure index, 6/10 on the extent of director
liability index, 8/10 on the ease of shareholder suits index, 7/10 on the extent of conflict of
interest regulation index, 7/10.5 on the extent of shareholder rights index, 4.5/10.5 on the
strength of governance structure index, and 4.5/9 on the extent of corporate transparency index.
One of the most important potential problems in corporate governance is self-dealing: the use of
corporate assets by company insiders for personal gain. Related-party transactions are the most
common example. High ownership concentration and informal business relations can create the
perfect environment for such transactions, which allow controlling shareholders to profit at the
expense of the company’s financial health. Company assets may be sold at an excessively low
price to controlling shareholders, assets may be bought at an inflated price from controlling

                                                                                                   11
shareholders, or company loans are given to controlling shareholders on terms far better than the
arms-length offers.

        Economies with strong protections of minority investors would have clear and detailed
rules on disclosure and duties for corporate directors. They would also have well-functioning
court system to allow minority shareholders to obtain judgments within reasonable time.

        Empirical research shows that the level of investor protection matters for cross-country
differences in income growth: countries with stronger protections tend to grow faster than those
with poor investor protections.15 Moreover, stricter regulation against self-dealing is associated
with larger equity investment and less concentrated ownership.16 This is in line with the view
that stronger legal protections make minority investors more confident about their investments
and reduce the need for concentrated ownership to mitigate weaknesses in corporate governance.

        Table A6 shows the details of the information collected by the World Bank to evaluate
the strength of minority shareholders protections in Tokyo. To further strengthen investor
protections, Japan can:

           Increase disclosure requirements (reform 15)

           Increase directors’ liability (reform 16)

           Allow the plaintiff of a shareholder suit to request categories of documents without
            identifying specific ones (reform 17)

           Strengthen governance structure (reform 18)

           Enhance corporate transparency (reform 19)

           Improve shareholder rights (reform 20)

Increase disclosure requirements: Japan currently scores 7/10 in the extent of disclosure
requirements. By implementing the following three reforms, Japan can improve the score to
perfect 10/10. First, Japan can require a resolution at both a board meeting and a general
shareholders meeting to approve business transactions that entail a conflict of interest of a
director and majority shareholders. Currently a resolution at the board level is sufficient.
Second, a review by an external body for such transaction can be required before it takes place.
Third, Japan can require immediate disclosure, to the public and/or shareholders, of transactions
that entail a conflict of interest.

Increase directors’ liability: Japan currently scores 6/10 on the extent of director liability. Japan
can improve the score to 10/10 by implementing the following three reforms. First, Japan can

give the judicial system the power to void a business transaction if the transaction is deemed
unfair to minority shareholders or entails a conflict of interest. Second, directors can be required
to pay the damages caused to the company and also repay the profit made from self-dealing.
Third, a director at fault can be punished by fines and imprisonment.

Allow the plaintiff of a shareholder suit to request categories of documents without identifying
specific ones: Japan already scores 8/10 on shareholder suits, but it can improve the score to
9/10 by allowing the plaintiff to request categories of documents from the corporate defendant
without identifying specific ones.

Strengthen governance structure: Japan scores 4.5/10.5 on the strength of governance structure
index. It can improve its score to 10.5/10.5 by implementing the following four reforms. First,
Japan can bar CEOs from also serving as chairs of the board of directors. Second, it can require
companies to have separate audit committees. Third, Japan can ask a potential acquirer to make a
tender offer to all shareholders upon acquiring 50% of a company. Fourth, it can limit cross-
shareholding between 2 independent companies to 10% of outstanding shares.

Enhance corporate transparency: Japan scores 4.5/9 on the extent of corporate transparency
index. It can improve to 7.5/9 by implementing the following two reforms. First, Japan can
require ownership stakes representing 10% to be disclosed. Second, it can make obligatory the
disclosure of the compensation of individual managers.

Improve shareholder rights: Japan scores 7.5/10.5 on the extent of shareholder rights index. It
can improve to 10.5/10.5 by (i) allowing shareholders to amend company bylaws or statutes with
a simple majority and (ii) granting shareholders automatic subscription rights on new shares.

2-7. Paying taxes

The Doing Business paying taxes indicator measures the time and cost associated with paying all
taxes and other mandatory payments as required by government. Japan is ranked 30 out of 31 in
OECD, making this the lowest performing area for Japan. On average, a firm makes 14 tax
payments a year, spends 330 hours a year preparing, filing, and paying taxes and pays 51.3% of
profit as taxes.

        Efficient tax administration can help encourage businesses to become formally registered
thereby expanding the tax base and increase tax revenues. Administration that is unfair and
capricious will bring the tax system into disrepute and weaken the legitimacy of government.
Overly complicated tax systems are associated with high tax evasion. High tax compliance costs
are associated with larger informal sectors, more corruption and less investment. Economies with
simple, well-designed tax systems are able to help the growth of businesses and, ultimately, the
growth of overall investment and employment. 17 Also, measures of tax complexity have a

                                                                                                 13
significant inhibiting effect on the presence of FDI for a country pair: a 10% reduction in tax
complexity is comparable to a one percentage point reduction in effective corporate tax rates.18
In addition, a cut in the corporate tax rate by 10 percentage points could raise the annual growth
rate of an economy by one to two percentage points.19

        Table A7 shows the details of the information collected by the World Bank to evaluate
what a typical startup company in Tokyo needs to do to pay all the required taxes and
contributions.20 Looking at the table, Japan can implement two reforms to improve its ranking
on the ease of paying taxes.

        Reduce number of payments (reform 21)

        Reduce corporate profit tax rate (reform 22)

Reduce number of payments: While a company needs to make 3 tax payments in Hong Kong, 4
in Norway, and 5 in Singapore, it has to make 14 payments in Japan. In Norway, the 4 payments
are corporate income tax, social security contribution, value added tax, and fuel tax. In addition
to these 4 payments, a company in Tokyo must also pay inhabitants tax, a depreciable fixed
assets tax, a fixed assets tax on land and building, employer paid employment and health
insurance premia, real property acquisition tax (for building expansion), business premises tax
(on floor space), stamp tax (on contracts for land sale and building expansion), registration and
license tax, automobile tax, and automobile tonnage tax.

        Multiple taxations, where the same tax base is subject to more than one tax treatments,
appear to be making tax compliance cumbersome for taxpayers in Japan. Multiple taxations
increase the cost of doing business for firms because it increases the number of payments and
compliance time. Different forms have to be filled out, often applying different methods for
calculating the tax.

        Consolidating taxes would be a worthwhile reform. Tax offices can then distribute the
revenues among government agencies. Slovakia did just that: its single social contribution tax
funds health insurance, sickness insurance, old age pensions, disability insurance, unemployment
benefits, injury insurance, guarantee insurance and reserve fund contributions. In many countries
social security agencies would be reluctant to part with their powers, especially if there is a
chance that the central tax office will not give them their share of revenues. To gain their trust, a
formulaic allocation of revenues can be introduced so that there is little room for discretion.

  We believe that the number of fuel tax payments reported in table (1) is not correct. The fuel tax is included in gas
20

price that is paid at pump. Thus, companies do not pay fuel tax separately from their payment for fuel.

                                                                                                                     14
       Fifty-five economies have one tax per tax base. This keeps things simple. Having more
types of taxes requires more interactions between businesses and tax agencies. It also
complicates tax compliance.

        Businesses in Korea no longer need to calculate numerous taxes on the same base.
Starting with the 2010 tax year, property taxes and city planning taxes are being merged with
other taxes. And, thanks to an effort aimed at unifying social security laws and administrations,
businesses can now file and pay 4 labor taxes and contributions in a single payment. This reform
freed businesses from the requirement to file additional returns and bear additional tax
compliance costs.

        Canada has harmonized and simplified its tax system. Beginning in the 2010 tax year,
businesses are subject only to the federal harmonized sales tax, which replaced the former
federal goods and services tax and provincial sales tax.

         The time required to pay taxes estimates the number of hours it takes a typical company
to gather data, analyze accounting information to highlight sensitive tax items, calculate tax
liability, and submit payments. The process is estimated to take 330 hours in Japan but only 63
hours in Switzerland.21 By reducing the number of payments, Japan can also reduce the number
of hours it takes a company to pay taxes.

        More specifically, the following reform can reduce the number of taxes. First, all the
taxes levied on corporate profits (corporate income tax, enterprise tax, inhabitants tax, and
restoration surtax) are combined into one. Similarly, all the contributions that are based on gross
salaries that the firm pays to its employees (employer contributions to welfare pension insurance,
health insurance, workmen’s accident insurance, employment insurance, and child allowance)
are combined into one. All the taxes on fixed assets (depreciable fixed assets tax, fixed assets
tax, city planning tax, automobile tax, and automobile tonnage tax) are also combined into one.
Two taxes for building expansion (real property acquisition tax and registration and license tax)
are combined into one. Finally, the reform eliminates the stamp tax altogether. Then, the
combined corporate income tax and the combined employee contribution are made to be
collected at the same time once a year. In addition, the corporation will be paying taxes just three
more times (combined tax on fixed assets, combined tax for building expansion, and the value
added tax). Thus, the total number of tax payments will be reduced to four. We do not expect the
preparation time for tax to be reduced proportionally. Somewhat arbitrarily, we assume the
reform will reduce the preparation time for corporate income tax and employee contribution to
health insurance by 33% because they are now collected at the same time, but the preparation
time for the value added tax does not change. Under this assumption, the total time the firm
spends to pay taxes will be reduced from 330 hours to 233 hours.

21
  For comparability purpose, the Doing Business Project takes a standard case/company in each country for each
area. In estimating the time it takes to pay taxes, the standardized company is assumed to have a turnover of 1050
times income per capita.

                                                                                                               15
Reduce corporate profit tax rate: The total tax rate (as % of profit) is 21% in Canada and 25.9%
in Ireland but 51.2% in Japan. While the marginal statutory corporate income tax rate is 3.9% in
Canada and 12.4% in Ireland, it is 28.9% in Japan. And, the labor tax and contributions account
for 12.5% in Canada, 12.1% in Ireland, and 18.1% in Japan. Japan could benefit from reducing
the total tax rate.

        Specifically, we examine the impact of the reform that ends up reducing the total
effective tax rate by 20% to 31.2% on the ranking. The reform is much more drastic than that
currently planned by the Abe administration. The government aims to reduce the effective tax
rate by more than 5% in several years and by more than 10% in the long run. As the first step,
the Cabinet tax reform plan for FY2015 calls for 2.51% reduction of the effective corporate tax
rate for FY2015 and another 3.29% for FY2016.22

2-8. Trading across borders

Japan is ranked 14th out of 31 on the Doing Business trading across borders indicator. This
indicator measures the time and cost associated with exporting and importing a standardized
cargo of goods by sea transport. The time and cost necessary to complete every official
procedure for exporting and importing the goods are recorded. All documents needed by the
trader to export or import the goods across the border are also recorded. In France and Ireland,
only two documents (the bill of lading and customs declaration) are required to export or import.
But, in Japan, one more document (the commercial invoice) is required to export and three more
documents (cargo dispatch document, commercial invoice, and packing list) are required to
import. And, while it takes 11 days to comply with all the procedures required to export or
import goods in Japan, it takes only 6 days to comply with the procedures required to export and
5 days to comply with the procedures required to import in Denmark, United States, and Estonia.
The cost associated with procedures required to export (import) is 29% (45%) lower in Hong
Kong than in Japan.23

        Table A8 shows the details of the information collected by the World Bank to evaluate
the number of documents, days, and costs required by a typical company in Tokyo to import and
export. To improve its ranking on the ease of trading across borders, Japan can:

        Allow electronic submission and processing (reform 23)

        Link agencies through an electronic single window (reform 24)

 While trade facilitation does improve as the country size becomes smaller, the relationship between country size
and trade facilitation does not appear to be driven by the fact that small countries trade more as a proportion of their
GDP than the large countries. See Amin and Haidar (2014) for details.



                                                                                                                      16
        Use risk-based inspections (reform 25)

        Improve transparency in trade regulation (reform 26)

Allow electronic submission and processing: Electronic systems for filing, transferring,
processing, and exchanging customs information have become an important tool for managing
flows of information in complex trading systems. The newest web-based systems can allow
Japanese exporters and importers to submit their documents from anywhere and to pay duties
online. Japan can update its regulatory framework to allow exporters and importers to take
advantage of the new information technologies. Over the past 9 years, 119 economies have
introduced or improved such systems. Today traders can submit all trade documents
electronically in more than half of OECD high-income economies with no need to provide hard
copies. For example, France speeded up and simplified its customs clearance procedures by
introducing an electronic customs declaration and eliminating the need to submit certain
documents. The Netherlands made importing easier by introducing a new web-based system for
cargo release at the port terminals in Rotterdam. Spain also expanded the use of electronic
submission of customs declarations.

Link agencies through an electronic single window: Increasingly, economies are going a step
further by virtually linking not only traders and customs but all agencies involved in trade and
transport through an electronic single-window system. In what is considered the best practice
today, such a system allows traders to file standard information and documents through a single
entry point to fulfill all import, export and transit-related regulatory requirements, and shares
relevant information with all parties involved including private participants such as banks and
insurance companies as well as public agencies such as immigration and vehicle registration
authorities.

       As of this writing, 71 economies around the world have implemented single-window
systems of varying complexity. 24 In Singapore, the government established the world’s first
national single window for trade (TradeNet) in 1989, bringing together more than 35 border
agencies. 25 Portugal also implemented an electronic single window for port procedures. The
Korea Customs Service estimates that the introduction of a single-window system there brought
some $18 million in benefits in 2010, a part of the overall economic benefits that year of up to
$3.47 billion from the agency’s trade facilitation efforts.26 Indeed, for Korean-based companies
such as Samsung and LG, achieving rapid and predictable turnaround times is an important
source of their competitiveness.

Use risk-based inspections: Requiring imports and exports to undergo inspections (for tax,
security, environmental, border control, and health and safety reasons) is often necessary. Done

with a heavy hand, however, inspections can be a serious obstacle to efficient and predictable
trades.

        Over the years, customs administrations around the world have developed systems for
establishing risk profiles of products that allow them to apply inspections in proportion to the
potential risk. Investing in equipment is another way to help expedite the processing of cargo.
Many economies have adopted the use of scanners to limit the need to physically open
containers. In some countries, however, the use of scanners has led to further delays because
customs agents scan all containers and mandatory scanning fees have added costs for traders.
Efficient use of scanners in conjunction with risk-based profiling can strike the right balance in
inspection, contributing to the efficiency of the trade process. Risk-based inspections are the
norm in OECD high-income economies, but Japan has not adopted the practice. They are also
becoming increasingly common elsewhere. Today 134 economies use risk-based inspections.

Improve transparency in trade regulation: Improving transparency in trade regulation by
providing easy access to documentation of requirements and tariff schedules can reduce
transactions costs for importers and exporters. The average customs clearance cost for exports as
measured by Doing Business is 25.3% lower in those economies where documentation
requirements are easily accessible.27

        Recent literature has emphasized the importance of trade facilitation in explaining trade,
access to markets, and increases in per capita income. For example, Clark et al. (2004) found that
ports efficiency is an important determinant of shipping costs and in bilateral trade. Also,
Djankov et al. (2010) found that each additional day that a product is delayed prior to being
shipped reduces trade by more than one percent. Put differently, each day is equivalent to a
country distancing itself from its trade partners by about 70 km on average.

2-9. Enforcing contracts

Japan currently ranks 16th out of 31 on this index. The Doing Business Enforcing Contracts
indicator measures time, cost and procedural complexity to enforce a debt in court between two
local businesses. It takes 360 days (or nearly 1 year) from the moment a case is filed until the
creditor receives payment and the average cost amounts to 32.2% of the value of the claim.

        Effective commercial dispute resolution has many benefits. Courts can be important for
entrepreneurs because they interpret the rules of the market and protect economic rights.
Efficient and transparent courts encourage new business relationships because businesses know
they can rely on the courts if a new customer fails to pay. Speedy trials are essential for small
enterprises, which may lack the resources to stay in business while awaiting the outcome of a
long court dispute.

        Table A9 shows the details of the information collected by the World Bank to evaluate
the ease of enforcing contracts in Tokyo. To improve its rankings on this indicator, Japan can:

          Limit adjournments and make enforcement of judgments more efficient(reform 27)

          Introduce performance measures for judges(reform 28)

          Maintain specialized commercial court(reform 29)

          Expand case management systems and automation(reform 30)

Limit adjournments and make enforcement of judgments more efficient: Judges can limit
adjournments. Frequent adjournments slow down contract enforcement in Japan. Adjournments
are responsible for 280 days out of the 360 days that it takes to get trial and a judgment, and add
another 60 days for enforcement. Time limits should be enforced to reduce long delays in court
hearings.

Introduce performance measures for judges: Performance evaluation for judges could be
introduced. There are several indicators for the judge performance used in other countries. One
of them is the disposition rate, which is calculated by dividing the number of disposed cases (by
issuing judgments or settling a case in mediation) by the number of incoming cases.

Maintain specialized commercial court: Austria and Belgium have stand-alone commercial
courts. The U.K. and the U.S. have specialized commercial divisions within their courts.
Specialized courts have been found to improve efficiency. 28 Creating specialized commercial
courts can result in faster and less costly contract enforcements. One reason for the greater
efficiency is that judges become expert in handling commercial disputes. Commercial courts
often have less formal procedures. For example, use of oral arguments is permitted even where
the general courts require written procedures.

Expand case management systems and automation: Japan could expand the use of case
management that currently exists in minimal form and only in limited number of courts. Judicial
case management involves monitoring and managing cases in the court docket from the filing of
the claim until judgment is rendered. It has proved to be an effective tool for reducing procedural
delays at court and for monitoring the performance of judges and court officers. By analyzing
court workloads, case management systems can help predict trends and allocate resources
strategically. Case management can be particularly successful when courts are computerized and
when support functions (such as electronic filing, case tracking, document management, deadline
reminders and scheduling of hearings) are all performed automatically. Currently 21 of the 189
economies covered by Doing Business allow electronic filing of the initial complaint in a
commercial case. In 12 economies including Korea and Malaysia, the capacity has been
introduced only after 2007.

       The cost of enforcing contracts is a key determinant of market performance. For example,
Bae and Goyal (2009) showed that banks respond to poor enforceability of contracts by reducing
loan amounts, shortening loan maturities, and increasing loan spreads. Also, supported by panel
data on Italian provinces and by cross-country evidence, Jappelli et al. (2005) showed that
improvements in judicial efficiency reduce credit rationing and increase lending.

2-10. Resolving insolvency

The Doing Business resolving insolvency indicator identifies the main procedural and
administrative bottlenecks in the bankruptcy process. Economies with good bankruptcy
procedures can maximize the total value of recovered debt (to be divided among the debtor, the
main creditors and possibly the shareholders) with the least cost. Economies with inefficient
insolvency procedures have low recovery rates.29 An efficient bankruptcy procedure helps keep
economically viable firms in business and encourages creation of new firms, thereby promoting
healthy competition in the economy.

        Table A10 shows the details of the information collected by the World Bank to evaluate
the strengths and weaknesses in existing insolvency regulations in Tokyo. Japan already ranks
second in the world on this indicator. To improve its ranking on the ease of resolving insolvency,
Japan can:

          Promote specialized courts (reform 31)

Promote specialized courts: Promoting specialized courts is among the most efficient ways to
ensure that insolvency cases receive attention more quickly. It also improves the quality of the
judicial system, because it allows judges to specialize in hearing insolvency cases and thus better
equips them to make informed decisions. Japan could reduce the length of proceedings to shorter
than 0.6 years by creating courts specialized in bankruptcy cases.



3. What would it take for Japan to be in Top Three?

Overall, we have identified 31 reforms that Japan can carry out to reduce the cost of doing
business. In this section, we classify each reform according to two dimensions. One is whether
the reform requires legal changes or not. The other is the extent of political resistance the reform
is likely to face.

        Identifying whether a reform requires legal changes is straightforward. Predicting the
extent of political resistance is not. We asked political scientists who specialize in the Japanese
politics to judge whether each reform would face low, somewhat low, somewhat high, or high
political resistance. Detailed description of the expert survey is in Appendix 2. We use the

29
     See Crimizi et al (2012)

                                                                                                 20
average response to classify 31 reforms into three groups: low political resistance (average
response between “low” and “somewhat low”), medium political resistance (average response
between “somewhat low” and “somewhat high”), and high political resistance (average response
between “somewhat high” and “high”).

        Using both dimensions of classification, we group the reforms into six groups as in
Figure 1. For each of the 31 reforms, Table 2 shows whether the reform requires legal changes
and the degree of political resistance that the reform is likely to face according to the expert
survey. The table also shows the numerical average for the expert survey responses and how
much Japan’s ranking improves by implementing just that reform. Table 3 summarizes how all
the reforms are classified into the six groups in Figure 1.

        Of the 31 reforms, we find 6 reforms to be just administrative changes and likely to face
low political resistance (Group I). For example, allowing electronic submission and processing
of export and import documents would entail only an administrative change in the process.
Similarly, reducing the time to register property by introducing fast-track procedures,
introducing fast-track procedures and combining certain procedures within the property transfer
process at the Legal Affairs Bureau do not require legal changes. Moreover, political resistance
for these reforms is expected to be low.

        Certain administrative reforms are expected to face medium level of political resistance
(Group II). We find 8 of the 31 reforms fall into this category. Reducing the number of
procedures to get a construction permit requires a collaborative effort from more than one
government agency. These agencies would lose some of their powers in the consolidation
process and hence would oppose the reform. Similarly, challenges may arise from limiting
adjournments and making enforcement of judgments more efficient, introducing performance
measures for judges, maintaining specialized commercial court, and expanding case management
systems and automation. These reforms are administrative but are likely to face medium political
resistance.

        Only one reform is administrative and expected to face high political resistance (Group
III). This reform is about introducing performance measures for judges.

        There are 16 reforms that require legal changes. Four of these (elimination of the
requirement for a company seal, cutting business registration fees, reduction of the number of tax
payments, and the creation of a unified legal framework for secured transactions) are expected to
face low political resistance (Group IV). On the contrary, for example, reduction of the number
of tax payments is actually likely to be popular.

       Among the remaining 12 reforms that require legal changes, 9 are expected to face
medium political difficulty (Group V). These reforms include promoting specialized courts,
reducing corporate profit tax rates, and creating a collateral registry in which all functional
equivalents can be registered. We expect the oppositions would come from Ministry of Justice,

                                                                                               21
Ministry of Finance, and many corporations. Similarly, establishing a public credit registry for
corporations require legal changes and probably will face oppositions from corporation that
would lose some privacy.

       Only three reforms that need legal changes are expected to face high political resistance
(Group VI). These are increasing directors' liability, improving shareholder rights, and enhancing
required disclosure.

       Table 3 shows that most of the reforms to improve Japan’s position in the World Bank’s
Doing Business Ranking are expected to encounter medium level of political resistance at most.
Moreover, about half of these reforms (14 to be exact) with low or medium political resistance
do not require legal changes. This is good news for the Japanese government. These reforms
would be relatively easy to implement.

        Implementing just the reforms in Groups I and II would improve Japan’s ranking to #13
if all the other countries that are ranked higher than Japan currently do not do anything to
improve their conditions for doing business. Japan would leapfrog Canada, Estonia, Switzerland,
Austria, Portugal, and Netherlands, but would still be ranked lower than New Zealand, the U.S.,
Denmark, Korea, Norway, United Kingdom, Australia, and Finland. Although not enough to
make Japan one of the top three countries, just following through the easy reforms makes a
significant difference.

        If Japan implements the reforms that require legal changes but are expected to face low
political resistance (Group IV) in addition to the in Groups I and II, Japan’s ranking jumps to #6,
again if all the other countries do not improve their environments for doing business. Japan
would move ahead of Germany, Canada, and Estonia though still looking up New Zealand, the
U.S., and Denmark.

         When the reforms in Group V, which require legal changes and are expected to face
medium political resistance, are implemented, Japan will move to # 3. Thus, Japan would
achieve the KPI of being ranked among top three without implementing politically contentious
reforms, under the assumption that the other countries stand still. The assumption that other
countries will not do any reforms will certainly turn out to be false. Thus, Japan will probably
need to implement some reforms with high political resistance (Groups III and VI) as well, to
make sure to be among the top three countries in the ease of doing business ranking. By
implementing all the reforms in Groups I-VI, Japan would be ranked #1 if other countries stand
still and increase its chance to be in top 3 even if other countries also reform.




                                                                                                22
4. Concluding remarks

Improving the environment for business is an important part of the growth strategy (Third
Arrow) of Abenomics. As the KPI (Key Performance Indicator) for this effort, the Abe
Administration aims to improve Japan’s rank in the World Bank Doing Business Ranking from
#15 (in 2013 Report) among high-income OECD countries to one of the top three. Setting a clear
target makes sense because the experience of business regulatory reforms elsewhere shows
measuring and monitoring the progress of reform is important. For instance, Saudi Arabia used
the doing business indicators as part of a scheme to measure its reform progress. In 2005, it set
up a 5-year investment climate reform program and aimed to be among the top 25 in the doing
business ranking by 2008.30 The reform program was successful and Saudi Arabia was ranked
11th in the World Bank Doing Business 2011 report.

        Although the goal may be clear, it is not yet obvious how the Japanese government will
try to improve its Ease of Doing Business ranking. This paper clarifies what it takes for Japan to
be among top three countries in terms of ease of doing business. By looking at details of the
latest World Bank Doing Business ranking, we identify various reforms that Japan could
implement to improve the ranking. Then, we classify the potential reforms into six groups
depending on whether the reform requires legal changes and the extent of political resistance that
the reform is likely to face.

        By just doing the reforms that do not require legal changes and are not likely to face
strong political opposition, Japan can improve the ranking from the current 19th among high-
income OECD countries to #13, if other countries do not improve their business environments.
To be in top 3 is a little bit more difficult, but even that can be achieved without politically
difficult reforms. If Japan implements all the reforms except for those which are likely to face
high political resistance and if the other countries do not reduce the cost of doing business, it will
be ranked #3. Since the assumption that the other countries do not reform while Japan does is
unrealistic, Japan will also need to carry out some politically unpopular reforms in Groups III
and VI in order to achieve the KPI becoming one of the top three countries among high-income
OECD countries in terms of ease of doing business.

        Improving the ranking alone, however, would not guarantee increased business creation
in Japan. This fact is because the Doing Business ranking does not look at all the aspects of cost
of doing business. For example, to measure the difficulty of dealing with licenses, Doing
Business indicators examine the burden of obtaining a permit to build a warehouse. However,
firms must deal with licenses in many other areas as well. These licenses include medical devices
and drugs, radio stations, mines, bars, banks, insurance companies, airlines, and taxis depending
on their business. The cost of doing business in those areas is not covered by the report’s
indicators. If Japan wants to reduce the cost of doing business generally, the government has to

     See Belayachi and Haidar (2008)

                                                                                                   23
look at licensing procedures in these other areas, too. International benchmarks may be useful for
getting an idea of achievable performance in a particular area, but the key is to improve in all the
areas that matter, whether or not they are covered by existing global indicators.31

        Finally, improving the business environment is just one of the many economic reform
areas proposed in Abenomics. Achieving the KPI for this reform area alone would not be
sufficient to restore the growth to Japan. Also, there is a social cost for implementing flexibility-
enhancing structural reforms that need to be addressed.32 Thus, it will be important to have clear
KPIs for other growth enhancing reform areas, too, and to achieve those. A problem of
Abenomics is that it is not clear on how to achieve the KPIs in many reform areas even when
they have clear KPIs. This problem still exists in the 2015 revision of the growth strategy. This
paper shows a way to formulate a clear reform plan to achieve the KPI for improving the
business environment in Japan.33 Similar exercises would be useful in other reform areas as well.

   Hausmann (2013) argues that countries should not focus too much on improving their rankings. Instead, he argues,
the countries should use the information as a catalyst for growth policy debates.

     Notes: “Impact” column shows what would happen when that reform alone without any other reforms was implemented. Thus, the
     impact on ranking is the marginal impact evaluated at the status quo. All rankings in Table 2 refer to OECD ranking (column 3 of
     Table 1). To capture "expected political resistance", we sought the help of 27 political scientists, who are experts on Japanese politics
     and institutions, in gauging the extent of political challenges each reform is likely to face. In a survey, for each of the reforms, we
     asked the experts to judge the extent of political resistance that the reform is likely to face using the following four point scale: (1) The
     reform is expected to face low political resistance; (2) The reform is expected to face somewhat low political resistance; (3) The
     reform is expected to face somewhat high political resistance; and (4) The reform is expected to face high political resistance. Then,
     for each of the reforms, we used the average response value. We came up with three groups of political resistance: low (1<=average
     score<2), middle (2<= average score<3), high (3<=average score<=4).

Appendix 2. Expert Survey on Economic Reforms in Japan
To gauge the extent of political challenges that each of the 31 reforms that we consider in this
paper, we have conducted an expert survey. The survey was designed and conducted using the
Qualtrics survey tool. The 31 reforms were grouped into three groups (reforms 1 through 10,
reforms 11 through 20, and reforms 21 through 31) and each respondent was randomly asked to
answer the questionnaire for one of the three groups.34
       The survey was sent to 68 political scientists who we consider are knowledgeable in
Japanese politics. 23 of them received the questionnaire for reforms 1-10, 23 received the one for
reforms 11-20, and 22 received the one for reforms 21-30. The emails asking to participate in the
survey was sent out on July 14, 2015 and the recipients were asked to complete the survey by
July 21. 27 respondents (10 for reforms 1-10, 10 for reforms 11-20, and 7 for reforms 21-31)
answered at least one question. Many answered all the questions.
       Emails were titled “Request for Assistance - Expert Survey on Economic Reforms in
Japan” and started as:

I am working on a paper on one particular policy in the Abenomics growth strategy. Improving the
environment for business is an important part of the growth strategy of Abenomics. As the KPI (Key
Performance Indicator) for this effort, the Abe Administration aims to improve Japan’s rank in the World
Bank Doing Business Ranking from the #15 (in 2013 Report) among OECD countries to one of the top three.
The paper identifies several reforms that Japan can implement to improve its ranking.

I would like you to help us gauge the extent of political challenges each reform is likely to face by completing a
brief survey. In this survey, we ask you to judge the extent of political resistances that the reform is likely to
face using the following four point scale.
(1). The reform is expected to face low political resistance.
(2). The reform is expected to face somewhat low political resistance.
(3). The reform is expected to face somewhat high political resistance.
(4). The reform is expected to face high political resistance.
Each question also has a space where you can write in additional comments (optional).

To have an idea about “low” political resistance and “high” political resistance for policies, the following
examples may be useful. As a part of “Cool Japan” strategy to promote Japanese contents (such as manga and
anime) and food (washoku) industries, the government proposes establishment of a one-stop contact point
for facilitating the rights management of content. You may judge that the political resistance for such policy is
expected to be “low.” On the other hand, you would judge that policies to promote TPP (Trans-Pacific
Partnership) and other FTAs (Free Trade Agreements) are likely to face “high” political resistance because
they will be opposed by powerful agricultural interest.

The survey will take 5-20 minutes to complete depends on how deeply you consider each question. If
possible, I would like to get your response by Monday, July 20. I appreciate your help.




  We are grateful to Mary Shiratori for designing and conducting the survey. She also created spreadsheets of the
34

survey result, which we used for the analysis. We thank Anil Kashyap, Kenji Kushida, Phillip Lipscy, Ulrike
Schaede, and Paul Schuler for giving us comments to improve the survey instrument. We also thank the experts
who responded to our survey: Daniel Aldrich, Marie Anchordoguy, Amy Catalinac, William Grimes, Yusaku
Horiuchi, Saori Katada, Azusa Katagiri, Junko Kato, Ellis Krauss, Ikuo Kume, Kenneth MacElwain, Ko Maeda,
Megumi Naoi, Gene Park, T.J. Pempel, Frances Rosenbluth, Richard Samuels, Ethan Scheiner, Kay Shimizu, Dan
Smith, Yuki Takagi, Harukata Takenaka, Hiroki Takeuchi, Mark Tilton, Maria Toyoda, and Steve Vogel.

Then the email listed the link for the survey for one of the three groups of reforms.
       The questionnaire for each of the three groups of reforms is reproduced below. The
paragraph “Details” is shown only when the respondent clicks the “show details” button. For
each question, the respondent can leave comments if (s)he chooses to do so.


A2.1    Questionnaire for Reforms 1 through 10
Reform 1: Eliminate the requirement for a company seal: This reform eliminates the
requirement for an entrepreneur to make a company seal and register it. The cost for making a
seal is about ¥10,000 for machine-carved seal or ¥20,000 for hand-carved seal. The entrepreneur
or a company representative must register the company seal and obtain the certificate of seal
registration from the Ward office in person. The certificate then must be submitted to the Legal
Affairs Bureau at the Ministry of Justice. The fee is approximately ¥400 per certificate of seal
registration but varies from ward to ward.

Details: Currently, an entrepreneur is required to make a company seal and register it. These two
procedures take about 4 days. The company seal is required, per Article 20 of the Commercial
Registration Act. The requirement is a legacy of the old business practice where a seal
symbolized the legal identity of a business and authenticated all its contracts. Seal makers (many
of them very small business) may oppose to the reform.

What is the extent of political resistance that you expect for this reform?
(1). Low
(2). Somewhat low
(3). Somewhat high
(4). High
Comments (optional):

Reform 2: Make business registration administrative rather than judicial: Currently, to apply
for registration, an entrepreneur submits a duly completed application form, along with
supporting documents including the certificate of seal registration and the Articles of
Incorporation to the Legal Affairs Bureau headquarter or any of its branch offices in major cities.
Once the filed documents are reviewed and approved, the company applies for the issuance of a
company registration certificate. Normally, a judicial scrivener completes the registration on
behalf of the company. The whole process takes 4 days.

Details: Japan can reduce the time for business registration by making it a simple administrative
process rather than judicial process. This seems to be straightforward. Similar reforms have been
implemented in many countries less developed than Japan, including Serbia, Uganda, Bulgaria,
and Honduras. It is hard to imagine prominent interest groups that would oppose to the reform.

What is the extent of political resistance that you expect for this reform?
(1). Low

                                                                                                50
(2). Somewhat low
(3). Somewhat high
(4). High
Comments (optional):

Reform 3: Create one-stop shop for business registration: Currently, the eight procedures that
must be completed to start a business in Japan require an entrepreneur to visit almost as many
regulators including the Ward Office (to obtain the certificate of seal registration), Ministry of
Justice, District Tax Office, Municipality, Labor Standards Inspection Office, Japan Pension
Service, and Public Employment Security Office.

Details: Creating one-stop shops for company registration has been a popular reform over the
last decade in many countries. For example, Portugal combined company, tax and social security
registrations in one building. An obvious interest group that may object to such a reform includes
bureaucrats who might view the reform as detrimental to their authority.

What is the extent of political resistance that you expect for this reform?
(1). Low
(2). Somewhat low
(3). Somewhat high
(4). High
Comments (optional):

Reform 4: Cut registration fees: This reform proposes to reduce the registration fee to ¥1,700
regardless of the size of corporation. It currently costs 0.7% of the official stated capital or
¥60,000, whichever is higher, to register the company at the Legal Affairs Bureau of the Ministry
of Justice in Japan.

Details: Registration fees account for the bulk of the direct monetary cost to start a business in
Japan. Ministry of Finance might object to the reform on the ground that this would reduce the
government revenues.

What is the extent of political resistance that you expect for this reform?
(1). Low
(2). Somewhat low
(3). Somewhat high
(4). High
Comments (optional):

Reform 5: Reduce the number of procedures to get a construction permit: Currently a company
must complete 12steps to build a warehouse legally. These procedures include acquiring
permits/consents from local authority, neighborhood, Building Department of Government of
Tokyo, Labor Control Office, Japan Building Center, and Land and Building Registry. Japan
Building Center and the Local Authority account for 9 out of the 12 procedures. The reform
proposes to cut the number of procedures to six by:



                                                                                               51
   (1) Combining two procedures to receive intermediate and final inspections from Japan
       Building Center, combining two procedures to obtain completion certificate and building
       permit from Japan Building Center.
   (2) Combining the five procedures to hold initial consultation with local authority, obtain
       consent of neighborhood, purchase and post statutory construction notice sign board,
       submit construction method plan to local authority and obtain approval, and submit
       project safety and health and resources recycling plan to local authority and obtain
       approval. An entrepreneur should be able to do the above procedures in one visit to the
       local authority.

Details: Some of the 12 procedures to legally build a warehouse are redundant and can be
merged with other ones. The Building Department of Government of Tokyo, Labor Control
Office, Japan Building Center, and Land and Building Registry may object this reform as they
may view it as detrimental to their authority.

What is the extent of political resistance that you expect for this reform?
(1). Low
(2). Somewhat low
(3). Somewhat high
(4). High
Comments (optional):

Reform 6: Reduce the time to issue a construction permit: This reform proposes to limit the
time it takes to issue a permit to 67 days (cutting 130 days from the current 197 days). The
government can introduce “silence is consent” rules: if the permit is not issued within the
timeline the construction is considered being approved. Also, the government can scale back
inspections for small construction projects. Such reform would adjust inspections to the size and
nature of the project.

Details: The Japan Building Center, Labor Control Office, and Water and Sewage Services may
object this reform; these institutions account for the bulk of time required to deal with
construction permits.

What is the extent of political resistance that you expect for this reform?
(1). Low
(2). Somewhat low
(3). Somewhat high
(4). High
Comments (optional):

Reform 7: Reduce the number of days it takes for getting electricity by 80 days by improving
process efficiency: After an initial contact with TEPCO on construction date and effective date
of contract, it currentlytakes93 days before electricity connection works start. After an average of
93 days of waiting, TEPCO takes 11 more days to carry out connection works and install a
meter. In this reform, the government would convince TEPCO to respond more quickly to the
customers’ request to start electricity services.

                                                                                                 52
Details: Examples from the rest of the world show that it is possible to increase the efficiency of
utilities’ internal processes and reduce the electricity connection delays. TEPCO may object to
this reform because it would need to make efforts to increase efficiency.

What is the extent of political resistance that you expect for this reform?
(1). Low
(2). Somewhat low
(3). Somewhat high
(4). High
Comments (optional):

Reform 8: Reduce the time to register property by introducing fast-track procedures: The
reform proposes to let the Legal Affairs Bureau offer a choice of expedited procedures: pay a
slightly higher fee and the registration is completed in 1-2 days instead of the current practice of
7-10 days.

Details: The Legal Affairs Bureau registers the title under the name of the new owner. As
registration is a requirement for perfection against third parties, reviewing the certified copy of
the real property registry is generally sufficient for identifying any existing encumbrances over
the real property. The parties may apply for registration by themselves. However, because of the
complexity of filing, usually they retain a judicial scribe for registration. The Legal Affairs
Bureau may be in need of some structural reforms to reduce their respective delays but such
reforms might require long-term efforts. It is hard to imagine prominent interest groups that
would oppose to the reform.

Reform 9: Combine and eliminate some procedures for registering property:The reform
combines two procedures that the seller of the property needs to complete (obtaining a corporate
registry certificate and obtaining a certificate of its official seal) into one. The reform also
eliminates the requirement to pay stamp duty at a post office.

Details: The corporate registry office and the Legal Affairs Bureau may oppose this reform.

Reform 10: Lower property registration fees: Currently, an entrepreneur in Tokyo must pay a
registration and license tax of 1.75% of property value and a property acquisition tax of 4% of
property value. The reform replaces these fees with single fee of 0.1% of property value.

Details: The cost to register property could be reduced significantly by replacing the current
percentage-based taxes by a fixed fee. Ministry of Finance might object to the reform on the
ground that this would reduce the government revenues.

A2.2   Questionnaire for Reforms 11 through 20
Reform 11: Create a unified legal framework for secured transactions including creation,
publicity and enforcement of security interests in movable assets: This reform would improve
collateral laws to make it easier for businesses to use their assets, especially movables, to secure
credits. The businesses will be allowed to grant a non-possessory security right in a single
category of movable assets (such as “machinery” or “inventory”) without requiring a specific
description of the collateral. Security right will also extend to future or after-acquired assets and
to the products, proceeds or replacements of original assets automatically.

Details: Japan can allow the businesses to grant a non-possessory security right in a single
category of movable assets (such as “machinery” or “inventory”) without requiring a specific
description of the collateral. This reform would increase the strength of legal rights of creditors
but may face objection from some borrowers.

Reform 12: Create a collateral registry in which all functional equivalents can be registered:
All functional equivalents to security interests in movable assets (fiduciary transfer of title,
financial leases, assignment or transfer of receivables, and sales with retention of title) will be
registered. The collateral registry will cover both incorporated and non-incorporated businesses,
unified geographically, and with an electronic database indexed by debtor’s names. The
collateral registry will also allow secured creditors to register, search, amend or cancel security
interests online.



                                                                                                  54
Details: Japan can improve the system of registering collaterals by creating a collateral registry
in which all functional equivalents to security interests in movable assets (fiduciary transfer of
title, financial leases, assignment or transfer of receivables, and sales with retention of title) are
recorded. If the reform is viewed as additional regulatory burdens for reporting, there may be
some objections from the financial industry.

Reform 13: Reform bankruptcy law: This reform introduces automatic stay for creditors in
court-supervised reorganizations (Corporate Reorganization and Civil Rehabilitation). The
reform also allows secured creditors to be paid first even before tax claims and employee claims
when a business is liquidated.

Details: Japan can improve the security rights of lenders in court-supervised restructuring by
changing the bankruptcy law. It can also allow secured creditors to be paid first even before tax
claims and employee claims when a business is liquidated. This reform may face challenges
from Ministry of Justice as it favors a less active judicial involvement in the proceedings and is
based on the principle that more control of the proceedings should lie in the hands of the
creditors. It is a hurdle to convince judges to relinquish some of their power while maintaining
their role as guarantor of the fairness of the proceedings not only in liquidation procedures but
also in reorganization procedures.

Reform 14: Establish a public credit registry for corporations: Currently Japan has private
sector credit bureaus that collect and distribute credit information on individuals, but does not
have those for credit information of corporations. In this reform, the government creates a public
credit registry that collects and distributes credit information on corporations.

Details: Japan has private sector credit bureaus that collect and distribute credit information on
individuals, but does not have those for credit information of corporations. To fill the gap, the
government can create a public credit registry that collects and distributes credit information on
corporations. The corporate sector may object this reform for reasons related to data security,
retention, and privacy as well as for compliance matters and actions in the event of
noncompliance.



                                                                                                   55

Reform 15: Increase disclosure requirements: The reform includes three changes in the
Corporate Law. First, it requires a resolution at both a board meeting and a general shareholders
meeting to approve business transactions that entail a conflict of interest of a director and
majority shareholders. Currently a resolution at the board level is sufficient. Second, a review by
an external body for such transaction will be required before it takes place. Third, companies will
be required to disclose any transaction that entails a conflict of interest immediately to the public
and shareholders.

Details: By implementing three reforms, Japan can improve the extent of disclosure
requirements. First, Japan can require a resolution at both a board meeting and a general
shareholders meeting to approve business transactions that entail a conflict of interest of a
director and majority shareholders. Currently are solution at the board level is sufficient. Second,
a review by an external body for such transaction can be required before it takes place. Third,
Japan can require immediate disclosure, to the public and/or shareholders, of transactions that
entail a conflict of interest. Large incumbent shareholders may be opponents for such reform as it
entails increased financial disclosure and requires a company to report large transactions with a
controlling shareholder immediately to the marketplace and in the annual report.

Reform 16: Increase directors’ liability: This reform includes three legal changes to increase the
liability for corporate directors. First, directors are required to pay the damages caused to the
company and also repay the profit made from self-dealing. Second, a director at fault can be
punished by fines and imprisonment. Finally, the judicial system is allowed to void a business
transaction if the transaction is deemed unfair to minority shareholders or entails a conflict of
interest.

Details: By implementing three reforms, Japan can improve the extent of director liability. First,
Japan can give the judicial system the power to void a business transaction if the transaction is
deemed unfair to minority shareholders or entails a conflict of interest. Second, directors can be
required to pay the damages caused to the company and also repay the profit made from self-
dealing. Third, a director at fault can be punished by fines and imprisonment. Directors on
corporate boards are obviously a potential group that would oppose to this reform.

governance. First, CEOs are prohibited from also serving as chairs of the board of directors.
Second, companies are required to have separate audit committees. Third, a potential acquirer
must make a tender offer to all shareholders upon acquiring 50% of a company. Fourth, cross-
shareholding between 2 independent companies are limited to 10% of outstanding shares.

A2.3   Questionnaire for Reforms 21 through 31
Reform 21: Reduce number of payments: Currently a company in Tokyo needs to make 14
payments (corporate income tax, social security contribution, value added tax, fuel tax,
inhabitants tax, a depreciable fixed assets tax, a fixed assets tax on land and building, employer
paid employment and health insurance premia, real property acquisition tax, business premises
tax, stamp tax, registration and license tax, automobile tax, and automobile tonnage tax). The
reform combines collections of these taxes so that a company has to make just 4 payments a
year. The Tax Agency then distributes the revenues to other government agencies that used to
receive revenues from these taxes.

Details: Some of these tax revenues are tied to specific public expenditures. For example, fuel
tax and automobile tonnage tax are still used primarily to finance the expenditures on
maintaining roads, although there have been some reforms to allow the government to use at
least a part of those tax revenues for general expenditures. Some politicians may fear this reform
is used to erode the funding for their preferred expenditures and may oppose to the reform.
Moreover, these tax revenues go to different governments. Some are revenues to the central
government and some others are for local governments. Local government may fear this reform
would end up reducing their tax revenues and may oppose the reform.

point to fulfill all import, export and transit-related regulatory requirements, and to share relevant
information with all parties involved including private participants such as banks and insurance
companies as well as public agencies such as immigration and vehicle registration authorities.

Details: Customs administration may hinder this reform which would require developing
information sharing system through a single entry point to fulfill all import, export and transit-
related regulatory requirements.

filing of the claim until judgment is rendered. By analyzing court workloads, case management
systems can help predict trends and allocate resources strategically.

Details: Judges and court officers may resist this reform as it may require changes in practices
that they are used to and may need them to learn to use new tools (such as electronic filing, case
tracking, document management, deadline reminders and scheduling of hearings).
