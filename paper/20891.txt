                                             ABSTRACT

We document several facts about workforce transitions from the informal to the formal sector in Vietnam,
a fast growing, industrializing, and low-income country. First, younger workers, particularly migrants,
are more likely to work in the formal sector and stay there permanently. Second, the decline in the
aggregate share of informal employment occurs through changes between and within birth cohorts.
Third, younger, educated, male, and urban workers are more likely to switch to the formal sector than
other workers initially in the informal sector. Poorly educated, older, female, rural workers face little
prospect of formalization. Fourth, formalization coincides with occupational upgrading.

       Reallocation of resources toward more productive uses contributes significantly towards

economic growth. A distinct feature of the distribution of firms in low-income countries is the

prevalence of small, informal, household-run firms, which employ a large share of the workforce

and provide livelihoods for the poor, but lag in productivity far behind formal firms (Banerjee

and Duflo 2007; Gollin 2008; La Porta and Shleifer 2014). Most of these firms have little

potential to transition to the formal sector (de Mel, McKenzie and Woodruff 2010, 2013; La

Porta and Shleifer 2014). Nonetheless, the individuals working in them might transition to the

formal sector as low-income economies develop (Lucas 1978; Gollin 2008). However, evidence

on economy-wide transitions of individuals in and out of informality in a low-income setting is

scarce, with most studies confined to urban middle-income settings (Maloney 2004).

       We document several facts about individual transitions from the informal to the formal

sector in Vietnam, a fast-growing, industrializing, and low-income economy. First, younger

workers, particularly those who have migrated, are more likely to work in the formal sector and

stay there permanently. Second, the decline in the aggregate share of informal employment

occurs through changes between and within birth cohorts. Third, younger, better educated, male,

and urban workers are more likely to switch to the formal sector than other workers initially in

the informal sector. A poorly educated, older, female, rural worker faces little prospect of

formalization. Fourth, formalization is associated with occupational upgrading.

       We focus on Vietnam over a decade of rapid growth from 1999 to 2009, when GDP per

capita increased by 78 percent, the labor force grew by 35 percent, and the percentage of the

workforce employed in the informal sector dropped from 86 to 79. This drop reflected a relative

contraction of employment in agriculture and an expansion of manufacturing and services, as

well as a drastic drop in the share of informal jobs within manufacturing from 58 to 43 percent.



	                                               1
       We analyze data from the 1999 and 2009 Vietnam Population Censuses and the 2002,

2004, 2006, and 2008 Vietnam Household Living Standards Surveys (VHLSSs) focusing on

workers ages 20-64. The data is nationally representative, covers all industries (including

agriculture), and workers in formal and informal firms. An individual works in the informal

sector if they are self-employed or works as an employee in the household business sector as

opposed to the registered, enterprise sector. In Vietnam, state, foreign, and collective firms are

legally required to register as an enterprise, whereas domestic private firms may legally operate

as either an enterprise or a household business. Our definition closely corresponds to the notion

of informality used in the literature (see La Porta and Shleifer 2014). The VHLSSs contain a

rotating panel subcomponent that tracks individuals over a period of up to four years. We

therefore analyze transitions to the formal sector in a nationally representative setting and over a

longer time frame than is usually feasible (de Mel, McKenzie and Woodruff 2010). An online

supplement provides further information on this data.

I. Formalization across and within birth cohorts

       Workers of different ages differ in mobility costs (Dix-Carneiro 2014), affecting their

ability to transition to the formal sector as the economy grows. Age cohorts can shape the decline

in aggregate informality through two channels. If the share of informal workers differs across

birth cohorts, aggregate informality declines if cohorts entering the labor market have lower

informality than existing and exiting cohorts. Additionally, workers within a given cohort may

transition to the formal sector. We examine the role of birth cohorts in the aggregate decline in

informality in Table 1. Panel A reports the share of informal employment by five-year birth

cohorts from the 1999 and 2009 censuses. Cohorts are based on age in 1999.




	                                               2
       Young workers make a key contribution toward the aggregate decline in informality.

Young workers that enter the workforce between 1999 and 2009 (age 10-19 in 1999, then age

20-29 in 2009) are less likely to work informally than older, exiting cohorts (ages 55-59, 60-64

in 1999. The informality among the entering cohorts is about 70 percent (column 2), compared to

over 90 percent among the exiting cohorts (column 1). This highlights the importance of young

cohorts for declines in informality through workforce shifts across cohorts. In addition, younger

cohorts experience greater declines in within-cohort informality than older cohorts. Column 3 of

Table 1 shows that reductions in informality are largest for the youngest cohorts and decline with

age. Cohorts age 20-24 and 25-29 in 1999 experience an 11.2 and 4.7 percentage point drop in

the share of informal employment by 2009, respectively, while workers in cohorts over age 40

either observe no change or gain employment in informal sector.

       Over the decade, manufacturing employment expanded from 8.9 to 13.7 percent of the

workforce, accompanied by a 14.5 percentage point drop in informality in that sector. As noted

in Table 1, young cohorts contribute even more significantly toward reductions in informality

within manufacturing than they do economy-wide. In manufacturing, the gap in informality

between entering young cohorts and existing cohorts is more pronounced and younger cohorts

experience a greater decline in informality relative to older cohorts over time. Analysis by

gender yields similar findings, although the gaps in informality across cohorts are larger for

women and the within-cohort changes in informality are larger for men (see Table A4 in

supplement).

       When formal manufacturing jobs are spatially concentrated, transitions to the formal

sector in a low-income country in part occur through migration (Harris and Todaro 1970). In

Vietnam in 1999, five provinces accounted for 63 percent of formal manufacturing employment.




	                                               3
We define migration as moving across provinces within the past five years, using the censuses

(see Table A5 in supplement). 4.6 percent of workers in 2009 migrated, 66 percent of them to the

five key provinces. Migration significantly increases over the decade of growth, particularly for

the youngest cohort, from 5.6 to 11.6 percent. Migration declines with age. Importantly, migrants

are much less likely to work informally. For example, in 2009, 72 percent of the workers in the

youngest cohort were employed in the informal sector (Table 1) compared to only 32 percent of

migrants in this cohort. Migration among the young and lower informality among the migrants

are even more prevalent for manufacturing workers and women (see Table A6 in supplement).

This analysis suggests that younger workers in part formalize more quickly because they are

more likely to migrate.

                                                       Overall, the between and within cohort shifts in informality contribute importantly

toward economy-wide formalization. Panel B of Table 1 suggests that workforce shifts between

cohorts account for 69 percent of the decline in aggregate informality, while within cohort

changes account for 31 percent. The between cohort changes dominate in manufacturing,

accounting for 90 percent of the decline in informality (particularly among women, see Table A4

in supplement).1 These differences in the relative role of between and within cohort shifts

highlight the importance of analysis based on all industries to understand the trends in

informality in a low-income industrializing country.

II. Switchers, sorting and formalization

                                                      Section I highlights differences in formalization of the labor force across and within birth

cohorts in a low-income country over a decade of fast growth. Using the VHLSS panels, which

track individuals over a period of four years, we illustrate how workers actually transition to the

  In contrast to the sharp decline in manufacturing, informality within services remained relatively constant (see
Table A3 in supplement). Future research could explore possible reasons, including the role of government policies,
firm organization, and FDI, for these different trends.


	                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 4
formal sector within birth cohorts. We examine the permanence of switches to the formal sector

over a longer time period than is usually possible, and examine whether and how workers sort

between the formal and informal sectors in a low-income country.

                 We first document individual transition patterns for various age cohorts. Table 2 reports

the share of workers in each age cohort that always hold an informal job, always hold a formal

job, or switch between the two sectors using the three-survey panels covering 2002 to 2008.2

Most workers are always in either the informal or formal sector. However, workers in younger

cohorts are less likely to always be in the informal sector, more likely to always be in the formal

sector and more likely to switch sectors. In addition, among the switchers, younger cohorts are

more likely to hold a formal job at the end of the period. Younger cohorts also experience greater

increases in the share that end up holding a formal job. In contrast, switching workers in older

cohorts tend to end up working in an informal job. Younger switchers also more permanently

transition to the formal sector: they are more likely to stay in the formal sector two to four years

following the switch.

                 The differences in switching behavior of workers across age cohorts in part reflect

disparities in other worker characteristics, such as education. The literature (Maloney 2004; de

Mel, McKenzie and Woodruff 2010; La Porta and Shleifer 2014) emphasizes sorting of

individuals into the formal and informal sector by education, consistent with theory (Lucas 1978;

Rauch 1991). We also find evidence consistent with sorting based on education by relying on the

usual cross-sectional analysis: formal workers are more likely better educated, younger, male,

non-minorities, and urban than workers in the informal sector (see Table A7 in supplement). We

provide further evidence on sorting in transitions out of informality with panel-level data. If

workers sort, the characteristics of workers in the formal sector are expected to be closer to the

       This data excludes migrants, so Table 2 likely underestimates the transitions to the formal sector among the young.


	                                                                                                               5
characteristics of workers that switch from informal to formal sector than to those of workers

that remain in the informal sector. We limit the VHLSS panel sample to workers that are initially

informal and regress an indicator for whether a worker switches to the formal sector by the end

of the panel on a vector of worker characteristics.

                                                      The results are reported in Table 3 and support sorting into the formal sector as the

workers that switch tend to be more educated, younger, male, non-minorities, and urban. This

implies that relative to workers that remain in the informal sector, workers that switch out of

informality tend to have more similar observable characteristics to workers already in the formal

sector. We find further support for sorting in switching of individuals from the formal to the

informal sector (see Table A8 in supplement). Relative to workers that remain in the formal

sector, workers that switch to the informal sector tend to have more similar education, age, and

residence to workers already working in the informal sector. However, women are less likely to

switch to the informal sector, even though women are more likely to work in the informal

sector.3

                                                      These findings imply that informal workers that are most likely to move to the formal

sector in a fast-growing low-income economy possess characteristics that most closely resemble

those of workers already in the formal sector. Poorly educated, older, rural, female workers are

unlikely to make such transitions. Importantly, even among the workers most likely to switch out

of the informal sector (completed upper secondary school, young, urban, and male), actual

switching is subject to a large amount of unobserved heterogeneity: the R2 is 0.06. Thus, many of

the workers that were the “most likely switchers” did not switch to formal sector. However, the

analysis excludes migrants, who are more likely to formalize (section II). To the extent that

  This might be related to the type of jobs women and men hold in the formal sector. Women are more likely
employed in FDI manufacturing than men, and thus less likely to voluntarily leave the formal sector to the extent
that FDI jobs are considered more desirable than other formal jobs.


	                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 6
worker characteristics affect geographic mobility, the above analysis does not capture their

influence on switching to the formal sector through migration. In addition, future work should

also explore the role of labor demand factors on switching behavior.

V. Formalization and occupational upgrading

       The literature suggests that few informal firms transition to the formal sector (de Mel,

McKenzie and Woodruff 2013; La Porta and Shleifer 2014), consistent with evidence from

Vietnam (McCaig and Pavcnik 2014). Most worker transitions from the informal to the formal

sector occur by workers changing jobs. An interesting question then is whether workers engage

in different job tasks as they switch to the formal sector.

       We group workers from two three-round panels of the VHLSSs into workers that are

always in the informal sector, always in the formal sector, and switchers. For each of the groups,

we report the share of employment in each occupation category at the beginning of the period

and the change over the period in Table 4. The occupations are in ascending order of mean

monthly compensation. The composition of occupations significantly differs across these worker

groups. Elementary occupations account for 85 percent of employment among informal workers,

67 percent among switchers, and 11 percent among formal workers. Switchers and formal

workers have similar shares of employment in skilled occupations, but formal workers have

notably higher shares of employment among higher-skilled occupations such as assemblers,

machinists and professionals.

        Importantly, switchers upgrade occupations. They tend to switch out of elementary

toward skilled and professional occupations. The share of elementary occupations declines for all

workers, but this decline is largest among the switchers. Switchers increase employment in

skilled occupations (e.g. skilled handicraftsman and manual workers, skilled service workers), as




	                                                7
well as in the assemblers, machinists and professional occupations, all occupations associated

with higher pay than elementary occupations. This analysis follows the same individuals over

time, so occupation upgrading does not reflect changes in underlying workforce composition.

Similar analysis of workers that move provides further support for occupation upgrading (see

Table A9 in supplement).

       Wage-earning informal workers receive lower wages and benefits than observationally

equivalent formal workers, and households headed by an informal worker have lower per capita

income than observationally equivalent households with a formal head (McCaig and Pavcnik

2014). The analysis of occupational upgrading sheds further light on changes in working

conditions associated with formalization in a low-income country. While many workers switch

to lower-skilled manufacturing jobs in the formal sector, these jobs offer higher-skilled

occupations and higher compensation than jobs previously held by these workers in agriculture

and in informal manufacturing.

VI. Concluding Remarks

       Our study highlights how one can use census and panel-level data to document facts

about workforce transitions from the informal to the formal sector in a fast-growing,

industrializing, low-income country over a longer time horizon. At an aggregate level, the

transition to the formal sector in Vietnam appears faster than in other countries (La Porta and

Shleifer 2014). Economic growth in Vietnam was accompanied by an expansion of exports and

inflows of foreign direct investment, propelled by the U.S.-Vietnam Bilateral Trade Agreement

and Vietnam’s entry into the World Trade Organization (McCaig 2011; McCaig and Pavcnik

2013). Such increased exposure to global markets affects the transition out of informality in a

low-income country setting (La Porta and Shleifer 2014; McCaig and Pavcnik 2014). Despite




	                                               8
declines in informality, a high share of workers continues to work in the informal sector. Future

work could further examine the effects of policies, including industrial policy and preferences for

SMEs, for the transition to formality.

Census data

                                                      We use data from the 1999 and 2009 Vietnamese population censuses made available

through IPUMS-International (Minnesota Population Center 2014). These datasets are a 3 and 15

percent sample drawn from the full population in 1999 and 2009 respectively. The censuses

collected information on demographics, education, current province of residence, province of

residence five years ago, and employment. The reference period for employment is the past 12

months for the 1999 census and the previous week for the 2009 census. The employment

modules collected information on the industry of affiliation (based on an adaptation of 3-digit

ISIC), occupation (based on ISCO-88), and ownership category (self-employed, working for

other households, state-owned economic sector, collective economic sector, private economic

sector, foreign-invested sector).

                                                      Our analysis of working in the informal sector focuses on being self-employed or

working for a household business or farm as opposed to working in the registered, enterprise

sector.1 In Vietnam, state, foreign, and collective firms are legally required to register as an

enterprise, whereas domestic private firms may legally operate as either an enterprise or a

household business. Our definition of informality is thus based on the registration status rather

      1999 census estimates suggest a large share of agricultural workers in collectives. This is inconsistent with
estimates from other datasets from a similar time period (e.g., 2002 VHLSS) as well as the 2009 census. Thus, to be
consistent across data source we classify all such workers as informal.
than employment conditions within a firm.2 Firms in the enterprise sector face different

regulations such as formal accounting requirements and compulsory social insurance

contributions (see McCaig and Pavcnik 2014). The differences in regulations between the

household business and enterprise sectors closely correspond to the notion of informality used in

the literature (see La Porta and Shleifer 2014).

                                                      We focus on workers ages 20-64 at the time of the census. By age 20 most individuals in

Vietnam have finished school as only 0.4 and 2 percent of 20 year olds in 1999 and 2009

respectively were still attending school based on census estimates. Table A1 displays summary

statistics for the two censuses pooled together. All estimates are weighted. We present three

samples: all workers, informal workers, and formal workers.



Household survey data

                                                      We use four nationally representative household surveys, the 2002, 2004, 2006, and 2008

Vietnam Household Living Standards surveys (VHLSSs), which were conducted by the General

Statistics Office (GSO) of Vietnam. Our datasets include approximately 74,000 households in

2002 and 46,000 households in 2004, 2006, and 2008.3 A valuable feature of the surveys is the

inclusion of a rotating panel such that we have three two-survey panels that each feature around

21,000 to 22,000 households and two three-survey panels that each feature around 10,000

households.

                                                      The surveys collected information on demographics, education, and employment. The

employment modules focused on jobs worked during the past 12 months and collected

  Wage-earning informal workers earn lower wages and benefits than observationally equivalent workers in the
formal sector. In addition, households headed by an informal worker tend to have lower per capita income than
observationally equivalent households headed by a formal worker (McCaig and Pavcnik 2014).

(based on ISCO-88), ownership category (self-employed, working for other households, state-

owned economic sector, collective economic sector, private economic sector, foreign-invested

sector), hours worked during the past 12 months, number of years doing the job (not available in

the 2002 VHLSS), and wages and other benefits. We focus our analysis on the most time-

consuming job. As is the case with the census data, our analysis of working in the informal

sector focuses on being self-employed or working for a household business or farm as opposed

to working in the registered, enterprise sector.4

                                                      We focus on workers ages 20-64 including individuals that may be working part time.

Table A2 displays summary statistics for the four surveys pooled together. We present three

samples: all workers, informal workers, and formal workers.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Supplementary Results

Supplementary Material for Introduction

                                                      Table A3 summarizes aggregate statistics about Vietnam’s labor force in 1999 and 2009.

The table summarizes the total labor force by four broad sectors of the economy and the

contribution of each sector to total employment. In addition, the table reports the share of

informal employment and the share of employment in FDI firms. Over the decade, Vietnam

experienced a 35 percent increase in the workforce. At the same time, the percentage of the

Vietnamese workforce employed in the informal sector dropped from 86 to 79. This drop reflects

a relative contraction of employment in agriculture and an expansion of manufacturing and

services, as well as a drastic drop in the share of informal jobs from 58 to 43 percent within

                   includes self-employment in a private enterprise. The 2002 VHLSS does not separately identify
self-employment in a private enterprise from self-employment in a household business, although the latter surveys
do. Thus, to be consistent across surveys we group all self-employed individuals in the informal sector. Self-
employment in the private sector is only 0.7 percent of total self-employment in 2004 (McCaig and Pavcnik 2014).

manufacturing. In contrast, the share of informal employment within agriculture and services

remains relatively stable. The table also illustrates the large expansion of FDI in manufacturing.

While the economy-wide percentage of employment in FDI firms increases from 0.5 to 3.4, it

remains low. All sectors experience an increase in FDI presence. However, FDI presence

increases most in manufacturing, where employment accounted for by FDI firms jumps from 5

to 22 percent.

       The bottom panel of Table A3 provides these same statistics for the five provinces in

Vietnam that are the most integrated internationally as a result of port infrastructure and pre-

existing manufacturing industry structure (Ho Chi Minh City, Ha Noi, Hai Phong, Dong Nai, and

Binh Duong). The table highlights the higher employment share of manufacturing in these

provinces, lower informality rate, and higher incidence of FDI employment. For example, these

five key provinces account for almost 50 percent of Vietnam’s manufacturing jobs and 85

percent of FDI jobs in 1999.

       Table A4 provides supplementary material on the role of birth cohorts in the aggregate

decline in informality shown in Table 1 in the main text. Table A4 examines the role of birth

cohorts in the decline in aggregate share of informal employment by gender. Overall, men and

women exhibit similar informality rates, but this masks gender differences in informality within

birth cohorts. The share of informal employment is lower among younger women than among

younger men, but higher among older women than older men. Within manufacturing, women are

less likely to work in the informal sector than women, and this mainly reflects lower share of

informal employment among younger women relative to younger men.

        The analysis in Table A4 confirms the economy-wide and manufacturing trends

highlighted in the main text. However, there are some interesting differences across gender. In

particular, the differences in informality across cohorts are larger for women than for men.

However, the within cohort declines in informality are larger for men than for women. Panel B

of Table A4 reports the decomposition of the aggregate decline in informality into the between

and within cohort change and confirms the gender differences in the relative contribution of the

two channels. Within cohort changes contributed 53 percent toward the economy-wide decline in

the share of informal employment for men. In contrast, within cohort changes contribute only 7

percent toward the economy-wide decline in the share of informal employment for women, with

workforce shifts across cohorts accounting for the vast majority of the informality decline among

women. As is the case with the pooled sample, workforce shifts between cohorts play a more

important role in declines in informal employment in manufacturing, particularly among women.

This likely reflects the large young cohort of women that enters the labor force with very low

rates of informality.

       Table A5 reports the share of workers that migrate and the share of informal employment

among these workers by birth cohort. Overall, 4.6 percent of workers in 2009 migrate, but 66

percent of them reside in the five key provinces. Migration significantly increases over the

decade of growth, particularly for the youngest cohort, from 5.6 percent to 11.6 percent.

However, migration is less prevalent with age. Importantly, within each cohort, migrants are

much less likely to work informally. For example, in 2009, 72 percent of the workers in the

youngest cohort are employed in the informal sector (Table 1), as compared to only 32 percent of

migrants in this cohort (Table A5).

             Table A6 reports the migration analysis by gender. This analysis confirms the trends in

the economy-wide and manufacturing samples and does not suggest large differences in

migration rates between men and women that work. However, women migrants are less likely to

work in the informal sector than men, driven by substantially lower informality rates among

young migrant women in manufacturing.

       Supplementary material for section III

             This section briefly summarizes the evidence consistent with sorting of individuals into

the formal and informal sectors. It examines worker characteristics that are associated with a

greater probability of working in the informal sector using cross-sectional data, a common

approach in the literature. In particular, we regress the indicator for whether an individual works

in the informal sector on age cohort indicators (25-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-64 (20-24 is the

excluded category)), a female indicator, an ethnic minority indicator, education indicators

(complete primary, complete lower secondary, complete upper secondary (no completed

schooling is the excluded category)), an indicator for whether the individual lives in urban area,

and occupation, industry, province, and year fixed effects. Table A7 reports the results in column

1. We find evidence of sorting of workers into the formal and informal sector based on

education. Workers in the formal sector tend to be better educated than otherwise observationally

equivalent workers in the informal sector. They are also more likely to be younger, male, and to

reside in urban areas than workers in the informal sector. The analysis that focuses on

manufacturing (column 2) and the five key provinces (column 3) yields similar conclusions. The

one exception is the role of gender. Within manufacturing, women are less likely to work in the

informal sector relative to observationally equivalent men. In the five key provinces, women are




	                                                   5
also less likely to work in the informal sector than men, likely due to high concentration of

manufacturing in these areas.

                                                      We complement the analysis of sorting based on switchers from informal to formal sector

from the main text (Table 3) by examining sorting in switching of individuals from the formal to

the informal sector. We confine the sample to all workers in the panel that initially work in the

formal sector and use an indicator for whether a worker works in the informal sector at the end of

the panel as the dependent variable. The results reported in column 1 of Table A8 suggest that

switching to the informal sector is more predictable (R2 of 0.27) than switching to the formal

sector (see Table 3 in main text) and supports sorting by education, age, and residence. Less

educated, older, and rural workers are more likely to switch to the informal sector. Relative to

workers that remain in the formal sector, workers that switch to the informal sector tend to have

more similar education, age, and residence to workers already working in the informal sector.

However, women are less likely to switch to the informal sector, even though women are more

likely to work in the informal sector.5

Supplementary material for section IV

                                                      Table A9 provides further support for occupation upgrading by focusing on workers that

move. The sample is based on workers from the household surveys that left the household and

reported leaving for work reasons. This information is available in the 2006 and 2008 VHLSSs.

Recall from section I that migration is associated with a higher degree of formalization. The

occupational structure after the move shifted away from elementary occupations toward skilled

occupations (especially skilled handicrafts and manual occupations), assemblers, machinists,

staff, and professionals relative to the start of the sample.

  This might be related to the type of jobs women and men hold in the formal sector. Women are more likely to be
employed in FDI manufacturing than men, and thus less likely to voluntarily leave the formal sector to the extent
that FDI jobs are considered more desirable than other formal jobs.
