                                          ABSTRACT

We demonstrate that data from digital platforms such as Yelp have the potential to improve our
understanding of gentrification, both by providing data in close to real time (i.e. nowcasting and
forecasting) and by providing additional context about how the local economy is changing.
Combining Yelp and Census data, we find that gentrification, as measured by changes in the
educational, age, and racial composition within a ZIP code, is strongly associated with increases
in the numbers of grocery stores, cafes, restaurants, and bars, with little evidence of crowd-out of
other categories of businesses. We also find that changes in the local business landscape is a
leading indicator of housing price changes, and that the entry of Starbucks (and coffee shops
more generally) into a neighborhood predicts gentrification. Each additional Starbucks that enters
a zip code is associated with a 0.5% increase in housing prices.

   I.      Introduction
“Gentrification: New Yorkers can sense it immediately. It plumes out of Darling Coffee, on Broadway
and 207th Street, and mingles with the live jazz coming from the Garden Café next door” – New York
Magazine (2014)

        Gentrification has emerged as an important policy issue in cities from New York to Edinburgh
to Seoul. Urban leaders often applaud the in-migration of the prosperous and associated increases in
property values, and gentrification enthusiasts point not only to housing markets, but also to the potential
for a more vibrant commercial sector supporting local businesses and services. Yet, others fear that
gentrification will both price out poorer renters and destroy the historic character of the neighborhood.
        In practice, any policy response to gentrification requires both a reasonably up-to-date
understanding of where gentrification is occurring, and a sense of how neighborhoods actually change
with gentrification. Where are housing prices spiking? Which neighborhoods are experiencing changing
demographics and an altering local economy? What do these changes look like?
        Standard public data sources cannot fully answer these questions, both because they often come
with multiple year lags and because there is limited public data about the types of businesses operating
within an area. For example, the American Community Survey provides data at the local level, but small
sample sizes mean that these are based on five years of data. For example, the current estimates cover
2012 to 2016 and are really most representative of 2014, almost four years ago. The Federal Housing
Finance Agency has begun to provide repeat sales indices at the tract level, and these are available up to
2016. Yet, the indices are still in development, and prices may not be particularly representative for
urban neighborhoods that are dominated by rental units. Moreover, data from government statistical
agencies contain only coarse categorizations of business type.
        In this paper, we explore the potential for Yelp data to provide city leaders and economists with
real-time information on neighborhood change. To do so, we examine whether changes in the type of
Yelp establishments in a neighborhood are associated with contemporaneous changes in five different
measures of neighborhood change. The use of Yelp data as a complement to standard data sources has
two advantages in this context. First, since data about the local economy is available virtually in real
time on Yelp, it can help to detect which parts of their city are experiencing gentrification without waiting
for public statistics to become available. Second, it provides a more granular understanding of how
neighborhoods change during periods of gentrification.
        As an illustrative example, suppose that Starbucks were to move into a struggling neighborhood.
As the New York Magazine quote suggests, this may be an indicator of gentrification within a
neighborhood. Combining Census data with Yelp data for the United States, we test this hypothesis and
find that the entry of new Starbucks stores into a ZIP code is in fact a predictor of housing price growth.
The entry of each additional Starbucks into an area is associated with a 0.5% increase in local housing
prices. We find similar results when looking at coffee shops as a whole. We then expand this analysis to
explore the broader changes to the local economy that accompany gentrification. We find that housing
price growth is associated with entry of grocery stores, restaurants, barbers, and convenience stores – as
well as increased activity at these businesses, as measured by Yelp data.
        We then turn to three demographic measures of neighborhood change based on American
Community Survey data (ACS) at the Census ZCTA level. We focus on New York City, and then
compare results in New York with results for four other large cities. Our three measures of gentrification
are the percent of population with a college degree, the percent aged between 25 and 34, and percent
white – drawn from Census data. Because of the nature of the ACS, we are forced to consider only a
long difference between the 2007-2011 period and the 2012-2016 period. To get comparable Yelp data,
we also average over those two five-year periods. This work follows Waldfogel (2008) who examines
the relationship between neighborhood composition and the location of different types of consumer
goods.
        Within New York City, we find that neighborhoods with rapid expansion of local businesses
(ranging from grocery stores to bars to hair salons) also attract an influx of more educated residents.
Growth in local businesses is also associated with an influx of younger residents in New York. There is
a weaker relationship between changes in business activity and the racial composition of a neighborhood.
We then repeat these analyses for four additional cities: Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles and San
Francisco. Some of the patterns are consistent, such as the link between growth in education and growth
in cafes and bars. Others vary across cities. For example, the expansion of laundromats as only a strong
indicator of gentrification in New York City.
        Our final outcome variable is the change in the value of Streetscore at the block level. Streetscore
is a computer-generated measure of the way humans perceive the safety of an image of a streetscape.
Naik et al. (2017) use changes in Streetscore as a measure of the change in the physical quality of the
neighborhood, and find that it is particularly associated with education and density levels. We look at
the relationship between Streetscore change and change in the number of establishments across a wide
range of industries. We find that Streetscore change is most positively associated with increases in the
number of vegetarian restaurants, Starbucks and cafes, and wine bars and bars more generally.
        While these patterns provide further insight into the patterns of gentrification, the direction of
causality is a priori unclear. In the final section of the paper, we explore the timing of changes using the
notion of Granger causality. Do business openings typically precede increases in neighborhood
education, or do they follow demographic shifts? With housing price changes, we find that openings of
Starbucks precede price growth, but that price growth does not predict growth in Starbucks openings.
Our preferred interpretation is that exogenous neighborhood changes spur store openings, which then
encourage prices to rise.
        We also look at whether demographic change precedes or follows our five strongest yelp
variables: laundromats, groceries, cafes, bars and restaurants. We find that higher initial numbers of
these establishments predict growth in the share of the population that is college educated, but that higher
initial levels of college education do not predict growth in these variables. Once again, Yelp
establishment growth seems to be a leading indicator, and perhaps even helps the process of
neighborhood change.
        Overall, our results suggest that changes in economic activity, as measured by Yelp, can provide
leading indicators of gentrification within a neighborhood. Yelp data provides relatively up-to-date
information that is useful for understanding where gentrification is occurring, before official statistics
become available. Yelp data also provides additional insight about how gentrifying neighborhoods
change. More generally, this type of data speaks to an additional benefit of digitization and the Internet
age. While the intended purpose of Yelp data is to help customers identify local businesses, the same
data is a valuable resources for policymakers and researchers looking to better understand economic
activity.


   II.       Data Description


   We begin by discussing our outcome variables. We then turn to the Yelp data, which we will use to
predict changes in those variables.

Measures of Neighborhood Change
        Our most straightforward measure of neighborhood change is the ZIP-code level housing price
data provided by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). This data is an annual repeat sales index
for over 18,0000 five digit ZIP-codes in the U.S., described in Bogin, Doerner and Larson (2016). We
use data from 2012 to 2016, and the average real growth of this index over this period is 3.1 percent (see
Table 1).
        Price indices are a tricky measure of neighborhood change, because economic theory predicts
that they should be forward-looking. A neighborhood that is expected to gentrify should experience price
increases before any changes in the neighborhood demographics occur, or before rents start to increase.
Consequently, price indices may move before gentrification, or possibly if there is price stickiness, after
gentrification. Moreover, price indices are likely to represent a better reflection of demand for a
neighborhood when supply is relatively fixed, which can occur either because prices remain below
construction costs or because strict land use controls limit the production of new housing.
        While ZIP-code level pricing data are available annually for a large number of ZIP-codes, our
demographic data for ZIP codes is available only for five-year windows. This data comes from the
American Community Survey, which replaced the Census long form after 2000. Since ZCTA, tracts and
block groups are only surveyed sporadically, the Census aggregates years for these smaller geographic
units. Moreover, there is surely error generated by the fact that some areas may be surveyed earlier in
the five-year window while other areas are surveyed later in the window, but it is difficult to actually
quantify this problem.
        We use three different measures of demographic neighborhood change: percent college educated,
percent aged between 25 and 34, and share of the population that is white. We see percent college
educated as the most natural measure of gentrification, because education is so reliably correlated with
both income and housing costs. In our sample, the average ZIP code saw the share of adults with college
degrees increase by 2.6 percent in New York and 3.4 percent for our other four cities (Boston, Los
Angeles, Chicago, and San Francisco).
        Gentrification is also often associated with changes in the age distribution, with younger
professionals replacing older longer-term residents. Consequently, we also use the share of the
population that is between 25 and 34 as an outcome. The change in this variable is significantly correlated
with the change in the share of college graduates in New York City; the correlation coefficient between
the two variables is .4. The average ZIP code in our sample in New York saw the share of the population
aged 25 to 34 grow by 0.3 percent. In the other cities, the average share of the population aged 25 to 34
rose by 1 percent.
        Our final demographic variable is the share of the ZIP code’s population that is white. Naturally,
there can be gentrification without racial change, but many of the most explosive instances of
gentrification occur when richer white tenants displace poorer African-Americans. The change in this
variable is also correlated with both percent of adults with a college education (correlation coefficient of
.32 in New York). In New York, the percent white decreased by 1.1 percent in our sample.
        Our final measure of neighborhood change is Streetscore, borrowed from Naik et al. (2015) and
Naik et al. (2017). This measure has its results in a crowd-source data set generated by Cesar Hidalgo,
in which respondents were asked to rate which image from Google Streetview appears safer. The ratings
generated by this crowd-sourcing were then used as training data for computer vision techniques, which
generated a Streetscore for a much wider range of neighborhoods. Changes in the measure do correlate
well with physical upgrading found in the records of the Boston Planning and Development Agency.
        We interpret this measure as a proxy for the overall physical quality of the neighborhood, not of
its safety per se. In fact, many areas with low Streetscores also experience low crime, presumably
because people do not wander around such unappealing areas. Naik et al. (2017) have shown that changes
in these measures correlate with density and education, and with neighboring Streetscore, density and
education. Consequently, there appears to be a spread in the perceived physical quality of the
neighborhood that resembles the usual process of spreading gentrification.
        Streetscore data is generated from Google Streetview images, and consequently, we have this
data for a limited number of years. We have a large number of images from around 2007, when Google
Streetview was first put on line, and from the period after 2014. In this case, we will be using this long
difference in Streetscore as our measure of gentrification. The mean increase in Streetscore in our New
York sample is 1.6.

Yelp Data

        For measures of changes in the types of establishments, we use data from Yelp, an online
platform that publishes crowdsourced reviews about local businesses. Business listings on Yelp are
sourced through Yelp’s internal team, user submissions, business owner reports, and partner
acquisitions, and checked by an internal data quality team. The data begin in 2004 when Yelp was
founded, which enables U.S. business listings to be aggregated at the ZIP code, city, county, state, and
country level for any given time period post-2004.
        Despite its granularity and availability, Yelp data comes with limitations. Yelp’s establishment
classification is assigned through user and business owner reports and Yelp’s internal quality check. As
a result, businesses are not always categorized systematically, or equivalently to government data sets.
Furthermore, the extent of Yelp coverage also depends on the degree of Yelp adoption, which has grown
over time as the company has become more popular. Lastly, businesses with no reviews may receive
less attention from users – and therefore may be less likely to be flagged as open or marked as closed
even after they close. We discuss these issues in further detail in Glaeser, Kim and Luca (2017).
        To account for these limitations, we only count businesses as open if they have received at least
one recommended Yelp review. We also limit our sample to years post-2007 to match the ACS (and to
post-2012 when possible), and to ZIP codes with at least one business recorded in this period in at least
one of the categories we examine. The average ZIP code in New York City had 80 restaurants and 814
restaurant reviews on Yelp between 2007-2011, and experienced a mean increase of 36 restaurants and
1525 restaurant reviews between 2007-2011 and 2012-2016. Additional summary statistics for the
number of establishments and reviews by categories are reported in Table 1.


   III.     Nowcasting Local Price Growth
    In this section, we focus on the ability of Yelp data to predict contemporaneous changes in housing
price growth at the ZIP-code level, as measured by the FHFA repeat sales index. This is an exercise in
nowcasting, not prediction of the future. We will return to the whether Yelp data can predict future price
growth in Section VI. Our exercise here is meant to ask whether Yelp data can be a useful indicated of
price growth for policy-makers who have not yet received that data from FHFA about price increases.
We look at the period from 2012 to 2016.

The Starbucks Effect

         We begin by following Rascoff and Humphries (2015) who used Zillow price data and identified
a “Starbucks effect,” linking proximity to Starbucks stores and price growth. In our variant of their
exercise, we examine whether price growth is correlated with contemporaneous growth in the number
of Starbucks cafes, which allows us to understand whether Starbucks is a leading indicator of
gentrification. We restrict the sample to include ZIP-codes that had at least one Starbucks during the
initial year.
         Our second specification in Table 2 regresses the percent growth in the home price index on the
absolute increase in the number of Starbucks in the ZIP-code during that same year. We include year
dummies to control for macroeconomic changes that impact housing price growth. We also cluster our
standard errors by ZIP-code. We find that a one unit increase in the number of Starbucks during a given
year is associated with a 0.5 percent change increase in housing prices.
        This is a large effect, both economically and statistically, but the added explanatory power
created by the Starbucks control is modest. The t-statistic is about six. The r-squared added by controlling
for Starbucks, over and above the year dummies, is only .002. As found by Rascoff and Humphries
(2015), the presence of Starbucks is associated with price growth, but Starbucks presence is hardly a
great predictor of which areas will grow.
        Naturally, we do not suggest, and do not think, that this is a causal estimate. There are two more
plausible interpretations of this correlation. First, it is quite possible that Starbucks targets its cafes in
places that are on the upswing, so the correlation reflects the endogeneity of Starbucks locations. Second,
Starbucks may be correlated with other changes in the neighborhood, such as gentrification, and
collectively these changes drive prices upwards.
        To partially distinguish between these hypotheses, the third regression includes a ZIP-code fixed
effect. Our time period is short, and if Starbucks is targeting growing areas, then a ZIP-code level fixed
effect should eliminate much of the correlation. Including these fixed effects causes the estimated
coefficient to fall to 0.17 and the r-squared to rise to 0.37 percent. A significant portion of the relationship
between Starbucks and growth reflects the tendency of Starbucks to locate in communities that have a
longer term positive trend.
        We believe that our time period is too short to simultaneously estimate ZIP-code level fixed
effects and anything using about the timing of the relationship between Starbucks and price growth.
Hence we drop the ZIP code fixed effects for the remainder of the table.
        In the fourth regression, we include both the current and lagged Starbucks growth. Both terms
end up being about equally significant and have roughly equal magnitudes. In the fifth regression, we
include two lags of Starbucks growth. All three terms are significant, but the second lag has a smaller
coefficient.
        The sixth regression includes two other Yelp variables: the increase in the number of Starbucks
that are closed and the growth in the number of Starbucks reviews. Notably, the reviews are specific to
the café, not the home location of the reviewer. An increase in the number of closed Starbucks does not
predict price increases or declines. The growth in the number of Starbucks reviews provides our most
powerful Yelp variable.
        A 10-unit increase in the number of reviews is associated with a 1.4 percent increase in housing
prices in the ZIP-code. Including this variable leads all the other Starbucks variables to become far less
significant, and it increases the r-squared of the regression from .24 to .26. We take this variable as a
proxy for the amount of business at the Starbucks, and it suggests that prices go up when a community
has more members that use Starbucks.
        Notably, this finding pushes against any interpretation that suggests that people are paying for
proximity to Starbucks. The presence of a Starbucks is far less important than whether the community
has people who consume Starbucks. Consequently, we think that this variable is likely to be a proxy for
gentrification itself, reflecting an increase in the number of people who like to consume expensive coffee
and then write about their experience online.

The Cafés Effect?

        While Starbucks may be a particularly prominent upscale coffee house, there is little reason to
think that it is the only possible retail establishment that can capture gentrification at the local level. In
Table 3, we expand our analysis to include all of the cafes listed in Yelp over the same time period. This
change enables us to considerably increase the number of ZIP-codes in our analysis. The number of ZIP-
codes with a café in our sample is about twice as large as the number of Starbucks in our sample.
        Table 3 reproduces Table 2 with growth in the number of cafes substituting for growth in the
number of Starbucks. Our second regression shows that the coefficient on cafes is similar to our
coefficient on Starbucks: .54. A ten unit increase in the number of cafes in a ZIP-code is associated with
an approximately five percent increase in prices. The t-statistic for this coefficient is 16. The overall r-
squared for this regression is lower than for regression 2 in Table 2, but this reflects the lower explanatory
power of year effects in this larger sample. The r-squared that is added by the cafes variable is .008,
which is four times larger than the r-squared added by the Starbucks variable, but still a modest
contribution.
        Just as in the case of Starbucks growth, this growth might reflect the strategic location of cafes
in areas with rising incomes and housing prices. Regression 3 includes ZIP-code specific place effects.
The r-squared rises to .21, and the coefficient on cafes falls to .02 and loses statistical significance. Once
again, there is evidence for strategic location, but regressions with fixed effects can be problematic when
the time series is this short.
        In the fourth regression, we include a lag of café growth as well. Once again, both variables are
quite significant, and the r-squared rises from .157 to .163, which is a modest increase but a larger one
than that associated with adding lagged Starbucks growth. In regression 4, we include two lags and now
all three variables are significant. The r-squared increases to .167.
        In the final regression of this table, we include café closings and growth in the number of café
reviews. The pattern is similar to that seen in Table 2, regression 6. The number of closings is negatively
correlated with price. The growth in the number of café reviews is strongly associated with price growth,
and it reduces the coefficient on contemporaneous and lagged café growth.
        However, the magnitude of the power of general café reviews is somewhat weaker than Starbucks
reviews. One interpretation is that growth in Starbucks reviews disproportionately measure growth in
upscale patrons, and so is a better proxy for gentrification of the neighborhood.

The Correlation of Home Prices with Other Yelp Establishments

        In this section, we expand our analysis to other Yelp industries. Table 4 provides the results
when growth in housing prices is regressed on contemporaneous percent growth in establishments from
a series of different retail clusters. All regressions are univariate with year fixed effects and standard
errors are clustered by ZIP-code.
        The first column shows the estimated coefficient and its standard error. The second column
shows the r-squared from the regression. The third column shows the r-squared when home prices are
regressed on the year dummies alone for the relevant sample. The fourth column shows the number of
observations, which change across samples because in some cases, ZIP-codes have none of the relevant
establishments at the beginning of the time period.
        The results show that across almost all categories, more establishments are associated with more
growth. The only real exception is the number of Chinese restaurants. The correlation with the number
of high price restaurants is also statistically insignificant, and the correlation with the number of
restaurants opened (which is essentially the change in the rate of change) is small.
        While many of these effects are quite large in both statistical and economic terms, their predictive
power is limited. The variables which add the most to r-squared, over the year fixed effects, are barbers
(.013 added r-squared), cafes (.008 added r-squared), restaurants (.007) and wine bars (.007 added r-
squared). The largest point estimate is for laundromats.
        In Table 5, we look at the growth in the number of Yelp reviews instead of the number of Yelp
establishments. In this case, all of the coefficients are significant and positive. The r-squared increases
are generally larger. Including the number of restaurant reviews increases the r-squared from .128 to
.159, which is a material increase in goodness of fit. Other measures of the number of reviews, including
barber reviews and café reviews, added to the r-squared in a meaningful manner.
        In this section, we have confirmed that home price index growth is correlated with growth in a
variety of different types of Yelp establishments. In many cases, as in Starbucks, the number of Yelp
reviews provided more predictive power than the number of Yelp establishments. This was not true when
we tried to predict the number of establishments in County Business Patterns (Glaeser, Kim and Luca,
2017), suggesting that Yelp reviews may be a more important correlate of gentrification if a less
important correlate of economic development.


   IV.     Nowcasting Demographic Change

       We now turn to predicting demographic change with Yelp data. In this case, our outcomes are
the change in demographic variables at the Census tract level. Our first period extends from 2007 to
2011. Our second period runs from 2012 to 2016. We look at the ability of Yelp data to predict changes
between those two periods.

Results for New York City

         In this case, we first focus on New York City, a place with significant gentrification. We then
turn to correlations outside of New York City. We limit ourselves to the ZIP codes that had at least one
example of an establishment type during the entire period. This restriction means that we lose a
significant number of ZIP-codes for many establishment types. We list only those establishment types
for which we have more than 100 ZIP-codes, except for Starbucks, which is included despite being
represented in slightly less than 100 ZIP-codes.
         Each row in Table 6 shows the pairwise correlation between the growth in the number of
establishment of each type and the change in the demographic variable. We use the absolute change in
the number of establishments, which eliminates the need to worry about cases where there are zero
establishments in the pre-period. Beneath each correlation coefficient, we report the p-value, the
estimated probability that the correlation is actually zero. We also show the number of observations,
which are the same across columns but differ across rows, because the Yelp data is different for each
ZIP code and category.
         We order the results by the strength of the correlation with change in the share of the adult
population in the ZIP-code that is college-education. Our first row shows the results for the change in
the number of groceries, which has a correlation coefficient of .35 with the change in the share of adults
with college degrees. This relationship is strongly significant.
         The correlation of the change in the number of groceries with the shares of the population that
are between 25 and 34 and the share of the population that is white are also significant at the five percent
level, but they are smaller. These correlation coefficients are approximately .18, or about one-half the
size of the correlation with change in percent college educated. These results seem compatible with the
literature on “food deserts” that documents how poorer people live in areas with fewer options for healthy
food.
         The second row shows the .338 correlation between growth in laundromats and the growth in the
share of the population with college degrees. We found this result somewhat surprising, as we do not
typically think of laundromats as a natural indicator of gentrification. Yet, many older neighborhoods,
especially in Brooklyn, lack indoor laundry machines. As the population in such areas becomes
wealthier, perhaps they are willing to pay more for laundry facilities that are nearby.
         The number of laundromats also correlates with the share of the population that is young, which
is perhaps less surprising. The correlation coefficients between these two variables is .2, which is
significant at the ten but not the five percent level. Laundromat growth is not significantly correlated
with the change in the share of the population that is white.
        The third row shows the .319 correlation between change in the share of the population with
college degrees and the number of cafes. These results support the findings of the previous section that
cafes are a strong indicator of gentrification. Again, the results are quite strong statistically for the share
with college degrees.
        The relationship between change in the number of cafes and our two other demographic variables
are much smaller and statistically indistinct from zero. Apparently, the growth in the number of cafes
are not strongly correlated with either growth in the younger population or growth in the white
population. We found those results somewhat surprising, but perhaps café growth is also related to
business location, while grocery growth is more strongly related to residential change.
        The fourth row shows the growth in the number of bars, which has a .313 correlation coefficient
with growth in the share of adults with college degrees. This correlation is almost exactly as strong as
the correlation with cafes. In this case, the correlation with growth in the share of the population that is
young is insignificant. We were somewhat surprising that the correlation between bars and youth was
not stronger. The correlation with percent white was weaker still and insignificant.
        The fifth row shows the .27 correlation between change in the share of the population with
college degrees and the change in the number of restaurants. Better educated, better paid restaurants eat
out more often and are willing to pay more for good food. Restaurant growth also correlates significantly
with the share of the population that is young at the ten percent level. The correlation between racial
change and this variable is insignificant.
        The sixth row looks at the change in the number of barbers, which has a .237 correlation
coefficient with change in the share of the population that is well educated. This variable again correlates
significantly with the change in the share of the population that is young, but not the share of the
population that is white.
        The seventh row shows the .232 correlation between change in the number of wine bars and
change in the share of the population that is college educated. The correlation between this variable and
share that is young or share that is white are both .14 and insignificant.
        The tables also show significant correlations between change in the share of the population that
is college education and change in the number of convenience stores, change in the number of fast food
restaurants, change in the number of florists, and change in the number of restaurants that are categorized
by Yelp as being pricey. Florists also correlate with the number of people who are young, but otherwise
these variables are unrelated to changes in the share of the young or share of the population that is white.
The other variables are insignificantly correlated with change in the share of the population that is well-
educated, young or white, except for the change in the number of restaurant openings, which is correlated
with the change in the share of the white population. Of our sample, we found eleven variables that had
significant correlations with educational improvements. The correlations with the other variables were
almost uniformly weaker.
        Table 7 repeats Table 6 but using the percentage increase in the number of Yelp reviews, rather
than the change in the number of Yelp establishments as our dependent variable. The results show a
similar pattern. For example, laundromats again correlate particularly highly with gentrification, but the
correlations decline. This change reverses our finding with price increases, which were generally more
correlated with the number of reviews than with the number of establishments. This change may reflect
a difference between demographics and prices, or a difference between New York City and the rest of
the country. We will return to this issue in the next subsection when we look at results outside of New
York.
        Table 8 looks at the total explanatory power using four of our strongest univariate
predictors. Collectively, change in restaurants, cafes, bars and groceries can explain 16.2 percent of the
variation in the education change variable across 170 New York ZIP-codes. Perhaps surprisingly,
groceries have the strongest positive coefficient. The coefficient on restaurants actually flips sign,
suggesting that the well-educated may be more interested in convenient places to shop than places to eat.
In the second regression, we include initial controls for the three demographic measures. The r-squared
rises to 31.1 percent. The coefficients remain relatively stable but generally decrease slightly, with the
exception of the number of cafes, which rises by .05.

Replications for the Other Large Cities

        As a form of replication, and to test whether these results are particular to New York City, we
now reproduce Table 6 and 7 using data from four other large cities: Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles and
San Francisco. Again, we look at ZIP-code correlations between changes in the demographic variables.
Table 9 looks at the correlations with Yelp establishment numbers. Table 10 examines correlations with
the number of Yelp reviews.
        Many of the patterns are broadly similar. The number of restaurants, cafes and bars are among
the strongest correlates of gentrification across these four cities, although the correlation coefficients are
somewhat smaller than in New York City. The number of laundromats is no longer a strong correlation
of gentrification, suggesting that surprising finding was really describing an unusual New York City
phenomenon. In these other cities, the number of florists was particularly strongly correlated with change
in the share of the population with college degrees.
        Just as in the case of New York, the correlations between the number of establishments and
education are stronger than with either age or race. Also like New York, the correlation between reviews
and education was weaker than the correlation between number of establishments and education, but
with one significant difference. Several of the review counts correlated reasonably well with the number
of younger people in the ZIP-code.
        Consequently, one puzzle is why an increase the number of Yelp reviews in a ZIP-code correlates
with an increase in the number of young people in these cities, but not in New York. One explanation
might be that reviews for New York restaurants often come from people outside the ZIP-code. A second
explanation is Yelp reviewers are more disproportionately young outside of New York City.


   V.      Nowcasting Physical Change

         Our final outcome is the physical change in the neighborhood as measured by Streetscore. As
before, we begin with our results on New York City and then turn to results for other large urban areas.
As discussed in the data section, Streetscore represents a computer-generated measure of how safe the
street looks to humans based on Google Streetview images in 2007 and 2014.

Predicting Streetscore Changes in New York City

       To keep results comparable, we continue to look at ZIP-code level data, although there is no
reason why we could not look at the block itself. Indeed, given that we have the precise location for
every Yelp business and every Google Streetview image, it would be quite straightforward to estimate
complex spatial models linking business location with change in the built environment. Again, we are
not suggesting anything causal with these relationships, and we have ordered the table so that the
strongest relationships are at the top. We have also excluded those restaurant classes for which we have
fewer than 100 ZIP-codes, with the exception of Starbucks.
       In Table 11, the strongest correlation is with the number of vegetarian restaurants, which had a
much weaker correlation with the change in the share of the population that was well educated. The
change in Streetscore has a .37 correlation with the change in the number of vegetarian restaurants. The
second strongest correlation is with the change in the number of Starbucks restaurants, which is .355.
         The stronger correlations of these variables with Streetscore than with neighborhood
demographics might reflect a substantial difference between these two types of variables. Streetscore
can change as readily for commercial areas as for residential areas, and indeed, business owners might
be more likely to invest in obvious physical upgrades than residents. The many New Yorkers who live
in historic districts are specifically prevented from doing much to change their physical appearance.
Consequently, it may be that variables that are linked with commercial success correlate more strongly
with Streetscore.
         The third strongest correlation, a coefficient of .339, is with wine bars. This mirrors the results
with demographic change. The significant correlations of Streetscore change with changes in cafes,
florists, barbers, and restaurants overall, also all parallel the results of Table 6. There are also positive
correlations with the number of fast food restaurants and convenience stores. Yelp changes the predict
changes in the share of the population with a college degree also predict changes in the physical
environment.
         One notable difference is that growth in the number of laundromats does not predict upgrading
in Streetscore, even though it is correlated with increases in the share of the population with a college
degree. This difference may perhaps reflect the tendency of laundromats to locate in older residential
areas that cannot be upgraded for regulatory reasons, which would suggest that laundromats appear
specifically in areas that are getting richer but that cannot change their physical footprint.


   VI.     What Comes First?


        We have documented correlations between gentrification and contemporaneous changes in Yelp
openings and reviews. A second question is whether Yelp data predicts or “Granger causes” future
gentrification. Does a recent opening of groceries or cafes predict subsequent gentrification? Granger
causality does not imply true causality, as Yelp openings could precede gentrification solely because
entrepreneurs expect gentrification that is to come. Still, understanding the timing of Yelp openings and
gentrification has value from a purely predictive perspective, and might also enable us to reject some
explanations for the observed correlations.
        We begin with housing prices, which enable us to look at a relatively rich annual time series.
With the demographic data and Streetscore, we can only look at whether early Yelp openings predict
change in gentrification measures and whether early measures of gentrification predict changes in the
Yelp variables.

The Timing of Housing Prices and Yelp Openings

        While our time series is limited, we can still run regressions of annual percent changes in the
ZIP-code level housing price indices on lagged changes in the growth of Starbucks or Cafes more
generally. We begin this with Table 12, in which changes in housing price indices are first regressed on
two lags in Starbucks growth. We do not include contemporaneous Starbucks growth.
        The first regressions shows the both lags are economically and statistically significant. A ten-
unit growth in Starbucks in the past year is associated with a 4.8 percent increase in housing prices. A
ten-unit growth in Starbucks two years ago is associated with a 2.6 percent increase in housing prices
during this year.
        While these correlations are robust, they could just reflect the well-known correlation of housing
prices changes with the one-year lag of housing prices changes (Case and Shiller, 1989, Glaeser and
Nathanson, 2017). To check whether the serial correlation of housing prices appears at the ZIP-code as
well as the metropolitan area level, the second regression simply regresses price changes on two years
lags of those price changes. Both coefficients are positive, although somewhat smaller than those
typically reported at the metropolitan area level. The coefficient on the one year lagged value of price
change is .324 and the coefficient on the two-year lag is .076.
        Granger causality typically requires that lagged variables of one variable predict the change in a
second variable, controlling for lagged values of the second variable. Consequently, in the third
regression, we control for two lags of both Starbucks growth and past housing price growth. The
coefficient on the one-year lag of Starbucks growth falls from .48 to .29, but it remains statistically
significant. Starbucks growth does seem to predict future housing price growth, even controlling for the
recent past of housing price growth.
        In Table 13, we ask whether housing price growth predicts growth in Starbucks. The first
regression shows that there is a small and statistically marginal effect of price growth in the previous
period on Starbucks growth. A ten percent increase in price growth is associated with a .2 increase in
Starbucks. The second regression shows that past Starbucks growth is not associated with current
Starbucks growth during this period. The third regression shows that there is still a small and statistically
modest impact of past price growth on future Starbucks growth.
        Our overall finding here is that past Starbucks growth predicts future price growth much more
strongly than past price growth predicts future Starbucks growth. Our preferred interpretation of this
finding is that Starbucks locations are chosen by individuals with very good judgment about where prices
are going to increase. A second possibility is that Starbucks enters early in the stage of gentrification
because it caters to a crowd that is willing to move early into up-and-coming neighbors. We find the
interpretation that Starbucks is actually causing price increases to be distinctly less plausible.

Which came first? Demographic Change or Yelp Establishments

        We do not have rich enough data for our demographic variables to properly study the timing of
change. Our closest approximation is to look at whether Yelp establishments during 2007-2011 predict
demographic changes over the next five years, or whether demographics during 2007-2011 predict
growth in Yelp establishments or both.
        We will focus on five core types of Yelp establishments, and on the percent with a college
education. We first look only at univariate relationships, and then also control for the initial value of the
independent variable. Instead of just looking at New York, here we look at the entire country.
        The odd-numbered regressions of Table 14 show the relationship between change in the percent
college educated at the ZIP-code level and the average number of establishments between 2007 and 2011
in five Yelp categories: laundromats, restaurants, cafes, bars and groceries. The even numbered
regressions include a control for the initial share of the population with a college degree. In most
specifications, there is a negative correlation between the initial share of the population with a college
degree and growth in the share of the population with a college degree, and controlling for this initial
value strengthens the relationship between the Yelp variable and growth in the number of college
educated.
        The first two regressions examine the laundromat variable, and show that laundromats between
2007 and 2011 predict growth in the share of college educated over the next five years. Similarly,
groceries, bars, cafes and restaurants all predict subsequent increases in the share of the population with
a college degree. Over the past decade, neighborhoods that began with more entertainment
establishments saw their levels of education increase more swiftly. As suggested by Glaeser, Kolko and
Saiz (2001), rising skill levels are associated by increased demand for urban entertainment amenities.
        In Table 15, we reverse the order and regress change in the number of Yelp establishments on
the initial value of education. The odd-numbered regressions do not control for the initial number of
Yelp establishments. The even-numbered regressions include that control.
        In this case, initial share of the population with a college degree is an extremely strong predictor
of growth in the number of cafes, bars and restaurants. There is little correlation between initial education
and growth in the number of laundromats. The correlation with groceries is strong, but less strong than
for growth in cafes, bars and restaurants.
        In this case, we find striking differences between the odd regressions and the even regressions.
If we don’t control for initial number of establishments, then education strongly predicts growth in the
number of cafes, restaurants, bars and groceries. Once we do control for the initial share, we find that
the relationship with education either reverses or becomes small and marginally significant.
        The overriding fact in the Yelp data is that the places with more establishments initially added
more establishments over the next five years. This may reflect something real about the growth of
consumer-oriented establishments in places that had natural strengths, or it may represent something
more artificial about the roll-out of Yelp. It may be that Yelp coverage increased gradually and places
that had more restaurants overall had more restaurants and in 2011, but also saw more of those restaurants
added to Yelp by 2016.
        Yelp establishments are solid predictors of growth in education. Education is not a strong
predictor of growth in Yelp establishments, when we control for the initial level of establishments. We
would not want to attribute too much meaning for these facts, but they are at least compatible with a
view that consumption establishments are attracting the more skilled—not just that they follow the
location of the more skilled.


   VII.    Conclusion

        In this paper, we illustrate how the local business landscape, as measured by Yelp data, correlates
with measures of neighborhood gentrification. Housing price increases at the ZIP-code level are
correlated with increases in the number of Yelp establishments, and more strongly related to changes in
the number of Yelp reviews. Demographic change is also correlated with the changes in the number of
Yelp establishments, both in New York City and in other large cities. For predicting demographics, the
number of establishments is a better predictor than the number of reviews.
        Changes in the number of Yelp establishments and reviews appear to be reliably correlated to
process of gentrification, measured either with housing prices or with increases in the share of the
population that is well educated. The predictive fit is far from perfect, but Yelp can provide signs that a
neighborhood is changing. Consequently, given the slow appearance of reliable neighborhood level
Census data, Yelp may be helpful for measuring up-to-date development in a neighborhood.
        We have little to say about causation. The most natural hypothesis to us is that restaurants respond
to exogenous changes in neighborhood composition, not that restaurant availability is driving
neighborhood change. Yet, it seems true that Yelp establishments from 2007-2011 predict changes in
education levels over the next five years, but education from 2007 to 2011 does not predict increases in
the number of Yelp establishments, once we control for the initial level of Yelp establishments.
Consequently, it is still also possible that Yelp is measuring neighborhood amenities that also help drive
neighborhood change.
