             IMPACT OF GOVERNMENT ON GROWTH AND TRADE


                                 ABSTRACT

     In this paper    we   attempt to test the development economist's
perceptions of the    negative contributions of governmental

activities, as well as the positive contributions of other

activities, to growth. This paper provides evidence on the
importance of government behavior for economic growth and, in so

doing, attempts to start building a bridge between the

development economics literature and the new growth theory. The
focal point is the recognition that governments do more than

spend and tax in manners that maximize social welfare functions:

they influence incentives and regulate in ways that affect

private behavior, and their spending, even on infrastructure, is

not always optimal.

                    impact of Government on Growth and Trade

                         Anne 0. Krueger and David Orsmond*



     In the 1950s and 1960s, efforts to develop a theory of economic growth

proceeded along two main, and largely independent, lines. On one hand, there was

a line of research concerned with a theory of economic growth pertatntng chiefly

to those characteristics believed to be particular to developing countries. On

the other hand, neoclassical growth theory was developed, stimulated by the

seminal work of Solow.

    Initially, the focus of those concerned with the economic growth of the

developing countries was primarily upon ways of achieving more rapid capital

accumulation in the context of a dual—economy, labor—surplus, model in which a

variety of "structural rigidities" and market imperfections were thought to have

been responsible for the economic backwardness ci developing countries. Attention

therefore centered on reasons for backwardness, and the role of government tn

overcoming market failures.

     Neoclassical growth theory, iy contrast, was developed on the assumptions

that markets function well and that the production function (with at least labor

and capital as inputs) had constant returns to scale. Growth in the long run

could therefore originate only through technical progress.

      Over time, the attention of those seeking a theory of development shifted

from a primary concern with capital accumulation in dual economy models toTh

broader effort to understand the interaction of factor accumulation and govern—

ment poLtctes in the development process. This research was stimulated in Large

part by the experience of developing countries. A key stylized fact was that

growth rates were widely dtvergent among developing countries, and that economic

polictes ——   especially   with respect to the foreign sector —— were one crucial

factor that dtffered between raptdly and slowly growing countries. In the lore

of trade and development economists, the fact that Korea's average annual rate

of growth of real GNP rose from under 5 percent in the 1950a to over 10 percent

tn subsequent decades was associated in part with the shift in the trade and

payments regime. By the 1980e, other countries had also experienced large

apparent changes tn rates of growth and of exports and the empirical regularity

appeared confirmed. 1

      By contrast, tnterest n neoclassical growth models appeared to fade by the

late 1960s. The assussptton of constant returns to scale evidently implied that

economic growth would eventually halt unless new technologies emerged: for any

gtven prcduction functton, labor force growth rate, and savings behavior, these

models predtcted an approach to a steady state per capita income level.

     In the mid—1980s, however, Lucas (1988) and Romer (1986) began considering

models in whtch the presence of plausible externalities or increasing returns to

scale could explatn the continuation of more—or—less constant growth rates over

long time periods. The results were impressive and have led to a revival of

tnterest in growth models, based essentially upon neoclassical premises, but with

externalities or increasing returns capable of generating an escape from the

"steady state conclusions of earlier work.2



     1See, for example, Balassa (1989).

     2For recent extensions, see, for example, Murphy, Shleifer and Vishny
(1989), and Romer (1990).
     To date, however, the new economic growth models generally assume efficient

resource allocation in all economies; sources of differences in growth rates

emanate from differences in earlier paths of accumulation and output, but not in

the degree to which governmental policiee differ or in the efficiency with which

resources are consequently allocated. There is a danger that the new economic

growth Literature and the development economics Literature will once again fail

to connect.

    Recently, Barro (1989s and l989b) began closing the gap by examining the roLe

of governments in new economic growth models, taking into account human capital

formation and savings behsvior. In his models, government investment expenditures

contribute positively to output.    Infrastructure is assumed to be effectively

provided free of charge to potential users. garro assumes that more

infrastructure augments the productivity of resources in private production. He

separates government spending into this "productive spending," from spending on

consumption, with the former expected to be positively correlated with growth and

the latter negatively. His tests using Summers and Heston's (1988) data from 72

countries bear this cut.

     In Barro's model, consumption expenditures simply detract from available

investible resources. In this paper, we go further, attempting to test the

development economist's perceptions of the negative contributions of governmental

activities, ss well as the positive contributions of other activities, to growth.

This paper provides further evidence on the importance of government behavior for

economic growth and, in so doing, attempts to start building a bridge between the

development economics literature and the new growth theory. The focal point is

the recognition that governments do more than spend and tax in manners that

maximize sociaL welfare functions: they influence incentives and regulate in ways


                                        4
that affect private behavior, and their spending, even on infrastructure, is not

always optimaL. A first section outLines some of the styLized facts that have

emerged from development economics regarding governmental behavior and its impact

on growth. A second section then describes our approach to testing for both

positive and negative effects of government activities and describes our data.

A third section presents the results. A final section provides some tentative

conclusions and suggests iurther lines of research.

     We have been guided in part by Jones •   contributions   to the evolution of both

development theory and to understanding of two—sector models of trade and growth

in important ways. He demonstrsted how factor market distortions —       the   resuLt of

government interventions that raise the urban wage or lower the cost of capital —

could affect the allocation of resources and negatively affect trade (Jones

1971). His contributions to understanding the Heckscher—Ohlin—Samuelaon model

(Jones 1956, 1965, 1977 and 1979) have provided an analytical underpinning for

empirical analysis of the contribution of differences in factor proportions and

trade to economic growth.3 As will be seen below, trade policies — as reflected

in our estimates as well as in earlier works in the development literature — do

affect growth rates, and an important reason is the opportunities that trade

provides for a developing tountry to use its abundant factors of production

effectively.

1. Government Policies in Develooine Countries

     In practice, many developing countries have adopted economic policies that

are highly tnimical to economic growth. These include: monetary and fiscal

policies that result in quadripie digit rates of inflation; expenditure patterns




     3See, for example, Krueger (1977).
on both consumption and investment that result in a great deal of waste4; the

construction of parastatal enterprises to undertake manufacturtng activities,

usually at very high costs; the monopolization of economic activities such as

agricultural distribution by the public sector with gross inefficiencies in the

delivery of inputs and the collection of outputs; price controls over economic

activities; regulation of private investments through licensing; maintenance of

overvalued exchange rates and import licensing regimes with strong disincentives

for exports and consequent "foreign exchange shortage"; and regulation of the

financial system in ways such that real interest rates paid by those receiving

funds are strongly negative while many other producers are precluded from

borrowing channels.

     However, governments also undertake activities that are potentially growth

promoting: the construction of essential infrastructure services such as roads,

ports, electicity, and telephones; the provision of education and public health

facilities; maintenance of Law and order; the development of irrigation; and

agricultural research and extension oervices.

     In practice, however, not all investment on infrastructure is productive.

In part, political—bureaucratic motivations may lead to expenditures and/or

employment in infrastructure facilities that are nonoptimal. This can occur

because concern is more with maximizing employment than with attaining a social

overhead facility at low coat; it can also occur because regional and other

political situations result in the location, size, or even sector of the



     4One of the horror stories emerging from the debt crises of the l980s was
that, in the Philippines, a nuclear power plant had been built at a cost of $4
billion that had never been operated. It takes considerable persuasion to
convince nonprofessionals that the Philippines were lucky relative to countries
where public—sector activities have been the recipients of the majority of
investment, and where they do not cover their operating costs.
 investment to be uneconomic.    In developing countries, stories of investments

 (unmaintained) in four—lane highways without significant traffic, sports stadis,

ultramodern sirporta, new capital citiea, and in expanding univeraity capacity

while Leaving many illiterate are too common to ignore.

      In addition, government controls, and the incentives they create, affect the

output per unit of input, and its growth, in the private sector. That highly

overvalued exchange rates, extreme levels of protection, credit rationing, labor

market regulations, and other measures are important in many developing countries

cannot be doubted. Most development practitioners believe, and available evidence

suggests, that these practices are important in affecting growth. Again, the

question is how to estimate their relative importance.

     One question that has arisen repeatedly in the literature on the growth of

developing countries has been        practices which reduce economic efficiency

should also lower the growth rats over time. In the context of a neoclassical

framework, after all, economic inefficiencies generated by controls would shrink

the production possibility frontier inward and thus affect the level of income;

there is no obvious presumed link in theory between the presence of these

practices and the growth rate.

      Partial answers have been provided. Firstly, controls seem to intensify

over time and are thus continuously reducing the productivity of existing and new

resources. Secondly, developing countries should be catching up over many years

and controls inhibit the process as the approach to the steady—state is greatly

slowed down. The new growth theory, with its emphasis on cumulative processes,

suggests yet s third reason: if there are externalities in the growth process,

anything that slows down the current rate of growth negatively affects the future

rate of growth.
     A second question is jf governments would adopt policies inimical to

economic growth. Recent advances in the political economy of development policy

have suggested a number of answers5. In the early development literature, it wae

implicitly assumed chat governments would behave as benevolent social

guardians.6 Experience has shown, however, that governments may instead behave

either as 'autonomous bureaucratic states or as "predatory authoritarian

states", In the former, the bureaucracy in effect governs and behaves to maximize

its power through increasing public employment and the activities undertaken by

the state. In the latter, the dictator, or oligarchic ruling group baa sufficient

political power to extrsct resources from the economy either directly (through

taxation) or indirectly through providing itself services at the expense of the

other sectors. There are also governments in which a number of groups compete for

politicaL power, and in which the ruling coalition's behavior is constrained by

the necessity of maintaining the coalition. In these circumstances, investments

and expenditures in particular sectors or regions, or other uses of governmental

resources, msy in fsct be wise investments in maintaining political power despite

their low or negative productivity for the economy as a whole.

     Findlay and Wilson (1987) modelled the behavior of a predstory government.

In their model, the state sllotstes resources to   infrastructure   and other goods



     5See Lal and Myint (forthcoming), and Krueger (forthcoming) for two
discussions.

      It can plausibly be argued that the motivation of many of the nationaList
leaders who led their countries to independence was genuinely idealistic, and
that those leaders based their policies on the assumption that their government
was and would continue to be committed to maximizing social welfare. Even
accepting that motivation, however, it would appear that there hss been
"bureaucratic capture" of governments in many developing countries, as the
sdmnistrative apparatus established to implement government controls over the
economy created bureaucrstic and other interests which then maximized in their
own self—interest.

                                        8
 insofar as it is in its own self—interest to do so. Real national income is s

function of private sector inputs and of government expenditures enhancing

productivity of the private sector. Findlay and Wilson consider two alternative

objective functions the ruler might have. In the first case, the sovereign is

constrained by a historically given tax rate and must pay pubLic sector employees

the same wage as is received in the private sector. Subject to this, the

sovereign maximizes the surplus, defined as the difference between his taç

revenue and his expenditure (when the expenditures indirectly yield additional

tax revenue, which is the only reason they are made at all). If this model were

correct, ihe sovereigns expenditures on infrastructure snd other investments

enhancing private sector productivity would be suboptimal. In the second version

of their model, however, which appears the more plausible, the sovereign's

surplus is then spent on other categories of goods —   bureaucratic   office holders

who expand their domain insofar as revenues permit it, through, for example,

palaces, sports stadia, and expanded public employment.

     In the Findlay—Wilson model, therefore, government expenditures perform two

functions: on one hand, some expenditures enhance the productivity of privste

sector activity, and on the other hand, some expenditures divert resources from

productive uses. Once bureaucratic interests are recognized as a motive in

resource allocation, there is no presumption that even investment expenditures

wiLl be allocated efficiently. In terms of attempting to estimate the impact of

direct government policies, the important challenge is to quantify separateLy the

magnitude of wasteful and of productive expenditures.

     Despite the enormous difficulties of segregating various categories of

government activities, the presumed importance of the phenomenon in deveLoping

countries makes an effort worth while. This paper therefore makes a first effort
to identify variables that can reflect, at least to same degree, differences in

the productivity of different categories of government activities. In addition

to those activities that are uirectly" reilecceo in government expenditure

accounts, we recognize 'indirect effects on the productivity and growth of

private economic activity that arise through controls imposed by the bureaucracy,

or the sovereign, over private activity.

2. Quantifying Government Activities and Their Effects

     The period we cover is 1976/77 to 1980/81. The choice of time period was

determined largely on the basis of data availability. Two other considerations,

however, suggest that use of growth rates over that interval makes sense. First,

there would be difficulties in using growth rates for the first half of the 1980s

because of the differential impact of worldwide conditions on different

countries' growth performances. Second, economic policies do change in developing

countries

          Our dependent variable is the rate of growth of real GOP over this period,

using Summers—Heston (1988) estimates of growth rates. As will be seen, data

available for proxying unproductive government expenditures are available on a

relatively consistent basis for at least a few —    twenty—six — countries over that
period. This group of countries includes eleven relatively developed countries8

and fifteen developing countries.9


         our sample, Sri Lanka appear to be something of an outlier. A possible
explanation may be that in 1977, an election resulted in a change of government
which proceeded to dismantle economic controls and substantially liberalize the
economy.

        We seek to identify the contributions, both positive end negative, of

government activities to economic growth. To do so, we need four sets of

variables: 1) measures of those government expenditures that enhance private

sector output; 2) indicators of those government expenditures that directly

reduce private sector output; 3) indicators of the indirect negative effect of

government policies on private sector productivity; and 4) measures of the growth

of resources available to the private sector. Here, we describe the measures

used.

        2.1 Positive Direct Effects of Government Exoenditures. As a potential

indicator of the posittve product of   direct   government economic activity the

availabLe measure ——   given our negative measure defined below —— was the level
of output of state owned enterprises (SOfa). These enterprises cover a range of

activities, including provision of power, irrigation, and transport (railroads

and ports especially) services that presumably enhance private sector output,

although they also include the value added of state marketing boards, and

parsatatal enterprises engaged tn such diverse activities as manufacturing,

mining, and tourism. Insofar as marketing boards suppress producer prices of

agricultural commodities, those activities would not be reflected in measures of

the value of their output. Unfortunately, a split between the output of SOfa by

major economic activity i5 not comprehensively available. When public sector

output is produced inefficiently, using a measure of inputs to reflect the

negative contribution of government will, we hope, reflect this (see Sect. 2.2).

In the regression results reported below, the variable used is public sector

enterprise output as a fraction of nonagriculturaL GHP.10 Note that since


     10 There are few available estimates of the values of SOf output on a
consistent basis across countries. We use data from Short (1984) and Nair and
Filippides (1988). These estimates generally pertain to the 1976—80 period.

                                       11
governments outputs of nonpriced services are not captured by thia proxy, to the

extent theee contribute to growth, the net direct effect of government ta

probabiy biased downward.

     2.2. Direct Government Exoenditures that are Wasteful. In all models of

government behavior, the resources employed by government subtract from those

available for private economic activity. For that reaaon, we uae the ratio of

public aeotor employment to total nonagricultural employment as a proxy for the

negative direct impact of government expenditures. Clesrly, if the output of

state owned enterprises is a reasonably vslid proxy for the positive effects of

government expenditures, then s measure of the resources used by government can

serve aa an indicator of the negstive impact of government: estimating a "net

direot effect can then be done by combining the two impacts.11

     2.3 Indirect Nerative Effects of Government. The governmental economic

policies that affect the efficiency of private sector resource allocation may

also affect economic growth. Many of these policies have been analyzed and

quantified for particular groups of developing countries in the literature.12

      Two sets of policies whose effects have been shown to be strongly negattve

are thooe affecting the trade and psy,sento regime and those which suppress the

ftnanctsl sector. We sought proxies that might reflect the extent to which the

credit market and the foreign exchange market were, in the period under review,




     11No international organization publishes data separately identifying public
employment. The most comprehensive data are available in Heller and Tait (1984)
and pertain for most countries to 1979 or 1980.

analysis. See also Bhsgwati (1978) and Krueger (1978, 1983) for trade policies,
MoKinnon (forthcoming) for financial policies, and Krueger, Schiff and Valdes
(1988) for agrioultural pricing policies.

                                        12
distorted by government policies. In the case of the trade snd payments regime,

we use the percentage premium of the black market exchange rate13 relative to

the official exchange rate. Although no messure is perfect, there is reason to

believe that there is a significant relationship between the height of the bLack

market premium and the restrictiveness of the trade regime. An alternative

approach might have been to attempt to estimate deviations of real exchange rates

from some base year purchasing—power—parity exchange rate. The difficulty with

this procedure would have been to attempt to identify reasonably comparable base

years across countries.

     For the financial market, governments often ration credit through controls

upon interest rates and through instructions, or guidance', as to how banks

should allocate their lending across economic activities. There is clearly more

scope for such guidance the lower is the nominal interest rate relative to the

one which wouLd clear the market. To reflect this acroaa countries, we

constructed a measure of the real interest rate by taking in general the deposit

interest rate deflated by the inflation rate in the estimation period.14

     Clearly, the expectation is   that        the estimated coefficient on the real

interest rate will be positive: the less negative it is, the lees likely is

credit to be misallocated across economic activities. For the black market

premium, the coefficient is expected to be negative: a larger premium presumably

reflects a more negative effect on output and growth.

    2.4 Growth in Private Sector Resources, Here, we seek to be as traditional

as possible, and consistent with measures used by Barro and others. The

     13
       Data from World Currency Yearbook (formerly Pick's) were collated by Wood
(1988). We use Wood's data.

     14Eatimates were also made using the GDP deflator, rather than the consumer
price index, as en estimator of inflation. There was no difference in results.

                                          13
importance of human capital has been recognized by both development economists

and the new growth theorists. Indeed, in the works of Romer and others, education

may be one source of externalities. Romer (1986) and others believe that growth

rates should be positively associated with the initial level of human capital

stock. For the countries we include in our estimates, we take the enrollment in

secondary school as a proporticn of the population age 12 to 17 in 1965 as our

variable

    In general, the initial level of capital stock is expected to be positively

correlated with the level of per capita income and, if there are externalities,

with growth. The rate of growth of the capiial stock ought to be positively

correlated with the growth rate. We constructed two measures to take this into

accouni. A real capital stock index was calculated using perpetual inventory

methods, iaking the 1960 ratio of GOP to investment as having reflected the

capital output ratio at that time, and then adding new investment and

depreciating capital for subsequent years, using Summers and Heston data. For the

second measure, we took a simple average of real investment to GOP ratios for the

1960—76 period, aa used by Barro. Neither variable proved helpful: the signs were

negative, sometimes significantly so. It is not clear why this occurred, and the

capital stock variable was omitted from the regression estimates reported below.

3. Results

     The regression estimates are shown in Table 1. The first equation reports

the results when the average real rate of growth is related only to the initial

(logged) level of average per capita income in 1976/77, public sector employment,

and output of public sector enterprises. As can be seen, only public sector

employment is significant: a one percentage point increase in the ratio of


     15flata were obtained from World Bank (1990).

                                        14
government employrsenc to the nonagricultural labor farce reduces the estimated

rate of growth by eight one hundredths of one percent.

        The second equation adds proxies for the effects of the trade and payments

regiae and credit rationing on the growth rate. These variables are highly

significant and add greatly to the explanatory power of the estimating equation.

In addition, when controlling for employment effects, an increase in the share

of state owned enterprises in nonagricultural output is positively and

significantly related to growth. Public employment is significantly negatively

related as before. These results are certainly consistent with the hypothesis

that direct government activities contain a positive component (output) and a

negative component. As expected, a one percentage point higher real interest rate

is associated wtth a 0.24 percent increase in the real rate of growth. The black

market premium, also as expected, has a significant negative impact on the growth

rate.

        Includtng both direct and indirect effects of governmental activities alone

in equation (3) results in an equation capable of accounting for just under 50

percant of the variation in output growth rates, which suggests the importance

of both direct and indirect government activities upon the rate of growth. The

signs, aagntcude, and signtficance of the direct output effects remain much the

same as before and conform again to the Findlay—Wilson hypothesis.

    The fourth and fifth equation in Table I incorporate the human capital

variable into the estimation. Education is in general positively related to

growth, although it is not stgntftcant at the 90 percent level and is unstable

for changes in the number of regressors.

        Table 2 provtdes estimates of the predicted direct and indirect effects of

government sctivtties on per capita output growth in the 26 countries, using the


                                         15
results of equation (3) from Table I. In computing predicted growth, the constant

term and effects of government activities are included. As is readily apparent,

governments appear in many countries to have a large negative impact upon

economic growth. The elasticities of public sector employment and state—owned—

enterprise output, exsmined at the means, are negative 1.28 and positive 1.01

percent, indicating a proportionate rise in both has a relatively small net

negative effect upon output growth.

    The indirect effects are generally larger than the direct effects (averaging

around minus one percentage point) and range from plus 0.3 percent to minus 5.7

percent. The elasticities of changes in the real interest rates and the exchange

premium are 0.31 and negative 0.37 percent respectively.

    Those countries for which actual growth deviated moat from the predicted rate

include Sri Lanka, Tanzania, Zambia, and the Central African Republic. Sri Lanka,

as already mentioned, underwent a strong liberalization program starting in 1977.

Tanzania, the CAR and Zambia experienced declines in their growth ratea in the

early l980a.

    Evaluated ac their means, both the direct and the indirect effects of

government are more negative in developing compared with developed countries.

rndeed, according Co these estimates, the difference in actual growth rates

between che two groups was more chan accounted for by the difference in

government policies. Stated another way, the fifteen developing countries for

which the relevant data were available experienced on (unweighted) average about

1.4 percent leas annual average growth in per capita income than did the

developed countries. If these estimates are used as a basis for compuiaiion, if

developing countries governments activities had been the same as those of

developeo countries, che formers growth rates would have been 0.5 percentage

4. Conciusion

     Equations which use a growth rate aa a dependent variable are notoriousLy

difficuLt because of the inherent difficuLties in specifying the underLying modeL

correctLy, and even of estimating the true growth rate. The results presented

here are highLy tentative. Perhaps the surprise should be that any variables

were strongLy significant, and yet the apparent impact of governmentaL activities

on output growth show up strsngly across the forms of the equations used here.

    In Light of data Limitations, these resuLts are clearly preLiminary. They

strongiy point to the need for further research into the combined impact of

factor accumulation and government activities upon economic growth. A major

barrter to that research is the Lack of the reLevant data on anything Like a

comparable basis across countries. We hope that our contribution may stimulate

not onLy further analysis using other sources of data, but also in spurring the
