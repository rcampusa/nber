                                               ABSTRACT

The paper examines the determinants of scientific productivity (number of articles and journals’ impact
factor) for a panel of about 3600 French and Italian academic physicists active in 2004-05. Endogeneity
problems concerning promotion and productivity are addressed by specifying a generalized Tobit model,
in which a selection probit equation accounts for the individual scientist’s probability of promotion
to her present rank, and a productivity regression estimates the effects of age, gender, cohort of entry,
and collaboration characteristics, conditional on the scientist’s rank. We find that the size and international
nature of collaborative projects and co-authors’ past productivity have very significant impacts on
current productivity, while age and gender, and past productivity are also influential determinants
of both productivity and probability of promotion. Furthermore we show that the stop-and-go policies
of recruitment and promotion, typical of the Italian and French centralized academic systems of governance,
can leave significant long-lasting cohort effects on research productivity.

1. Introduction and overview

       Countries exhibit very substantial differences in their scientific productivity

as well as in the institutional settings of their research activities (May, 1997; King,

2004). However, most of the available studies on academic scientists’ productivity

and careers are based upon US data, and their theoretical insights and policy

implications take for granted the institutional characteristics of US universities

(Long, 1978; Allison and Long, 1990; Levin and Stephan, 1991; Lee and Bozeman,

2005). Little is known in fact on the determinants of academic scientists’

productivity in Europe. European university systems differ substantially both

from their US counterparts and among themselves, the most important differences

being related to the degree of autonomy of universities, the size and flexibility of

the academic job market, and the relative weight and quality of universities and

public research organizations (PROs) within the national science system.


       In this paper we study various determinants of careers and scientific

productivity of academic physicists in France and Italy, by taking explicitly into

consideration the institutional context of the two countries. In both France and

Italy, universities have very limited autonomy and compete for human and

financial resources with large PROs (especially important in France). Their

tenured staff are civil servants recruited and promoted through centralized

procedures controlled by the State. This centralization tends to originate highly

irregular recruitment and promotion “waves”, such that career opportunities may

be absent for long intervals of time, and then appear all of a sudden as a
                                                                                     2
consequence of a policy decision. We expect such irregularities to result in long‐

lasting cohort effects on productivity, which we wish to compare with other

productivity determinants found to be significant by US‐based studies.


      We thus investigate the effects of age, gender, cohort of entry and past

productivity both on individual scientists’ current productivity and on their

career progress. We also consider the role of size and nature (international vs.

national) of research projects as well as the influence of co‐authors’ productivity.

We base our analysis upon a panel of about 3600 academic physicists, with the

exception of nuclear and astro‐physicists, all of them active in academic year 2004‐

05. Our productivity measures, both in terms of “quantity” and of “quality”,

derive from information from the ISI‐Web of Science pertaining to a set of some

360 journals covering most specialized journals in physics with some reputation

(namely, with at least a five‐year average impact factor of 0.5).


      We consider five productivity regressions, one for each main position in the

academic ranking of the two countries, from assistant to full professor: precisely

Maitre de Conference (MCF) and Professor (PR) in France, and Ricercatore

Universitario (RU), Professore Associato (PA) and Professore Ordinario (PO) in

Italy. We also specify three selection probit equations accounting for the

individual scientist’s probability of promotion from respectively MCF to PR, RU to

PA, and PA to PO. The three productivity regressions for PR, PA and PO are

estimated jointly with the three corresponding promotion equations as a

generalized Tobit model by means of Heckman two‐step method. Estimating a

                                                                                  3
productivity regression for each rank, and jointly with a promotion probit

equation for professors helps in controlling for unobserved individual

heterogeneity across ranks and in correcting for selectivity in promotion to

professorship. We also take care of individual heterogeneity among individual

physicists by including past productivity variables in all equations: three year

average lagged productivity in the promotion probit equations, and average

productivity before recruitment (for MCF and RU) or promotion (for PR, PA and

PO) in the productivity regressions.


      As expected from the background literature, our results confirm the

existence of age and gender effects both on the probability to be promoted and on

productivity conditional on academic rank, although with some differences

between ranks and countries. They also confirm that physicists’ own past

productivity has very significant positive impacts on promotion probability and

current productivity. We find that the size and international nature of

collaborative projects, as well as co‐authors’ past productivity, are influential

determinants of current productivity. Finally, we provide significant evidence that

the physicists recruited or promoted in 1980 in Italy and in 1985 in France (when

massive recruitment and promotion waves took place after several years with

limited career opportunities) are on average less productive than the other

physicists, showing the damaging and long‐lasting effects of the stops‐and‐goes in

recruitment and promotion policies typical of the two centralized academic

systems.

                                                                                 4
          The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we very

briefly outline the background literature, and in section 3 we present at some

length the institutional features and relevant historical developments of the French

and Italian academic systems in the past 30 years. In section 4 we explain our data

and justify our choice of econometric specification, and in section 5 we comment

in detail our results. Section 6 concludes.




2. Background literature

          Interest in the determinants of individual scientists’ productivity goes back

to the XIX century1. From the very start, enquiries on scientific productivity were

meant to cast light on a two separate issues: the soundness of eugenic principles

proposed by Sir Francis Galton, whose studies on the “hereditary genius” had

been largely based on the demographics of “eminent men of science”; and the

impact of academic institutional arrangements and incentive schemes on a

country’s scientific performance, as measured by the number of outstanding

scientists from that country (Cattell, 1903; Godin, 2006; Godin 2007)2. Both the


1   James Cattell published in 1903 the first systematic data collection on scientific papers per author

and provided strong evidence of the existence of large differences across individuals, a result later

systematized by Alfred Lotka’s well‐known “power law”(Lotka, 1926).

2   A third purpose served by these early enquiries was the study of disciplines, from their birth to

consolidation. This is still a very much beaten path, although recent studies add to simple paper

counts increasingly sophisticated applications of network analysis (Crane, 1972).


                                                                                                      5
issues have been debated ever since and are still present in today’s studies,

although quite often in a disguised manner.


         Since the 1960s, sociologists of science have tested whether increasing

returns to scientific reputation and productivity (presently referred to as

“Matthew effect”) may explain Lotka’s law better than the unequal distribution of

intelligence in the population (Merton, 1968; Merton, 1988; David 1994). A typical

result in this direction has been obtained by Long and Fox (1995), who find that,

other things being equal, graduates from prestigious universities have a higher

chance to get their first job at institutions in the same league, with substantial

advantages in terms of present and future research productivity. As for individual

determinants, gender is the one that has attracted most of the attention, with

cognitive and genetic explanations of gender differences (as opposed to social

ones) being still debated (Etzkowitz et al., 2000; Fox, 1999; Spelke, 2005).


         Understanding the relationship between academic institutions, incentive

schemes, and scientists’ performance has become increasingly important over the

last 30 years or so. This surge of interest can be explained by the policy makers’

wish to measure and increase the effectiveness of the public funding of science.

Leading research universities and scientists, facing possible budget cuts, have also

actively lobbied in favour of a higher concentration of resources on the basis of

publication‐ and citation‐based indicators of excellence (Graham and Diamond,

1997).




                                                                                  6
          An important line of research explores the impact of age and tenure on

scientists’ productivity. In particular, many studies have explored the possibility

that individual scientific productivity follows a life cycle: productivity increases

when the scientist is young, reaches a peak at/before middle age, and declines

afterwards (Levin and Stephan, 1991). At the same time, studies on tenure have

tried to clarify whether observable life cycles are due to biological factors or to the

incentive structure, such as the reduced “publish‐or‐perish” pressure on senior

scientists with tenured positions. In a rare study on a non‐US sample, Turner and

Mairesse (2002) find that while promotion has a positive effect on the quantity and

quality of publications, the time spent on the same tenured senior position has a

negative impact on both variables. They also show that being a member of a

highly productive laboratory fuels individual productivity. This confirms that

some institutional variables, such as the stratification of universities according to

prestige and funding, may generate increasing returns in science.


3. Recruitment and careers of academic scientists in France and Italy

          Most of the available literature on scientific productivity is based both

theoretically and empirically on the US case. This is an important limitation,

because the latter is not representative of university systems worldwide 3 . The

centrality of universities for public science, the degree of academic job mobility,



3   Noteworthy exceptions are Turner and Mairesse (2002), Bonaccorsi and Daraio (2003), Hall et al.

(2005), Mairesse and Turner (2006), and Breschi et al. (2007, 2008).


                                                                                                 7
and the clear stratification of universities according to research intensity are

typical characteristics of the USA (Ben‐David, 1992; Clark, 1993). In countries such

as France and Germany, for example, large public research organizations such as

CNRS (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique) or the Max Plank Institute have

been regarded by policy makers as the main pillars of the public research system;

Italy also followed this model for many years with CNR (Consiglio Nazionale delle

Ricerche).


       As for job mobility, we observe that US universities select candidates for

professorial jobs in total autonomy, with no control from the central (federal) or

state governments. Professors of all ranks are university employees who can

bargain for their wages and working conditions on an individual basis; in addition,

the existence of a proper academic job market allows scientists with a strong

publication record to move across universities in search of better paid or better

funded research positions (Ehrenberg et al., 1990). This is hardly the case in France

and Italy. In these centralized systems university staffs are considered civil

servants, who are employed by the government and selected by commissions of

senior peers, chosen by national members of the relevant discipline or nominated

by government. In these countries, there is not a strong competition between

universities for recruiting or promoting the most promising or productive

scientists.


       At the same time, strict dependence of universities on government funding

(which tend to be highly pro‐cyclical) and the frequent reforms of the recruitment

                                                                                   8
procedures tend to make career perspectives highly erratic. Italy, for example, has

a long history of prolonged periods during which universities did not recruit new

scientists, due to funding shortages or ongoing policy revisions, followed by

sudden waves of mass recruitment and promotions, often under the political

pressure exerted by the large number of scientists seeking a tenured position after

many years of temporary contracts.




3.1 Academic careers in France and Italy


       The French academic system has two main positions: “Maitre de conférence”

(MCF; roughly equivalent to the US rank of assistant professor) and “Professeur”

(PR). In Italy there are three positions: “Ricercatore universitario” (RU), “Professore

Associato” (PA) and “Professore ordinario” (PO). In French physics, MCFs amount to

around two thirds of tenured faculty, while in Italy each of the three ranks adds

up to around one third of tenured faculty (see figure 1).


                             [FIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE]


       All positions are tenured, and for all of them the teaching and research

duties, as well as the wages, are defined by national laws, with limited possibility

of negotiation at the local level. Whatever their rank, academics are classified by

the government according to their discipline. Such disciplines act very much as

professional guilds, since their members (and not individual universities or




                                                                                     9
department) control the recruitment process4. Before accessing any of the above‐

mentioned positions (most often RU in Italy and MCF in France) young scientists

go through post‐doc positions of various lengths. Universities that wish to recruit

a young scientist or promote any member of the academic staff are subject to a

series of administrative constraints, which limit their freedom to allocate funds to

recruitment or career progress in the absence of governmental approval, and

require them to follow a set of complex procedures to place a job call and collect

the related applications. In addition, the job calls may be suspended by the

government at any time for either financial or regulatory reasons, forcing

universities to delay their recruitment or promotion plans.


          In Italy and France, these constraints have often clashed against an

increasing demand for higher education instruction, whose growth was

particularly intense in the 1960s and 70s. In those years, both countries answered

to the growing number of students of those years by hiring a large number of

young assistants with fixed‐terms contracts or when tenured weak prospects of

promotion (Professori incaricati as well as contrattisti and assegnisti in Italy, and

Assistants and Maitres Assistants in France). In early 1980s, two reform acts were

passed: law 382 in Italy (in 1980) and the Higher Education Act in France (in 1984).

Both laws reformed the recruitment process by introducing the ranking system we

4   Notice also that the US system is openly stratified according to the research vs. teaching intensity

of institutions. On the contrary, both the Italian and French laws forbid universities to differentiate

openly their mission, and to assign different research versus teaching loads to the faculty.



                                                                                                     10
described above, and by changing the hiring rules. At the same time, a number of

ad hoc measures were passed along with the new laws, which were meant to allow

many professori incaricati and assistants to obtain tenured positions as ricercatori or

professori associati in Italy, or maitres de conference in France. In Italy, the ad hoc

procedures were merely formal and candidates did not face any selective

competition5 (Clark, 1977; Moscati, 2001). As a result, in each country there was a

massive recruitment wave (respectively in 1980 and 1985), followed by a

prolonged period without any recruitment in Italy, and by a sensible decline in

recruitment in France. Figures 2 and 3 illustrate this effect for the field of physics:

they report the number of scientists ‐ who were on active duty in 2004‐05 ‐ by year

of recruitment (for RU and MCF) or year of last promotion (for those in

professorial positions). The 1980 and 1985 entry/promotion peaks are clearly

visible.


                                 [FIGURES 2 AND 3 ABOUT HERE]


          The 1980 and 1984 laws also had lasting effects on the selection procedures.

In Italy, it was established that the promotion to PA and PO had to occur at a

national level, for a number of positions issued every other year by the ministry,

and managed by a professors’ committee whose members were first chosen by all


5   See article 50 and 57 DPR 382/1980 for Italy and article 59 Décret n 84‐431 du 6 juin 1984 for

France. These laws can be found (in original language) on the following websites:

                                                                                               11
peers in each discipline, and then further selected by the ministry. As for RUs,

these were selected at the university level by a committee of three among PAs and

POs, all appointed by the ministry. Together with the universities’ lack of financial

autonomy, this highly centralized system soon became responsible for a number

of difficulties in speeding up the recruitment process by universities throughout

the 1980s and early 1990s (see again Figure 3).


         In 1998 a new recruitment system was introduced, which was still in place

at the time of our study6. The system allows each university to offer new positions

by launching its own call for applications (concorso), and to set up an examination

committee. All the committee members, however, must belong to the same

discipline for which the position is offered and (with the exception of just one

member) they are not selected by the university, but elected by all the discipline

affiliates at the national level. Nominally, the commission has not the task to pick

the most suitable candidate for the university that launched the call (on the basis,

for example, of the coincidence of the candidate’s and the university’s research

interests), but the best possible candidate in absolute terms, who should be the one

with the best publication record (called “idoneo”, which means fit‐for‐the‐job). In

principle, if the university does not like this candidate, it can always refuse to

nominate him/her and launch a new job call. In practice, most commissions try to


6   While we revised the paper, the Ministry of Education announced a new change in the

recruitment laws, which by June 2009, however, had not yet been entirely disclosed to the

Parliament.


                                                                                      12
steer the selection process towards candidates deemed suitable for the university.7

Once again the introduction of the new law coincided with a new wave of

recruitment; although less dramatic than the 1980 one, this is still visible in Figure

2, in the years between 1999 and 2001.


          The French recruitment system is also very centralized and discipline‐

centred 8 . Every year, the central government issues a list of vacancies, by

discipline and institution, both for the MCF and PR positions. The applicants need

first to get a qualification certificate, which is granted by the CNU (Conseil National

des Universités) – whose members are partly elected and partly designated by the

Ministry of Education. Once obtained, the qualification is valid for four years and

the qualified candidates are the only ones who can apply for the vacant positions.

Applications will then be examined at the university level, by disciplinary

commissions, composed both of local and non‐local members9.


7   This requires many behind‐the–scene manoeuvres by the university, aimed at steering the

election of the committee members in favour of friendly candidates. For a more in‐depth

discussion of this point, and of its consequences for academic careers in Italy, see Pezzoni et al.

(2009)

8   In August 2007, the Sarkozy presidency initiated a number of much debated and still on‐going

reforms which are       aimed    at giving autonomy to universities by shifting powers and

administration of resources from the Ministry to them.

9   These disciplinary commissions are made up of 10 to 20 members, coming both from the

discipline or possibly other disciplines in the university, and from the discipline in other

universities. These commissions, in which PR and MCF sit in equal number, are elected for 4 years;


                                                                                                13
        Both the Italian and the French recruitment systems have undergone severe

criticism over the years, which resulted in a succession of reforms that shifted the

balance of decision power in recruitment matters back and forth between the

national and local level (Chevaillier, 2001; Moscati, 2001; Musselin, 2005). None of

these reforms, however, has gone as far as to grant universities total freedom in

recruitment matters, nor it has diminished much the power of disciplines. More

importantly, the procedural uncertainty created by this succession of reforms,

combined with repeated cuts in the public spending for universities, has made the

recruitment process very irregular over time.


        Time irregularities in recruitment and career advancement mechanisms

determine the age composition of the academic workforce. Table 1 reports the

number of physicists in France and Italy in 2004‐05 by rank and decade of birth.

As expected, the lower academic ranks are populated by younger scientists in both

countries. However, in Italy the top academic rank (PO) is populated by much

older scientists than its French equivalent (PR): while in France 19.6% of the full

professors (PR) were born in the 1960s, in Italy the percentage of PO from the

same decade is only 2.6%. Although less striking, such differences in age

composition hold also for the lower ranks: only 11.6% of Italian RU were born in

the 1970s, as opposed to 25.0% of French MCF. This is a very likely consequence of




they meet to deliberate on the recruitment of MCF in plenary formation, and on the promotion of

PR in a formation restricted to PR.


                                                                                            14
the higher emphasis on seniority‐career links in Italy, and of the higher

irregularity of the Italian recruitment process.


                                    [TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE]


          Finally, an important institutional feature of both the French and the Italian

research systems is the role of large PROs such as CNRS and CNR, respectively. In

France, CNRS has been traditionally regarded as the most important actor of the

research system (even more so in physics, with the exception of nuclear physics,

where that role is contended by CEA, a special agency for atomic energy). As such,

it has often out‐competed universities in attracting the best and most motivated

young scientists, who may perceive the academic position of MCF as overloaded

with teaching and administrative duties (not so much the professor’s position,

which is often targeted by CNRS Chargés de recherche). In Italy, the history of CNR

starts similarly to that of CNRS, which indeed was taken as a model for its

creation, in the late 1930s. Badly hit by successive budget cuts, the CNR has

progressively lost its centrality in the Italian research system, as well as the

possibility to offer permanent positions to young scientists. This implies that while

French universities have at least one competitor in the academic labour market,

Italian universities have none.10


10   Note also in France the existence of institutions of higher education called “Grandes Ecoles”,

such as “Ecole Normale Supérieure” and “Ecole Polytechnique” to cite two oldest and most

prestigious ones. They are of very small size compared to universities, but they select excellent

students, and have also developed good research activities in the last twenty years.


                                                                                                15
3.2 Implications for scientific productivity


      The analysis of the recruitment process in the two countries, and of the

relative balance of universities and PROs inside the research system, suggests

some observations on the factors affecting scientific productivity. In principle,

productivity is a key determinant of career advancement in both countries, at least

for senior positions. In a related paper we show that this is indeed the case in

France for moves up to PR positions, and in Italy for promotion from RU to PA

but less so for promotion from PA to PO (see Pezzoni et al., 2009). As a

consequence, other things being equal, we should expect scientists who are

currently on higher positions to be more productive than those in lower ones. We

should also expect such scientists to exhibit a less pronounced life cycle that is to

be highly productive over a longer time spell, and to incur a productivity

slowdown at a later age. However, especially for Italy, informal recruitment and

promotion practices push in the direction of career by seniority and can give great

advantages to local candidates, no matter their productivity. If these effects were

dominant, they would significantly weaken the effectiveness of incentives to high

productivity.


      We also expect to find strong effect for the different years of

entry/promotion both in Italy and France, for at least three reasons. First, access to

tenured academic positions has increasingly become more difficult over the 1980s

and 1990s, so we may presume that scientists who have been recruited over these

two decades are more productive than their predecessors. Second, late generations

                                                                                   16
of scientists have more international experience and may be expected to find it

easier to publish in international journals, which in our data are better represented

than national ones. Last, cohorts of scientists recruited en masse over short periods

of time (after periods of no recruitment) could be either more productive or less

productive than the average. We expect the RU, PA and MCF that entered the

university system in 1980 in Italy and 1985 in France (or reached their last

academic rank), to be less productive, due to the explicit lack of selective pressure

in those two years. We do not have any a priori on the effect of the 1980 and 1985

entry waves on the productivity of scientists in higher positions (PO and PR),

which were much less affected by these legislative changes.


          We expect productivity to grow over time (calendar years) for at least three

reasons. First, both in Italy and in France public research funding has been

increasingly distributed on the basis of competitive grants. Second, physics, as any

other discipline, has enjoyed decreasing publishing cost, thanks to new

procedures and media. Finally, and especially in physics, “big science” and large

projects have favoured teamwork, which tends to increase productivity, as

measured by publishing (Price and Beaver, 1966)11.




11   : “..It is especially noteworthy that nobody who worked without collaborators or with only one

co‐author succeeded in producing more than four papers in the five‐year period, whereas

everybody with more than twelve collaborators produced fourteen or more papers in the same

time..” (Price and Beaver, 1966, p. 1014)


                                                                                                17
           As for gender, no apparent reason exists to think of peculiarities for France

and Italy with respect to the US, so we expect to find evidence of a statistically

significant gender effect in both countries. Stratification effects may also exist,

which we try to capture with information on the affiliation and productivity of our

scientists’ co‐authors.




4. Data and methods


4.1 Data collection and sample


         Our data collection is based on lists of all tenured academics in Italian and

French universities, active in academic year 2004/2005, provided by the Ministries

of Education of the two countries. The lists classify academics according to their

disciplinary affiliation: as indicated in Table 2, the individuals we have selected

are those active in all fields of physics, with the exception of astro‐physics and

nuclear physics12. The lists also provide the academics’ dates of birth, gender and

university, as well as their rank in 2004/2005 and seniority in these ranks. For all



12   Not all the scientists classified in one discipline, in fact, have homogeneous research interests. In

addition, it is often the case that some scientists are pushed to join (nominally) the discipline with

the highest opportunities of promotion at a given point in time. Face‐to‐face interviews to Italian

physicists show that some nuclear and particle physicists are classified as Fisica Sperimentale (Field

FIS/01), which enters our study, instead of being classifies as Fisica Nucleare e Subnucleare (Field

FIS/04), which we excluded from our study.


                                                                                                       18
individuals who in 2004/2005 were at the bottom rank of the academic ladder

(namely, MCF in France and RU in Italy) we thus know when they were recruited

in such position; for all those who in the same year occupied a higher position (PR

in France, PA or PO in Italy), we know when they were promoted to such position,

but we ignore when they were recruited (as MCF or RU) or first promoted to

lesser ranks.


         We gathered the information on scientific publications from the ISI Web of

Science, from Thompson‐Darwent, by matching the surnames and names of the

physicists in the ministerial lists with the surnames and initial of names (as coded

by ISI) for the authors of all articles published in physics journals going back to

1975. We considered a total of 363 journals classified as mainly physics journals in

the ISI records and with a minimum reputation as defined by an average five year

impact factor of at least 0.5 13 . This list of journals includes all the main

international journals specialised in physics and covers well all of its subfields14.




13   This means in other words that we excluded the physics journals which have regularly received

over a five year period less than 0.5 citations per article. It is also the case that ISI does not cover as

well those low reputation journals.

14   The list of the 20 journals with the larger number of publications in our database is reported in

the Appendix Table 6. Interviews with a few physicists have confirmed that no top journals

specialised in physics are missing.


                                                                                                        19
Note that we have preferred not to consider generalist journals such as Science or

Nature15.


                         [TABLE 2 AND TABLE 3 ABOUT HERE]


          Such a collection strategy is the only one compatible with the publication

data gathered from the Web of Science, but it generates problems of homonymy

for the small group of physicists with the same surnames and initial of names in

the ministerial lists, as well as for those with very common surnames. Ignoring

these problems may lead to over‐estimating the productivity of these physicists. In

other cases homonyms can be found in the original ministerial databases, so that it

is impossible to correctly attribute papers. Therefore after some trials we finally



15   Including generalist journals such as Science and Nature may create even more problems of

homonymy than the ones we already have (if there are several “Smith J.” in physics, there must

plenty when considering all disciplines!). Moreover, we believe there are strong correlations

between publishing in specialized journals of good quality and generalist journals of outstanding

reputation as Science and Nature. Such generalist journals are few and they are not alternative

outlets to specialist physics journals. Top physicists who manage to publish the results of their

research in Science and Nature also publish these results in specialized physics journals. In terms

of descriptive statistics on “quantity” productivity, the errors we introduce should be more or less

negligible. On “quality” productivity, the absence of a few very‐high‐impact‐factor journals such

as Science and Nature probably results in chopping up slightly the long tail of the productivity

distribution of scientists. In terms of biases in our econometric analysis, one can expect that they

will not be sizeable. At the same time, it is very unlikely that a physicist with a small publication

record in specialized journals will publish many papers in Science or Nature.


                                                                                                  20
dropped from our search all homonyms in the ministerial lists and all physicists

with an apparent productivity record far too high for being credible, and with

quite common surnames. These choices resulted in dropping about 3% of

surnames from the original lists, leaving us with 2151 French physicists (instead of

2211) and 1769 Italians (instead of 1816) 16. Note also that unless one would think

that the spelling of surnames could in some way be related to the scientific

productivity, cleaning our study sample from homonyms should not introduce

any biases in our econometric results.


          Looking at our publications data, we found that about 3% (52) of the

academic physicists in Italy and about 11% (235) of the French ones have no

articles at all before and after recruitment or promotion, and hence a computed

zero productivity throughout their observed careers. This significant difference

could reflect the French academics’ tendency to write much more than Italians also

in journals not included in the ISI Web of Science; or by a higher share, in France,

of academics involved nearly exclusively in teaching, and/or administrative,

advising and consulting activities. Given the lack of specific data for investigating

why these “zero‐productive” physicists self‐select as “non researchers”, we




16   Most of the surnames of physicists we discarded are the homonyms in the ministerial lists.

Otherwise we have had in fact to discard only 4 names of physicists for France and 2 for Italy

because their computed productivity appeared much too large to be credible (with 30 papers or

more for at least 10 years!) and they had also widespread surnames (e.g., CHEN or WANG).


                                                                                            21
thought it was better to simply leave them out from our analysis17. Our final study

sample is thus made of 1916 French and 1717 Italian academic physicists, for

which have a corpus of respectively 44100 and 52919 articles published from 1975

up to 2005 in 363 physics journals. Table 3 gives the number of physicists in France

and Italy, active in 2004‐2005, by gender and rank in the overall sample (before

cleaning) and in our study sample. All the statistics and econometric estimates

reported in the following sections of this paper are obtained from our study

sample.


4.2 Specification and estimation problems and solutions


          Our data constitute an unbalanced panel, where individual physicists are

observed from year T0 to 2005. For most scientists, year T0 coincides with the year

of their first recorded publication; alternatively, for the oldest scientists, year T0

coincides with 1975, the first year for which any publication record is available in

our version of ISI‐Web of Science; finally, for the few MCFs and RUs without any

recorded publication before their known year of recruitment, T0 coincides with the

latter.


          To assess sensibly and with reasonable confidence the effects of the various

determinants of scientific productivity, we have to worry about three major kinds

17   Following a referee’s request, we have also replicated our econometric analysis for the sample

including the “zero‐publications” physicists. Our main results do not change significantly, with the

exception of the estimated effects of the 1980 and 1985 entry waves on productivity and promotion,

which appear to be stronger. The tables showing these results are available on request.


                                                                                                 22
of interrelated specifications errors: selectivity, endogeneity, and unobserved

(correlated) individual heterogeneity. All three are potential sources of estimation

biases, as well as of uncertainty regarding the proper meaning and correct

interpretation of our estimates. We have tried to take of care of them in a specific

and particularly cautious way.


          First, we have considered five productivity regressions, both in terms of

quantity and quality, one for each position in the academic ranking of the two

countries (PR and MCF in France; RU, PA, and PO in Italy); each of these

regression exercises is conducted on the subsamples of physicists who had

reached these ranks in 2004‐2005, restricted to the years after their promotion to

the rank. Our estimated impacts of productivity determinants are thus conditional

on rank. This helps in controlling for selectivity and endogeneity as well as

unobserved heterogeneity of physicists across ranks. We could have tried to

estimate only two productivity regressions, one for each country, with rank as an

explanatory variable (possibly interacted with other explanatory variables). Even

putting aside the difficulty that we do not exactly know the full career history of

professors before they were promoted, this would have been a more risky

alternative, and a more difficult one since rank is endogenously determined and

would have to be instrumented18




18   Of course the interest of this alternative is to be more parsimonious and provide direct estimates

of unconditional impacts. We intend to explore it in future work.


                                                                                                    23
          Second, we estimate three selection probit equations accounting for the

individual physicist probability of promotion from respectively MCF to PR, RU to

PA and PA to PO. These equations are specified jointly with the corresponding

productivity regressions as three generalized Tobit models, one for each of the

professor ranks. To estimate consistently such Tobit models we have simply relied

on Heckman’s two‐step method, where the probit equation is estimated in the first

step, and the productivity equation estimated in the second step including as an

additional explanatory variable in the equation the inverse Mill’s ratio of the

probability of promotion as predicted by the probit equation (Heckman, 1979;

Dubin and Rivers, 1989; Wooldridge, 2002) 19 . Besides providing interesting

information per se on the determinants of promotion, estimating jointly a model of

promotion and productivity helps controlling for selectivity, endogeneity and

unobserved heterogeneity.20



19   Note that while the productivity equations are estimated for the professor subsamples restricted

to the observations after promotion, the promotion probit equations are estimated on all the

observations, both before and after promotion, of these subsamples. We have preferred to use the

two‐step Heckman method to the maximum likelihood, which encountered in some cases

problems of convergence due apparently to our very large number of variables (including in

particular in both the promotion and productivity regressions interactions of cohort of entry and

year dummies, as explained in the next sub‐section).

20   Note that we might have also considered two probit equations accounting for the individual

physicist probability of being recruited as respectively MCF and RU. That was not, however, really

possible because of a much too short history of publications before recruitment (or even none) and


                                                                                                  24
          Last, we also control for individual heterogeneity in both the promotion

and productivity equations by introducing past productivity variables. In our

analysis, individual heterogeneity mainly corresponds to individual characteristics

such as ability and motivation. These are not directly observable, but have a major

impact on individual performance. In so far as these individual characteristics are

mostly permanent, they are bound to be strongly correlated with past productivity.

Thus the presence of past productivity in the promotion and current productivity

equations will take care of the most likely unobserved heterogeneity biases, if not

fully at least to a large extent.21


4.3 The determinants of promotion and scientific productivity


       Table 4 lists all the variables we consider for our econometric exercise. The

latter requires estimating two equations: a selection equation in which the

dependent variable is promotion of the scientist to the present position (PO, PA,

PR), with past scientific productivity as the key explanatory variable; and a


for lack of other background information, such as on graduate studies. Moreover, that also seemed

a priori less relevant than concerning promotion to professor.

21   The standard approach in a panel data setting as ours is to control for permanent unobserved

heterogeneity by including fixed individual effects in the equations. Although we may want to go

back to this approach in future analysis, our first attempts were not promising. The advantage of

our approach here is that past productivity variables largely correct for the likely heterogeneity

biases by picking‐up the correlated components of individual fixed effects, while being more

informative than fixed effects per se and preserving, contrary to them, the relevant cross‐sectional

information in the data.


                                                                                                 25
productivity equation in which the dependent variable is productivity, for all

scientists in the same position. Each estimation exercise of the productivity

equation is run twice, for two different dependent variables that measure

respectively the quantity and quality of the scientific productivity of each

individual scientist:


‐   Quantity: log(1 + number of articles in year t)


‐   Quality: log(1 + average 5‐year impact factor of journals with articles in year t)


                                  [TABLE 4 ABOUT HERE]


       We do not correct the number of articles, and the related quality measure,

by the number of co‐authors of each article; that is, we do not try to capture the

individual scientist’s contribution to the article. We have two reasons for doing so.

First, almost all articles in physics are co‐authored, often by quite a large number

of scientists. Papers written in isolation or by a few authors may be either

theoretical ones or, if applied, they may reflect the isolation of their authors from

the rest of the scientific community, rather than a larger individual contribution.

Introducing arbitrary corrections according to the number of authors would have

meant giving greater weight to theoretical papers or, possibly, to papers by




                                                                                     26
peripheral authors. Instead, we control for the productivity of co‐authors before t,

which we expect to be correlated to the number of papers at time t22.


       The key explanatory variables in both the selection and productivity equation

are related to the scientists’ age, the historical conditions of the academic labour

market at the time of their recruitment or promotion, and time trends in

productivity23. Additionally, promotion is explained by productivity, which enters

the regression through two distinct variables: Quantity flow and Quality flow. These

are the average number of papers published by the scientist between t‐4 and t‐2,

and the related average value of the five year impact factor of journals24. Finally,

promotion is also a function of Academics per year, which is the number of

individuals who achieved promotion in year t.


       Introducing age, cohort, and historical time in the promotion or the

productivity equation creates the identification problem discussed by Hall et al.

(2005). In particular, it is impossible to take simultaneously into account age, time

22   We have also produced a series of ancillary regressions with author‐weighted measures of

quantity and quality, whose results do not differ substantially from those reported in this paper,

and are available on request.

23   It is common knowledge that bibliometric measures of productivity exhibit an increasing trend

over time. Our data do not escape this regularity, both for quantity and quality.

24   Publications in t‐1 are excluded because the recruitment procedure (concorso in Italy or concours

in France) can take many months, up to one year or so. Therefore, some publications appear after a

candidate has filed for the job and are not considered by the commissions relevant for the

appointment.


                                                                                                   27
and birth cohorts, one variable being a linear combination of the other two (age =

year – birth cohort). In line with Hall et al. (2005) we attack this problem by using a

semi‐parametric model in which these effects enter linearly, and are represented

by variables the least affected by identification problems.


       First, we do not consider birth cohorts, but only entry cohorts. That is, our

Cohort dummies refer to the scientists’ years of entry in the academic workforce,

namely the first year in which the individual scientist published an article or, if the

scientist does not have publications before last promotion, the date of last

promotion. This is similar to the approach used by Levin and Stephan (1991)

which define as cohort the year in which a scientist received her PhD. It also

captures more precisely than the year of birth the influence of changes in the

importance of research fields or legislation on a cohort’s productivity. The entry

cohort dummies are interacted with a full set of Period dummies that refer to

calendar years; in other words, our semi‐parametric model includes a dummy

variable for each cohort‐period combination (Cohort x Period).


       In addition, we estimate the impact of being recruited or promoted in 1980

in Italy and 1985 in France. We expect scientists belonging to these recruitment

waves to display, other things being equal, lower productivity levels than

scientists from all other cohorts, due to lack of selective pressure. Notice that the

share of scientists recruited/promoted as RU, PA, and PO in 1980 in Italy and as

MCF and PR in 1985 in France account for respectively 34%, 52%, 19%, 20% and

13% of the observations in the productivity regression samples (see Appendix

                                                                                    28
Table 2 and 3), and therefore they represent a substantial share of the academics

active in 200525. In both the selections and the productivity equation we identify

these scientists with the Wave 1980 and Wave 1985 dummy variables. Besides, in

the selection equation, we control for the ease of entry into academia by counting,

in each year t, the number of scientists promoted in that year and still active in the

same rank in 2005 (Academics per year).


          As for the scientist’s age, we address the above‐mentioned identification

problem by using age groups; more precisely, we introduce in both the selection

and the productivity equations five Age dummy variables, representing ten‐years

age‐intervals of our scientists (see Table 4)26. Our expectation is to find a negative

impact of scientist’s age on productivity (Levin and Stephan, 1991; Hall et al., 2005).

On the contrary, when considered as a determinant of promotion (selection

equation), Age is expected to have a positive impact: the older the scientists, the

higher their chances to be promoted (as in Long, 1993).


          In both the selection and productivity equations we test for gender effects

(Gender=1 for women). In our sample, women represent respectively the 23% and

27% of the French MCFs and Italian RUs. At the same time they are the 7% and 6%


25   It’s worthwhile remarking that we do not have the full career profile of the scientists and

therefore we do not know how many PR, PO and PA ‐ that were promoted after 1980 in Italy and

after 1984 in France – were previously recruited or promoted in the Wave 1980 and in the Wave 1985.

26   We have also tried different specifications using directly the age variable and age squared and

the results do not change substantially.


                                                                                                 29
of the French PRs and Italian POs. The literature typically indicates that women

publish less than men (Levin and Stephan, 1998). However this result often

depends on cross‐sectional data that cannot control for individual heterogeneity.


       Moreover, in both the selection and productivity equations, we control for

the scientist’s specific research fields through a set of dummies reflecting ministerial

classifications of disciplines (Field 28 and Field 30 for France; Field FIS/01, Field

FIS/02, and Field FIS/03 for Italy). We expect the probability to be recruited or

promoted to be field‐specific for two reasons. First, resources to hire new

employees are not distributed homogeneously among all the disciplines. Second,

some disciplines could be more prolific in terms of new discoveries and research

paths, thus attracting more junior scientists. As for productivity, this can also be

affected by the scientist’s specific field of research, due to differences in the

resources needed to produce a paper.


       In order to characterize the work environment in the productivity equations,

we also control for our scientists’ relationship with other members of the scientific

community. First, we consider the past productivity of each scientist’s co‐authors

in year t (Co‐author’s quantity and quality). The co‐authors we consider are only

those who also belong to our sample (that is, we ignore all co‐authors who are

neither French nor Italian physicists for which we have no publication data). Their

overall Quantity and Quality is calculated over the interval [t‐3, t‐1] and divided by

the number of years in the interval. We expect both variables to bear positive

effects on the scientist’s productivity, however measured, to the extent that

                                                                                     30
working contacts with other productive individuals provide access to knowledge

and information27.


           Second, we consider the size and geographical reach of the projects in

which our scientists are involved. We produce four time‐varying and mutually

exclusive dummy variables that summarize information on the number of co‐

authors and their addresses, as reported by the ISI publication records (in this case

we consider all co‐authors, not only the French and Italian scientists)28. In order to

do so we consider the scientist’s publications from t‐3 to t‐1. The variable Large

Project dummy, then, takes value one if the scientist has at least one article (among

this set of lagged publications) with 30 or more authors29. All these large projects

are international, that is for all papers with 30 or more co‐authors, the ISI records

27   In order to avoid endogeneity problems, we do not consider the co‐authors’ publication to which

the observed scientist also contributed.

28   The information on affiliation and related addresses provided by ISI is not precise. For each

publication, in fact, the authors’ names and affiliations are reported in separate fields, with no one‐

to‐one matching between the two. So there is no way to know how many authors of a publication

come from a university or research institute among those listed; but only that at least one authors

comes for sure from such university or institute.

29   The share of articles with 30 or more co‐authors is higher in Italy (8.57%) then in France (5.95%).

Appendix Table 4 shows the percentage of large projects in the two countries and the information

available about the affiliations (addresses) from the ISI database. Moreover, Appendix Table 5

reports the average number of authors (per article) according to a list of 22 nationalities and PROs.

US, German and English scientists are quite frequent co‐authors in Large Projects publications, both

in Italy and France.


                                                                                                     31
report several non‐Italian and non‐French addresses. Alternatively, in case the

scientist’s lagged publications do not come from any large project, we check

whether there is at least one publication resulting from an international project,

although of a smaller scale. As a result the Small_project_with_foreign_co‐author

dummy takes value one if the scientist has no publications with 30 or more

authors over [t‐3,t‐1], but she has at least one publication with at least a foreign co‐

author.


           A third dummy variable, named Small_project_with_only_national_co‐authors

signals that none of the co‐authors has a foreign affiliation30. Finally since in many

cases the information on affiliation and addresses reported by ISI is incomplete,

we control for the possibility that none of the scientist’s articles contains

information on its authors’ affiliation or addresses (Small_project_with_co‐

authors_of_unknown_affiliations dummy). Scientists with no publications over [t‐3,

t‐1] constitute the reference case.


          In order to capture unobserved heterogeneity in the productivity equations,

we control for the scientist’s productivity before promotion, that is the yearly

average quantity and quality since entry year (Quantity before promotion; Quantity

before promotion).




30   This dummy is an approximation since the addresses of the authors are not always reported in

the articles.


                                                                                              32
          Finally, we control for problems arising from data design. First, in the

productivity equation we deal with the left truncation problem due to the

unavailability of information on publications before 1975. To this end, a dummy

variable Promotion before 1975 is inserted, which takes value one for scientists who

reached the present position before the first year of observation. As for the

promotion equation, we simply do not consider observations affected by this

problem. Second, we deal with the presence of zero values in all measures of

quantity and quality when used as explanatory variables by inserting a number of

dummies which take value 1 in case of absence of any publication31.


31   In the promotion equations we include a Zero lagged flow dummy indicating when past quantity

and quality‐productivity are zeros, while in the productivity equations we include a Zeros before

promotion dummy. The reasons for including these two dummies is to allow for some functional

form flexibility without imposing that a strict linearity through the value of zero for the effects of

the corresponding variables which are measured in terms of log(1+x) (i.e., respectively the

Quantity‐productivity lagged flow and Quality‐productivity lagged flow variables and the Quantity‐

productivity before promotion and Quality‐productivity before promotion variables). The reason for the

inclusion in the productivity equations of the Zeros after promotion dummy is different one. It is to

fully abstract from the information that will be conveyed in the estimation of the productivity

equations if we did not include it. It is thus simply equivalent to excluding the physicists with only

zero publications after promotion from our study sample before estimating these equations. We

could have also excluded these few physicists when estimating the promotion equations. Since

these physicists have published one or more articles before promotion, we thought, however,

better to keep them included (and at the same time to use a study sample based on the information

concerning the exact same set of physicists in estimating both types of equations).


                                                                                                   33
      Appendix Tables 1, 2 and 3 report summary statistics for all the regressors,

by rank.




5. Results and discussion

In what follows we comment separately the results from the estimation of the

selection and productivity equations. In the case of RU and MCF we do not see

enough history of the individual to explain the promotion with a probit model. For

example, many RUs and MCFs published very few or no articles before being

promoted to their present rank; and the latter may have been achieved mainly

thanks to the candidates’ graduate work or educational attainments, which we

also do not observe.


5.1 Promotion equation


      Results from the selection equation for Italy and France are reported in

Table 5. Cohort‐period interactions are included in the estimation, but not

displayed. As expected, the promotion probability of both Italian and French

scientists increases with age, which confirms the role of seniority in both academic

systems. Note however that for full professors in both countries (PO in Italy and

PR in France), the estimated coefficient for Age group 5 (that is, for academics who

are more than 60 years old) is smaller than the coefficient for Age group 4. This

suggests a non‐monotonic effect of seniority on promotion probability


                                [TABLE 5 ABOUT HERE]

                                                                                 34
           The positive sign and absolute size of the coefficients for Wave 1980 and

Wave 1985 confirm that in those two years a scientist’s chances of being promoted

were much higher than at any other time in recent history. This result holds

despite we also controlled for the (positive) effect of Academics per year on the

probability of promotion. For example, the estimated marginal effect for Academics

per year in the PO equation suggests that one more PO promoted in year t gives

any (Italian) candidate to the same position 0.23% more chances of success (1.2%

for PA and 0.46% for PR). On top of this, being a candidate to the same position in

1980 meant a 40% higher probability of success (38% also for PA and 18%, in 1985,

for PR). Overall, in 1980, 62 individuals reached the PO position, for a combined

increase in the probability of promotion of around 54%, other things being equal

(40% from the Wave 1980 dummy, plus 62x0.23% from Academics per year).


           The Gender effect is strongly negative in both countries and confirms that,

other things being equal, women in physics face more difficulties than men to be

promoted. Field effects are also significant, with some relevant differences across

ranks.32


           As for productivity, its effect on the probability of being promoted is

captured by the two variables Quality flow and Quantity flow, whose estimated


32   In Italy, promotion to PO appears to be easier in Fisica teorica (Field FIS/02) rather than Fisica della

materia (Field FIS/03, the reference dummy). On the other hand the chances of being promoted to a

PA position are higher in Fisica sperimentale (Field Fis/01). In France, promotion to PR are more

likely in Milieux dilués et optique (Field 30), compared to Milieux denses et matériaux (Field 28).


                                                                                                           35
coefficients differ across countries. In Italy, promotion seems to be affected largely

by quantity, the impact of quality being negligible for promotions to PO but

negative to PA position33. In France quality, but not quantity, affects positively and

significantly the probability of promotion to PR34.


5.2 Productivity equation


           Results from the productivity equations for Italy and France are reported in

Tables 6 and 7. In Table 6 the dependent variable is quantity while Table 7 refers to

quality. As expected, the age of academics has a negative impact on both the

quantity and quality of articles published. In all equations, this is captured by the

age group coefficients, which are all negative and significant (with the exception

of Age group 1) and increasingly larger when moving from Age group 3 to Age group

535.


33   Variables quality and quantity flow are highly correlated

34   Notice that the variable Zero flow is positive and statistically significant in all the selection

equations. At first sight this result looks puzzling, but in fact it depends on the design of the

pooled‐probit exercise. In such exercise the dependent variable is a binary one, which takes value

one from time t onward, for all scientists who are promoted at time t. After t many scientists may

stop publishing altogether, so the value one of the dummy Zero flow is often coupled with unitary

model outcome. This variable should be considered as a control for the zeros and its omission does

not affect the estimates of other regressors.

35   In a separate regression exercise we have tested the effect of age on productivity of Italian PO, in

the absence of controls for participation to large and/or international projects. In this case, the

impact of age on productivity (quantity) appears to be negligible. One interpretation is that PO


                                                                                                      36
                                [TABLE 6 AND TABLE 7 ABOUT HERE]


           Elaborations on the estimated coefficients in Table 6 tell us that over‐60

Italian POs produce around 2.25 articles per year less than their 30‐to‐40 year old

peers. A similar comparison suggests that over‐60 French PR produce 0.65 articles

per year less than their younger peers36. As for quality (Table 7), Italian POs seem

the most affected by age, with over‐60s exhibiting a loss of average impact factor

per year equal to 1.99. Since                we observe the productivity conditional to the

scientist’s ranking in 2005, our estimates capture on one side the life cycle effect, as

discussed in section 4.3; but on the other side, and only for RUs, PAs and MCFs,

they capture the effect of less productive scientists that are not promoted and

remain at lower academic ranks.




suffer of a productivity loss at the individual level, which they compensate by participating to

large international projects.

36   Throughout Section 5 we express the impact of the covariates on quantity (the number of articles)

or quality, (average impact factor) by means of marginal effects, which we compute on the basis of

the estimated coefficients in Tables 6 and 7. The marginal effect of any dummy covariates is given


by: y  e
              R D
                      (e   1) where e R  D is the average predicted value of the model minus the

dummy D effect and             is the coefficient of D. As for the marginal effects of a continuous or

      Gender impacts differently in Italy and in France, and across academic ranks.

With reference to quantity estimates in Table 6, we observe that Italy exhibits a

negative gender effect only for RU: Italian ricercatrici publish 0.27 papers less than

their male peers, per year; on the contrary, women in PA or PO position are not

less productive than their male equivalents. As for France, we observe a negative

gender effect on quantity both for PR and for MCF, where women produce

respectively 0.26 and 0.13 papers less than men, per year. Results for quality are

similar, the women’s gap in average impact factor per year being: ‐0.49 for PR, ‐

0.24 for MCF, and ‐0.39 for RU. In the absence of additional data, we can provide

intuitive explanations for such results. In particular, we notice that, for Italy, the

existence of a gender effect only for the most junior position (RU) is consistent

with the possibility that gender matters more at the early career stages, when

familiar engagements may also be demanding. Thus, a self‐selection process may

take place, by which only the best or most motivated researchers try to access the

higher ranks, at which the gender effect appears to be less remarkable or even not

significant. If this was the correct interpretation, we need then to explain why we

observe a gender effect also at the senior level of French PR. In this respect we note

that women in France are 10% of PR (as opposed to 6% of Italian PO). Moreover,

going back to the selection equation (Table 5), we notice that the negative gender

effect on promotion is smaller for PR relatively to PO. One possibility is therefore

that French women face less difficulties in the promotion to full professorship




                                                                                   38
(thanks, for example, to the first centralized step managed by CNU), which may

explain why we observe the negative gender to persist at the top academic rank.


      The estimated coefficient of the Wave 1980 and Wave 1985 dummies is

negative and significant in the quantity model, for all positions (with the exception

of French PR; see Table 6), while it is still negative, but never significant in the

quality model (with the exception of Italian RU where it is significant and PR and

PA where is positive; see Table 7). As for quantity, POs promoted to such rank in

1980 publish 0.20 articles less per year than other POs. Similarly, PAs and RUs last

promoted in 1980 publish respectively 0.19 and 0.35 articles less per year than

colleagues last promoted in more recent years. The effect for France is still

noticeable, but less pronounced: MCFs who were recruited in 1985 (and never

promoted to PR) produce 0.05 articles less than other MCFs, per year. Bearing in

mind that we do not observe how many scientists, among those who entered the

academic system as RU or MCF in 1980 and 1985, have been subsequently

promoted to higher positions (as opposed to having retired or left Italy), the

interpretation of our results may be as follows: the 1980 and 1985 big recruitment

waves in the two countries filled up the RU, PA, and MCF positions with less

productive scientists, who did not progress much further in their careers, and are

now responsible for the negative signs we observe in Table 6 and (for RU) in Table

7. We can estimate the total scientific productivity loss due to the entry wave of

1980 in Italy, where the effect is stronger, comparing the total number of papers

published by scientists promoted in these entry cohorts, with the estimated

                                                                                  39
number of papers published by scientists from other entry cohorts, other things

being equal. This exercise suggests that the 62 Italian POs promoted in 1980 have

published about 314 articles less than what expected by similar POs from other

cohorts, over the same years of activity. Similar calculations suggest a production

gap of 785 articles by PAs and of 639 articles by RUs from the 1980 wave, for a

total scientific loss of around 1738 articles. Our calculations may under‐estimate

the effects of the massive entry waves, since they are based on a sample which

includes only academics who published at least one article since 1975. A large

share of the French and Italian unproductive scientists, excluded from the

regression sample, comes precisely from the 1985 and 1980 waves [respectively

17% (40/235) and 36.5% (19/52)], so that their inclusion would have increased

further the size of the estimated coefficients for the two wave dummies37.


          These figures suggest that the percentage of unproductive scientists over all

scientists hired during the 1980 and 1985 waves is at least two (for MCF) or three

times higher (for PA and RU) than the same percentage for the rest of the sample38.




37   More precisely, among the Italians hired during the 1980 wave the unproductive PO, PA and RU

are respectively 1.6%, 6.7% and 7.6%. In France 21.9% are MCF and 9.8% are PR. Notice that,

following referee request we rerun all the regression including all scientists with zero publications.

The effect of the waves is confirmed and become even stronger.

38   Another peculiarity of the waves is that in Italy were hired considerably younger academics if

compared to the average age of hiring in other years; this is true also for PR in France but not for

MCF with an average age of 41 instead of the usual age of 32 in other years. In general there are no


                                                                                                   40
       Some descriptive statistics help understanding why the “wave effect”

appears to be stronger in Italy than in France. In Italy, over 10% (62/588) of PO,

26% (166/618) of PA and 14% (73/511) of RU active in 2005 were promoted to such

positions in 1980. In France, only less than 8% (55/705) of PR and 10% (121/1212) of

MCF reached their present position in 1985. In other words, the 1980 wave in Italy

was bigger and produced more enduring effect than its French equivalent. As for

Italian RUs, this effect is also visible for the quality‐based measure of productivity.


       As explained in the previous section, we control for the individuals’

unobservable heterogeneity by means of lagged measures of productivity

(Quantity before promotion and Quality before promotion). As expected, all such

controls bear a positive and significant sign (the only exception being the negative

sign of the impact of past quality‐productivity on current quantity‐productivity in

the case of PO).


       Productive      co‐authors     impact     positively    on    individual     scientists’

productivity. For quantity measures of productivity, estimates in Table 6 suggest

that Italian PO and French PR and MCF produce 0.08, 0.06 and 0.18 extra articles

per year for every additional article produced by their co‐authors over the three

preceding years. The marginal effect of co‐authors’ quality on the scientist’s

quality output per year is positive for all ranks and countries, and it ranges

between 0.37 for Italian RU and 0.53 for PR.

big differences for the gender composition of the academics promoted during the waves except for

the rank of RU where, during the wave were promoted 14% more women (36% instead of 22%).


                                                                                             41
       Involvement in large and/or international projects affects strongly a

scientist’s yearly productivity. This is especially true for Italian POs, where the

dummy Large project produces a marginal effect on quantity of more than 5.5

articles per year. Similar results hold also for PAs and RUs, whose productivity is

increased significantly by participation to Large project (4.40 and 3.43 more articles

per year; the reference group is given by scientists with no publications in the

three years before t). The effect of Large project for France, albeit high if compared

to the effect of other covariates, is weaker than in Italy, the marginal effects for PRs

and MCFs being respectively equal to 4.63 and 3.33. Even quality is affected by

participation to large international projects, with increases in the average impact

factor per year comprised between 3.54 (for MCF) and 9.09 (for PO). Scientists who

are not involved in large projects, but had at least one foreign co‐author in the

three years before t, also have larger quantity and quality scores than the reference

group (but lower than their peers participating to large projects). Italian POs with

dummy Small_project_with_foreign_co‐authors equal to one, for example, publish

2.41 more papers per year than the reference group. On the other hand, POs with

participation to Small_project_with_only_national_co‐authors publish 1.50 papers

more than the reference group. Similar results hold for all position in both

countries.


       Controls for field effects also prove significant. Italian POs belonging to

Fisica sperimentale (Field Fis/01) and Fisica teorica, modelli e metodi matematici (Field

Fis/02) publish respectively 0.46 and 0.65 articles less than colleagues from Fisica

                                                                                      42
della materia (Field Fis/03), per year. The quality of the publications is also lower. In

France, MCFs belonging to Milieux dilués et optique (Field 30) publish more and

higher quality articles if compared to Milieux denses et matériaux (Field 28).


        Tables 6 and 7 show also the estimated inverse Mill’s ratio (lambda)

produced by the Heckman procedure to correct for the problem of selection bias.

Its negative sign means that the probability of not being promoted affects

negatively the individual scientific productivity. The coefficient is significant for

PR, PO and PA in the quantity regressions and for PR and PO in the quality

regressions. Lack of significance for PA in the quality regression means that the

two equations, selection and productivity, could have been estimated separately,

without any kind of correction for endogeneity of the academic rank.




6. Conclusions

       In this paper we have investigated the determinants of scientific

productivity for a sample comprising most of the academic physicists active in

French and Italian universities in 2004‐2005. We have performed this analysis both

conditional on being in an assistant or professorial position (MCF and PR in

France and RU, PA and PO in Italy) and together with a joint analysis of the

determinants of promotion to professor (from MCF to PR in France and RU to PA

and PA to PO in Italy). We consider this approach to be more informative than




                                                                                      43
most alternatives, as well as better at addressing the interrelated econometric

problems of endogeneity, selectivity, and unobserved heterogeneity.


       Our estimates of promotion equations show that the probability of a French

or Italian physicist to be promoted professor increases with age until he/she

reaches his/her sixties. Other things being equal, we also find that such probability

is significantly lower for women. In Italy promotion is influenced by the quantity

of past publications (quantity‐productivity lagged flow), and in France, it is

influenced by their quality (quality‐productivity lagged flow). In both academic

systems we observe big recruitments waves, in 1980 and 1985, which affect

significantly the probability of promotion.


       In the productivity equations we show that the age of academics has a

negative impact on the quantity and quality of articles published by French PR

and Italian PO publications. For the other academic ranks the age effect is mixed

with the other effect of not being promoted, due to the database design. French

MCFs and Italian PAs and RUs are characterized by a strong negative impact of

age.


       As for gender effect on productivity, Italian women at the early stage of

their careers (for example RU) are penalized in their publication activity. However,

if Italian women manage to be promoted to higher ranks, then they publish as

much as their male colleagues. On the contrary, in France we observe a negative

gender effects across all ranks. We find evidence that the work environment is

very important for individual scientists’ productivity. In particular being involved
                                                                                  44
in large projects, or at least having an international collaboration, has a strong and

positive effect on quantity and quality of published articles


      Finally we show that the big recruitment and promotion waves of 1980 and

1985 had negative and lasting effects on the average scientific productivity of the

two countries, especially for Italy. Such big waves came after a prolonged spell

with no recruitment of new scientists and few promotions, and were the result of

policy provisions aimed at providing permanent positions for many scientists

with temporary assignments. Many of the physicists recruited in these years

appear not to have progressed much in their careers, and to have been persistently

less productive than the average physicists of the same rank, recruited or

promoted in other years. Our results on age, gender and past productivity confirm

many of the ones already found in the literature, but our findings on the enduring

negative effects of en masse recruitment in France and, most notably, in Italy are

more original.

Dependent variables in promotion and productivity equations
       Promotion          Step indicator for being promoted in year t(p): =0 if promoted [i.e., t>=t(p)], and =1 if
                          not promoted [i.e., t<t(p)].
  Quantity‐productivity   Logarithm of the numbers of articles published in year t, plus 1
   Quality‐productivity     Logarithm of the average five years impact factor in year t for the journals in which
                            articles have been published in that year, plus 1
Explanatory variables in the promotion equations only:
  Quantity‐productivity   Logarithm of the average number of articles in the three years t‐2,t‐3 and t‐4, plus 1
       lagged flow
   Quality‐productivity   Logarithm of the average five years impact factor of the journals in which articles have
       lagged flow        been published in the three years t‐2, t‐3 and t‐4, plus 1.
     Zero lagged flow     Dummy=1 when Quantity flow=Quality flow=0 (and =0 if not).
    Academics per year      Estimates of the number of academics promoted in year t as PR, PA or PO.

Explanatory variables in the productivity equations only:
  Quantity‐productivity   Logarithm of the average number of articles per year published before the year of
      before promotion    recruitment or last promotion, plus 1
   Quality‐productivity   Logarithm of the average impact factor of the journals in which articles have been
      before promotion    published before the year of recruitment or last promotion, plus 1.
   Co‐authors quantity    Logarithm of the moving average of co‐authors’ number of articles (with other
                          scientists than the author) in the three years t‐1, t‐2 and t‐3, plus 1.
    Co‐authors quality    Logarithm of 1 plus the moving average of average impact factor of the articles
                          published by the co‐authors (with other scientists than the author) in the three years t‐
                          1, t‐2 and t‐3, plus 1.
 Co‐authors quantity and  Dummy=1 when co‐authors quantity is 0 (and=0 if not); and Dummy=1 when co‐authors
        quality zeros     quality is 0 (and =0 if not).
  Co‐authors number and   Large Project Dummy=1 if in the three years before t (t‐1,t‐2 and t‐3) scientists have at
    affiliation dummies   least one article with 30 or more co‐authors (and=0 if not);
                          Small Project with Foreign co‐authors Dummy=1 if in the three years before t (t‐1,t‐2 and t‐
                          3) scientists have no articles with 30 or more co‐authors and have at least one article

Table 4 (continued): Dependent and explanatory variables in promotion and productivity
equations


Explanatory variables in both the promotion and productivity equations:
     Wave 1980/1985       Dummy=1 if academic experienced last promotion in 1980 in Italy or in 1985 in
                          France
        Gender            Gender dummy variable: Female=1, Male=0
   Age group dummies         Dummy= 1 if academic belongs to a specific age class: age group 1 (age<30), age
                             group 2 (30<=age<40), age group 3 (40<=age<50), age group 4 (50<=age<60), age
                             group 5 (age>=60)
            Field            Country specific fields of affiliation of physicists in French and Italian universities.
  (28, 30, FIS01, FIS02,     In France 28= Milieux denses et matériaux and 20= Milieux dilués et optique. In Italy
           FIS03)            Fis01= Fisica Sperimentale, Fis02= Fisica Teorica and Fis03= Fisica Della Materia.
(Year) and (cohort of entry) Interactions between dummies for year of publication and cohort of entry defined
   interactions dummies      as the first year we see the scientist publish (or in case of zero publications before
                             entering or being promoted the year of entry or of promotion)
  Promotion before 1975      Dummy variable for the (small) subset of professors promoted before 1975. The
                             inclusion of this dummy in the productivity equations controls for the fact that the
                             publication history of this subset of professors is unknown between promotion
                             and 1975. Its inclusion in the promotion equations is equivalent to eliminating
                             them in the estimation of these equations (the dependent step indicator of being
                             promoted is always equal to one for them).
