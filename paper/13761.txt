                                              ABSTRACT

Is the 2007-2008 U.S. sub-prime mortgage financial crisis truly a new and different phenomena? Our
examination of the longer historical record finds stunning qualitative and quantitative parallels to 18
earlier post-war banking crises in industrialized countries. Specifically, the run-up in U.S. equity and
housing prices (which, for countries experiencing large capital inflows, stands out as the best leading
indicator in the financial crisis literature) closely tracks the average of the earlier crises. Another
important parallel is the inverted v-shape curve for output growth the U.S. experienced as its economy
slowed in the eve of the crisis. Among other indicators, the run-up in U.S. public debt and is actually
somewhat below the average of other episodes, and its pre-crisis inflation level is also lower. On the
other hand, the United States current account deficit trajectory is worse than average. A critical question
is whether the U.S. crisis will prove similar to the most severe industrialized-country crises, in which
case growth may fall significantly below trend for an extended period. Or will it prove like one of
the milder episodes, where the recovery is relatively fast? Much will depend on how large the shock
to the financial system proves to be and, to a lesser extent, on the efficacy of the subsequent policy
response.

                                          I. Introduction


       The first major financial crisis of the 21st century involves esoteric instruments,

unaware regulators, and skittish investors. It also follows a well-trodden path laid down

by centuries of financial folly. Is the “special” problem of sub-prime mortgages this time

really different?


       Our examination of the longer historical record, which is part of a larger effort on

currency and debt crises, finds stunning qualitative and quantitative parallels across a

number of standard financial crisis indicators. To name a few, the run-up in U.S. equity

and housing prices that Graciela L. Kaminsky and Carmen M. Reinhart (1999) find to be

the best leading indicators of crisis in countries experiencing large capital inflows closely

tracks the average of the previous eighteen post World War II banking crises in industrial

countries. So, too, does the inverted v-shape of real growth in the years prior to the

crisis. Despite widespread concern about the effects on national debt of the early 2000s

tax cuts, the run-up in U.S. public debt is actually somewhat below the average of other

crisis episodes. In contrast, the pattern of United States current account deficits is

markedly worse.

       At this juncture, the book is still open on the how the current dislocations in the

United States will play out. The precedent found in the aftermath of other episodes

suggests that the strains can be quite severe, depending especially on the initial degree of

trauma to the financial system (and to some extent, the policy response). The average

drop in (real per capita) output growth is over 2 percent, and it typically takes two years




                                              2
to return to trend. For the five most catastrophic cases (which include episodes in

Finland, Japan, Norway, Spain and Sweden), the drop in annual output growth from peak

to trough is over 5 percent, and growth remained well below pre-crisis trend even after

three years. These more catastrophic cases, of course, mark the boundary that

policymakers particularly want to avoid.



               II. Post War Bank-Centered Financial Crises: The Data

       Our comparisons employ a small piece of a much larger and longer historical data

set we have constructed (see Reinhart and Kenneth S. Rogoff, 2008.) The extended data

set catalogues banking and financial crises around the entire world dating back to 1800

(in some cases earlier). In order to focus here on data most relevant to present U.S.

situation, we do not consider the plethora of emerging market crises, nor industrialized

country financial crises from the Great Depression or the 1800s. Nevertheless, even in

the smaller sample considered in this paper, the refrain that “this time is different”

syndrome has been repeated many times.

       First come rationalizations. This time, many analysts argued, the huge run-up in

U.S. housing prices was not at all a bubble, but rather justified by financial innovation

(including to sub-prime mortgages), as well as by the steady inflow of capital from Asia

and petroleum exporters. The huge run-up in equity prices was similarly argued to be

sustainable thanks to a surge in U.S. productivity growth a fall in risk that accompanied

the “Great Moderation” in macroeconomic volatility. As for the extraordinary string of

outsized U.S. current account deficits, which at their peak accounted for more than two-

thirds of all the world’s current account surpluses, many analysts argued that these, too,




                                              3
could be justified by new elements of the global economy. Thanks to a combination of a

flexible economy and the innovation of the tech boom, the United States could be

expected to enjoy superior productivity growth for decades, while superior American

know-how meant higher returns on physical and financial investment than foreigners

could expect in the United States.

          Next comes reality. Starting in the summer of 2007, the United States

experienced a striking contraction in wealth, increase in risk spreads, and deterioration in

credit market functioning. The 2007 United States sub-prime crisis, of course, has it

roots in falling U.S. housing prices, which have in turn led to higher default levels

particularly among less credit-worthy borrowers. The impact of these defaults on the

financial sector has been greatly magnified due to the complex bundling of obligations

that was thought to spread risk efficiently. Unfortunately, that innovation also made the

resulting instruments extremely nontransparent and illiquid in the face of falling house

prices.

          As a benchmark for the 2007 U.S. sub-prime crisis, we draw on data from the

eighteen bank-centered financial crises from the post-War period, as identified by

Kaminsky and Reinhart (1999), Gerard Caprio et. al. (2005), and Andrew Mullineux

(1990).

These crisis episodes include:

          The Big Five Crises: Spain (1977), Norway (1987), Finland (1991),

          Sweden (1991) and Japan (1992), where the starting year is in parenthesis.

          Other Banking and Financial Crises: Australia (1989), Canada (1983),

          Denmark (1987), France (1994), Germany (1977), Greece (1991), Iceland




                                              4
           (1985), and Italy (1990), and New Zealand (1987), United Kingdom

           (1973, 1991, 1995), and United States (1984).

           The “Big Five” crises are all protracted large scale financial crises that are

associated with major declines in economic performance for an extended period. Japan

(1992), of course, is the start of the “lost decade,” although the others all left deep marks

as well.

           The remaining rich country financial crises represent a broad range of lesser

events. The 1984 U.S. crisis, for example, is the savings and loan crisis. In terms of

fiscal costs (3.2 percent of GDP), it is just a notch below the “Big Five” 1. Some of the

other 13 crisis are relatively minor affairs, such as the 1995 Barings (investment) bank

crisis in the United Kingdom or the 1994 Credit Lyonnaise bailout in France. Excluding

these smaller crises would certainly not weaken our results, as the imbalances in the run-

sup were minor compared to the larger blowouts.



                                            III. Comparisons

           We now proceed to a variety of simple comparisons between the 2007 U.S. crisis

and previous episodes. Drawing on the standard literature on financial crises, we look at

asset prices, real economic growth, and public debt. We begin in Figure 1 by comparing

the run-up in housing prices. Period T represents the year of the onset of the financial

crisis. By that convention, period T-4 is four years prior to the crisis, and the graph in

    The fiscal costs of cleaning up after banking crises can be enormous. The fiscal cleanup from Sweden’s

1991 crisis was 6 percent of GDP and Norway’s 1987 crisis was 8 percent. Spain’s post-1977 cleanup cost

over 16 percent of GDP. Estimates for Japan’s bill vary widely, with many in excess of 20 percent of GDP.



                                                      5
each case continues to T+3, except of course in the case of the U.S. 2007 crisis, which

remains in the hands of the fates.2 The chart confirms the case study literature, showing

the significant run-up in housing prices prior to a financial crisis. Notably, the run-up in

housing prices in the United States exceeds that of the “Big Five” .

States, the index is the S&P 500; Reinhart and Rogoff, 2008, provide the complete listing

for foreign markets.)

          Once again, the United States looks like the archetypical crisis country, only more

so. The Big Five crisis countries tended to experience equity price falls earlier on than

the U.S. has, perhaps because the U.S. Federal Reserve pumped in an extraordinary

amount of stimulus in the early part of the most recent episode.

                         Figure 3 looks at the current account as a share of GDP. Again, the United States

is on a typical trajectory, with capital inflows accelerating up to the eve of the crisis.

Indeed, the U.S. deficits are more severe, reaching over six percent of GDP. As already

mentioned, there is a large and growing literature that attempts to rationalize why the

United States might be able run a large sustained current account deficit without great

risk of trauma. Whether the U.S. case is quite as different as this literature suggests

remains to be seen.

                         Real per capita GDP growth in the run-up to debt crises is illustrated in Figure 4.

The United States 2007 crisis follows the same inverted V shape that characterizes the

earlier episodes. Growth momentum falls going into the typical crisis, and remains low

for two years after. In the more severe “Big Five” cases, however, the growth shock is

considerably larger and more prolonged than for the average. Of course this implies that

the growth effects are quite a bit less in the mildest cases, although the U.S. case has so

many markers of larger problems that one cannot take too much comfort in this caveat.

              Figure 5 looks at public debt as a share of GDP. Rising public debt is a near

universal precursor of other post-war crises, not least the 1984 U.S. crisis. It is notable

that U.S. public debt rises much more slowly than it did in run-up to the Big Five crisis.

However, if one were to incorporate the huge buildup in private U.S. debt into these

measures, the comparisons would be notably less favorable.

protracted growth slowdown, it should either be considered very lucky or even more

“special” that most optimistic theories suggest. Indeed, given the severity of most crisis

indicators in the run-up to its 2007 financial crisis, the United States should consider

itself quite fortunate if its downturn ends up being a relatively short and mild one.

                                       IV. Conclusions

        Tolstoy famously begins his classic novel Anna Karenina with “Every happy

family is alike, but every unhappy family is unhappy in their own way.” While each

financial crisis no doubt is distinct, they also share striking similarities, in the run-up of

asset prices, in debt accumulation, in growth patterns, and in current account deficits.

The majority of historical crises are preceded by financial liberalization, as documented

in Kaminsky and Reinhart (1999). While in the case of the United States, there has been

no striking de jure liberalization, there certainly has been a de facto liberalization. New

unregulated, or lightly regulated, financial entities have come to play a much larger role

in the financial system, undoubtedly enhancing stability against some kinds of shocks,

but possibly increasing vulnerabilities against others. Technological progress has plowed

ahead, shaving the cost of transacting in financial markets and broadening the menu of

instruments.

        Perhaps the United States will prove a different kind of happy family. Despite

many superficial similarities to a typical crisis country, it may yet suffer a growth lapse

comparable only to the mildest cases. Perhaps this time will be different as so many

argue. Nevertheless, the quantitative and qualitative parallels in run-ups to earlier post-

war industrialized-country financial crises are worthy of note. Of course, inflation is

lower and better anchored today worldwide, and this may prove an important mitigating

factor. The United States does not suffer the handicap of a fixed exchange rate system.

On the other hand, the apparent decline in U.S. productivity growth and in housing prices

does not provide a particularly favorable backdrop for withstanding a credit contraction.




                                               11
           Another parallel deserves mention. During the 1970s, the U.S. banking system

stood as an intermediary between oil-exporter surpluses and emerging market borrowers

in Latin America and elsewhere. While much praised at the time, 1970s petro-dollar

recycling ultimately led to the 1980s debt crisis, which in turn placed enormous strain on

money center banks.3 It is true that this time, a large volume of petro-dollars are again

flowing into the United States, but many emerging markets have been running current

account surpluses, lending rather than borrowing. Instead, a large chunk of money has

effectively been recycled to a developing economy that exists within the United States’

own borders. Over a trillion dollars was channeled into the sub-prime mortgage market,

which is comprised of the poorest and least credit worth borrowers within the United

States. The final claimant is different, but in many ways, the mechanism is the same.

           Finally, we note that although this paper has concentrated on the United States,

many of the same parallels hold for other countries that began experiencing housing price

duress during the 2007, including Spain, the United Kingdom and Ireland. Indeed, as

Appendix Table 1 reminds us for the panic of 1907 and the crash of 1929, the global

dimension of the current crisis is neither new nor unique to this episode. As history has

shown, there can be similarities across unhappy families, too.

Notes: In 1914 alone there are 10 banking crises worldwide, eight of these in advanced
economies. Given the outbreak of a world war, we do not include these as an example of
a global financial crisis episode.
