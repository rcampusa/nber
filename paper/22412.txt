as the aged and youth dependency ratios and income. It has a negative impact in India, where the
bride’s side has to pay substantial dowries to the groom’s side at marriage, but a positive impact
in Korea, where, as in China, the groom’s side has to bear a disproportionate share of marriage-
related expenses including purchasing a house or condominium for the newlywed couple.

1. Introduction




As documented by Wei and Zhang (2011a), Du and Wei (2013), and Golley and Tyers

(2014), the introduction of the one-child policy and other population control measures in

the People’s Republic of China (hereafter China), combined with strong son preference, led

to an increasingly unbalanced sex (or gender) ratio (ratio of males to females) in the

pre-marital cohort.   And in two widely cited papers, Wei and Zhang (2011a) and Du and

Wei (2013) argue that the increasingly unbalanced pre-marital sex ratio, in turn, required

the groom’s side to save increasingly more to ensure his success in an increasingly

competitive marriage market and that this elevated the saving rate of the household

sector as a whole (what they call the “competitive saving motive”).




Wei and Zhang (2011a) and Du and Wei (2013) verify this effect using household-level data

and provincial panel data for China, cross-country data for a sample of about 160

countries, and numerical calibration methods and show that the sharp increase in the

pre-marital sex ratio can potentially explain about 60% of the sharp increase in China’s

household saving rate during the 1990-2007 period (from 16% to 30%) and about half of

both the current account surplus of China and the current account deficit of the United

States (see Wei and Zhang (2015) for a useful survey).




While the “competitive saving motive” may be applicable outside of China given the

unbalanced sex ratios and conventions regarding marriage-related expenses in other

countries, empirical investigations have been limited (but see Horioka (1987) for an

analysis of saving for marriage in Japan).   The purpose of this paper is to contribute to


                                             1
the literature by determining whether or not a similar mechanism has led to a significant

relationship between the pre-marital sex ratio and the household saving rate in India and

the Republic of Korea (hereafter Korea), two countries in which, as in China, sex ratios are

unbalanced and marriage-related expenses are considerable, and to determine whether or

not trends over time in the pre-marital sex ratio can explain trends over time in the

household saving rate in these two countries. In order to accomplish these objectives,

this paper estimates a household saving rate equation for India and Korea using

long-term time series data for the 1975-2010 period, focusing in particular on the impact

of the pre-marital sex ratio on the household saving rate.




To summarize the main findings of this paper, it finds that the pre-marital sex ratio (ratio

of males to females) has a significant impact on the household saving rate in India and

Korea, even after controlling for the usual suspects such as the aged and youth

dependency ratios and income.     It has a negative impact in India, where the bride’s side

has to pay substantial dowries to the groom’s side at marriage, but a positive impact in

Korea, where, as in China, the groom’s side has to bear a disproportionate share of

marriage-related expenses including purchasing a house or condominium for the

newlywed couple.    The findings of the paper imply that trends in the pre-marital sex ratio

can explain trends in the household saving rate during the first half of the sample period

but not during the second half in both countries and that the level of the pre-marital sex

ratio can partly explain the high level of Korea’s household saving rate but not the high

level of India’s household saving rate.




                                             2
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows:                 Section 2 contains a theoretical

discussion of the impact of the pre-marital sex ratio on the household saving rate, section

3 presents and discusses data on trends over time in the pre-marital sex ratio and the

household saving rate in India and Korea, section 4 presents the estimation model used in

this paper, section 5 discusses the data sources used, section 6 presents the estimation

results, and section 7 summarizes, concludes, and explores the policy implications of our

findings.




2. Theoretical Considerations




In this section, we discuss the theoretical impact of the sex (male-to-female) ratio of the

pre-marital cohort on the household saving rate (this exposition is based on

Grossbard-Shechtman (1993), Wei and Zhang (2011a), Du and Wei (2013), and Grossbard

(2015)).1     If the pre-marital sex ratio is unbalanced, families with a child who belongs to

the overrepresented gender will presumably increase their saving in order to ensure that

their child is able to secure an “attractive” spouse, especially if the custom in that country

is for families with a child who belongs to the overrepresented gender to bear a

disproportionate share of marriage-related expenses. At the same time, families with a

child who belongs to the underrepresented gender may or may not reduce their saving due

to the presence of two mutually offsetting effects.               On the one hand, they may reduce

their saving because of their favorable bargaining position in the marriage market, but on

the other hand, they may increase their saving to ensure that their child does not suffer an

1   See Lafortune (2013) for a very similar analysis of the impact of sex ratios not on the household saving
rate but on pre-marital educational investments and Wei and Zhang (2011b) for a very similar analysis of

the impact of sex ratios on the occupational choice of parents.

                                                      3
erosion of his or her bargaining power vis-à-vis his or her spouse (assuming that the

relative wealth levels of the two sides affects the relative bargaining power of the husband

and wife vis-à-vis one other after marriage). Thus, families with a child who belongs to

the overrepresented gender will unambiguously increase their saving, but it is not

immediately clear whether families with a child who belongs to the underrepresented

gender will increase or decrease their saving and whether the saving of the household

sector as a whole will increase or decrease, on balance.




However, Du and Wei (2013) show that a higher pre-marital sex ratio will unambiguously

raise the saving rate of the household sector as a whole for at least two reasons.     First,

families with a child who belongs to the overrepresented gender will save more not only

because of the child’s disadvantaged position in the marriage market but also because they

know that families with a child who belongs to the underrepresented gender will save less

due to the child’s advantaged position in the marriage market and want to compensate for

the reduced saving from the other side.   Thus, the increase in the saving of families with

a child who belongs to the overrepresented gender will more than offset the decrease in

the saving of families with a child who belongs to the underrepresented gender.      Second,

the more unbalanced the pre-marital sex ratio is, the higher will be the proportion of the

pre-marital cohort that needs to save more for marriage due to its disadvantaged position

in the marriage market.




These theoretical considerations generate the prediction that the saving rate of the

household sector as a whole will be lowest when the pre-marital sex ratio is balanced and

that it will be higher, the more the pre-marital sex ratio is unbalanced in either direction.


                                             4
In other words, the pre-marital sex ratio will have a negative impact on the household

saving rate if the pre-marital sex ratio is below the biologically normal sex ratio of 1.05 to

1.06 and a positive impact on the household saving rate if the pre-marital sex ratio is

above this threshold.   However, as shown later, the pre-marital sex ratio is unbalanced in

favor of males (exceeds the 1.06 threshold) in both India and Korea (except in Korea

during the 1975-1983 period).     This implies that we would expect the pre-marital sex

ratio to have a positive impact on the household saving rate in both countries because the

groom’s side will have to save more and more as the pre-marital sex ratio increases and

brides become in increasingly short supply.




However, the foregoing discussion ignores the issue of which side bears the brunt of

marriage-related expenses, and it is to this issue that we now turn.     Since the custom in

China is for the groom’s side to bear a disproportionate share of marriage-related expenses

including purchasing a house or condominium for the newlywed couple, this in turn bid up

the cost of securing a bride, led families with sons to save more than before, and caused

the overall household saving rate to increase over time.     Similarly, in the case of Korea,

the bride’s side is expected to pay a (cash) dowry and to pay for the furnishings of the

newlywed’s home, but the groom’s side is expected to return half of the dowry and to pay

for the newlywed’s home, which has become a more and more onerous burden over time

due to the rapid rise in housing prices (see Onishi (2007)).     Thus, wedding customs in

Korea are very similar to those in China, with the groom’s side being expected to bear a

disproportionate share of marriage-related expenses, and moreover, housing prices have

increased sharply in Korea, as they have in China, thereby further increasing the groom




                                              5
side’s burden.2




By contrast, in the case of India, the bride’s side must pay enormous dowries to the

groom’s side.      According to Anderson (2007), dowries are paid in 93 to 94% of cases in

India and amount to 4 to 6 times annual male income, 7 to 8 times annual per capita

income, and 68% of total household assets before marriage, and the amount of dowries

increased at the phenomenal rate of 15% per year during the 60-year from 1921 until 1981.

The Dowry Prohibition Act was enacted in 1961 and it was further strengthened in 1983

and 2005, but the payment of dowries is still common in many parts of India and the

aforementioned laws are primarily concerned with preventing and punishing the cruel

treatment, harassment, and even murder of brides in connection with dowry demands

rather than with the payment of the dowry itself.             Thus, the situation in India is the

opposite of that in China.




If the social custom is for the groom’s side to bear a disproportionate share of

marriage-related expenses (as in China and Korea), the positive impact of the pre-marital

sex ratio on the household saving rate will be actualized because the groom’s side has to

save for marriage-related expenses even when the pre-marital sex ratio is balanced and

will have to save even more for marriage-related expenses if the pre-marital sex ratio is

unbalanced and they are disadvantaged in the marriage market.




By contrast, if the social custom is for the bride’s side to bear a disproportionate share of

2   Note, however, that there is an endogeneity issue here, with the higher housing prices in China and

Korea being caused in part by the increased demand for housing caused by the unbalanced pre-marital

sex ratio (see, example, Wei, Zhang, and Liu, 2015).

                                                       6
marriage-related expenses (as in India), the positive impact of the pre-marital sex ratio on

the household saving rate may not be actualized because it is the bride’s side that bears

the burden of marriage-related expenses, and even if the pre-marital sex ratio increases

(the ratio of grooms to brides increases), the groom’s side will not necessarily have to save

any more than before for marriage-related expenses despite their disadvantaged position

in the marriage market.    Indeed, as the pre-marital sex ratio increases, the shortage of

brides will become increasingly acute, which in turn might bid down dowries, reduce the

marriage-related saving that the bride’s side has to do, and thereby reduce overall

household saving.   Thus, the impact of the pre-marital sex ratio on the household saving

rate is theoretically ambiguous, but it could well have a negative impact on the household

saving rate, the opposite result from countries such as China and Korea where the groom’s

side bears a disproportionate share of marriage-related expenses.




To summarize, even though the pre-marital sex ratio is unbalanced in favor of males in

both India and Korea, we would expect the impact of the pre-marital sex ratio to be

different in the two countries due the differences in social customs regarding which side

bears the brunt of marriage-related expenses. We would expect the pre-marital sex ratio

to have a positive impact on the household saving rate in Korea where the groom’s side

bears a disproportionate share of marriage-related expenses, and it could well have a

negative impact on the household saving rate in India, where the bride’s side bears a

disproportionate share of marriage-related expenses.

3. Data on Pre-Marital Sex Ratios and Household Saving Rates in India and Korea




In this section, we present data on the sex ratio of the pre-marital cohort and the

household saving rate in India and Korea during the 1975-2010 period.




In India, the average age at first marriage was 22.7 for males, 17.7 for females, and 20.2

for both sexes in 1971 and 26.0 for males, 22.2 for females, and 24.1 for both sexes in 2011

(all data were taken from Medindia, 2016), and thus the average age at first marriage for

both sexes presumably averaged about 22 during the 1975-2010 period as a whole. By

contrast, in Korea, the average age at first marriage was much later--26.7 for males, 22.8

for females, and 24.75 for both sexes in 1966 and 32.2 for males, 29.6 for females, and 30.9

for both sexes in Korea in 2013 (the data for 1966 were taken from Lapierre-Adamcyk and

Burch (1974) while the data for 2013 were taken from Statistics Korea (2013)), and thus

the average age at first marriage for both sexes presumably averaged about 28 during the

1975-2010 period as a whole.    We therefore define the pre-marital cohort as the 10 to 19

age group in India and the 15 to 24 age group in Korea, reflecting differences in the

average age at first marriage in the two countries, and calculate SEXRATIO (the sex ratio

of the pre-marital cohort) as the ratio of males to females for the 10 to 19 age group in the

case of India and for the 15 to 24 age group in the case of Korea.      It would have been

preferable to use a different definition of the pre-marital cohort in each year to reflect

increases over time in the average age at first marriage in the two countries, but we were

not able to do so because the population data are available only for 5-year age groups.

Moreover, it would have been preferable to take account of the age difference between

males and females at first marriage (about 4 to 5 years in India and about 3 to 4 years in


                                             8
Korea), but we were not able to do so for the same reason.




Figures 1-1 and 1-2 show data on trends over time in SEXRATIO (the pre-marital sex ratio,

the ratio of males to females) in India and Korea, respectively, during the 1975-2010

period, taken from United Nations (2016), and as can be seen from these figures, this ratio

was relatively stable in India during this period, fluctuating in the 1.080 to 1.103 range.

It showed a slight downward trend during the 1975-93 period, declining from 1.094 in

1975 to 1.080 in 1993, remained stable at 1.080 during the 1993-98 period, and showed a

slight upward trend during the 1998-2010 period, increasing from 1.080 in 1998 to 1.103

in 2010.      In Korea, by contrast, the pre-marital sex ratio showed a sharp upward trend

throughout the 1975-2010 period, increasing from 1.045 in 1975 to 1.127 in 2010. There

are at least two possible explanations for this trend.     One is the increasing availability

and/or affordability of sex determination technology (ultrasonography and amniocentesis)

and sex-selective abortions (see Guilmoto (2009) and Du and Wei (2013)), and the other is

that the sharp decline in fertility, combined with strong son preference, caused parents to

care more about the gender of any given child (see Golley and Tyers (2012) for a discussion

of the population control policies that were largely responsible for the sharp decline in

fertility).




Note that the biologically normal sex ratio at birth is 1.05 to 1.06 (105 or 106 males for

every 100 females).      Thus, the sex ratio in both India and Korea is higher than the

natural ratio (except until 1983 in Korea), as it is in many, if not most, Asian countries (see

Guilmoto (2009) for comparative data on sex ratios at birth for a large number of Asian

countries), suggesting that parents have a strong preference for sons in both countries.


                                              9
Parents presumably operationalized their preference for sons via female infanticide in

earlier times (observed in some northern Indian states such as Delhi, Haryana, and

Rajasthan) and by sex-selective abortions (made possible by sex determination technology

such as ultrasonography and amniocentesis) in more recent times. 3                           The crucial

difference between India and Korea is in trends over time, with Korea showing a much

more pronounced upward trend in its sex ratio throughout the period of analysis for the

reasons noted earlier.




Turning to data on the household saving rate, we defined HHSR (the household saving

rate) as the ratio of net household saving to net household disposable income, where net

household saving is calculated as the difference between net household disposable income

and household consumption) (see section 5 for data sources).                 Figures 2-1 and 2-2 show

data on HHSR for India and Korea, respectively, during the 1975-2010 period, and as can

be seen from these figures, India’s household saving rate has shown a long-term upward

trend over time, increasing from 9.6% in 1975 to 26.9% in 2010.                    By contrast, Korea’s

household saving rate has been highly volatile over time, fluctuating between 0.4% in

2002 and 26.0% in 1988 but generally high (above 10%) until 1999 and generally low

(below 10%) thereafter.




We now compare trends over time in the pre-marital sex ratio to trends over time in the

household saving rate in India and Korea.             In the case of India, the pre-marital sex ratio

and the household saving rate showed opposite trends during the 1975-96 period, with the

3   Indeed, Chen, et al. (2013) find using variations across counties in China that access to ultrasound had

a significant impact on sex ratios at birth, with 40-50% of the increase in sex ratios at birth in China

being due to improved access to ultrasound.

                                                     10
former showing a downward trend and the latter showing an upward trend, whereas they

showed similar trends during the 1996-2010 period, with both of them showing upward

trends.   Since we hypothesized that the pre-marital sex ratio may have a negative impact

on the household saving rate in the case of India, trends in the pre-marital sex ratio may

be able to explain trends in the household saving rate during the 1975-96 period but not

during the 1996-2010 period.




In the case of Korea, the pre-marital sex ratio showed an upward trend throughout the

1975-2010 period but the household saving rate was volatile during this period.     Since we

hypothesized that the pre-marital sex ratio will have a positive impact on the household

saving rate in the case of Korea and since the household saving rate showed an upward

trend during the 1975-78, 1980-88, 1997-98, 2002-04, and 2008-09 periods, trends in the

pre-marital sex ratio may be able to explain trends in the household saving rate during

these periods but not during other periods.




However, we cannot be certain about the impact of the pre-marital sex ratio on the

household saving rate in the two countries unless we conduct a rigorous regression

analysis and control for the impact of other factors.   It is to this type of analysis that we

turn in the remainder of this paper.




4. Estimation Model




In this section, we discuss the estimation model we use in our econometric analysis of the

determinants of household saving rates in Korea and India.         We start with the most


                                              11
commonly used specification deriving from the life cycle/permanent income hypothesis

that posits that the household saving rate is a function of the age structure of the

population, income levels, corporate saving, etc. and add to it the pre-marital sex ratio

(see, for example, Modigliani (1970), Feldstein (1977, 1980), Modigliani and Sterling

(1983), Horioka (1989, 1997), Edwards (1996), Higgins (1998), Loayza, et al. (2000), Chinn

and Prasad (2003), Luhrman (2003), Bosworth and Chodorow-Reich (2007), Horioka and

Wan (2007), Kim and Lee (2008), Park and Shin (2009), and Horioka and

Terada-Hagiwara (2012) for more details; Fafchamps and Pender (1997), Kochar (1999),

and Athukorala and Sen (2004) for papers on India; and Hurd (1995), Kwack and Lee

(2005), and Park and Rhee (2005) for papers on Korea).




Thus, the estimation model we use is as follows:




(1)          HHSR(t) = a0 + a1*DEP(t) + a2*AGE(t) + a3*SEXRATIO(t) + a4*PCY(t) +

      a5*CORPSAV(t) + a6*POP1519(t) + a7*TREND(t) + e(t),




where HHSR = the household saving rate (defined as the ratio of net household saving to

net household disposable income)

        DEP = the youth dependency ratio, defined as the ratio of the young population (the

population aged 0 to 14 in the case of India and the population aged 0 to 19 in the case of

Korea) to the working-age population (the population aged 15 to 59 in the case of India

and the population aged 20 to 64 in the case of Korea)

        AGE = the aged dependency ratio, defined as the ratio of the aged population (the

population aged 60 and older in the case of India and the population aged 65 and older in


                                             12
the case of Korea) to the working-age population

      SEXRATIO = the sex ratio (the ratio of males to females) of the pre-marital cohort

(defined as the 10 to 19 age group in India and the 15 to 24 age group in Korea, for the

reasons explained earlier).

      PCY = per capita real net household disposable income

      CORPSAV = the ratio of net corporate saving to net household disposable income

      POP1519 = the ratio of the pre-college population (the population aged 15 to 19) to

the working-age population (the population aged 20 to 64) (included only in the case of

Korea for the reasons given below)

      TREND = a time trend

      e = an error term




DEP and AGE are meant to capture the impact of the age structure of the population and

are included in virtually all aggregate saving rate regressions.   The life cycle hypothesis

predicts that both coefficients will be negative since the aggregate household saving rate

should be lower, the higher is the ratio of the dependent (young or aged) population to the

working-age population.       The dependent and working-age populations are defined

differently in India and Korea to reflect differences in college entrance rates (higher in

Korea than in India) and retirement ages (later in Korea than in India).




Turning to the other explanatory variables, one would expect the coefficient of PCY to be

positive since households should be able to afford to save more if their income levels are

higher, and one would expect the coefficient of CORPSAV to be negative if households see

through the corporate veil and reduce their own saving in response to increases in


                                            13
corporate saving.




Yet another demographic variable of possible importance in societies that place value on

education is POP1519 (the ratio of pre-college children (the population aged 15 to 19) to

the working-age population (the population aged 20 to 64)).           More specifically, in a society

in which college expenses are high, one would expect parents with pre-college children to

save for their children’s college expenses and therefore that the aggregate household

saving rate will be higher, the higher is the share of parents with pre-college children.          By

contrast, in a society in which pre-college expenses such as the expenses of cram schools,

private tutoring, etc., are high, one would expect parents with pre-college children to have

to draw down their savings in order to pay for such expenses and therefore that the

aggregate household saving rate will be lower, the higher is the share of parents with

pre-college children (see Horioka (1985) for an analysis of saving for education in Japan).

This variable was included only in the case of Korea because its coefficient was not

significant when included in the regressions for India, perhaps because educational

expenses are not as important in India as they are in Korea, which in turn may be due

partly to the fact that the practice of sending pre-college students to cram schools, hiring

private tutors for them, etc., is far less common in India and partly to the fact that a much

lower proportion of the young go to college in India.4         As of 2010, 39.8% of the population

aged 25 and above had completed tertiary level education in Korea whereas the

corresponding figure for India was still only 9.1%, according to data from Barro and Lee

(2016).

5. Data Sources




In this section, we describe the data sources from which our data were taken.




National accounts data for Korea on the net saving and net disposable income of

households and non-profit institutions serving households and net corporate saving

(needed to calculate HHSR, PCY, and CORPSAV) were taken from Organisation for

Economic Co-operation and Development (2016), while similar data for India were taken

from CEIC data manager, WEB (New York, N.Y.), which in turn were taken from Central

Statistics Office (2016).




In both countries, PCY was calculated by dividing net household disposable income by

total population, then deflating by the price deflator for private consumption expenditure.

In the case of India, the price deflator was obtained by dividing nominal private

consumption expenditure by real private consumption expenditure using data from

Central Statistics Office (2016).   In the case of Korea, the price deflator was taken

directly from Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (2016).




DEP, AGE, SEXRATIO, and POP1519 were calculated using data taken from United

Nations (2016).




                                            15
6. Estimation Results




In this section, we present our estimation results.




6.1. Time Series Properties of the Variables




We tested the variables used in our analysis for unit roots using the Dickey-Fuller test,

Augmented Dickey-Fuller test, KPSS test, and Zivot-Harvey test (see Dickey and Fuller

(1979), Kwiatkowski, et al. (1992), Zivot and Andrews (1992), and Harvey, Leybourne, and

Taylor (2013)).   The detailed test results are not shown due to space limitations, but we

found that all of the variables used in our analysis are non-stationary.      In particular,

most or all tests showed that HHSR, PCY, and CORPSAV are I(1) and that DEP, AGE,

SEXRATIO, and CREDIT are I(2) or I(3) in the case of India.     Similarly, most or all tests

showed that HHSR, CORPSAV, and CREDIT are I(1), that SEXRATIO and FINA are I(1)

or I(2), that DEP and AGE are I(2) or I(3), and that the degrees of integration of PCY and

POP1519 are not clear in the case of Korea. Thus, there is a real danger that ordinary

least squares will lead to spurious correlations, and the use of cointegration techniques is

clearly warranted.




6.2. Results of the Tests for Cointegration




We tested for cointegration using the Engle-Granger test (Engle and Granger (1987)), the

KPSS test (Kwiatkowski, et al. (1992)), and the Johansen test (Johansen (1988, 1991) and

Johansen and Juselius (1990)).   Looking first at the results of the Engle-Granger test and


                                               16
the KPSS test (see Tables 1-1 and 1-2), the results for all specifications for both countries

indicate the presence of cointegration, implying the presence of a long-term relationship

among the variables.




Turning to the results of the Johansen test (not shown due to space limitations), the trace

test as well as the maximum eigenvalue test indicate the presence of cointegration in both

countries for all specifications.   As for the number of cointegrating vectors, the trace test

as well as the maximum eigenvalue test indicate the presence of 2 to 5 cointegrating

vectors in the case of India and 2 to 4 cointegrating vectors in the case of Korea.   A priori

we would expect to find only one cointegrating vector and it is well-known that the

Johansen test will lead to an upward bias in cointegrating rank in small samples (see, for

example, Cheung and Lai (1993) and Johansen (2002)).             Thus, when estimating the

cointegrating vector, we constrained the number of vectors to be one.




6.3. The Determinants of Household Saving Rates in India and Korea




In this subsection, we present our estimates of the cointegrating vector, which shed light

on the determinants of the household saving rate in India and Korea.          The results for

India are shown in Table 2-1, and as can be seen from this table, the coefficient of

SEXRATIO is negative and significant in both variants, as expected.               As for the

coefficients of the other variables, the coefficients of AGE and DEP are negative and

significant, as predicted by the life cycle hypothesis, the coefficient of PCY is positive and

significant, as expected, the coefficient of CORPSAV is negative and significant, as

expected, and the coefficient of TREND is negative and significant, indicating a downward


                                               17
trend in the household saving rate.




The results for Korea are shown in Table 2-2, and as can be seen from this table, the

coefficient of SEXRATIO is positive and significant in every variant, as expected.     As for

the coefficients of the other variables, the coefficient of DEP is always negative and

significant, as expected, but the coefficient of AGE is always positive and significant in all

but one variant, contrary to expectation.     Perhaps this is because Koreans continue to

save even after retirement because they are risk-averse (and concerned in particular about

longevity risk) and/or because they want to leave a bequest to their children.            The

coefficient of PCY is positive and significant, as expected, the coefficient of CORPSAV is

positive and significant, contrary to expectation, the coefficient of POP1519 is negative

and significant, presumably because the cost of cram schools, private tutoring, and other

expenses of pre-college students lowers the saving rate of households with pre-college

children, and the coefficient of TREND is negative and significant, indicating a downward

trend in the household saving rate.




Thus, the results are highly satisfactory, in general, and provide support for the life cycle

hypothesis in both India and Korea, and in particular, the coefficient of SEXRATIO has

the expected sign (negative in India and positive in Korea) and is always significant in

both countries.   This suggests that the “competitive saving hypothesis” of Wei and Zhang

(2011a) and Du and Wei (2013) applies not only in China but also in India and Korea and

that unbalanced pre-marital sex ratios elevate the household saving rate.




We turn now to the implications of our findings for whether trends over time in the


                                             18
pre-marital sex ratio can explain trends over time in the household saving rate in India

and Korea.      Looking first at the case of India, the negative impact of the pre-marital sex

ratio on the household saving rate implies that the downward trend in the pre-marital sex

ratio until 1993 can explain the upward trend in the household saving rate until 1993 but

that the upward trend in the pre-marital sex ratio after 1998 cannot explain the

continuing upward trend in the household saving rate after 1998.5




Looking next at the case of Korea, the positive impact of the pre-marital sex ratio on the

household saving rate implies that the upward trend in the pre-marital sex ratio

throughout the 1975-2011 period can explain the upward trend in the household saving

rate until 1998 but not the downward trend therein after 1998.6




Turning next to whether the level of the pre-marital sex ratio can explain the level of the

household saving rate in India and Korea, the fact that the pre-marital sex ratio has a

negative impact on the household saving rate in India and the fact that the India’s

pre-marital sex ratio is higher than average imply that India’s household saving rate

5   If the coefficient of the pre-marital sex ratio became positive after 1998, the upward trend in the

pre-marital sex ratio after 1998 would be able to explain the upward trend in the household saving rate,

but when we tried introducing an interactive term between SEXRATIO and a dummy variable that

equals one for all years after 1997 and zero otherwise, we found that the coefficient of SEXRATIO not

only remained negative after 1997 but that its absolute magnitude increased even further.


6   If the coefficient of the pre-marital sex ratio became negative after 1998, the upward trend in the

pre-marital sex ratio after 1998 would be able to explain the downward trend in the household saving

rate, but when we tried introducing an interactive term between SEXRATIO and a dummy variable that

equals one for all years after 1997 and zero otherwise, we found that the coefficient of SEXRATIO not

only remained positive after 1997 but that its absolute magnitude increased even further.



                                                   19
should be lower than average. Thus, India’s pre-marital sex ratio cannot explain India’s

higher than average household saving rate.




Turning to the case of Korea, the fact that the pre-marital sex ratio has a positive impact

on the household saving rate and the fact that Korea’s pre-marital sex ratio was below

average until 1983 and above average thereafter implies that her household saving rate

should have been below average until 1983 and above average after 1983.            Thus, the

pre-marital sex ratio can explain the high level of Korea’s household saving rate during

the 1984-2000 period but not the high level thereof before 1984 nor the low level thereof

after 2000.




As for the impact of the age structure of the population, since DEP was found to have a

negative impact on India’s household saving rate, the steady decline in DEP during the

period of analysis can help explain the steady increase in India’s household saving rate

during this period.   AGE was also found to have a negative impact on India’s household

saving rate, but since it increased only slowly during the period of analysis, it did not have

an appreciable impact on trends over time in India’s household saving rate during this

period, and India’s household saving rate showed a steady increase despite the slight

downward pressure exerted on it by the slow increase in AGE.




In the case of Korea, both DEP and AGE exerted upward pressure on the household saving

rate during the period of analysis because DEP declined over time and has a negative

impact on the household saving rate while AGE increased over time and has a positive

impact on the household saving rate.    Thus, trends in the age structure of the population


                                             20
can explain the upward trend in Korea’s household saving rate during the 1975-78,

1980-88, 1997-98, 2002-04, and 2008-09 periods but cannot explain trends in Korea’s

household saving rate during other periods.7




7. Conclusions




In this paper, we estimated a household saving rate equation for India and Korea using

long-term time series data for the 1975-2010 period, focusing in particular on the impact

of the pre-marital sex (or gender) ratio (the ratio of males to females) on the household

saving rate.      To summarize the main findings of the paper, it found that the pre-marital

sex ratio has a significant impact on the household saving rate in both India and Korea,

even after controlling for the usual suspects such as the aged and youth dependency ratios

and income.        It has a negative impact in India, where the bride’s side has to pay

substantial dowries to the groom’s side at marriage, but a positive impact in Korea, where,

as in China, the groom’s side has to bear a disproportionate share of marriage-related

expenses including purchasing a house or condominium for the newlywed couple.                          The



7   Finally, we estimated an error correction model to analyze the short-run dynamics of household saving

behavior.    The results are not shown in detail because they were not very satisfactory, but we provide a

brief summary here.     In the case of India, virtually none of the coefficients including that of the error

correction term were significant.   In the case of Korea, the coefficient of the error correction term was

negative and significant in some cases, indicating some tendency to return to equilibrium after a

deviation.   None of the other coefficients were consistently significant, and moreover, their signs were

almost always contrary to expectation.    These results suggest that the variables included in the analysis

cannot adequately explain short-run household saving behavior, which is not surprising because most of

the variables included in the analysis are variables that would be expected to have a longer-term impact

on household saving behavior.



                                                    21
findings of the paper imply that trends in the pre-marital sex ratio can explain trends in

the household saving rate during the first half of the sample period but not during the

second half in both countries and that the level of the pre-marital sex ratio can partly

explain the high level of Korea’s household saving rate but not the high level of India’s

household saving rate.




In sum, unbalanced pre-marital sex ratios combined with excessive and asymmetric

marriage-related expenses have distorted the saving behavior of households in both

countries. Du and Wei (2013) conduct a welfare analysis using numerical calibration

methods and show that, in China, the welfare of males decreases while that of females

increases and that social welfare (the sum of the welfare of all males and all females)

decreases as the sex ratio increases.   Thus, the welfare of males as well as social welfare

could be increased by bringing the sex ratio back into balance in Korea, where marriage

customs are similar to those in China, and conversely in India, where marriage customs

are the opposite of those in China.




Another policy implication relates to saving-investment imbalances and current account

imbalances.   Wei and Zhang (2011a) and Du and Wei (2013) show that more than half of

the increase in China’s household saving rate was due to the sharp increase in the

pre-marital sex ratio and that about half of China’s current account surplus was due to her

unbalanced sex ratio. Similarly, saving distortions caused by unbalanced sex ratios may

very well affect saving-investment imbalances and current account imbalances in India

and Korea as well.




                                             22
A related policy implication of our results relate to the so-called worldwide saving glut.

Our results imply that the imbalanced sex ratios in India and Korea are causing India’s

household saving rate to be lower than it would be otherwise and Korea’s household

saving rate to be higher than it would be otherwise.    Thus, the net impact of imbalanced

sex ratios on worldwide saving is ambiguous.




Turning finally to how to reduce or eliminate the distortions in household saving behavior

caused by unbalanced pre-marital sex ratios in the first place, there are at least 3 possible

ways: (1) to eliminate son (or daughter) preference, (2) to relax or abolish population

control measures, and (3) to reduce excessive and asymmetric marriage-related expenses.




There is a long tradition of son preference in Asian societies because the eldest son

traditionally carries on the family line or the family business, and it is therefore not easy

to weaken this long-held tradition.   However, Das Gupta, et al. (2009) argues that Korea

did precisely that through direct policy measures although Hvistendahl (2011) disputes

this claim (see Golley and Tyers (2014)), and thus weakening son preference is a

potentially effective way of eliminating the distortions in household saving behavior

caused by unbalanced sex ratios.




Turning to population control measures, they have been implemented in many developing

countries as a way of keeping population growth down and raising living standards, but

the most extreme example is the one-child policy in China (see Golley and Tyers (2012) for

an excellent overview of population control measures in China and India).       Relaxing or

abolishing population control measures would enable parents to have the desired number


                                             23
of children and, at the same time, eliminate the distortions in household saving behavior

caused by unbalanced sex ratios, thereby enabling two birds to be killed with one stone.

The Chinese government’s relaxation of its one-child policy in rural areas and certain

cities in the early 1980s (see Golley and Tyers (2012)) and its sudden decision to abolish

the one-child policy altogether starting in 2016 are examples of policies that weakened or

abolished population control measures.




Finally, the marriage customs that led to excessive and asymmetric marriage-related

expenses have a long tradition and hence would be hard to change, but abolishing such

customs would reduce the financial burden on parents of newlyweds and, at the same time,

eliminate the distortions in household saving behavior caused by unbalanced sex ratios,

thereby enabling two birds to be killed with one stone.   India’s efforts to prohibit dowries

via legal means is one example of such a policy.




Moreover, policies to weaken son preference and policies to reduce excessive and

asymmetric marriage-related expenses would also lead to greater gender equality, which

in turn would lead to a decline in sex-selective abortions and infanticide and in the

dowry-related harassment and even murder of women, and hence would be beneficial for

that reason as well.




Thus, policies to eliminate son (or daughter) preference, to relax or abolish population

control measures, and to reduce excessive and asymmetric marriage-related expenses are

highly beneficial because they would not only eliminate the distortions in household

saving behavior caused by unbalanced sex ratios but also because they would allow


                                            24
parents to have the optimal number of children, reduce the financial burden of

marriage-related expenses, and achieve greater gender equality.
