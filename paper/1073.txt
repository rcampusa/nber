                                ABSTRACT

      This working paper presents Chapter 7 of a book to be published for the

 National Bureau of Economic Research by the University of Chicago Press. The

point of the book is to compare taxes on income from capital in four countries,

accounting for corporate, personal, and property taxes, and including national,

regional, and local level taxes. We describe statutory tax rates and other

tax rules in each country and calculate overall effective marginal tax rates

for different combinations of asset, industry, source of finance, and ownership

categories.

     This chapter compares effective tax rates in the four countries for

different assets, industries, sources of finance, and ownership categories.

Differences in overall effective tax rates among countries are attributed to

differences in rates of inflation, actual depreciation, tax parameters, or

differences in the amount of capital in each combination.   For each country,

we plot the effect of inflation on overall tax rates, and we plot the distri-

bution of different effective tax rates at a given rate of inflation. We

further investigate the sensitivity of results to assumptions about inflation

and interest rates.

             In early 1979, Martin Feldstein suggested that the general approach of

 Mervyn King's Public Policy and the Corporation (1977) could be used to measure

 effective marginal tax rates on a comparable basis for several different

 countries. Our feeling was that the existing studies had employed different

 methodologies thus making inter—country comparisons a hazardous task. We

 decided to launch a study based on a common methodo1or which might help to shed

 light on the significant economic differences among the tax systems in four

 major economies which have experienced differing degrees of economic success,

the U.S., U.K.   ,   West Germany and Sweden. In this book we report the results of

this enterprise which was undertaken with the combined financial and human

resources of the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) in Cambridge,

Massachusetts, the Institute for Economic Research (IFO) in Munich, West

Germany, and the Industrial Institute for Economic and Social Research (iui)    in
Stockholm, Sweden. In addition, we gratefully acknowledge financial support

from the National Science Foundation under grant numbers SES791120 and

SES8O25J40.

         Our first meeting was held at NBER in August, 1979. This meeting

included Helnut Laujner    and Willi Leibfritz from IFO in Germany, Gunnar Eliasson
and Jan S6dersten from IUI in Sweden, Mervyn King and John Flemxning from

Britain, and several U.S. economists including Alan Auerbach, David Bradford,

Larry Dildine, Martin Feldstein, Don Fullerton, Charles NcLure, John Shoven, and

Lawrence Summers. Subsecjuent meetings were held in Stockholm, June 1980, in

Munich, November 1980, in Cambridge, August 1981, at the London School of

Economics,   January 1982, and again in London in June 1982. We received valuable
comments and assistance from participants at each of these meetings.

         In particular, although all authors participated in the writing of the

whole manuscript, we would like to acknowledge the primary efforts made with

respect to each chapter. The U.K. chapter was written primarily by Mervyn King

of the University of Birmingham and NBER, by Michael J. Naldrett of the

University of Birmingham and later of Princeton University, and by

James Poterba of Nuf field College, Oxford and NBER. We received invaluable

assistance from E. B. Butler, R. N. Elliss, J. King, and P. Penneck of the

Inland Revenue, from H. I. Armitage of the Central Statistical Office, and from

J. S. Flemxning and J. rding of the Bank of England.

         The chapter on Sweden was written primarily by Thomas Lindberg of IUI

and by Jan Sódersten of IUI and the University of Uppsalla, Sweden. We are

especially indebted to Vi1J.y Berstrxn, Gran Normann Rbck and Rolf Rundfelt

for valuable assistance and helpful comments. Contributions were also made by

Ragnar Bentzel, Christen Herzen, Sven—Olof Lodin, Gustav Sandstrin, and

Leif Sundberg.

         Primary authors of the chapter on Germany were Willi Leibfritz of IFO

and Julian Alvorth of the Bank for International Settlements in Geneva,

Switzerland. We are especially grateful to Heinz Ludwig of IFO for research

assistance. Other helpful comments and assistance were received from Hans—Georg

Jatzek, Josef Krner, and Stephan Teschner. We are also grateful for statisti-

cal help from Christa Bronny and Christian Wagner, and from the

Deutsche Bundesbank and the Statistisches Bundesaurt.

         Don Fullerton was the primary author of the U.S. chapter, though fre—

quent assistance was provided by Yolanda K. Henderson. At several points during
                                                                      Preface, p3


 our progress, we received help from Alan J. Auerbach, Larry L. Dildine,

 Daniel Feenberg, Martin Feldstein, Barbara M. Frauineni, Roger H. Gordon,

 Dale W. Jorgenson, Lawrence B. Lindsey, Charles E. McLure, John B. Shoven,

 Nartin A. Sullivan, and Lawrence H. Summers.

          Mervyn King had primary responsibility for the introductory Chapters 1

and 2, and he began the computer programniing with Michael Naldrett at the

University of Birmingham. Later, computer work was undertaken at Princeton

University by Don Fullerton, Michael Naldrett, and Thomas Kronmiller. Fullerton

had primary responsibility for authorship of Chapter 7. Tables for that chapter

were drawn up by Thomas Kronmiller, and t.vid Bradford, also at Princeton,

kindly contributed his efforts as the primary author of our concluding chapter.

Particular mention xaist be made of Don Fullerton7s efforts to produce results

for each country from the Princeton computer according to a tight schedule.

         Again, although we wish to credit these responsibilities for each

chapter, we also wish to emphasize that this book is a joint product and is not

a collection of separately authored papers. All authors participated in the

drafting and redrafting of the manuscript and in the development of a common

view as to how best to tackle the problem we set ourselves.

         Finally, we would like to express our thanks for remarkable efficiency

and patience to those who typed various parts of the manuscript, Ingrid Hensel,

Alice Pattersson, Jenny Saxby, Judy Weinberger, Michael Wickhain and Maja Woxen,

and to Annie Zeuiner of NBER and Liz Johnson of Chicago University Press for

making life as easy for the authors as it is possible for a publisher to do. A

last word of thanks must go to Randall Mrck who organized and shepherded the

preparation of the final manuscript.

                          Comparisons of Effective Tax Rates


           One of   the main purposes of our stuy is to examine the variations in

effective   tax rates among the four countries, and to explain the nin reasons
for these differences. A summary of the main results for each country was pre-
sented above in the appropriate chapter. In      this chapter we analyze the results

more fully, placing particular emphasis on comparisons across countries (section

7.1). Such comparisons help to place the results for any one country in per-

spective, and to shed light on some key relationships such as the impact of

inflation on effective tax rates. As we shall see, this impact differs signifi-

cantly from one country to another (section 7.2). We shall also examine the

extent to which differences in tax rates are attributable to differences in the

tax   systems   or to differences in the importance of particular industries,

assets,    sources of finance and owner (section   7.3).

           In   addition to these basic questions, we examine the sensitivity of the

estimated tax rates to the values of p (in the fixed—p case) and r (in the

fixed—r   case) at which they are evaluated (section 7.1.).    One aspect of this

issue is that,    at different inflation rates, we evaluate the tax rates at
constant   average net of personal tax rates of return. The question of how sen-

sitive our results are to this assumption is tackled in section 7.5. Finally,

for each ccAintry we calculate the distribution of effective marginal tax rates.
 7.1 Corparin Results under Standard Assunmtions

         Let us first suirmarize the results with the standard parameters for
 each country. Thble 7.1 shows effective tax rates in the fixed—p case for the
 four    countries. From   the final    row of Table 7.1 we see that the highest overall

 effective marginal tax rate is the 148 percent rate in West Germany, followed by

 37   percent   in the U.S., 36   percent   in Sweden, and only 14   percent   in the U.K.

 The overall rate for each country is an average of the effective              marginal tax
 rates   for the 81 combinations, weighted by the proportion of capital in each

 combination. These weights, together with all 1980 input parameters for each

 country, are shown in Appendix A, and the matrices of tax rates for different

combinations and inflation rates in the four countries are given in Appendix B.

            Each row in Table 7.1 shows a weighted average tax rate for a subset of

combinations. For example, the first row shows the average tax rate over all

combinations which include machinery. From this row we can see that immediate

expensing   of machinery is a major reason for the low overall          rate in the U.K.
The   effective tax rate on machinery is minus 37 percent, while other assets are
taxed at over 39 percent. Britain has the lowest total tax on machinery and the
highest    share of machinery in its capital stock.1        Sweden's exponential depre-
ciation   of machinery at a 30 percent annual rate for tax purposes is con-

siderably more than the 7       to   20 percent rates which we estimate for economic

depreciation. This accelerated depreciation plus the 11 percent investment

grant mean that the total corporate and personal tax wedge on machinery in

Sweden is zero. A limited degree of accelerated depreciation plus a 10 percent

grant in the U.S. imply       that   the total tax on machinery is 18 percent, while tax

lives of 11 years and only 2 percent credits in Germany          result   in a tax rate on

machinery of 145   percent.    The   effective tax   rate on investment in buildings is

strikingly similar in all four countries, with rates ranging from 36              to   143
                                                                       Chapter 7.1, p.'

percent. The row for inventories demonstrates the ijrjortance of inflation
accounting, since the lower tax rates are in the U.K. and U.S., where FIFO
accounting is    not obligatory for tax    purposes, while 59   and 69 percent tax rateB

are   found   in Germany and Sweden where half of inventories and all     of inventories

are on FIFO accounting, respectively.

           Looking   at the industry breakdown in the U.K. ,    th tax rate for manu-
facturing is    lowest   because of the   high weight on machinery and because that

industry   receives extra grants for machinery. The "other industry" category,
although qualifying for lower grants, has a higher relative weight on machinery.
The more interesting aspect of the industry breakdown, however, is that in
Germany and Sweden the tax rate in "other industry" is higher than the overall
rate, and in the U.K. and U.S. it     is   lower than the overall rate. The low U.S.
rate reflects the availability of investment tax credits for both machinery and
buildings in utilities. The higher tax rates in Germany and Sweden reflect
larger weights on buildings which receive less generous depreciation allowances
and lower grants.
           In the breakdown by source of finance, the U.K. again provides the most
striking contrast. Debt—financed investments are heavir subsidized, since
assets receive accelerated or immediate depreciation, while corporate interest
payments   are fully deductible from taxable incon. Investment        financed   by new
share   issues receives a small subsidy because of the tax credits for dividends

afforded by the iutation system of corporation tax Only investment projects

financed by retained earnings are taxed at positive rates in Britain.
                                                                    Chapter 7.1, p.3

 In all four countries tax deductibility of interest payments keeps down the tax

 rate on debt finance. Because of the imputation system both in Germany and the

 U.K., the tax rate on projects financed by new share issues is lower than that

 on projects financed by    retained   earnings. In Sweden and the U.S., in contrast,

 the relative positions of the two sources of equity finance are reversed,

 because of a classical system of corporation tax.

            Finally, Table 7.1 shows effective tax rates by ownership category.

 These rates reflect the differences in personal rates on interest and dividends

 in each country which are shown in Appendix A. Households in Sweden and Germany

 have particularly high personal tax rates, and effective marginal tax rates on

projects financed directly from households are 105 and 71 percent, respectively.

In Germany, however, tax—exempt institutions do not receive refunds of dividend
tax   credits or   withholding taxes, so that only in Germany is the tax wedge posi-

tive for projects financed by tax-.exenipt institutions.

            In other countries tax—exempt institutions are subsidized because their

receipts of income are tax—free and the corporations in which they invest

receive deductions for interest payments, accelerated
                                                           depreciation, investment
grants,   and in certain cases credits for dividends paid. The position of
Insurance   companies Is rather different. Although they are, on average, sub-

sidized in Britain and Germany, they are taxed at positive rates in Sweden and

the U.S. We discovered that in all four countries the taxation of insurance

conanies was an extremely conlex matter. The effective tax rate depends cri-

tically on special provisions, such as the possibility of making tax—free allo—

cations to reserves, which imply that the tax may be quIte different from the

statutory corporate rate applying to insurance conanies, and can increase

rapidly with inflation as we shall see in Section 7.2.
                                                              Chapter 7.1, p.4



        The tax rates shown in Table 7.1 refer to projects all of which are

assumed to earn a pre—tax rate of return of 10 percent per annum. These figures

give some idea of the incentives provided by the tax schedule but do not tell us

what revenue we would expect to collect at the margin corresponding to a small

increase in the capital stock as a whole. This is because we might expect pro-

jects to be pushed to the point at which all projects yield the same rate of

return before deduction of personal taxes. This arbitrage equilibrium we call

the fixed—r case. It gives greater weight to the nxre highly taxed com-

binations, because it is these combinations which require a higher pre—tax rate

of return in order to generate funds to pay the given market rate of return.

The results for the fixed—r case are shown in Table 7.2. As untioned above,

the weighted—average tax rates in Table 7.2 wIll generally be larger than those

in Table 7.1 for the fixed—p case.2 The overall marginal tax rates in the

fixed—r case are 30 percent in the U.K., 50 percent in the U.S., 5 percent in

Sweden, and 65 percent in West Germany.

         Although the absolute values of the tax rates shown in Table 7.2 are

higher than those in Table 7.1, the patterns of variations of tax rates both

among countries and across combinations remain the same. Investment in machin-

ery is subsidized in the U.K., pays virtually no tax in Sweden, and is taxed at

higher positive rates in the United States and especially in West Germany. Tax

rates on investments in inventories are highest in Sweden and Germany.

Investment in the U.K. is taxed less heavily in manufacturing than in other

industries, whereas in the United States manufacturing pays a higher tax rate

than other sectors of the economy.

         It is clear that investment financed by borrowing is much less heavily

taxed than that financed by equity. In three of the four countries, such
                                                                       Chapter 7.1, p.5


projects are subsidized, and in the exception, Sweden, they receive a tax rate

of    only   11.5 percent. In Britain the subsidy is sufficiently large that the

required     pre—tax rate of return, necessary   to generate a 5 rate of
                                                                   percent
return before personal taxes to savers, is actually negative. Thus the factor
income net of depreciation which would be produced in arbitrage equilibrium is
negative, and the use of this factor incorre as the denominator of an estimated
tax rate would     produce figures with a sign opposite to that corresponding to our

intuition.      The tax wedge on debt finance    in the U.K. is   negative, and in Table
7.2   the implied tax rate would be positive because of the        negative pre—tax rate
of return. Hence this figure is omitted. One advantage of reporting the
results in the form of the implied tax wedge (p—s) is that the sign of the wedge
always corresponds to the impact of the tax system on the incentive to save and
invest.
             Finally, there are substantial differences in the effective tax      rates
levied    according to the identity of the provider of the funds for the project.

Tax-exempt institutions receive a net subsidy in all countries except Germany,

whereas      in all four countries projects financed directly by households pay
extremely high tax rates.

7.2 Effects of Inflation on I4arginal Tax sates

           Section   of each country chapter provides estimates of tax rates for

inflation rates of zero, ten percent per annum, and the estimated actual infla-

tion rate during the period 1970—1979. In this section we investigate more

systematically the effect of inflation on marginal tax rates. Figure 7.1 shows

the overall effective marginal tax rates in the fixed—p case for inflation rates

varying from 0 to 15 percent. The figure illustrates some major differences

among   the four countries. In particular, overall marginal tax rates in Germany
and the U.S. are rather insensitive to the rate of inflation, whereas in Sweden
and   Britain the tax rate is much more dependent on the inflation rate. But the

influence of inflation is in oposite directions for the latter two countries.

At zero inflation both countries have an overall marginal tax rate of around 13

percent, but as inflation increases the tax rate rises in Sweden and falls in

the U.K.

           In order to discuss Figure 7.1 and the different net effects of infla-

tion in each country, it is useful first to summarize four separate effects of

inflation that mit operate in any one country. First, a marginal investment

in 1980 typically has future depreciation allowances that are based on histori

cal cost (the 1980 purchase price for the asset). Since inflation reduces the

real value of these fixed nominal deductions, it tends to increase effective tax

rates. As inflation increases further, however, the real value of depreciation

allowances falls at a reduced   rate: only               rate of inflation does
                                             at an infinite

the   real value of these deductions approach zero. For this reason, the effect
of   historical cost depreciation becomes less important with successive increases

in the rate of inflation. It is also less important in Britain where machinery

receives immediate expensing and hence inflation has no effect on the vector of

such allowances.
                                                                     Section 7.2, p.2


             Secondly, inflation increases the nominal interest rate. Where nominal

 interest payments are deductible from the corporate income tax,     inflation   tends
 to increase these deductions and decrease the overall tax. At the same time,

 where nominal interest receipts are included in the personal income tax base,

 inflation tends to increase these receipts and increase the overall tax. In

 combination, since the corporate rate is greater than the personal rate averaged

 over investors in st of our countries, inflation tends to decrease overall

 taxes.


           Thirdly, inflation increases the nominal value of inventories.    Under
FIFO inventory accounting, taxable profits are measured by the difference bet-

ween nominal sales price and nominal costs.      Thus, for given real ngnitudes,
inflation tends to increase taxable nominal profits and increase the effective

tax rate. This effect depends on the proportion of assets held as inventories.

           Fourth3r, tax rules for insurance cozianies can exacerbate the effects
of   inflation. In the U.S. and   Sweden, insurance cocanies are allowed deduc-
tions for reserves that are based on fixed nominal interest rate assumptions.

As inflation increases nominal interest receipts, it reduces the real value of

deductions for reserves. The entire addition to the nominal return is taxed,

even if it is needed to meet reserve obligations. As a result, inflation tends

to   increase the effective tax rate proportionateJr.
          These   four effects of inflation operate in different directions and
with different magnitudes in each country, but the total effects are shown _n
Figure 7.1. In Germany, for example, the tax rate starts at 145 percent with no
inflation. It tends to increase because of historical cost depreciation and
inventory accounting, but it   tends   to decrease because of nominal interest
deductions   at a corporate rate that exceeds the personal rate. The net effect
                                                                   Chapter 7.2, p.3


is positive at first, but the effect of historical cost depreciation diminishes

with further inflation. Nominal interest deductions become relatively more

inortant at a 5 percent rate of inflation, and further inflation reduces the

total tax.

          The same general story applies to the U.S., except that the effect of

FIFO inventory accounting is replaced by the effect of nominal reserve allow-

ances for insurance coxanies. Taxes increase with inflation, but at a dimi-

nishing rate as the effect of historical cost depreciation diminishes. The

curve becomes almost flat at high rates of inflation, where the tax—increasing

effects of insurance rules are almost exactly offset by the tax—reducing effects

of nominal interest deductions at a corporate rate which exceeds the personal

rate.

          All four effects operate in the same direction for Sweden. First,

depreciation is allowed on a historical cost basis. Secondly, nominal interest

is taxed at a personal marginal rate of 49 percent, a rate which exceeds

the corporate rate. (Sections 2.5 and 4.3 of Chapter 4     find   that the effective

corporate rate in Sweden was 35 percent in 1980.) Thirdly, Sweden requires FIFO

inventory accounting. Fourthly, insurance companies are allowed only a fixed

nominal return for reserves. The combination of these four effects for Sweden

itself is dramatic, but the contrast with Britain in Figure 7.1 is tremendous.

Nominal   interest   in Britain is deducted at the 52 percent corporate rate, and it

is received by households with a 28 percent rate, tax—exempt institutions, or

insurance conpanies with a 17 percent rate. This effect swamps that of his—

torical cost depreciation. Although some buildings in Britain receive delayed

depreciation   at historical cost, other assets are expensed. Inflation does not
operate   to increase taxes through inventories or insurance companies. As a
                                                                   Chaper 7.2, p.14


result, overall taxes start at about 13 percent of the pre—tax return, they fall

with inflation, and they keep falling as inflation increases.

            Figure 7.1 does not show differential effects of inflation among. coin—

binations in each country. To investigate differences among assets, industries,

financial sources, or owners, we start with tax rates for zero inflation in

Table 7.3. These tax rates for each country are taken from the zero—inflation

column of the first table of results in each country chapter. The columns for

the U.K. and Sweden demonstrate that these two countries not Ofli start at the

same overall 13 percent effective tax rate with no inflation, they also start

with very similar tax rates on particular combinations. Machinery is subsidized

in both nations, because of acceleratedor immediate depreciation, and other

assets    are taxed. Debt is subsidized   in both nations, because of interest

deductions   at the corporate level, and other sources of finance are taxed. Tax—
exextt institutions are subsidized,    and households are taxed.

           There,   however, the similarity ends. Table 7.14 shows, for each
combination in each country, the differential effect of inflation. Each entry
shows the addition (or subtraction) to the tax rate in that combination for an
increase of inflation from 6 percent to 7 percent. Almost all of the entries

for the U.K. are negative and a1nst all of the entries for Sweden are posi-
tive. One percentage point of inflation reduces British taxes by one per-
centage point for machinery, by 5 points for debt, and by 3 points for tax—

exempt institutions. The one point of inflation raises Swedish taxes by14

points for inventories, by 14   points for insurance companies, and   by 5 full

points for households. It even increases the tax rate on debt by 2 percentage

points.
                                                                   Chapter 7.2, p.5


           Finally, we might also be interested in the variance of the effects of

inflation within each categorization. Among owners in the U.S., for example,

an extra point of inflation adds 5 points to the tax rate on insurance companies and

subtracts 4.5 points from the tax rate on exeiit institutions. This difference

of 9.5 points is larger than the difference among owners in any other country.

Britain has the smallest difference among owners. Among sources of finance,

Germany has the largest differences (—5.1 for debt and +3.7 for retained ear-

nings, for a difference of 8.8), and Sweden has the smallest difference. Among

industries, Gernny has the largest differences, and Britain has the smallest.

Finally, among assets in each country, Sweden has the largest differences, and

Britain the smallest. Thus, we conclude that while inflation reduces overall      -




taxes   in Britain, it does so on a comparatively regular basis.
 7.3 Differences Among   the   Four Countries

          While the U.S., U.K., Sweden, and Gerny show obvious differences in

 the tax treatments of different assets, they differ also in the relative amounts

 of each asset. The weighted—average tax rates differ for both of these reasons.

Secondly, while we have found clear differences in the way inflation affects tax

rates in each country, we have also found different actual rates of inflation.

Tax rates differ for both of these reasons as well.   Finally, while new invest-

ments receive different grants and allowances in each country, thej also have

different actual rates of depreciation. They thus have differences in the rates

at which reinvestment qualifies for new grants and allowances. This section

investigates how much of the overall tax rate differences are attributable to

tax law and how much are due, instead, to differences in the measured weights,

inflation rates, or actual depreciation rates.

         To perform thib decososition, we first recalculate tax rates in all

countries, using their own parameters everywhere except for a common set of

weights. We recalculate tax rates again with own parameters everywhere except

for a common inflation rate, and then with own parameters except for a common

set of actual depreciation rates. Finally, we recalculate tax rates in all

countries using their own tax parameters, but using common weights, inflation

rates, and actual depreciation rates.

         The choices for the common weights, inflation rates, or depreciation

rate are essentially arbitrary. We might select the weights or rates from any

one of the four countries, or we might apply to each country an average et of

weights or rates. We do not wish to introduce a fifth set of weights, however,

even if it is an average of the four coutries, because such parameters would not

reflect any actual experiences. Instead, we select U.S. weights and rates for

the standard of comparison.
                                                                       Chapter 7.3, p2


           Table 7.5 reflects   results of the first simulation which attempts to
answer two questions. First, what would be the effective rginal tax rates in
each country if they all had the U.S. mix of assets, industries, sources of

finance,   and owners? Secondly, or conversely, how     much of   existing tax rate
differences are attributable to different weights on each category? If all
countries   provided the same relative tax treatments to different assets,

industries, sources, or owners, then we would not expect taxes to cause dif—

ferences    in the distribution of capital among those components. If relative tax
treatments differ, however, then we might     expect   substitution among production
processes to allow relatively more use of a particularly      tax—favored asset, more

output of a tax—favored industry, more finance through a tax—favored source, or

more savings channelled through a pension fund, insurance company, or other par-

ticularly tax—favored    ownership category. Since there are these differences
among countries, we might expect the switch to a common set of weights in each
case to put less weight on particular tax—favored investments, and thus       to raise

the   overall average tax rate.
           The fourth column of Table 7.5, for the U.S., is identical to that of

Table 7.1. Since weights for the U.S. have not changed, the overall rate is

still 37 percent in the fixed—p case. The overall rate for Britain, however,

has increased from 3.7 to 11.6 percent. This overall change results primarily

from the fact that the U.S. has a much lower weight for machinery than does the

U.K. where machinery is subsidized. It is somewhat offset by the fact that the

U.S. has more weight on debt, which Britain also subsidizes.

           The overall tax rate in Sweden increases from 36 to 8 percent when

U.S. weights are employed. Zero—taxed machinery is given less weight, low—taxed
                                                                            Chapter 7.3,   p.3


 debt is given rruch less weight, and the highj.y—taxed households are given rela—
 tively more weight. Moreover, because U.S. statistics include more privately
 owned utilities in the other industry category, this highly—taxed sector is also
 assigned more weight with the U.S. proportions. In West Germany, the overall
 tax rises from 143 to 58 percent when U.S. weights are exrloyed. Again, the
 other industrial sector plays a major role, because it is the most highly taxed
 sector     in Germany, and its weights are the largest in the U.S. Also, debt

 changes from a net subsidy to a tax, because relatively more of it is held by

 households in the U.S. Individual
                                            coronents can be further investi-
 gated by considering the individual country weights as shown in Appendix A.

              Thus, as expected, overall tax rates of all countries increase when
common      weights were exr1oyed. The differences, however, remain intact. The
spread      actually increases from 1414   percentage points (the difference between 148.1
for    Germany and 3.7   for   the U.K.) to 146   percentage points (the difference
between 57.5 and 11.6 for the same two countries). According to these experi-

ments, then, differences in weights by themselves do not account for any of the
Overall tax rate differences.

             Next, we turn to inflation. How xrmch of the actual tax rate differ-

ences would remain if all countries had the same rate of inflation? This

question can be answered by looking at the zero inflation column of each

country's 1980 results table (brought together in Table 7.3),          or   by looking at.
the    ten percent column of each 1980 results table. For consistency, in Table
7.6,   we   look at the tax    rates that would exist in each   country with 6.77 percent
inflation, the actual U.S. rate of inflation.
                                                                          Chapter 7.3, p.14


           Again   tax rates in the   U.S.   are the same   as   they were before. Tax
rates in   other countries rise or fall, as can be seen from Figure 7.1. Since

taxes in Britain fall with inflation, and since 6.77 percent is less than the

actual U.K. rate, the 3.7 percent tax rate in Table 7.1 rises to an 8.9 percent

rate in Table 7.6. This overall change incorporates smaller subsidies on machi—

nery, debt, and tax—exempt institutions, as well as higher positive taxes on

other categories. Since taxes in Sweden rise with inflation, and since 6.77 is

less than the actual Swedish rate, the 35.6 percent tax rate in Table 7.1 falls

to a 29.5 percent rate in Table 7.6. Finally, note that the Figure 7.1 tax rate

curve for Germany reaches its highest point at a 5 percent rate of inflation and

then starts to decline. Since we change the German inflation rate from 14.2 per-

cent to 6.77 percent, the overall tax rate is hardly affected. The flatness of

that curve incorporates offsetting effects, however, so there is a higher tax on

inventories and a lower tax on debt.

           According to these experiments, then, some of the actual tax rate dif-

ferences can be attributed to inflation rate differences. The 1414 point spread

in Table 7.1 falls to a 39 point spread in Table 7.6 (147.9           for Germany minus 8.9
for   the U.K.). This conclusion is not robust, however, as can be seen from

Figure 7.1. For any two countries in that diagram, tax rates become more simi—

lar if we choose one common inflation rate and less similar if we choose a dif-

ferent common inflation rate.

           Finally, we ask, how imich of the differences in tax rates may be attri-

buted to differences in actual depreciation rates? We have two reasons for

addressing this question. First, we want to isolate differences attributable

solely to tax law. Of course, the tax law can induce producers to alter the

maintenance or type of particular assets enloyed. Secondly, each of our
                                                                       Chapter 7.3, p.

  country chapters uses its own procedures to derive estimates of actual depre-

  ciation. These methodological differences might contribute to apparent effec-

  tive tax rate differences.

           Table 7.7 shows calculations for all countries when we
                                                                  use only U.S.
 depreciation rates. As shown in Appendix A, these rates for buildings are

 greater than those for Britain and Sweden but less than those for Germany. The

 U.S. rates for machinery
                            are approximately in the middle of those for other

 countries but depend on industrial location.      Substitution of these parameters
 serves to reduce the overall tax rates
                                           in Britain and Germany and slightly
 increase that in Sweden. The spread between the low rate of Britain and the

 high rate of Geriny is
                          essentially unchanged.
          While these factors sometimes
                                          greatly affect individual combinations,
 we conclude that none has a
                               major impact on the differences in overall tax rates
among countries. In Table 7.8, however, we take all of these factors together

and calculate effective tax rates when all countries have the
                                                              same weights,
inflation rates, and depreciation rates. Because these factors are not addi-

tive, they have more of an iact together than they do separately. Taken

together, these factors increase the tax in Britain for two reasons: we use

less weight on Britain's subsidized machinery, and we use a lower rate of infla-

tion. The overall rate in the U.K.
                                      increases from 3.7 to 18.9 percent, while
that on Germany only increases from 48.i   to   52.6   percent.   The spread thus falls
form      to 33.7 percent. These remaining differences can be attributed solely
to tax law.

         All the above calculations
                                      referred to the fixed—p case. In Table 7.9
we show consarable calculations for the fixed—r case. When all countries have

all of their own paraxrters,
                               fixed—r tax rates vary between the 30 percent rate
                                                              Chapter 7.3, p.6


for l3ritain and the 65 percent rate for Geriiny (as shown in Table 7.2). When

all countries have their own tax paraneters but U.S. weights, depreciation and

inflation, fixed—r tax rates vary between !2 percent for Britain and almost 70

percent for Sweden (as shown in Table 7.9). The spread thus falls from 35

points to 28 points. Changes in the individual coronents of any countrd can be

explained by arguments similar to those for the fixed—p case above.
7.1 nsitivity to Assuied Fats of Retum
        in general, the xasured effective tax rate depends on the assumed
value for p or r in the fixed-p or fixed—r calculations. Are our estirntes
relatively robust to these choices, or do they depend greatly on the assumed

rate of return? This section discusses the possible reasons for this dependence

and then calculates different effective tax rates for different rates of return.

            In   a linear system, the tax is a constant fraction of the pre—tax
return. Thus the tax rate is independent of the pre—tax or post—tax rate of
return. In general, however, tax systems are not linear. The tax rate depends
on the present value of depreciation allowances, which depend nonlinearly on the
rate of return used for discounting. The importance of this point justifies
some algebraic elaboration. In chapter 2, equation (2.23) provides a coipli—

cated expression for the pre—tax return (p) as a function of the corporate tax

rate (T), the firm's discount rate (p), the depreciation rate (6), the present

value of allowances (A), and other parameters. in order to focus on the rain

issue, and to abstract from unnecessary corlications, we consider the case with

LIFO accounting (v=O), no corporate wealth taxes (w=o), and no inflation (iC,

or,   equivalently, colete indexation for inflation). In this simple case,

(2.23)    reduces   to


                    =    ___ (6)    - 6   .                                   (7.1)

Also in   chapter 2, equations (2.2I) to (2.27) provide expressions for the firm's

discount rates when finance is obtained by debt, new share issues (NSI), and

retained earnings (RE). If we take a classical corporate tax system (0=1) and

ignore capital gains taxes (z=O), then these equations reduce to


                  DEBT =   r(l—t)
                  NSI =    r                                                  (7.2)

                  RE =     r(l—m)
                                                                                Chapter 7., p.2


where m is the personal tax rate. The real interest rate r is equal to the

nominal   rate I    ,   since inflation is assumed to be           zero   here. Finally, the
saver's post—tax        real rate of return in equation (2.6) reduces to


               s    =   r(1-m)         .                                                   (7.3)

With these forrilae, for any source of finance, we can calculate the effective
tax rate t =       (p—s)/p .          Starting   with r , for exaile, we have s and p
directly as linear        functions. In          general, however, the    present value term A

is not a linear function of p , so the tax is not linear in r . Similarly, if
we start with a value for p , we can generally find a value for p that is

consistent   with equation (7.1). However, it also will depend nonlinearly on the

initial p chosen. The tax rate ren.ins a nonlinear function of p

           Suppose, however, that there are no cash grants nor immediate expensing

     =     = 0),   and that depreciation allowances are equal to economic depre-

ciation at replacement cost. In this case,                 the present value of allowances is



                   A = AD =             f   _(&4-p)udU   =     ,                           (7.4)

and equation (7.1) reduces sixrqly to

                          p                                                                    7.5


Now the three effective tax rates reduce to



                   tDEBT =    m

                   tNSI =     t + m(l—t)                                                       (7.6)

            Equations   (7.6) make   clear that these effective tax rates do not depend
on    p or r .     The system is linear in that the tax is a constant fraction of

any   pre—tax return. Our effective tax rate foriaxlae provide global estimates of
the tax rate, in either the fixed—p case or the fixed—r case, for any
                                                                                        initial p
or    r

            In our example above, linearity depends upon the assumption of economic

depreciation at replacement cost.- Actual tax systems conform neither to an

income tax on properly measured income nor to a consumption tax. In particular,
depreciation allowances are often accelerated relative to economic depreciation.

Because    these tax advantages are delayed, the effective tax rate depends on

their present value and tYius nonlinearly on the rate of discount.                 For these

reasons, there is no such number as the effective tax rate. Different estimates

are obtained for different values p and r.            It is very important, therefore, to

investigate the sensitivity of results to the initial               p or r .      For   reasons of
space,    we limit this investigation to the standard 1980 parameters in each

country. We also limit the investigation to one example, machinery in the manu-

facturing sector. Our       sensitivity   analysis should consider the most sensitive

case, and machinery has differentially accelerated depreciation allowances. It

is therefore expected to exhibit some of the greatest nonlinearities. We weight

over owners and sources of finance to calculate the total tax wedge or tax rate

on the "average" investment in manufacturing machinery in each country.
                                                               Chapter 7.14, p.1


         Figure 7.2 plots for each country, the effective tax rate on nchinery

as the pre—tax return varies from 1 to 30 percent.   These calculations employ

the fixed—p uthodolo, but the firm's discount rate is linked by our formulae

to this pre—tax return. For nchinery in the U.K., immediate expensing nans

that the discount rate does not affect the present value of depreciation

allowances, but additional grants ensure that the asset receives a subsidy at

    pre—tax return. When this subsidy is expressed as a fraction of a 1 percent

pre—tax return or less, the rate of subsidy becomes arbitrarily large. Because

the rate of tax or subsidy is misleading in such cases, we also show the tax

wedge in Figure 7.3. As the pre—tax return becomes small, the negative wedge in

Britain is reduced in absolute size although it becomes a larger fraction

of p
         In Sweden, as we see in Table 7.1, the total tax on the average new

investment in machinery is essentially zero. The wedge (p—s) is zero, so the

wedge as a fraction of p is also zero. As a result, the curves for Sweden in

Figures 7.2 and 7.3 are essentially flat at zero.

         To understand the curves for Germany and the U.S., consider first a

hypothetical case with no inflation but with accelerated depreciation arid

 investment grants. When the pre—tax return is relatively low, the discount rate

 is also relatively low, and the delayed depreciation allowances are re irnpor—

 tant. A subsidy may result in such a case, and it may be an arbitrarily high

 fraction of p •   As   p (or the discount rate) increases, depreciation allowan-

 ces become less important, and the tax may rise to zero or above. In such a

 case, the curve would look like that of the U.K.

          With significant inflation, as in the U.S., or with long asset life-

 times, as in Germany, depreciation allowances on historical cost may be less
                                                                       Chapter 7.1,     p.5

than economic   depreciation at replacement cost. In      such   cases, the   tax   wedge

may be positive, and it may be an arbitrarily high       fraction   of a very small p

Moreover, as p (or tne discount rate) increases, the unadvantageous depre-

ciation allowances becoir less important, and the effective tax rate falls.

Figure 7.3 shows that the tax wedges in the U.S. and Germany are small          at    low

p , even if the, are a high fraction of p as shown in Figure 7.2.

           An important aspect of Figures 7.2 and 7.3 is that the curves do not

cross. At actual inflation rates and standard 1980 parameters, the choice of p

does not affect the conclusion that the highest taxes are in Germany, followed

by the U.S., Sweden, and the U.K. Moreover, while the amount of tax naturally

increases with the earnings from the asset, as shown in Figure 7.3, the tax rate

curves of Figure 7.2 have large segments that are fairly flat. Beyond some cri-

tical value of p ,      the tax rate is not nuch affected by further changes in p
Standard calculations use a p of 10 percent, clearly beyond this sensitive

range.

           Similar   analyses are performed for the fixed—r methodolor in Figures
7.L and   7.5. Curves for Germany and the U.S. are very similar to those for the
fixed—p case above. In Sweden, the fixed—r calculation implies a snail positive
wedge for machinery in manufacturing. When r is 1 percent in this case, the

value of p is only 0.1 percent. A small denominator makes the tax rate

misleadingly   high.
          For the U.K., Figure 7.5 demonstrates that machinery is clearly sub-
sidized at any value for r .       As     r is reduced to about 2 percent, however,
the subsidy (p—s) becomes     equal to the whole return to the saver (s). Since the

government provides the saver's entire return, the asset need earn nothing. The

pre—tax   return p     is zero, and the   subsidy rate (p—s) /p is not defined. At
                                                                            Chapter 7.L,   p.
even lower values for r ,       the   subsidy is even larger than the saver's return,

and the asset can make a loss. A negative wedge (p—s) divided by a negative p

iilies a positive rate in spite of the subsidy.

         We need a common standard for coraring taxes on different assets or in

different countries. The tax—inclusive effective rate (p—s)/p is a logical

candidate, because it corresponds to our general conception of a tax rate and

because it reduces to the statutory rate in special cases. Because p can be

zero or negative, however, this rate is often not useful for drawing corn—

parisons. The tax—exclusive rate (p—s)/s is a logical alternative, but the

next section describes cases where s can be zero or negative as well. Both

rates are subject to misleadingly wide variations when their denominators are

close to zero. The remaining alternative is to report the tax wedge (p—s); in

this case we do not have a denominator. This effective tax measure alwas has

the "correct" sign, and it can be interpreted as a wealth tax rate, the percen-

tage of the asset value paid in tax each year. As the earnings of the asset

increase in Figures 7.3 and 7.5, so does the amount of tax or subsidy. The tax

sequence of the fact that the tax rates level off in Figures 7.2 and 7.J4.

         These diagrams demonstrate clearly the nonlinear aspects of our effec-

tive tax fornulae. The tax rates in Figures 7.2 and 7.14 are particularly nonli-

near because p appears in the denominator. Even the tax wedges in Figures 7.3

and 7.5 are nonlinear, however, because p is a nonlinear function of r

Both wedges and rates are sensitive to the choice of p or r , so care must be

taken in their interpretation.

         One other interesting result can be explained with the use of the

equations given above. It turns out that the effective tax rate is related
                                                                      Chapter 7., p.7


inversely   to the personal tax rate m in some instances. In the U.S., for

example, the effective tax rates in some categories are raised by the use of

"low   tax" parameters, or reduced by   the   use of "high tax" parameters. In par-
ticular, the effective tax rate on retained earnings is 67      percent   with the low
value for in , 62 percent with the standard value for m ,       and   only 58   percent

with   the high value for m (see Tables 6.20 to 6.23).

            This result derives from the arbitrage assumption of Chapter 2.        In

equilibrium, savers are assumed to require the same net—of—tax real return on

any investment, in any asset or industry. Thus s is always given by the real

net—of—tax interest rate, whatever source of finance is actually used. Consider

an increase in the personal tax rate in        on interest income. If the source is

retained earnings, then individuals still earn a lower net return s

Secondly, since equity does not actually pay the tax on interest income, the

firm can earn a lower gross return on the asset and still provide a net return

equal to that on interest income. Whether the gross return p falls by nxre or

less than the net return s depends on depreciation deductions. If depreciation

allowances are not immediate, and the higher m implies a lower discount rate

for the firm, then the present value of allowances rises. In this case, the

required return p falls by nre than s , and the tax wedge is reduced.                   In

effect, the increase in m raises the relative advantage of internal finance if

capital gains are taxed at concessionary rates, and in some cases this can re-

duce the tax wedge on an investment project.

            Consider, for example, the simple case with no inflation, no wealth

taxes, no capital gains taxes, and no investment grants. Discount rates for

this case are shown in equation (7.2), and the saver's return is shown in

equation (7.3). With economic depreciation at replacement cost, the pre—tax
                                                                          Chapter 7., p.8


return reduces to p/(l—t) , as shown in equation (7.5). The total tax rate on

debt is in   , on new share issues is t + zn(i—t)      ,   and on retained earnings is

      as shown in equations (7.6). An increase in in thus raises effective tax

rates for debt and new share issues, but leaves unchanged the rate for retained

earnings. With other than economic depreciation, however, the expression for

the pre—tax return does not reduce to equation (7.5). To reduce the expression

for p in a different way, suppose actual depreciation (o)               is zero. Then A >
0    represents "accelerated" depreciation, and       a    higher discount rate reduces the

present value of depreciation allowances. With this alteration, the expression

for the gross return p changes from (7.1) to



                      p(l—A)                                                          (7)

and the effective tax rate on retained earnings changes from t               to

                                                                                       (7.8)


             Now a change in the personal tax rate in         affects   t for projects

financed from retained earnings according to

With     p = r(l—m)   ,   the   discount rate for retained earnings falls as      in rises

 (   3p/3m ( 0 ).     Since      3A/3p is negative, and t      is   less than one, the effec-

tive tax rate also falls as m rises.

             The effect on any single asset or industry depends on the share of

 retained earnings as a source of finance. In the countries studied here, other

 sources of finance are large enough that the overall effective tax rate does

 in fact increase with the personal tax rate.5
7. Sensitivj- to Assumed eatonshi bet.een inflation and interest Rate
               In fixed—i' calculations above, we assume that arbitrage eliminates dif—
erences in net—of—tax interest rates, except for differences in personal tax
rates among owners. In this case, the same real interest rate r is earned on
any investoent. Because of tax differences, then, the pre—tax returns p must
differ among investments. While we hold r constant across investments at any
inflation rate, this assumption provides no guide as to correct comparisons
among inflation rates. There is no arbitrage story to be told here, and we are

concerned simply with the choice of r at which to evaluate the tax rate. With a

linear tax system, the choice would not matter, but in practice nonlinearities

necessitate an assumption to. enable us to make comparisons for ceteris paribus

changes    in the rate of inflation. For this purpose, we 1rpically hold constant the
average real rate of return to savers. This assumption implies a particular
relationship between the inflation rate and the nominal interest rate, and the
purpose    of this section is to investigate alternative assumptions about this

relationship.

               In the fixed—r case, we may interpret               rF as the interest rate that
would exist if there was no inflation. In such a case, the average post—tax
return to savers would be s =
                                         rF(1_m)       ,   where   in   is   the weighted average of

different owners' personal marginal tax rates. If inflation increased to the

rate       ,    and the nominal interest rate rose to a value i                   ,   then in real terms
the average saver would receive                S     i(l—m) — ii .      If   the averaLe real return

to savers is to be constant across inflation rates, by                       assumption,    then we must

set these two expressions equal           to       each other and solve for the nominal interest

rate as:


                    i
                        r1.
                              +—--   .                                                              (7.10)
                                                                  Chapter 7.5, p2


Because nominal interest is subject to tax, inflation iust adu more than point—

for—point to the nominal interest rate for the real after—tax return to be
constant. In our calculations above, we do not mean to claim that inflation
does add more than point—for—point to nominal interest. 1ather, equation (7.10)
is a natural consequence of the standard we use for conaring across inflation

rates.

            Other assumptions might be employed, however, and we now investigate

their implications for our results. One such alternative is suggested by

Frauzneni and Jorgenson (1980) who find a roughly constant real after—tax rate of

return in the corporate sector. If corporations successfully arbitrage between

bonds    and real capital, then the real after—tax return that they earn on an
investment must be the same as the real net interest saved by retiring a bond,
namely, rF(lt) with no inflation or i(1—T)—n with inflation at rate        iT



Assuming equality of these expressions across inflation rates implies


                 I =
                       r.   +—                                                  (7.11)


           Feldstein and Summers (1978), on the other hand, have estimated that
inflation adds approximately point—for—point to nominal interest rates. This       is

described as the result of two countervailing forces within the tax system.

Taxation of nominal interest tends to raise i by more than       iT to keep the

real net return constant, while historical cost depreciation and taxation of

nominal capital gains tend to reduce the real net return that can be earned.

Summers (1981) makes a stronger statement, that nominal interest rates rise by

at most the inflation rate, if at all. This empirical finding can be summarized

as

                I =
                       rF +   iT   .                                            (7.12)
                                                                Chapter 7.5, p3


         In the absence of taxes, (7.12) would keep borrowing and lending oppor-

tunities independent of the rate of inflation. Since Irving Fisher originally

considered the case without taxes, (7.12) has been referred to as "Strict

Fisher's Law" (Bradford and Fullerton, 1981). In a tax system where all nominal

interest receipts are taxed at the rate t   , and all nominal interest payments
are tax—deductible, (7.11) would keep real borrowing and lending opportunities

independent of inflation. This relationship has been referred to as "Modified

Fisher's Law." In the other relationship used above, equation (7.10), we account

for varying tax rates on nominal interest income by keeping the average saver's

opportunities independent of inflation. It is, of course, a different modifica-

tion to Fisher's Law.

         When inflation is zero, all versions of Fisher's law imply the same

result. When inflation is positive, however, the choice among these rela-

tionships has an effect on tax rate estimates. Table 7.10 shows overall tax

rates for each country, using actual inflation and standard 1980 parameters

(only the fixed—i- case is presented). In the middle rows of Table 7.10, where

the standard assumption of equation (7.10) holds, the effective tax rates match

those from Table 7.2 above. In the bottom set of rows, where (7.11) holds, the

effective tax rates in all countries are reduced. Because (7.11) holds constant

the real return after corporate taxes, additional inflation serves to increase

the real return after personal taxes. To net the higher required net return,

assets nist earn more before tax as well. The result is similar to con-

sideration of Figures 7.2 to 7.5, where higher rates of return imply lower tax

rates.

         In the top rows of Table 7.10, where Strict Fisher's Law applies,

effective tax rate estimates in each country are increased. Because inflation
                                                                         Chapter 7.5, p.14


adds only point—for—point to nominal interest, and because nominal interest is

fully taxable in these countries' tax systems, inflation reduces the real after—

tax returns s (except for tax—exempt institutions). The assets need only earn

a    lower pre—tax return p •      While the tax wedges (p—s) are all sma1ler as shown
in   the table, division by small values for p imply higher tax as a proportion

of gross returns. In fact, individual pre—tax returns are often negative under

Strict Fisher's Law, so the use of effective tax rates presents more of a

problem generally. We provide p and s separately in the table for this

reason. 6

            With Strict Fisher's Law, the ordering of country tax rates is altered.

Germany takes second place while Sweden acquires the highest tax rate estimate.

The inflation rate in Germany is low, however, so the taxation of nominal

interest does not reduce s or p as much in that country as it does in

Sweden. The high rate in Sweden reflects a low denominator, since the wedge is

still   higher in Germany.
            To get an idea   of   how these assumptions might affect the breakdown of

effective tax rates within        a country, Table 7.11   presents   detailed results for
the   United States. For any individual combination, p is always lower under

Strict Fisher's Law (in the first column) than it is under either modified ver-

sion of Fisher's Law. The tax wedges (p—s) are also lower, but division by p

provides tax rates that are higher. The subsir for debt is so large that p

is very close to zero, and the subsiy rate is misleadingly large. In fact,

since further inflation reduces real net returns still more under Strict

Fisher's Law, calculations for ten percent inflation imply that p is negative

for the average debt financed U.S. investment. The net return s is small but

positive, so this subsidized investment would shoi a large positive tax "rate".

           These sections have deLonstrated that effective tax rates (p—s)!p may

not be useful indicators of the total tax or subsidy on a given marginal invest—

inent.   They are not very stable at low values of the pre-.tax return, and they
may even   have the wrong sign. We recommend great care in their use and inter-
pretation, and we suggest using the tax wedge    (p—s) which   is more stable and
always   has the right sign.
7.6 Summary

               nave tried      in   this chapter to present effective marginal thx rate
calculations in a number of different ways for each country. While              these

results depend fundamentally          upon   the basic methodoloT chosen for our   study,

they depend also on a number of additional assumptions. In particular, the
results   reflect our decision to look at the statutory provisions which determine

the   tax liability on a marginal investment in each combination of asset,

industry,    source of finance, and owner. The precise values of the estimated tax

rates depend upon our choice of a given value for the pre-tax rate of' return on

all projects in the fixed—p case, and upon our choice for the interest rate

earned    on all projects in the fixed—r case.

            Table 7.12 sujnjarizes the       major findings for each country. In the
first—row,    the    tax   rates refer to the fixed—p case, with a pre—tax annual       return

of 10 percent on all        assets. In the second row, they are based       on a fixed real
interest    rate    of 5 percent    per annum for all assets. These fixed—r results are

higher than the corresponding tax rates for the fixed—p case, but 'the ranking of'

the countries is the same. We find the highest overall effective tax rates in

Germany, followed by Sweden, the U.S., and the U.K. As shown above, this

ranking is unaffected by the values of p and r at which the tax rates are

evaluated.

            A major issue in all countries is the effect of inflation on efi'ective

tax rates. The overall effective tax rates for inflation rates betieen zero and

fifteen percent are plotted for each country in Figure 7.1. The surprising

result is that taxes in Sweden and            the U.K.   start out at a common 13 percent

overall rate at zero inflation, but they diverge dramatically as inflation
increases. Tax rates in Sweden rise with inflation, while those in Britain fall
with inflation. In Germany, overall taxes rise initially, due to historical
                                                                     Chapter 7.6, p2


 cost depreciation, but eventually fall as nominal interest deductions become

more important at higher rates of inflation. The     curve   for the U.S. is simi-

larly shaped, but tax rates level off only at a 15 percent inflation rate. At

lower inflation rates, the effective marginal tax rates rise with inflation.

The fourth row of Table 7.12 shows the change in taxes when inflation increases

from 6 to 7 percent in each country.

            We tried also to decompose tax rate differences into those attributable.

to differences in rates of inflation, the allocation of investment, and actual

depreciation rates, as opposed to differences in tax parameters themselves.

Table 7.12 summarizes these results, indicating that none of these differences

taken by itself had a major impact on the spread of tax rates, but that in total

they do have some impact. fective tax rates are somewhat more equal among

countries    when only tax parameter differences remain.

         A very important aspect of our study is not captured by any of these

overall effective tax rate calculations. That is, the overall tax rates conceal

a wide distribition of individual effective tax rates within each country. To

summarize these differences in each country, Figures .6 to 7.9 provide

histograms for the actual inflation rate with 1980 parameters. For the height

of each bar in the histogram, we add together the capital stock weights for any

individual   combinations that are taxed at effective rates falling in each ten

percent interval between —320 percent and +200 percent.

         These bounds are chosen because at least one combination in the U.K. is

taxed at a —312 percent rate. Appendix B shows the individual fixed—p tax rates

for each combination, at each inflation rate, in each country. For actual

inflation rates, the lowest tax rate anywhere is the —312 percent rate in

Britain, for debt—financed machinery in the manufacturing sector, where the debt
                                                                   Chapter 7.6, p3


is held by tax—exempt institutions. At an annual inflation rate of 13.6 percent

in the U.K. , a considerable inflation premium in the nominal interest rate is

tax—deductible at the corporate level, but for this combination it is not taxed

at   the personal level. Machiner- receives immediate expensing, and in addition
qualifies    for a cash grant. At the other extreme, Appendix B shows a +130 per-

cent rate on an internally financed investment in other industrial buildings in

the U.K. ,   where the equity is held by households. Buildings receive only

straight—line depreciation, and other industry receives smaller grants than

manufacturing. Because of disparate tax treatments of different assets,

industries, sources, and owners, Figure 7.6 shows a relatively flat distribution

of tax rates in Britain. They extend from —312 to +130 percent, with no more

than 12 percent of the capital stock taxed within a single ten point interval.

This implies a very high variance of marginal tax rates.

          A similarly flat distribution is shown for Sweden in Figure 7.7.

Again, no more than 12 percent of the capital stock is taxed at rates falling

within any  ten point interval. In this case, however, the rates range from —116
to   +11414 percent. The investment with the lowest tax rate is a machine in other
industry financed by bonds sold to tax—exempts. Although the 11.14 percent grant
and 30 percent exponential depreciation allowances are the same for machinery in
all sectors, machinery in other industry was found to have lower true rates of
economic depreciation. The result is higher relative acceleration of allowances

and the lowest total tax rate. Other combinations with tax rates less than —110

percent bring the total weight for that interval up to almost 10 percent of

total capital in Sweden. The investment with the highest total tax is a

building in other industry financed by issuing new shares to households. Sweden

had no dividend tax credit in 1980, so earnings on such an investment are taxed

by both the corporate and personal tax systems.
                                                                     Chapter 7.6, p1


            German investments are taxed at a much narrower spread of rates, as

 shown in Figure 7.8. The lowest tax rate is only —59 percent, on a building in

 manufacturing financed by debt issued to tax—exempt institutions.     Machinery in

 Germar receives relatively long 11 year tax lifetimes, as well as a wealth tax

 rate that is higher that that on buildings. Interest deductions make the lower

building tax rates negative. At the other end, the highest rate is "only" 102

percent, on inventories financed internally through equity held by households.

 (This rate is identical for all industries.) Inventories receive the highest

tax rate because of unfavorable inflation accounting practices required for tax

purposes, and internal finance receives the highest tax rate because of taxation

at both corporate and personal levels. Dividends, on the other hand, receive

imputation credit at the personal level for corporate tax already paid.

           Unlike the U.K. and Sweden, Germany and the U.S. have most of their

capital stock taxed at rates between zero and 100 percent. Figure 7.9 shows

that nearly 30 percent of U.S. capital is taxed at rates between 80 and 90 per--

cent. Because another 30 percent of U.S. capital is taxed at rates between —30

and +20 percent, and because rates extend down to 105 percent, the weighted—

average marginal tax rate is found to be 37 percent in this fixed—p case. As in

all other countries, the least taxed investment in the U.S. is financed by debt

sold to tax—exempt institutions, but in this case the asset is machinery used in
the commercial sector. This asset receives lower grants in commerce and the
same depreciation allowances in all sectors, but the faster actual depreciation
rate in comxrrce means that reinvestment   qualifies for those tax advantages more

often. The highest tax rate in the U.S. is +111 percent, on buildings financed

by new shares sold to households, in either manufacturing or commerce.

Buildings receive less accelerated depreciation allowances, while dividends are

fully   taxed at both corporate and personal levels.
                                                                 Chapter 7.6, p5


         In general, we find that the histograms in Figures 7.6 to 7.9 provide

much nre useful inforntion than individual overall tax rates in each of the

four countries studied.

         These disparate tax treatments in each country would be eliminated

under a comprehensive income tax, that is, with full integration of corporate

and personal tax systems, economic depreciation at replacement cost, no special

grants or incentives, no wealtn taxes, full indexing, and the full taxation of

accrued real capital gains. In such a case, all investments would be taxed at

the weighted—average personal tax rate. For comparison purposes, in Table 7.13,

we calculate this marginal personal tax rate in each country, taking weighted

averages over household rates on debt and on equity. In order to capture a

comprehensive tax concept, we do not include tax—exempt institutions or

insurance companies, nor do we reduce personal rates to account for returns

earned in the form of tax—free banking services. The U.S., U.K., and Geriany

are very close together, at 43_14L percent tax rates, and Sweden is at a 57 per-

cent rate. Histograms under such a hypothetical comprehensive income tax would

collapse to a vertical line at the country's single tax rate, applied to 100

percent of the capital stock.

        We do not mean to imply that countries could easily switch to a compre-

hensive income tax, nor that to do so would be desirable. Rather, these calcu-

lations demonstrate another striking constrast: the overall effective rate in

Britain is a full    percentage points below the average marginal personal rate,

the overall effective rate in Sweden is 21 points below the average personal

rate, the effective rate in the U.S. is 6 points below the personal rate, and

the effective rate in Germany is several points above the personal rate. Our

four countries are quite different in this respect.
                                                                     Chapter 7.6, p6


            Finally,   we might naturally ask about the inlications of tnese effec—

tive tax rates for economic gro.ith in each country. Clearly, this is not a

study about coxrarative capital formation, incore growth, or living standards in
the four countries. We have attempted to measure effective marginal tax rates
in each country in a number of different ways, but we have not tried to use
these estimates to measure     effects on growth, excess burdens, or income distri-

bution. Nevertheless, it is interesting to look at soixe summary growth sta-

tistics in light of our tax rate findings. To do so, Table 7.lLi reproduces our

standard fixed—p overall effective tax rates, and it shows two average annual

growth rates in constant dollars from 1960 to 1980 in each country. The first

growth rate is for GD?, and the second is for the nonfinancial corporate capital

stock, excluding inventories.

            The results are surprising to say the least. If we rank .the four

countries by their average annual growth in GD?, we obtain exactly the same

order as when we rank by effective tax rates. Germany has the highest overall

effective tax on income from capital and the highest growth rate. The U.S. is

second in both categories and Sweden is thirth The U.IC has the lowest overall

effective   tax on income from capital arid the lowest growth rate. If we look at
growth of nonfinancial corporate capital, results are substantially the same.
The U.S. and Sweden are reversed, but Germany is still the highest and Britain
is   the lowest.

           Nothing here should be construed to iriply causation in either direc—

tion. It is certainly possible that the slower growing countries have reacted

to their slow growth by providing more investment incentives which reduce

overall effective taxes. As we saw in Chapters 3—6, tax rates have changed over

time, in sorxe cases markedly. For example, tax rates in the U.K. were very high
                                                              Chapter 7.6, p7


in 1960 but have fallen dramatically since then. This reduction in rates xray

lead to higher investment in the future than would otherwise have taken place.

It is also possible that high groith is associated with high taxes on capital if

these taxes are somehow less distorting than alternative taxes on labor

incon.T Rather, the correlations in Table 7.l1 are interesting by themselves.

They suggest multiple interpretations and hypotheses, many of which will, we

hope, be investigated further and tested using the estimates of tax rates and

data on individual countries which we have produced in the course of this study.

1. The first matrix of weights in Appendix A shows the proportion of capital

     stock that is used in each combination of asset and industry. If we add

     across the three industries in each country, we find that machinery is 17

     percent of total capital in Britain, 42 percent in Germany, 32 percent in

     Sweden, and 22 percent in the U.S. The high percentage in Britain can be

     explained by the tax advantages afforded machinery, and the low percentage

     in the U.S. can be explained by the fact that a larger proportion of utili-

     ties are private corporations in the U.S. than in Earope. Since there are

     more structure—intensive utilities in the "other industry" category, the

     U.S. has a lower relative total weight on machinery.


2.   If the tax system were linear, then the effective tax rate calculated for a

     particular combination would not depend on the choice of p or r in

     either the fixed—p or fixed—r calculations. Since individual tax rates

     would then be the same in both cases, any weighted—average in the fixed—r

     case must be greater than the corresponding weighted—average in the fixed—p

     case.    The tax system is not linear, however, so the individual tax rates

     depend   on the chosen p of 10 percent in Table 7.1, and on the chosen r
     of 5 percent in Table 7.2. Since the tax rates for individual combinations

     are not identical in the two cases, averages over tax rates in the fixed—r

     case do not necessariiy exceed those in the fixed—p case. Indeed, when we

     average over all combinations involving a particular asset, industry,

     source, or owner, the fixed—r tax rate in Table 7.2 is sometimes less than

     the   corresponding fixed—p rate of Table 7.1.

3. Auerbach and Jorgenson (1980) suggest a "first—year recovery" system where

     the investor receives only an immediate deduction, equal to the present

     value of actual depreciation on the asset. All internally financed invest-

     ments are then subject to a uniform tax rate T              , from   equation (7.6). This

     is not the only linear tax system, however. At the other extreme, immediate

     expensing in our simple case provides a uniform rate of zero on all inter-

     nally financed assets. Brown (1981) suggests that any uniform rate between

     zero and t        can be obtained by providing a common rate of grant that is

     proportional not to the purchase price of the asset, but to the purchase

     price minus the first—year deduction.


4.   Table 7.2 shows a small subsidy      for machinery   in     Sweden when r is fixed at

     5    percent,   but that calculation considers an average over all industries,

     sources, and owners. Here, when we look at machinery             only in   manufacturing,

     we have a small positive tax at any value for           r
5.   In   an alternative xnethodolor, Bradford and Fullerton (1981) assume that

     firms   arbitrage   between debt and real capital such that the net—of—tax

     return to the corporation is equalized. Since r(l—t) would be saved by

     retiring a unit of debt, the     same aist    be earned by a new investment in any

     asset using any source     of finance. This net rate is always the firm's
     discount rate, so    cannot affect the gross return p . However, when the
                            m

     incon from the asset is retained, distributed, or paid out in interest,
     different personal tax treatments inly that the net returns s nust
     differ. Thus, when risk is ignored, one can either assume that individuals
                                         -F3 -


                               Footnotes (continued)


     arbitrage away differences in s ,   or      that firn arbitrage away differences

     in source of finance, but not both.


6. The choice among equations (7.10) to (7.12) also affects the relationship

     between inflation and effective tax rates. While curves in Figure 7.1

     correspond to equation (7.10), similar curves could be plotted for each

     country under each alternative assumption.


7.   See Fullerton and Gordon (1981) for soxr elaboration and testing of the idea

     that replacennt of capital taxes with a labor tax of equal yield can

     provide a welfare gain.
