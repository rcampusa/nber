The History and Politics of Corporate Ownership in Sweden
Peter Högfeldt
NBER Working Paper No. 10641
July 2004
JEL No. G3, N2, N4
                                        ABSTRACT

Not despite but because of persistent Social Democratic political influence since the Great Reversal

in 1932 have a few families and banks controlled the largest listed firms in Sweden. The Social

Democrats have de facto been the guarantor rather than the terminator of private capitalism since

the political and corporate incumbencies have been united by strong common interests. Incumbent

owners need the political support to legitimize that their corporate power rests on extensive use of

dual-class shares and pyramiding. While the Social Democrats only get the necessary resources and

indirect support for their social and economic policies from the private sector if the largest firms

remain under Swedish control so that capital does not migrate. The extensive use of mechanisms to

separate votes from capital however drives a significant wedge between the costs of internal and

external capital that causes an enhanced (political) pecking order of financing where new external

equity is strongly avoided. By not encouraging outsiders to create new firms and fortunes, and by

not fully activating the primary equity markets, the heavy politicized system has redistributed

incomes but not property rights and wealth. The result is an ageing economy with an unusually large

proportion of very old and very large firms with well-defined owners in control. 31 of the 50 largest

listed firms in 2000 were founded before 1914, only 8 in the post-war period and none after 1970.

One of the ironies of European business history of the 20th century is the relative stability

(resiliency) of corporate ownership structures despite the unprecedented political turmoil with

devastating wars and the interregnum of socialism. It is however still impossible to understand the

strong historical path dependence without analyzing how political factors have profoundly affected

the development of corporate ownership by first setting the stage and then changing the conditions

in systematic ways (see e.g. Roe (2002a and b)). Not only through the design of the legal system

(regimes) and corporate laws, and the efficiency of legal enforcement and supervision. But also by

changing the balance of interests between labor and capital by regulation of labor, product and

capital markets, and development of tax-financed, public welfare systems with egalitarian ambitions

to redistribute resources and opportunities.

          Another historical irony is that previous adversarial relations between capital and labor

have given way to a corporatist society where heavily entrenched private ownership of the largest

listed firms co-exits and cooperates with labor unions whose members enjoy strong employee

protection, and are represented on the board (see Pagano and Volpin (2001)). Since financial

markets are conducive to structural changes, which often run counter to the status quo interests of

incumbent labor and capital, they tend to be less developed in corporatist countries, and firms also

less dependent on external financing through equity markets (see e.g. Rajan and Zingales (2003a)).

This is particularly true in Continental Europe and in Scandinavia where proportional voting

systems tend to favor formation of minority or coalition governments and consensus decision

making, which fosters political rent seeking by the firms’ stakeholders, and larger public sectors.1

Corporate ownership in a country does therefore not only rest on the corporate law and on the legal

regime but ultimately on the political acceptance at large of entrenched private ownership. The

  In a cross-country analysis of the relation between political institutions and policy outcomes, Persson and Tabellini
(2003) find that presidential regimes have smaller governments than parliamentary systems. Majoritarian elections induce
smaller governments, less welfare spending and smaller deficits than do proportional elections. In particular, they report
systematic differences in spending patterns: Proportional and parliamentary democracies alone display a ratchet effect in
spending, with government outlays as a percentage of GDP rising in recessions, but not reverting in booms. All countries
cut taxes in election years. Presidential regimes postpone fiscal contractions until after the elections, while parliamentary
regimes do not; welfare-state programs are expanded in the proximity of elections, but only in democracies with
proportional elections.

structure of corporate ownership and governance, as well as the development of the financial

system, are thus very much integrated parts of a country’s political history.

        But how do the economic, political, legal and historical conditions interact? The challenge

in comparative historical analysis of corporate ownership is to try to separate which factors are

primarily exogenous and which are predominantly endogenously determined, and then evaluate

their relative importance and causal relations by comparing the realized, historical paths across

countries. History is of course not deterministic since the actual equilibrium path is only one of

many possible and temporary random events like financial crises and subsequent regulatory

responses may have long-term effects through path dependence (see Rajan and Zingales (2003b)).

The underlying assumption is thus that there is enough structural stability in societies for the

comparative analysis to map out the major decisive factors of corporate ownership over time.

        This is of course a very tall order but fortunately some institutions and factors (e.g.

constitutions, legal regimes and enforcement, economic geography) are surprisingly stable over

time and therefore natural candidates as exogenous determinants in the causal, historical analysis.

Protection of property rights, freedom of contracting and the openness of the civic society have

basically been exogenous factors over a longer time period but sometimes exposed to the strong

winds of political change. Changes in external competition and major technological changes are

also primarily exogenous, in particular for a small open market economy, and often catalysts for

structural changes. Other pivotal factors have a much less exogenous character since they are more

influenced by changing economic and political conditions. For example, the domestic economy’s

openness to trade and capital flows, choice of exchange rate regimes and policies to promote

flexible labor markets and development of financial markets. The strongest endogenous factor in the

20th century has definitely been how political ideology (e.g. socialism or egalitarianism) in general,

and voice of parties and organized stakeholders, in particular labor, have rallied political support for

and implemented policies that absorb and assuage effects of brute, tempestuous markets forces.




                                                   3
        This paper contributes to the comparative historic analysis by analyzing which factors

(economic, legal, historical and political) were decisive in the historical development of corporate

ownership (listed firms) in Sweden. In fact, Sweden is a rather suitable case for a causal analysis

since several economic factors are exogenously determined by the fact that it is a small and export-

oriented economy that has exploited it base of natural resources and supplied Europe with raw

materials and manufacturing goods. Institutional and political conditions have also been very stable

since the country benefited politically and economically by staying out of the two wars. In

particular the political stability has been unprecedented among Western democracies.

        The Social Democratic Party (SAP) has been in power since 1932 except for 9 years

between 1976-82 and 1991-94 but predominantly as a single party minority government with

passive support from the Communist (later Socialist) Party (SKP, VPK and Vänsterpartiet,

respectively), and more recently also from the Environmental Party (Miljöpartiet) or in coalition or

with support from the Farmers’ party (Bondeförbundet, later Centerpartiet). Consistent with the

corporatist spirit in society, the relation between the well-organized interests of capital and labor

has in general been cooperative and consensus oriented, and property rights have been respected.

The exceptions to this rule are two major political conflicts in the late 40s (about a far-reaching,

governmental interventionist program for a more planned economy to fight an expected post-war

depression) and in the late 70s and early 80s (about a proposal for partial transfer of corporate

control to the labor unions), which both resulted in electoral set-backs for the Social Democrats and

in implementation of significantly watered-down programs that later were terminated.

        Despite recurrent financial and industrial crises, and increasing capital demands, corporate

control of the largest firms has been remarkably stable and increasingly concentrated since the

1930s. The political intervention and general influence in the economy at large has however been

significant, and embodied in an unusually large tax-financed public sector that redistributes

resources and opportunities between citizens in a very ambitious manner. The mixture of

institutional stability, persistent social democratic policies and stable, concentrated corporate


                                                 4
ownership in a small open economy exposed to international competitive pressure makes Sweden a

particularly interesting case.

        I focus on three major questions about the history and politics of corporate ownership. First,

given the changing economic and political conditions, which factors caused the ownership of the

largest listed firms to become so concentrated and stable over time? And which are the economic

consequences thereof? Since stability breeds complacency, lock-in of inherited capital and political

rent seeking, in particular if firms are controlled by families and banks, it is important to track the

effects on investments, R&D, overall growth and creation of new firms; where does the new

entrepreneurial blood come from (see e.g. Morck, Strangeland and Yeung (2000) and He, Morck

and Yeung (2003))?

        Second, the relation between labor and capital has not been without tension, but why did

the very strong egalitarian ambitions of the labor movement (the blue-collar union LO and the

Social Democratic Party-- SAP) made a halt at private ownership and accepted that the control of

the largest firms via pyramids and extensive use of dual-class shares rests with a very small elite of

old families and professional managers? Why does one of the most egalitarian societies accept one

of the most unequal distributions of power over large corporations? Neither lasting influence of an

antithetical political ideology nor ambitious redesign by occupational powers (Germany and Japan)

seems thus to hinder established mechanisms of corporate control from reproducing (replicating)

themselves in democracies. But why are the control mechanisms so strong that they survive the

whirlwinds of political and social change?

        The third question concerns how the structure of the financial system has influenced and

shaped corporate ownership and how ownership in turn has affected the development of the

financial system, in particular of the primary equity markets. The question is of course motivated by

the influential literature on law and finance that finds correlations between e.g. civil law origin

dummy (significant regression coefficient), more concentrated ownership and less developed

financial markets (see e.g. La Porta, Rafael, Florencio Lopez-de-Silanes, Andrei Shleifer and


                                                  5
(Robert Vishny) (1999) and (2000)). Are there other factors besides the degree of legal protection of

minority shareholders that explains why ownership did not become dispersed in Sweden? Does e.g.

Mark Roe’s idea that ownership and control does not separate in Continental Europe because the

pressure of social democracy (in a wide sense, not necessarily political party) also apply to the

perhaps most social democratic society in Europe, Sweden?

         I provide an integrated answer to the three closely related questions by focusing on a

narrow financial perspective: How did the firms finance their investments? Or more specifically:

How dependent have listed firms been on external capital from the primary equity market?2 The

importance of political, social and external economic factors will be analyzed from the perspective

of how they have influenced and shaped the firm’s dependence on external equity financing. The

basic idea is that ownership will only become dispersed if firms need to raise a significant part of

their capital in the external equity markets, and that political decisions will determine how

dependent firms are on external financing. Political support for use of pyramids and dual-class

shares that separate votes from capital will limit the controlling owners´ as well as the firm’s

dependence on equity markets. This occurs because the separation of ownership from control drives

a significant wedge between the costs of internal and external capital as new external shareholders

demand compensation (discounts) for the associated agency costs. But the firm’s internal capital is

comparatively inexpensive for the controlling owners as they have access to and exert power over


2
  My ideas have been inspired by Rajan and Zingales (2003 a and b) and their interest group theory of financial
development where incumbents oppose development when it breeds competition. My analysis of the Swedish case may be
regarded as an application and elaboration of their basic framework by its focus on the interaction between political
ideology and corporate ownership. Another great inspiration is Mark Roe’s political theory about social democracy (Roe
(2002a) and his views on corporate law and corporate governance (Roe (2002b)) although I disagree on some points. My
analysis deviates from the interesting approach to a new political economy surveyed and developed by Pagano and Volpin
(2001) and (2004), respectively, since I emphasize the importance of political ideology more strongly than differences in
electoral systems but their analysis has been thought-provoking. Erixon (1997) has been an important inspiration and my
financial approach may be regarded as complementary to his real analysis of the Swedish industrial development. I have
also benefited from Henreksson and Jakobsson (2001 and 2003a and b) that emphasize the negative effect of taxes on
corporate ownership and the threat of Socialism to private ownership. But they completely ignore that the existence of
pyramids presupposes that inter-corporate dividends as well as capital gains are not taxed; see Morck (2003). Social
Democratic governments have over the years implemented such tax policies that are conducive to pyramiding; see
Holmén and Högfeldt (2004b). Applying Rajan’s and Zingales´ general reasoning, I however develop a political theory of
corporate ownership and financial markets that generates the diametrically opposite conclusion. The Social Democrats
have been the guarantor rather than the threat to entrenched corporate ownership since the political and corporate
incumbencies have been united over time by strong common interests. Glete’s (1994) historical description and analysis
of corporate networks have significantly contributed to my knowledge and ideas about corporate ownership in Sweden.

all of the firm’s internal cash flows via a relatively small (less than proportional) capital investment.

This generate an enhanced pecking order of financing: Strong reliance on retained earnings and

borrowing but avoidance of equity issues, in particular of large public offers as they would dilute

control and also be extra costly due to the discounts to new outside shareholders; see Holmén and

Högfeldt (2004b).3 The enhanced pecking order is reinforced by the key political decision to allow

banks to directly or indirectly own equity as the banks are more likely to provide new debt when

their closely related firms need capital. The close connections between banks and large listed firms

have had profound and lasting effects on corporate financing and ownership in Sweden over the last

100 years.

         If capital for investments can be supplied primarily through retained earnings, by borrowing

in banks or by infusion of private capital, firms have no immediate need to go through the strictures

of equity offers and place a larger fraction of shares with new investors that may dilute the value of

their private benefits of control and disperse ownership. The Social Democrats have in particular

pursued three policies that tend to reinforce entrenchment of incumbent owners: (i) allowing bank

ownership of equity; (ii) strong support for control structures that rigidly separate votes from

capital, for a long time also combined with rigorous restrictions on foreign ownership of equity, and

(iii) persistently giving retained earnings and borrowing a tax advantage over equity. The policies

have de facto disfavored formation of new, fast growing firms over incumbent firms as well as

outside equity financing by supporting an enhanced pecking order of financing in established firms.

         The real irony is thus that corporate ownership in Sweden is very concentrated not despite

but because of persistent Social Democratic policies since the Great Reversal in 1932. The Social

Democrats have in fact been the guarantor rather than the terminator of private capitalism since the

political and corporate incumbencies have been united by strong common interests. Incumbent

owners need the political support to legitimize that their corporate power rests on extensive use of

dual-class shares and pyramiding while the Social Democrats only get the necessary resources and

3
 The pecking order is enhanced since it is caused by agency costs inherent to the ownership structure and not primarily
by asymmetric information costs, and since public offers are very strongly avoided; see Högfeldt and Oborenko (2004).

indirect support for their social and economic policies from the private sector if the largest firms

remain under Swedish control so that capital does not migrate.

        Before elaborating on these ideas, I start by presenting a general picture of how corporate

ownership has developed historically. After an analytical description of how the ideology and

policies of the Social Democrats have affected corporate ownership, I develop my simple, political

theory of why ownership did not separate widely in Sweden that focuses on the interaction between

corporate ownership and development of the primary equity markets. Before presenting an

integrated answer to the three main questions of this chapter, I critically evaluate the Swedish model

of corporate ownership. To extract some general implications about how history and politics

interact, I speculate about the major exogenous and endogenous factors that caused corporate

ownership to follow the path it did in Sweden. I conclude by putting my analysis in a wider

historical context.



                  1. A Stylized History of Corporate Ownership in Sweden

Starting with economic reforms in the 1860s (e.g. freedom to establish new firms for men and

women and liberalization of foreign trade), Sweden followed a trajectory of fast industrialization

with the highest recorded rate of productivity growth between 1870 and 1913; the productivity level

was the second lowest in Europe in 1970 (Maddison (1982)). The export-oriented raw material

sector expanded very fast as it supplied the booming Western Europe with timber and iron ore. A

first wave of (domestic) innovations provided the foundation for new (genius) firms specialized in

engineering and manufacturing that became the basis of large export of investment goods: Atlas

Copco (1873), L M Ericsson (1876); Alfa-Laval (1883); ASEA (1883); AGA (1904); and SKF

(1907). Already before 1914 the newly founded firms represented half of the production value in

Swedish engineering. The very rapid industrialization until 1914 took place behind a tariff barrier

that averaged about 15%. In a second wave of innovations, primarily international adapted to




                                                  8
domestic conditions, new firms with domestic consumer goods orientation were founded:

Electrolux, Scania–Vabis, Volvo, and SAAB.

        The long expansion from 1870, in particular from the 1890s, to 1914 resulted in radical

transformation of all facets of the society. Sweden is a good early example of successful export-lead

growth. The public sector, both at the central level and in municipalities, raised very significant

amounts of capital in international bond issues (primarily from France and Germany) to finance the

large infrastructural investments in e.g. railroads, harbors, cities and housing. Because of very

favorable circumstances, the loans were repaid during WWI. As part of the structural reforms, a

banking system of Scottish model with deposit banks that issue notes was built. The new firms used

almost exclusively retained earnings (about 40% of profits were reinvested), trade credits, short-

term credit notes and later short-term bank loans combined with bond financing of machinery and

buildings (see Gårdlund (1947)). Firms were controlled by a very small circle of shareholders

around the founder and his/her family (see Jörberg (1988)).

        Commercial banks (equity-backed) developed fast from the 1870s when the regulation of

interest rates was abandoned. But bank loans did not become an important source of industrial

financing until around 1900. The banking industry was well organized and had political support

since an efficient banking system was regarded as crucial for the development of a relatively poor

country. Because of the large export-lead industrial expansion after 1900, a relatively large external

equity financing became necessary. More organized and regular trading started at The Stockholm

Stock Exchange in 1901 as equity replaced the traditional bond financing and borrowing from

banks increased rapidly in response to the increasing demand for capital. The development of the

financial system in Sweden seems to be demand-driven as new institutions and regulation adjusted

to the changing conditions.

However, despite significant increase in demand for investment capital from the rapidly growing

export-oriented industries (manufacturing and raw material-based industries) after 1900 when the

equity market became more important, the capital flows were mainly directed through the banking


                                                  9
system. After heavy lobbying from the banking industry, the Banking Act of 1911 allowed banks to

directly own shares and operate as investment banks; the leading bankers controlled the public

commission that wrote the law (see Fritz (1990)). The German banking system was now the role

model since significant infusion of new capital via the (universal) banking system was argued to be

the key to the German economic success. The banks fuelled the speculative stock market boom of

the 10s and 20s both by helping clients to lever up their portfolios and by buying most of the

relatively frequent equity issues via highly levered, stock-financed so called Issuing Companies

(Emissionsbolag) that were very closely affiliated with the banks (see Östlind (1944)). The

established, relation-based banking system thereby extended its influence and control also to the

new equity market that developed too late to become a large independent supplier of risk capital

before the financial markets de facto closed down in the 30s.

        After the crises in the early 20s the banks owned a significant number of shares in the major

listed firms and became the controlling owner; see Table 1. However, since the innovators that

founded the first generation of firms were not equally successful as business men, they often lost

control, particularly after financial crises, or the control of their family was diluted. Given the rather

advanced technical character of the firms, an outside professional manager with background in

engineering and management was often hired to run the firm. That the banks became controlling

owners reinforced this tendency as they lacked the competence to run the firms themselves. The

previously privately controlled firms that dispersed their ownership already when issuing new

equity to finance their investments in the 10s and 20s, in effect came to be run by the management

under supervision of the controlling bank. It is thus no surprise that the overwhelming majority of

the 25 largest firms in 1925 are de facto run by the CEO. In fact, an interesting feature of corporate

ownership in Sweden until after the WWII is the very strong position of the CEO who most often

did not own any shares but often had a significant support from minority shareholders. There are

examples where the CEO won battles with the largest owners by accumulating the votes of the

minority shareholders. The firms were frequently more identified with their CEO than with their


                                                   10
controlling owners; there are several cases where the CEO built a dynasty by letting his son or son

in law succeed him. 4

         After the financial crises in the 30s when banks owned very large portfolios of listed stocks

and de facto controlled the largest, listed firms, the Swedish 1934 (light) version of Glass-Steagall

prohibited them to directly own equity but a few years later they were allowed to transfer their

assets to holding companies if the shares were distributed to the bank’s shareholders. The

controlling owners of the banks thus maintained control, and, in effect, reinforced it, since the

holding companies were formally separated from the banks but were organized as (listed) closed-

end- investment funds (CEIFs) that became the pivotal entity around which the typical three-level

Swedish ownership pyramid is built: a controlling family or bank foundation at the apex and the

listed portfolio firms at the bottom that are controlled via the CEIF at the intermediate level. Figure

1 illustrates the transparent three-level structure of the Wallenberg ownership pyramid in 1996 with

Investor in the middle as the pivotal control vehicle of the largest listed firms in Sweden, and the

tax-exempt family foundations at the top.

         Investor was founded by the Wallenberg-controlled Stockholms Enskilda Bank (today SEB)

while Industrivärden, the other leading holding company (CEIF), was founded by the management-

controlled Svenska Handelsbanken (SHB). Starting already in the 20s, the banks exercised more

influence as shareholders and sometimes also as controlling owners at the same time as being the

major provider of loans. Since the equity markets de facto closed down in the 30s, the banking law

made the financial capital the dominant supplier of capital and the bankers became business leaders

even if the CEOs had a strong position without owning shares. The banks restructured the

financially distressed Swedish industrials using intermediated capital and active management of

their portfolio. A combination of political conditions and financial crises reversed the road to

dispersed ownership.



4
 For example, three generations of Laurin were CEOs of PLM without owning any shares and despite that one father
warned the owners to let his son succeed him.


                                                      11
          It is particularly interesting to observe that the two pivotal reforms of bank ownership in

1911 and 1934 both had the strong support of the Social Democrats; without their votes together

with the Liberals in 1911, there would not have been any reform.5 They wrote the new law in 1934

after gaining power in 1932. When the Social Democrats formed their first minority government in

1920, Hjalmar Branting appointed Johannes Hellner, head of the legal department at Stockholms

Enskilda Bank, to finance minister.

          Because of a sequence of pivotal political decisions, supported both by the Social

Democrats and the political voice of leading capitalists, listed firms in Sweden have primarily relied

on retained earnings— the traditional but also significantly tax subsidized way of financing-- and

bank loans but have only to a very limited extent issued new shares. The largest firms were linked

to their main bank as supplier of credits while the firm’s deposited money and did their banking

with their hausbank. Analyzing credit contracts between listed firms and large banks between 1916

and 1947, Sjögren (1995) finds that 46 of 50 non-financial, listed firms entered contracts that lasted

for at least 5 years. 40% of the listed firms had contracts that lasted for the whole period. More than

30% of the firms had credit, ownership, deposit and bond issuance contracts with only one bank.

But the other side of financial interaction was a tight network of pivotal persons around the bank;

the controlling owners or CEOs of the listed firms were often represented on the bank’s board while

representatives of the bank had seats in the firms’ boards. Fig 2 illustrates the alliances and very

close relations between leading representatives of the major banks, in particular the three largest

ones: Enskilda Banken (Wallenberg), Skandinavbanken and Handelsbanken), and industrial firms in

1960 (see Hermansson (1965); former leader of the Communist Party in Sweden). The lines

(dotted) indicate a direct (indirect) link between the banks and the main borrowers as the banks’

managing directors or board members are members of the board of their main industrial clients.

  In 1905 Marcus Wallenberg Sr argued that Sweden had great untapped resources, able engineers and good workers but
lacked entrepreneurs. His remedy was to start a business school and allow banks to buy shares in listed companies. His
family helped found Stockholm's School of Economics in 1909. And his elder half-brother K.A. Wallenberg, chief
executive of Stockholm's Enskilda Bank, chairman of the Swedish Bankers' Association and an MP, spearheaded an
initiative to allow the largest commercial banks to own shares and to begin acting as investment banks. Against the will of
the Conservative government but with the support of the Social Democrats, his proposal was adopted in 1911.

        Table 2 shows the ownership and control of the largest listed firms right after the war in

1945. The size of the firms has become significantly larger and owners, in particular the Wallenberg

group, have advanced their position even if management control under bank supervision is the norm

while control by founding firms has diminished further. Using a Swedish Census on equity

ownership from 1945, Lindgren (1953) reports that 6–7% of shareholders controlled 65–70% of the

market value. Analyzing records from the shareholders’ general meetings, he finds that a single

individual represented the majority of votes in 60% of the large firms (more than 500 employees)

while three or fewer owners constituted the majority in +90% of these firms. In regularly quoted

firms, a single individual represented the majority in 53% of the cases while in 85% of the firms the

two largest owners represented more than 50% of the votes.

        Fig 3 shows the so called 15 families and their controlling interests and financial networks

in 1960 that Hermansson (1965) identified as the ultimate controlling owners of the listed firms in

Sweden. Of the 50 largest industrial firms 41 are controlled by these families (9 are controlled by

the state or by cooperatives or municipalities). The government commission on Ownership and

influence in private industry (SOU:1968) analyzed the situation in 1963 and identified the same 15

families as well as two bank-related groups as the controlling owners. It is interesting to observe

that the 9 families that were closely tied to Handelsbanken and Skadinavbanken do not exert any

power today or are significantly marginalized; an exception might be the Klingspors who through

their association with the Stenbeck Group still exert power. Of the families with very close personal

ties to Enskilda Banken and Investor, the main family, The Wallenbergs, is still in control even if

diluted in recent years due to large international mergers (ABB, AstraZeneca and Stora Enso) and

concentration of their portfolio investments. While the Bonnier and Johnsson families have been

rejuvenated in the 5th generation and are still influential even if their relative position has declined.

The Wehtje and Throne-Holst families and to a lesser extent the Söderberg family have been

marginalized since 1967 or exert no power today.

          But already in 1967 had the very rapid growth and international expansion of the leading

firms in the 50s and 60s undercut the family control of the largest listed firms even if the families

more frequently changed to a dual-class structure in order to maintain control when raising new

capital. Only 18% of the largest listed firms used such a control structure in 1950 but almost 1/3

used it in 1968. However, as Table 3 illustrates, the financial capital became dominant and the

Wallenberg group in particular had the financial muscles when the equity markets were dormant.

The increasing capital demands to establish a large ownership position is also evident from Table 4

that shows the frequency of ownership positions sorted both by size of ownership (capital—not

votes) and by size of the 100 largest firms in terms of employment in 1950, 1963, 1978 and 1985.

The frequency of small but identifiable holdings have decreased very significantly over the years

while the number of larger positions have increased, particularly in the larger firms, which indicates

that owners with more capital resources have become more dominant, even without considering

their extra voting power due to the frequent use of dual-class shares.

          Table 5 shows that in 1990 the largest firms have become significantly larger due mergers

and acquisitions while the Wallenbergs remained in control. However, the number of management

controlled firms is still high, in particular since three of the most important— Sandvik, Skanska and

Volvo— developed an elaborate system of cross-shareholdings to fend off potential hostile

takeovers as more developed liquid markets facilitated such endeavors. New financial operators

became active during the 80s— Anders Wall, Erik Penser, Sven-Olof Johansson to name a few—

but their importance vanished during the 90s. More recent additions are Carl Bennet, Gustaf

Douglas, Sven Hagströmer, Mats Qviberg, Fredrik Lundberg, Melker Schörling and Jan Stenbeck

who have built and rebuilt existing firms into controlling groups using entrepreneurial financial

skills.

          In recent years the Wallenberg power sphere has let go of control in Alfa-Laval, Esab,

KemaNobel, SAAB Auotmobile, Swedish Match, and partially of Scania and most parts of the

Incentive conglomerate and of Diligentia while established control of Gambro, WM-Data and a


                                                  14
portfolio of smaller firms. The group has also been instrumental in abolishing shares with a 1:1000

voting differential in Electrolux and SKF but not in Ericsson until 2004 when the A-shares were

finally converted to a new differential of 1:10 as the other controlling owner, Industrivärden,

(finally) accepted the negotiated compensation for old A-shares. Instead of a joint voting strength of

+80% ín Ericsson, they now only control around 40% of the votes.

         The long-run survival of controlling families in Sweden looks as follows. 4 (Wallenberg,

Bonnier, Johnson and Söderberg) of the 14 families that established control before 1920 are still

exerting control while 6 (Rausing, Kamprad, Olsson, Wallenius, Persson, and Stenbeck) of the 23

families that founded firms between 1920 and 1965 are still significant and active owners today.

Other vanished slowly and maintained positions until the 80s: Kempe/Carlgren, Salén, Edstrand,

Roos, Malmros, von Kantzow, Throne-Holst, Philipson, Wendt. These families were well-

connected but most likely the entrepreneurial spirit ran out and so did their financial resources.

Newer additions have shown much worse survival rates. The addition in recent years of new family

controlled firms that have grown large very fast has been very limited indeed, the very old firms

still dominate, even if the number of family controlled firms among IPOs had been high; see

Holmén and Högfeldt (2004a).

         Significant legal restrictions on foreign ownership have been an important ingredient of the

Swedish ownership model. Starting with ban on foreigners owning real estate and mines in the 19th

century, foreign ownership was in 1916 limited to 20% of voting rights in Swedish firms owning

natural resources. In the 30s foreign ownership in listed firms was limited to so called unrestricted

shares (representing at most 20% of the voting rights) while restricted shares could only be owned

by Swedish individuals and institutions. 6 There has been a dramatic increase in foreign ownership

of listed shares since 1993 when the restrictions on foreign ownership were abolished. Anticipating

that direct foreign ownership of equity will be allowed as part of the process to join the EU, many



6
 In 1983 the restriction on foreign ownership of natural resources was adjusted to the dual system for foreign ownership
of shares in listed firms in the Corporate Purchase Act (Företagsförvärvslagen).


                                                          15
family controlled firms started to use dual-class shares in the 80s; an overwhelming majority of

them used it in the early 90s.

         Looking further back at trends, direct ownership of listed shares by Swedish households has

decreased from 75% in 1950 to about 25% in 1990 while ownership by Swedish institutions

increased from about 20% in 1950 to 70% in 1990; foreign ownership was well below 10% during

this period but is currently around 35%. These types of portfolio investments are primarily in B-

shares. The original owners have therefore most frequently managed to remain in control by using

dual-class shares more efficiently. But the institutional capital has definitely become much more

important in Sweden and has recently, somewhat reluctantly, started to exert responsibility and

power as large providers of capital but not necessarily as controlling owners.

         Table 6 shows that almost 70 years after the formal legal separation from the banks, the two

closed-end funds— Investor and Industrivärden-- are still the major controlling owners of the

largest listed firms. Even if the pyramids are shallow the combined effect with dual class shares

creates a substantial control multiplier: total equity value of firms controlled by closed-end

investment funds (CEIFs) divided by value of capital invested by controlling owners. For example,

Panel A shows that in year 2000 the controlling owners’ investments in the CEIFs were worth 80

billion SEK, which amounts to 2.6 percent of the market capitalization of the SSE. The total market

value of listed firms de facto controlled by the CEIFs (largest fraction of votes) was 1 786 billion

SEK, which is 57 percent of the market capitalization of 3 135 billion SEK (excluding the market

value of CEIFs).7 The control multiplier was thus 22 (57/2.6) in 2000 and has grown over time.

         Panel B shows the dominance of the two most powerful CEIFs-- Investor and

Industrivärden— where the pivotal owners controlled almost 50 percent of the market capitalization

by investing only two percent of the market capitalization. The control multiplier for the two

combined was thus 23.8


7
 At the end of 2000, 4 (12) of the 10 (20) largest firms (market value equity) in Sweden were controlled by CEIFs .
8
 The dramatic increase in the CEIF control multiplier in 1991 is due to intra group takeovers. Industrivärden acquired
Bahco (previously named Promotion), the other CEIF controlled by the SHB group, while Investor acquired another


                                                         16
         The firms controlled by CEIFs do not only dominate the stock market capitalization. They

are also extremely important for the general economic activity in Sweden. In 2000 CEIF-controlled

firms generated 38 percent of the Swedish GDP.9 And in 1999 their investments constituted 28

percent of the gross capital formation in the business sector. By controlling a large share of the

corporate capital in Sweden, the pyramids’ investment decisions thus have significant impact on the

overall allocation of economic resources. Even if the separation of ownership and control in

pyramid structures is a well-established international phenomenon, the very large control multiplier

in CEIFs may thus have wider economic implications in Sweden.

         Via Investor the Wallenbergs also exert a significant political influence both externally and

within the business community, e.g. by being the controlling owners (together with the government)

of the Stockholm Stock Exchange (SSE), and by in effect setting their own standards for listing

requirements and for ethical codes-- the Swedish version of self-regulation. After the equity markets

were reactivated in the 80s and firms needed more capital as the size of firms grew rapidly, the two

funds’ control has in fact increased because of very extensive use of dual-class shares. Overall

entrenchment of corporate ownership has increased since other listed firms as well as newly listed

IPO firms have also used dual-class shares in an unprecedented way to maintain control; around

60% of the listed firms use dual-class shares. Despite the very significant increase of institutional

capital and foreign capital, corporate ownership is as entrenched as ever in Sweden since the largest

firms are still controlled by an old financial nobility of families in the 3-5th generation, and banks

but to a much lesser extent by institutions that provide the majority of the capital.

         The conflict between private control and increasing capital demands is thus handled in

Sweden by strategic pyramiding and more frequent use of dual-class shares that increases the

separation between control and ownership over time. The pivotal corporate control of the largest

listed firms thus remains in Swedish hands while the capital becomes more institutionalized and

Wallenberg-controlled CEIF: Providentia. The value under control remained roughly the same, but the value of the
controlling owners listed investments decreased. The same year Investor also acquired Saab where the Wallenbergs had a
large direct ownership. In 1994 Investor also acquired Export-Invest, another CEIF within the Wallenberg sphere.

term consequences are. It is a highly political story!


                              2. Social Democracy and Capitalism

The historical agenda of the Social Democrats had three stages: First, the fight for political

democracy (suffrage); then use of parliamentary power to implement social democracy (an

egalitarian welfare state) and finally economic democracy when economic decisions within firms

are not based on strict private rationality but reflect the wider social interest of the firm’s

stakeholders and society at large. The electoral victory in 1932 initiated implementation of the

social democracy. The existing industrial structure with relatively large scale production in a few

export-oriented firms, often with a well-defined controlling owner or a strong manager, suited their

vision of the road to economic democracy quite well. They did not envision direct nationalization of

industries but a stakeholder form of socialism that was more efficient than pure capitalism because

it contained elements of rational planning that would eliminate the waste that irrational, short-

sighted markets create like unemployment and volatile investment cycles. But also because the

necessary economic changes would be faster and more efficiency-enhancing if they take place in

ways that are more socially acceptable for workers. Egalitarianism and economic efficiency were

thus not necessarily contradictory concepts.

        The ideological motivation was the almost existential conflict built into capitalism between

private ownership of capital (firms) and the ever growing social character of production; workers

are not only a production factor but also members of society with social needs, and private

economic decisions within firms will have a wider and deeper impact on society at large. The

immediate needs of the workers within the firm would be protected by their union negotiating with

the employer about compensation and working conditions without governmental intervention

(except for basic regulation), i.e. the adversarial relations between labor and capital would be

respected without board representation of labor. Their more general social interests outside the firm



                                                   18
(e.g. employment, pension, education, and housing) would be protected via social democratic

political initiatives to build a tax-financed public sector that redistributes resources between

individuals and families and provides social services and insurance. The overriding objective was

however to create a full employment economy by promoting growth-enhancing policies that

stimulated labor mobility as well as investments and restructuring within the industrial sector.

Higher growth would not only generate higher wages but also increase welfare by financing the

public sector.

        The Social Democrats´ vision of economic growth was large scale production with ever

growing firm size as resources are better used within a planned hierarchy than in markets, in

particular allocations to large investments and to large scale R&D are more efficient; see e.g.

Wigforss (1980) vol I. To realize the idea of a more efficient, higher stage of capitalism the pivotal

factor was to induce capitalists to invest more, particularly in long-term capital-intensive

production; a good capitalist is one who fulfills his/her basic economic function of investing. The

increasing dependence of very large firms would also make the social character of production more

obvious, and thus also the need to let the firm’s stakeholders and wider societal concerns affect the

private economic decisions within the firm. This was in effect a vision of a corporatist society with

capitalistic firms without capitalists as their decision power would be cut back to the decision to

invest; capital would remain within the firm as investments financed by retained earnings were

heavily tax subsidized. Firms would be run in the interests of society at large and not in the narrow,

private economic interests of essentially nominal owners. Or to use the words of Ernst Wigforss, the

leading ideologue and minister of finance from 1932 to 1949, social firms without owners. Taming

of capitalism did thus not imply immediate takeover of private ownership as long as the capitalists

invested.

        The existing corporate structure of relatively few but large, export-oriented firms closely

affiliated with and often controlled by the major banks actually fitted the corporatist vision very

well. Banks are intrinsically relatively more important than individual firms as they are pivotal


                                                 19
nodes in the network that allocates capital across firms and individuals, which may make it easier

for them to assume wider societal concerns. However, perhaps more importantly, being both major

lenders and providers of equity capital to the often highly levered firms, the controlling banks in

effect acted more like bondholders with focus on long-term survival than as thorough-bred, risk-

taking capitalists. They are therefore more inclined to adopt a long-term perspective with less focus

on myopic profits and more ready to accept social considerations when firing and hiring people. In

particular, they are more likely to finance large, capital-intensive investments that are also socially

desirable. Such owners are also more conducive to respond to tax-based policies that strongly

stimulates re-investment of retained earnings in the large, established firms.10

         The idea of social firms without owners was part of a greater vision of a socially planned

(democratic) economy that consisted of an integrated set of policies. For example, tax-based

policies to promote and direct investments, and regulations to channel household savings to

politically controlled funds that allocate capital to socially desirable objectives like investment in

housing, infrastructure and education. But also programs to stimulate growth by promotion of

innovations, labor market mobility and extensive research in cooperation with the leading capitalists

and their firms. The pivotal element was to generate a higher overall growth rate by policies that

stimulated savings and allocated investments more efficiently by also incorporating wider societal

objectives. The higher growth may then be used to finance the social reform agenda. The programs

would be implemented by the Social Democrats but in close cooperation with the capitalist. How

was it done?



The first step on the road to economic democracy: Cooperation in corporatist spirit

1938 is a pivotal year for two reasons. First, to avoid political intervention and legislation to

regulate the tempestuous labor market relations but also to appease unions that voiced more radical


10
   In the 50s Galbraith’s book from 1956— American capitalism: The concept of countervailing power— and later his
1967 book-- The new industrial State-- had a strong influence on the leading social democrats with its blessing of large
scale production. He was invited by the PM for a two day conference with leading representatives of the Swedish society.


                                                          20
political demands, SAF (The Swedish Confederation of Employers) initiated talks with LO (The

TUC) that resulted in a general accord— Saltsjöbadsavtalet— that regulated their interactions. It

contained rules for negations, conflict resolution, procedures for how to fire and layoff workers, and

for how to limit the detrimental effects on third parties and society at large. The implicit trade-off in

the agreement was that SAF recognized the LO as a full and equal counterparty representing all

workers while LO accepted the employers’ right to unilaterally direct and assign the workload

between workers. The accord had a distinct corporatist character and established a spirit of

consensus and cooperation in labor market relations that stressed common economic goals--

Saltsjöbadsandan— and lasted for almost 40 years until 1976 when LO abandoned the accord. It

was particularly strong after the mid-50s when SAF initiated centralized wage negotiations between

the parties (perhaps due to an increased labor shortage).

        The second pivotal event in 1938 was the reform of corporate taxes to grant free

depreciation allowances for machines and equipment. This system benefited large, profitable and

capital-intensive firms as historical profits (retained earnings) determine future investments. Since

the rules were very generous also by international standards, the previous hostility towards social

democratic policies from leading CEOs of ASEA, Electrolux, LM Ericsson, Separator (Alfa-Laval)

and SKF called TBF (The Big Five) subsided even if this political pressure group existed until

1953. Starting in 1958, the corporate tax system allowed accelerated depreciation for machines and

equipment (max 40% of profits before taxes in an investment fund) while at the same time

depositing 46% of the depreciation allowance in an account in the Central Bank that did not pay any

interest and could only be used if approved by the bank as part of general business cycle policies.

        These two major changes in 1938 made cooperation between labor and capital the norm for

interaction in the corporatist society but biased the firms’ investment criterion as retained earnings

became the major tax-subsidized source of financing. Almost concurrently, the major banks were

allowed to transfer the significant corporate assets they held after the crises in the early 30s to

holding companies organized as closed-end investment funds. By making their temporary


                                                   21
ownership in the aftermath of the crisis permanent, the leading banks became the major owners of

the largest listed firms even if formally only at arm’s length. These three changes shaped what

might be called The Swedish model and had long-run implications for the future political and

economic developments.


The second step: The corporatist innovation model

The social democratic vision of the social firm was a large, capital-intensive firm that invests

heavily, particularly in R&D, in order to be more productive and to grow larger. The basic idea is

that innovations are best developed in and commercially implemented by very large export-oriented

firms. Small firms may innovate but are of limited importance and can be appropriated by the larger

ones that undertake R&D in a more rational systematic way and can carry the large fixed costs

because of their size. The importance of entrepreneurs who develop innovations commercially by

founding new, viable and rapidly growing firms was heavily discounted by the leading Social

Democrats as they argued that capitalism had reached a higher and more advanced stage of large

scale production and innovation. Entrepreneurship was thus implicitly assumed to be exogenously

given despite the fact that the leading Swedish firms were founded not so long ago by innovators

who turned entrepreneurs.

        In fact the Swedish model has two innovation systems (see Erixon (1997)). In the

fundamental system the large, mature firms in engineering and manufacturing produce or acquire

new ideas through their international contacts, transmit them to their domestic plants and other

firms. Exposure to foreign competition and demanding customers abroad force the export-oriented

firms to assimilate and develop new ideas into commercial products. These innovations are not of

break-through character that establishes new firms but they rather shape or reshape existing firms to

maintain their competitive edge. This innovation system is thus an integrated part of the large

export-oriented firms as it both feeds on the international network and is a prerequisite to remain

internationally competitive.




                                                 22
        The regulated system of innovations is more domestically oriented and is based on the

cooperative interaction between public authorities (not primarily universities) and large domestic

firms mainly producing investment goods and advanced products. The authorities may stimulate

innovations through public procurements (military orders); technical cooperation with authorities

(between Ericsson (telecommunication systems) and Televerket (monopoly operator)); through

regulation and setting of standards (housing, energy transmission and consumption, safety and

environment) and through tax policies like the free allowance of R&D expenditures; more than 90%

of the R&D spending in the Swedish manufacturing industry during the postwar period was

financed within the firm.

        The regulated innovation system has probably been the more important since it amounts to

a rather direct form of economic support of the largest firms using the taxpayers’ money, and in

particular since it was part of “planned” economy with coordinated public policies. For example,

behind tariffs and import restrictions, and with support of tax subsidizes for firms to buy trucks and

cars, and heavy public investments in the national traffic system, the transportation industry

developed very fast during the early post-war period. Using regional subsidizes, SAAB and in

particular Volvo integrated backwards and developed an elaborate network of decentralized

suppliers; the transportation industry became a very large employer and a significant export

industry. The saying that what is good for Volvo is good for Sweden was commonly accepted. But

without protection and support of specially designed public policies Sweden would not be the

domicile of two (Scania and Volvo) of the three largest manufacturers of heavy trucks in the world.

Without the public support from universities (elaborate education of engineers and advanced

research), regional subsidizes and large advanced public orders Ericsson would not have become

the largest supplier of telecommunication systems in the world. Similar programs were developed

for huge investments in energy production and systems, for highways and for housing: The Million

Program between1965-1974.




                                                 23
        This cooperation in large scale projects between public authorities and the largest firms had

a significant corporatist and somewhat nationalistic flavor as the unions actively participated and

the coordinated efforts were heralded as part of the national project to build the country in a spirit of

strong consensus under Social Democratic leadership. It is striking how strong the coordination and

integration of the policies (industrial, regional, tax, and labor market policies) were towards a

common goal of developing a more rational, social economy that satisfied the peoples’ needs

through significant interventionism, in particular by directing and coordinating large scale

investments with significant externalities.

        The very large, public investments projects were financed by taxes but also by channeling

of savings to public pension fund (The ATP-system with 3 original AP-funds; later supplemented

by a 4th fund that also invested in equity) that invested in public bonds. Since the equity markets in

effect were closed down until the early 80s and the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance

controlled the capital flows in the financial system, banks and insurance companies were forced to

invest very heavily in public bonds, in particular to finance the very large housing program. To

channel household savings to collective funds and direct their investments was a very important part

of the policies to implement a social democracy and use political power to direct investments. These

policies in effect made the large listed firms even more dependent on retained earnings to finance

investments; the volume of bank loans was regulated and capped while the equity markets were not

operational.


The third step: The labor market model

An important part of the growth policies was the so called active labor market policies initiated by

LO in 1951: The Rehn-Meidner model (see Hedborg and Meidner (1984) and Korpi (1978)). To

sustain a full-employment economy that grows without inflation that idea was to support

reallocation of resources and employment away from industries that are not internationally

competitive to more productive industries with sustainable growth opportunities. Through




                                                   24
solidaristic wage policies that compress the wage differential at a high average level that maintain

the international competitiveness of the export-oriented sector, the overall productivity would

increase by speeding up the closing down of firms in less productive industries while in effect

induce firms in more competitive industries to become more efficient by investing in more capital-

intensive technologies. The model tends to generate excess profits in the most competitive firms as

they pay relatively low wages. Combined with labor market policies that retrain workers and

stimulate their geographic and occupational mobility by compensating them for loss of income and

extra costs when relocating, the model enhances the dynamic efficiency in the economy without

causing too high inflationary pressure. The public sector would thus support and pay for the higher

labor mobility. The model combines an egalitarian ambition with support for reinforced dynamic

restructuring in order to maintain competitiveness, a higher growth rate and higher wages.

        When the negative social consequences of the higher mobility (regional unemployment,

disparate regional economic development and unemployment; increasing geographic concentration

of jobs to the largest firms’ plants) became too costly politically in the early 70s, the labor market

policies changed from encouraging mobility to support lock-in of employees with the current

employer as the new labor market legislation focused on job tenure. At the same time the overall

unemployment rate tended to increase because of the stiffer international competition.


The result: The Swedish model

The Social Democrats accepted the private control of the largest firms while the leading capitalists

accepted their political dominance. Based on mutual acceptance, an elaborate cooperation in

corporatist spirit developed around large infrastructural and industrial projects that benefited the

largest export-oriented firms in engineering and manufacturing. Tax-based policies to stimulate a

high investment level, particularly in the transnational firms, by subsidizing investments in

machinery and buildings and R&D, and give priority to retained earnings and bank loans as the

major sources for financing— institutionalized saving in collective funds. Labor market relations




                                                 25
are peaceful and cooperative but with respect for adversarial interests; no co-determination. The

policies stimulated and supported a high growth rate and propagated the established large-scale

industrial firms with concentrated private ownership but deliberately ignored the formation of new

firms and the importance of small firms: a dynamic but aging social economy with a large public

sector.


More radical policies to implement economic democracy

Profound political, social and economic changes designate the years around 1970 as the defining

moment for the Swedish model; what might be termed its Golden Age came to an end and its

negative effects became all too apparent in a very short space of time. In response to very fierce

critique against the political incumbency, both from within and from outside the labor movement,

LO and SAP became more radical by proposing strongly egalitarian policies with more

redistribution of incomes and opportunities via the public sector that grew very fast during the 70s,

and resulted in the highest taxes in the world.11 More than half of the average income was paid in

taxes but a significant part was directly paid back to the households through redistribution

programs, in particular to families with children, students and pensioners, but also indirectly as

subsidized consumption. At the party congress in 1975 Olof Palme initiated the third stage of the

historical agenda: economic democracy. The timing could hardly have been worse as e.g. the

Bretton Woods system-- the anchor of the strongly interventionist economic policies with control

over capital flows— was collapsing, the oil crises had triggered the deepest economic crises since

the 30s; the new constitution adopted in 1973 used strictly proportional elections (which tend to and

did breed instable minority governments) and SAP was about to lose the 1976 election after 44

years in power.




11
  In retrospect the perhaps most important event was the long, bitter and very politicized, illegal strike in the North in
1969 against poor and unequal working conditions in the mines of the State run corporation LKAB. It triggered a fierce
debate with uncompromising critique against the political incumbency as it made the inequalities visible (see Korpi (1978)
and Hedborg and Meidner (1984)).


                                                           26
          The basic principle of non-intervention by the government in labor market relations was

abandoned in 1974 with The Employment Security Act (LAS) that was written and enacted in

response to direct demands from LO. It provides the employees with an elaborate protection against

dismissal and application of a strict last in – first out principle (LIFO); the only two legal grounds

for dismissal are gross misconduct and redundancies. The 1976 Codetermination Act granted labor

union representatives (strict minority) board representation. The laws were designed with the

conditions of the largest firms in mind as the needs and demands of small firms for more flexible

adjustment were ignored. Since tenure to the current employer becomes more important for job

security than actual skills and effort with the LIFO-principle, the costs of dynamic mismatches

increases, both in the general labor market and within the firms as workers de facto become more

locked-in with firms. To alleviate the higher costs of LAS for small firms, new and more flexible

rules were enacted in 1997.12

          But the most radical proposal was the 1976 decision by the LO congress to implement Ernst

Wigforss´ vision of social firms without owners by a gradual transfer of ownership of all firms with

more than 50 employees to wage-earner funds with trade union and other stakeholder

representatives collectively exercising the funds’ voting and other ownership rights. The actual

transfer of shares would occur by private placements to the funds corresponding to 20% of the

firm’s annual profit. The more profitable the firm is, the faster the transfer of control— at a profit

rate of 10% if would take 35 years for a fund to establish a majority control. Consistent with the

established line of ideas, the fund’s capital would stay within the firm and not be reallocated. The

combined effect of the labor market laws and wage earner funds would thus be an even stronger

lock-in of both capital and labor within firms.




12
   For example, by the use of prearranged temporary employment contracts all firms have the unconditional right to
employ up to 5 persons for a maximum of one year; the possibility for local collective contracts to replace the stipulations
in the law and sidestep the FIFO principle in case of dismissal; annul the right of reemployment for dismissed workers
and to extend the temporary employment beyond a year. In case of redundancies, firms with no more than 10 employees
are allowed to except 2 workers from the FIFO principle by a new law in 2001.


                                                            27
         The proposal had the lukewarm support of the SAP leadership and was the catalyst that

united all members and organizations to the right of the labor movement in the most vociferous

protests ever. A watered-down and rather tame version was enacted in 1984 after the Social

Democrats returned to power in 1982, but was abolished by the Center-Right government in 1992

and not reintroduced by subsequent Social Democratic governments.13 The controversy over wage

earner funds is the only time that private ownership has been really questioned. The debate has been

silent since then.


The orthogonal trajectory away from economic democracy

It is fair to assume that outside observers of the Swedish society around 1980 would have predicted

a bumpy road ahead to economic democracy with more interventionism and stronger political

control over the economy. But the real historical irony is that the actual trajectory chosen by the

Social Democrats when returning to power was orthogonal to the conjectured one as it entailed a

radical break with past policies; e.g. far-reaching deregulation of the banking system, dismantling of

capital flow controls, privatization of state-owned firms and policies that promoted market

competitiveness, and reactivation of equity markets that were liberalized with unrestricted foreign

ownership of shares. The chosen road led to more market economy, not to more socialism.

         A similar radical across the board break with the old did also happen in France with a

Socialist government (see Helleiner (1994). Given the centralist nature of both Swedish and French

political governance structures, the turnaround behavior is broadly consistent with Rajan and

Zingales´ (2003 a and b) political theory of incumbency.14 But perhaps a more direct interpretation

of the Swedish case is that it shows the profound pragmatic character of an encompassing party that

has been heavily entrenched for decades and almost inseparable from the state bureaucracy: to win

elections in order to exercise power is the primary objective. But to win elections the economy has

   The 5 wage-earner funds were financed by a 0.2% pay-roll tax and a 20% tax on real profits above SEK 1 million
during 7 years. When abolished the funds’ capital was distributed to research and venture capital funds to promote new
firms.
14
   Henreksson and Jakobsson (2003a and b) presents an alternative interpretation that emphasizes the break in policies but
does not provide a consistent explanation as they seem to argue that the threat form Socialism is as unrelenting as ever.

to be in order. The very radical change of policies was perceived as necessary to get the economy in

order and promote growth.


Necessary condition for the Swedish model of corporate ownership: Organized labor and capital

One important part of the Swedish model of corporate ownership is that it presupposed the

existence of two identifiable, well-organized parties— labor and capital— that both had a political

and a trade-based, corporative representation. At one level it is of course trivial to characterize the

society as corporatist but why did it become corporatist and why was it so important, in particular

for the Social Democrats?15 My answer pinpoints both external (exogenous) and ideological factors.

The fact that the industrial production was comparatively capital intensive and organized in

relatively few, large and geographically concentrated units in firms controlled by families and part

of networks around the leading banks facilitated organization of both employers and employees. So

did the smallness of the culturally homogenous society, and that industrialization came relatively

late but was then very fast. The other crucial exogenous factor was the strongly export-oriented

character of the largest firms which made both capital and labor heavily dependent on the business

cycles and fostered a sense of fighting the economic elements together. For example, after the deep

crisis in the early 20s, the strategies of both SAP and LO changed to become less adversarial and

more focused on employment and higher wages, which during the long, unprecedented expansion

since the 1890s had been taken for granted.

         The ideological factor is the idea that labor and capital are the two natural adversaries in a

capitalistic economy but that capitalists are crucial for the development of an advanced social

democracy because of their strategic control over investments and thereby of the growth in the

private sector. It was thus not inconsistent with the Social Democratic ideology to accept and

respect (at least for the time being) private ownership, and even reinforce the entrenchment of well-

defined private owners by political support for the use of dual-class shares and pyramiding. In

15
  Reiter (2003) argues that the crucial importance of Saltsjöbadsavtalet 1938 was that it gave the Social Democratic Party
an identifiable counter-party in the countries export-oriented industrialization and the construction of the welfare state
but does not provide any arguments or theory that explains why.


                                                           29
exchange the capitalist did not move their capital or refuse to invest but accepted the political

supremacy, in particular since it involved an elaborate and profitable collaboration with the

government and the unions. The objective of social firms without owners could thus be

implemented (at least partially) via negotiations between the firms’ two major stakeholders with the

(often passive) support of the government (state). The fact that both the workers and the leading

capitalists already were united in encompassing, national and centralized organizations that stressed

overriding goals facilitated consensus-based outcomes, which fitted the ideological view that

society is progressively changed via many small and peaceful steps.

          This combination of exogenous and ideological factors does not fit the political (non-

ideological) theory of Pagano and Volpin (2004) of a corporatist political equilibrium where low

investor protection that benefits controlling owners is exchanged for high employment protection

for labor. This outcome is more likely under a proportional voting system as it fosters the formation

of homogeneous blocks of voters, in particular if also the wealth distribution is unequal or the

production technology has low capital-intensity.16 The listed firms in Sweden did, however, (on

average) use relatively capital-intensive technologies and were primarily dependent on banks for

their financing, not on equity financing as their theory seems to suggest. The strong dependence on

a relation-based banking system thus implies that neither an unequal wealth distribution nor low-

capital-intensity technologies are necessary conditions.17 Interestingly, only since the Swedish

voting system became fully proportional in 1973 have governments without participation of the

Social Democratic Party been formed for the first time since 1932.

          The one-sided emphasis on equity markets, in particular on the primary function, in theories

of political economy of corporate ownership (governance) is difficult to reconcile with the limited

dependence of such markets in Continental Europe for most of the previous century. Ownership is
16
   The intuition behind this result is that proportional voting pushes political parties to cater more to the preferences of
social groups with homogenous preferences, that is, entrepreneurs and employees. This is because under this voting rule
the additional mass of voters that can be attracted by shifting a party’s platform is greater if the shift favors a
homogenous constituency; see Pagano and Volpin (2004).
17
   In a more literal sense it is also difficult to imagine that shareholder minority protection should be on the top of the
minds of controlling owners and that workers should have any reason to develop preferences about such protection. In
particular since they did not own any shares and stock markets were closed down at the time when corporatism reigned.


                                                            30
not more concentrated there because of weaker legal protection of minority shareholders as the

theory seems to presuppose (see also Burkart et al (2003)) but primarily because of political support

for use of mechanisms to separate votes from capital (dual-class shares, cross-shareholdings and

pyramiding); see Holmén and Högfeldt (2004a). Politically motivated concessions, both to the

government and to the workers, are easier to obtain when firms have a well-defined private owner

in control as they are visible in the public arena. It is therefore not surprising that concentrated

private ownership seems to cluster with well-organized labor unions and formation of major parties

along the left-right spectrum. Rather than focusing on formal minority protection, it seems more

natural to pinpoint the political support for concentrated ownership built on separation of ownership

from control and how this systematically affects corporate financing and worker protection.

        I sum up this section by answering one of my main questions: Why did the Social

Democrats not only accept but de facto supported that control of the large, listed firms and of the

pivotal banks, remained in private hands? A possible and plausible answer has three parts. First, the

party’s ideologically and economically pivotal objective to influence or control the large listed

firms’ investment behavior could be achieved through means that did not assume the eclipse of

private ownership. Second, since old family fortunes remained within the firms as working capital

and became foundations (institutions) because of the tax policies, the private capital in effect

became more social and institutionalized, in particular the bank capital; the remaining “private”

character of capital was not a primary problem. Moreover, since formation of large, private fortunes

in newly founded firms via equity financing was limited and controlled by tax policies and

regulations, the wealth distribution did not threaten to become too dispersed.

        Third, implementation of the Social Democrats’ social agenda did not necessitate a

takeover of control of large listed private firms, but could be realized through reforms and policies

that redistribute resources and opportunities via the public sector with strong and persistent electoral

support. While their more radical agenda for economic democracy was more ideological and

abstract and did not generate enough popular support. Besides more tactical considerations, the


                                                  31
heavy and unprecedented entrenchment of the party in general and the fact that individual careers

are closely tied to being in control of the public bureaucracy in particular, de facto narrowed the

primary objective to win elections to remain in power and run the economy in a competent and

stable way to finance reforms.



             3. Corporate Ownership and Development of Financial Markets

Why did not corporate ownership in Sweden separate widely as in the Anglo-Saxon countries? The

leading answer in the literature would be that it is because of weak formal minority protection (see

e.g. La Porta et al (2000) and Burkart et al (2003)). Good protection encourages both outsiders to

invest and founding families to sell out a larger fraction in an IPO since formal rules limit extraction

of pecuniary benefits by management when the firm becomes widely held; both factors stimulate

development of advanced financial markets. Lower protection thus causes founders to maintain a

larger fraction of shares to avoid being exploited, which predicts a negative relation between formal

minority protection on the one hand, and ownership concentration and size of (pecuniary) private

benefits of controlling owners, respectively, on the other. But this line of reasoning does not square

well with the history and politics of corporate ownership in Sweden for several reasons.

        The empirical estimates of Dyck and Zingales (2004) suggest that contrary to the

predictions, the size of private benefits in Sweden are of about the same size as in the Anglo-Saxon

countries that are perceived to have a better formal (legal) minority protection. In particular, there is

no positive relationship between ownership concentration and size of private benefits or a negative

relation with the level of minority protection (see Holmén and Högfeldt (2004a)). Inconsistent with

the leading theory, the only legal regime dummy that is significant is the negative coefficient (lower

private benefits) for Scandinavian origin. Other behavioral factors that are related to the culture and

norms of the society like degree of tax compliance, level of corruption, openness, and crime rates

eliminate the explanatory power of legal regimes and of level of minority protection (see Dyck and

Zingales (2004)). Stock market capitalization in relation to GDP, number of listed firms per million


                                                   32
inhabitants, frequency of IPOs and household frequency of equity ownership (around 55-60%) are

if not higher at least comparable to the Anglo-Saxon countries and higher than for Continental

Europe (see Holmén and Högfeldt (2004a)). The potential for transfer of corporate assets to the

controlling is perhaps largest in pyramiding, but unlike Bertrand et al (2002) for Indian pyramids,

Holmén and Högfeldt (2004b) find no evidence of tunneling in Swedish pyramids.

        Lack of minority protection did not hinder the development of active financial markets

before WW1 (see Rajan and Zingales (2003a). It was neither a prerequisite for the stock market

boom in recent decades as the protection was improved in the early 90s after public scandals

involving self-dealings, particularly in management controlled firms with cross-shareholdings. The

differences in formal minority protection between advanced countries seem too small to explain the

very significant discrepancies in ownership concentration; see also Roe (2002a and b).

        Implicitly, the leading explanation seems to assume that the size of private benefits of

control is larger if the firm becomes listed than if it remains privately held because of the pecuniary

extraction from minority shareholders. But the two most successful firms in Sweden founded after

WWII-- IKEA (founded by Ingvar Kamprad) and Tetra Laval (the Rausing family)-- have both

(aggressively) avoided going public with the explicit argument that their private value of control

would be diluted. Both because of the listing (information and transparency) requirements, and

since their long-run strategy (patiently building an empire) may be compromised by the perceived

myopic character of the stock market. The third most successful firm, H&M (international chain of

clothing stores founded by Erling Persson) went public in the 70s in order to finance its future

growth, in particular its international expansion. But since H&M has consistently generated high

enough profits to fully finance its investments by retained earnings, Stefan Persson, the head of the

family and COB (former CEO), has officially announced that the family regrets the listing; it would

have been better to stay private. Private benefits of control may thus have less to do with pecuniary

extraction of minority shareholders than with the value of being in control (power) per se, which is

maximized when staying fully private. Since a public listing dilutes private benefits of control, a


                                                  33
family-controlled firm goes public only when it needs new capital. More generally, Holmén and

Högfeldt (2004a) find that Swedish IPO firms in general but in particular family firms have a strong

preference for maintained control, and their behavior is consistent with the control theories (see

Bebchuk (1999) and Bebchuk et al (1999)).


Roe´s political theory

Mark Roe’s alternative, political theory that ownership does not separate widely in Continental

Europe since it is not politically and socially acceptable in the social democracies is summarized in

his Clarendon Lectures (Roe (2002a)):

It (ownership; my remark) is concentrated in no small measure because the delicate threads that tie managers
to shareholders in the public firm fray easily in common political environments, such as those in the
Continental European social democracies. Social democracies press managers to stabilize employment, to
forego some profit-maximizing risks with the firm, and to use up capital in place rather than downsize when
markets no longer are aligned with the firm’s production capabilities. Since managers must have discretion in
the public firm, how they use that discretion is crucial to stockholders, and social democratic pressures
induce managers to stray further than otherwise from their shareholders’ profit-maximizing goals. A crucial
political prerequisite to the rise of public firm in the Unites States is the weakness of social democratic
pressures on the American business firm.

        The dual side of this compelling set of arguments is thus that social democracies in Roe’s

wider sense presupposes concentrated corporate ownership but will be less efficient as necessary

changes will be delayed or not take place. The first implication is generally in line with my

arguments but the second one does not fit the history and politics of corporate ownership in

Sweden, perhaps the most quintessential social democratic society, very well. Roe’s arguments do

for example not recognize the pivotal effect in a small open economy of the international,

competitive exposure on labor market relations and conditions within the firm. Being determined by

outside conditions, it is perceived as an objective, exogenous factor that defines the necessary

adjustments and limits the set of possible actions in order to remain competitive and being paid a

higher wage in the current or in another job. As an encompassing union, the well-established

tradition within the LO has been not to fight changes motivated by rational economic arguments but

to accept and actually facilitate them in order for the whole economy to maintain its

competitiveness and growth. In fact, the general economic policy, in particular the labor market


                                                     34
policies, that the Social Democrats pursued with the active backing of the LO were at least until the

70s very growth-oriented as they stimulated structural changes and rationalizations, promoted labor

mobility and provided ambitious retraining and educational programs for the unemployed. Local

unions may voice protest but are not known to obstruct or aggressively fight back if negotiations

about lay-offs and close-downs are done in an orderly manner. Looking through the Swedish lens,

Roe ignores the crucial importance of a public sector that provides an outside protection via

insurance, education and benefit programs that assuages the effects of hardships of unemployment,

which seems to facilitate rather than obstruct necessary economic changes.

         Despite corporatist tendencies and a spirit of cooperation, the adversarial interests of labor

and capital have not been mixed and diluted by co-determination since unions did not get legal

rights to elect board representatives until the 70s; it is a strict minority representation; there are no

dual boards and unions have no right to veto a firm’s decisions. Unlike in Germany, co-

determination was not designed to appease aggressive unions and to fight social and political

instability. Moreover, the general rule has been that politicians should not intervene but to let the

representatives of labor and capital settle disputes and other matters by negotiations. ´

         Overall, Mark Roe paints a picture in too stark colors that exaggerates the differences

between Continental Europe and the U.S. by implying that necessary economic adjustments will not

be efficiently implemented in social democracies.18 The Swedish experience suggests that

efficiency enhancing changes will be undertaken but in a different and more orderly, fair manner,

perhaps somewhat delayed due to negotiations but often with more far-reaching consequences when

they occur.19 The effect of international exposure, a large welfare sector and of different labor


18
   Roe’s arguments presuppose that shareholder value maximization has consistently been the single, hard objective in the
U.S. while the firm’s objective has been diluted by stakeholder concerns in Europe. A reasonable interpretation is that
because of primarily political reasons maximization of shareholder value has been accepted only in certain time periods in
the U.S. but not uniformly, and that the importance of stakeholder value in Europe has also varied substantially with the
political tides. Implicit in Mark Roe’s theory about the negative effects of social democracy is also the idea that the
relation between labor and management is more adversarial than between labor and controlling owners. If anything the
Swedish experience however seems to suggest that the union representatives are more close to the management and that
the relations are based on consensus and trust as long as the firm pursues a reliable, long-term strategy.
19
   An illustrative example is the dramatic down-sizing of Ericsson in recent years from 110 000 employees worldwide to
less than 50 000. A significant fraction of the employees worked in Sweden but very few if any protest were voiced as it


                                                           35
market institutions (encompassing, well organized unions) and ownership structures lead to

outcomes that differ perhaps more in form than in substance. The more negative, institutional

aspects of the Scandinavian model are the significant lock-in effects of both labor (e.g. strict

application of the last in first out rule) and capital within the old, established firms that will be

stable and relatively efficient while the addition of new growing firms will be hampered.


An alternative political theory why ownership does not separate widely

My analysis of the history of Swedish corporate ownership, however, suggests another political

theory why ownership does not separate widely: listed firms do not have to disperse ownership and

dilute private benefits of control in order to raise new capital since their dependence of the equity

market is limited because of political decisions and institutional factors. This is particularly true for

the largest listed firms with well-established networks. The focus is on the equity markets´ primary

function— provision of capital— and its political sensitivity; not on liquidity provision. The basic

idea is that political decisions will determine how dependent firms are on external financing: if

capital for investments can be supplied primarily through retained earnings, by borrowing in banks

or by infusion of private capital, firms have no immediate need to go through the strictures of equity

offers and place a larger fraction of shares in a wider group of investors and dilute private benefits

of control in the process.

         My political theory of corporate financing starts with the assumption that corporate control

based on separation of control from ownership via mechanisms to separate votes form capital like

dual-class shares and pyramiding presupposes political support to be socially acceptable. In the

Swedish case, the political legitimacy of entrenched private ownership is traded-off against that the

implicit guarantee that the largest listed firms do not migrate and that they continue to invest,

thereby generating economic resources to finance the political reform agenda. The separation of

control from ownership has however a profound effect on corporate financing as it drives a


was done in an orderly, negotiated way. The unions did not obstruct but helped to accommodate the changes as they were
perceived as necessary in order for Ericsson to survive in the long run.


                                                         36
significant wedge between the costs of internal and external capital. New external shareholders

demand compensation (discounts) for the agency costs inherent in the separation, which makes

external equity more expensive. Shareholders seem to attach significant discounts to privately

controlled firms using dual-class shares (10-15%) and to pyramid holding companies (25-30%) to

separate votes from capital; see Holmén and Högfeldt (2004b). But internal capital is relatively

inexpensive for the controlling owners since they have access to all of the firm’s cash flows via a

small (less than proportional) capital investment.

        The wedge caused by the separation of control from ownership therefore generates an

enhanced (political) pecking order of financing: Strong reliance on retained earnings and borrowing

but avoidance of equity issues, in particular of large public offers as they would dilute control and

also be extra costly due to the discounts to new outside shareholders; see Holmén and Högfeldt

(2004b). The pecking order is enhanced since it is caused by agency costs inherent to the ownership

structure and not primarily by asymmetric information costs, and since it predicts the absence or

strong avoidance of public offers; see Högfeldt and Oborenko (2004).This is the key mechanism

that explains why firms in countries with prevalent use of dual-class shares and pyramiding like

Sweden have more concentrated ownership but are also much less dependent on the primary equity

markets and why they do not need to disperse ownership.

        The connection between the politics of corporate ownership and financing is particularly

conspicuous in regulation of banks’ ownership of equity since the 1930s. When the Swedish version

of the Glass-Steagal Act was enacted in 1934, commercial banks were no longer allowed to directly

own shares in other firms (a right granted them in 1911 because of the pivotal support from the

Social Democrats). Reflecting the strong political and economic interests of leading bankers but

with support of the Social Democrats, banks were, however, a few years later allowed to transfer

their portfolios of controlling interests to holding companies that were organized as closed-end

investment funds (CEIFs) and distribute the funds’ shares to the banks’ existing shareholders. The

controlling owners of the commercial banks at the apex of the pyramid thus controlled the largest


                                                     37
firms at the bottom via CEIFs at the intermediary level that were listed. Since pyramiding was

combined with use of dual-class shares the separation between votes and capital was multiplicative.

        The new laws in effect made two dominating banks (SEB and Svenska Handelsbanken) the

controlling owners of the largest listed firms, and bank loans the major way to finance the firms’

investments besides retained earnings, in particular in the decades when the equity markets were

dormant. Corporate control was therefore via political decisions directly linked to the control over

intermediated capital, which tend to make equity financing much less likely. Unlike in the US, the

pyramids were politically supported via the tax system: inter-corporate dividends as well as re-

invested capital gains were de facto tax-exempt; see Holmén and Högfeldt (2004b). Since this

preferential tax treatment is pivotal for the existence of pyramids (see Morck (2003)), it is the

critical element in the Social Democrats’ consistent support of the very heavy entrenched private

ownership of the largest listed firms in Sweden. It is perhaps also the very reason why capital did

not migrate.

        More generally, since the Social Democrats for ideological reasons focused on the largest

established firms and supported both retained earnings via tax benefits and a relation-based banking

system, the two major ways to finance investments both had strong political support. They were

also in general very skeptical towards the turbulent equity markets that are conducive to economic

and social changes, which is antithetical to their political ambitions to provide stability and social

reforms in an orderly, planned manner. But for egalitarian reasons they were, and still are, even

more skeptical towards the equity markets’ primary function. The combination of entrepreneurship

and equity financing will facilitate creation of large private fortunes and break the social status quo,

i.e. limit the possibilities for social control and for redistribution. Since a well functioning primary

market will widen the income distribution but in particular the distribution of wealth and ownership

of assets, new equity issues have consistently been disfavored by a tax disadvantage. Reactive

financing via retained earnings that benefits incumbent owners by locking-in the capital in the

existing firms was preferred to a more proactive and aggressive financing mode via the primary


                                                  38
equity market that is more likely to implement faster and more drastic changes that are likely to

challenge the incumbents’ power. This outcome is also the most likely since the new entrepreneurs

and firms lack political power while the well-organized incumbents are united by common interests

and have political voice.

          As long as this closely integrated system of ownership and financing is stable, the firms do

not need to raise substantial amounts of new capital from the equity markets. And when firms were

highly levered in the 70s and needed more equity capital as both profits and credits were squeezed,

and more restructuring takeovers occurred, there was strong political support for the incumbent

(often capital-constrained) owners to use of dual-class shares to separate votes from capital

contribution in order to maintain control also after issues of equity.20 Hence, for a combination of

political and institutional reasons, ownership does not separate widely since listed firms are not

directly dependent on equity markets to finance their investments.

          My alternative political theory of corporate financing has several testable implications. The

first one is that the very entrenched and relation-based banking system will block the development

of arm’s length markets for corporate bonds; if they exist they will not be well developed. Hence, it

should not come as a surprise that there are no domestic corporate bond markets in Sweden and that

the largest listed firms use the international bond markets but only to a limited extent.

          The second prediction of the theory is that the volume of IPOs and SEOs on average should

be very small. Fig 4 shows that the annual volume (2002 prices) of new equity and bond issues on

average corresponds to about 10% of gross domestic capital formation before 1931 but averages

only about 1% since then. The peak in 1917-1918 is a result of the speculative war economy fuelled

by excessive buying of new issues by the highly levered and bank-affiliated Issuing Companies

20
   The legislators’ motivation for use of dual-class shares in the new corporate law (Proposition 1997/98: 99 p 120— my
translation) illustrates the political support: The use of shares with different voting rights has a long tradition in Swedish
law. Dual-class shares are very common among listed companies in Sweden. The dual-class share system has significant
advantages. It makes it possible (facilitates) to have a strong and stable ownership function even in very large companies.
Thereby creating the necessary conditions for an efficient management as well as for the long-term planning of the firm’s
activities. Shares with different voting rights also facilitate for growing companies to raise new capital without the
original owners losing control. There is no evidence that the dual-class share system has caused any noticeable negative
effects…Dual-class shares can significantly promote the efficiency and development of individual firms as well as of the
business sector in general.

sentiments by issuing equity and, in particular, debentures (unsecured bonds) both domestically and

internationally to save his highly levered and very opaque empire before it collapsed after he shot

himself in Paris in 1932 and triggered the worst financial crises in Sweden.

         The more recent peak in 1992 around 5% is the result of extremely low investments due to

very high interest rates in the wake of the second worst financial crises when a speculative real

estate bubble busted. It was fuelled by excessive credit expansion by the recently deregulated banks.

The large volume in 1999 is, of course, due to a record number of IT-related IPOs, particularly

related to mobile internet and IT-based services. For comparative purposes, the table does not

include the 30 Billion SEK rights issue in 2002 by the financially distressed Ericsson since it is the

largest SEO ever. It is particularly interesting to note that this single issue corresponds to 13% of

the total volume of all SEOs (2002 prices) during the last 100 years; 25% of all SEOs since 1970

and 40% of all SEOs during the exuberant 90s (about 10 billion dollars). The listed firms’

dependence on the equity markets for new capital has thus been very limited indeed in Sweden.

         Because of the strong preference for control, in particular among family firms, a third

implication is that dual-class shares should be used very frequently and that SEOs should follow a

specific pecking ordering ranked by the extent to which they dilute control: first rights issues, then

private placements followed by directed issues (stock financed acquisitions) and finally public

offers that are strongly avoided. Moreover, the issues should be relatively small and only offer low

voting B-shares. Rights issues should have the largest size since they dilute control the least. The

empirical evidence from 233 IPOs between 1980 and 1997 in Holmén and Högfeldt (2004a) and

from Swedish SEOs since 1984 in Högfeldt and Oborenko (2004) are consistent with this

implication since almost 90% of the privately controlled IPO firms use dual-class shares and there

is a well-defined pecking order of SEOs. In particular, the amounts raised are very small and rights

21
  The SEO volume in 1917-1918 corresponds to about 2.5% of the total stock market value while the volume in 1927-
1929 is about 7% of the market cap.

issues are by far the largest. The fastest growing IPO firms are controlled by the

founder/entrepreneur and finance their expansion by rights issues, normally within 18 months after

the listing.22

          It is particularly interesting to observe the absence of public offers, which are both the most

common and the largest offers in the U.S. but infrequently used outside the Anglo-Saxon countries.

Relatively large public offers are especially important in the financing of newly founded firms that

grow really fast (gazelles). But they are also instrumental to disperse ownership widely at and after

the IPO. The very infrequent use of public offers may thus explain both why ownership does not

disperse widely and why very few young firms grow to become really large in Sweden. To

understand why public offers are uncommon in say Civil Law countries may also explain why

financial markets in general and primary equity markets in particular are less developed there.23 My

theory suggests that because of the politically supported control structure combined with the strong

preference for maintained private control, public offers are last in the enhanced pecking ordering

since they by their larger size dilute control the most and are most costly because of the required

discounts to new shareholders.

          More generally, my theory predicts that the following stylized facts about the corporate

system cluster: (i) concentrated ownership because of extensive use of devices to separate votes

form capital; (ii) secondary markets relatively well-developed if dual-class share are frequently used

(B-shares provide liquidity) but primary markets particularly politically vulnerable and

underdeveloped; (iii) equity financing of investments far less important than borrowing and use of

retained earnings (small volume of IPOs and SEOs) and limited market timing; (iv) pecking order

also of SEOs: rights issues (largest) and private placements most frequent while public offers are

absent or exceptionally few; (iv) very few young firms grow fast to become really large; (v)

22
   If the founders relinquish control, they do so by selling their control block before the IPO, but keep the block intact both
at the IPO and afterwards until they sell it. Family-controlled firms often finance relatively small acquisitions by issuing
B-shares (see Holmén and Högfeldt (2004b) and Högfeldt and Oborenko (2004))).
23
   Even if trading volumes and market caps are less developed than in the Anglo-Saxon countries because of the extensive
use of dual-class shares, the liquidity provided by trading of B-shares may still be large: The number of IPOs is not
necessarily small since dual-class shares facilitate maintained family control after the IPO and stock financed acquisitions.


                                                              41
undeveloped markets for corporate bonds (due to the strong relation-based banking system) and (vi)

relatively equal distribution of wealth and incomes. Because the separation of ownership from

control drives a wedge between the costs of internal and external capital, my theory predicts that

firms controlled by pyramids or via extensive use of dual-class shares will have higher investment-

cash flow sensitivities; see Holmén and Högfeldt (2004b) for supporting empirical evidence.

           The reasons why ownership did not separate widely in Sweden are thus according to my

theory profoundly political: Use of dual-class shares and pyramiding, which are politically

supported, drives a wedge between the costs of internal and external capital that causes an enhanced

(political) pecking order of corporate financing. The political support for separation of control from

ownership and for non-equity financing benefit established firms and in effect align the interests of

the incumbent political power with incumbent capital (in particular the leading banks) as corporate

control is maintained and actually reinforced (despite increasing needs for new capital) while

formation and growth of new firms by equity financing was effectively disfavored for egalitarian

reasons.

             4. A Critical Evaluation of the Swedish Model of Corporate Ownership

At this point it is convenient to oversimplify and pinpoint three constituent parts of the Swedish

model of corporate ownership. The first is the primarily exogenous character of production: capital-

intensive, large scale, export-oriented production (raw materials, manufacturing and engineering)

by relatively few large, transnational and privately controlled firms. The second is the changing

international market conditions due to political, economic (competition) and technological factors.

The final is the endogenous effects of prolonged social democratic policies. We focus on the long-

run economic effects by looking at the impact of three major Social Democratic policies: (i)

Political support for a relation-based banking system and control of the largest listed firms via bank-

controlled closed-end investment funds. (ii) Political support for dual-class shares and other devices

to separate votes and capital in order to facilitate maintained private control with well-defined

owners despite increasing capital needs and institutionalization of ownership. (iii) Consistent


                                                  42
political focus on the largest listed firms and strong preference for retained earnings and bank loans

as the major ways to finance investment while in particular disfavoring of equity financing and

equity markets in general. These policies jointly create the foundation for the enhanced political

pecking order of financing and have three major long-run effects.


Overinvestment by large firms in old industries and underinvestment of new firms in growing
industries, biased distribution of firm size and age, and lower overall growth

The strong dependence on retained earnings and debt in the enhanced pecking order, reinforced by

the preferential tax treatment, implies that firms’ investment criterion has been systematically

biased since past profits to a significant degree influence or determine the allocation of investments,

not expected future profits.24 This benefits firms in old established and capital-intensive industries

with large real assets that have consistently been profitable and are part of a leading bank’s

network. But the policies disfavor young firms in new lines of business based on human capital and

services with strong growth potential and in need of risk capital. Since incumbent firms have access

to relative inexpensive internal capital while new firms are hampered since they use the primary

equity markets only to a limited extent, the biased investment criterion is likely to create systematic

under- and overinvestment problems that tend to have a negative effect on the overall growth in the

economy. The largest firms that will tend to invest too much are in mature industries with lower

future growth potential while the new and smaller firms tend to invest too little and are likely to be

in lines of business with higher growth potential. These effects are reinforced by the fact that IPO

firms for control reasons are not inclined to use large public offers to grow fast and since older

firms that finance their investments via retained earnings tend to have realized returns that are


24
   The corporate and ownership tax policies are not the direct cause behind the enhanced pecking order of financing since
they are primarily supportive of the ownership policies that promote separation of control form ownership. The tax
policies have at the margin disfavored direct ownership by households and benefited institutional ownership, and
disfavored equity as a source of capital, in particular when the inflation rate is high, while favoring debt and retained
earnings. Table 7 shows the effective marginal tax rates for different type of owners and sources of financing at points in
time when taxes were revised. A negative marginal tax rate indicates that the rate of return is greater than before: a
marginal tax rate of -83% for a debt financed investment by a tax-exempt institution transforms to 10% real return before
tax to 18.3% return after tax. The taxes on debt, equity and retained earnings were rather differentiated before the big tax
reform in 1991 but have become more harmonized since then. Note that the most negative tax effects on equity ownership
by households occurred before 1985 when the equity markets were dormant in Sweden.


                                                            43
significantly below their cost of capital; investments financed via debt or equity do not seem to

systematically underperform, see Holmén and Högfeldt (2004b). The free cash flow problem thus

seems to be particularly serious for firms that have a well-defined owner in control and rely on

retained earnings; they also tend to have higher investment-cash flow sensitivity. Inefficient

investments due to (free) access to retained earnings may be the very reason why firms with strong

separation of control and ownership are traded at a discount.

Since the labor market laws in recent decades have promoted tenure with an employer, the

combined effect of investment and labor market policies is therefore a significant lock-in of both

labor and capital within the existing, large firms and their controlling owners. The biased

investment criterion and the lock-in effects endogenously create a stronger path dependency as the

firms’ future developments (size, investments and growth) are more directly tied to past

performance. The long-run effects on the firm structure will be a survival and growth bias: an

overrepresentation of very large and old firms in mature industries and an underrepresentation of

new and fast growing firms in new industries. Broadly consistent with this conjecture, Sweden has

one of the most skewed distributions with an extreme dominance of very large and very old

multinational firms still controlled by Investor and Industrivärden, and very limited addition of new

fast-growing firms. Fig 5 shows for example that 31 of the 50 largest firms in 2000 were founded

before 1914. No firm founded after 1970 has been added to the list. Moreover, measured by number

of the Fortune 500 firms in 1991, Sweden ranked as #6 with 15 firms on the list and with the

highest number of firms per GDP unit (one billion US (PPP adjusted)): 0.104 (see Jagrén (1993)).

The size distribution of Swedish firms (small, medium and large) is 84.1%, 12.1% and 3.7%,

respectively, compared to an international average size distribution of 87.5%, 10.2% and 2.2%,

respectively, which shows the bias towards larger firms (see Henrekson and Jakobsson (2001)).




                                                 44
          He, Morck and Yeung (2003) find that greater instability in the ranking over time of a

country’s largest firms is associated with faster economic growth.25 Economic growth is thus more

likely to be caused by the rise of new large firms than by the prosperity of established large firms.

Sweden has one of the most stable rankings over time but really stands out in their analysis as the

only country where the continuity of control over time actually increases.26 That lock-in of family

control for generations may have negative effects is a well-known phenomenon. For example,

Holmén and Högfeldt (2004b) report a robust 14% discount for large listed firms that are heir

controlled. The conjecture that incumbency tends to breed complacency and stagnation, in

particular when investments are financed via retained earnings, is consistent with Morck’s at al’s

(2000) finding in a cross-country analysis that countries with a larger fraction of heir controlled

firms tend to have a significantly lower overall growth rate. The dominance of the same firms

among the very largest for decades as well as the extreme continuity of control in Sweden is thus

consistent with a lower overall growth rate in the economy.

          The strong path dependency is particularly conspicuous for the very important closed-end

investment funds that control the largest listed firms since their shares trade at a significant discount

(on average 25-30%) relative their portfolio, which in effect makes it economically impossible for

them to raise new equity capital via SEOs. The funds thus prefer that their portfolio firms primarily

finance their investments by retained earnings and loans since these sources are relatively cheap

although the firms are traded at a 6-8% discount because being controlled via a pyramid; see

Holmén and Högfeldt (2004b). Since intercorporate dividends are not taxed if they just pass through

the pyramid holding company (the closed-end investment fund) on their way from the portfolio

firms to the ultimate shareholders, the controlling owners are even more inclined to retain earnings

in the portfolio firms. Since realized capital gains are not taxed if reinvested, the pyramid holding

25
   The faster growth is primarily due to faster growth in total factor productivity in industrialized countries, and faster
capital accumulation in developing countries; see He et al (2003).
26
   They observe a very interesting fact: Note that control continuity is always less than corporate stability, except in the
case of Sweden. This is because the Wallenberg family took control prior to 1996 of two new top ten firms that arose
between 1975 and 1996. These two new top ten firms thus have a continuity of control. This situation arises in no other
country; see He et al (2003).


                                                            45
company avoid paying dividends themselves. The combined effect of the preferential tax treatment

and the pyramid control structure is therefore that the portfolio firms systematically pay out less

dividends and tend to overinvest, which the significantly higher investment-cash flow sensitivity

and the significantly lower realized return on investments financed via retained earnings for

pyramid firms shows (Holmén and Högfeldt (2004b)). Moreover, since the two leading banks are

both controlling owners of the most important pyramids and the major providers of loans to the

portfolio firms, they tend to behave more like bondholders: accumulation of hidden reserves and

choice of conservative investment strategies that focus on long-run survival and stable cash flows,

not on risk taking and entrepreneurship.

        The lock-in effect and the biased investment criterion have especially negative long-run

effects since the portfolio firms are in old and often capital-intensive industries. In particular since

these firms tend to invest heavily in R&D, often along the narrow trajectory previously chosen by a

specializing strategy (few and highly specialized areas with relatively large production volumes),

and not in a diversifying direction in alternative technologies (see Erixon (1997)). The old

established firms have their comparative advantage in the commercial implementation and

marketing of large scale research projects, not in major breakthrough patents and innovations.

While neither R&D investments nor the number of resulting patents are necessarily small, the

endogenous effect is that it perpetuates a development path that leads to an even smaller and

narrower base of highly specialized firms that might not generate high growth and that may also be

economically vulnerable due to shifts in technology. An interesting fact is that of 100 major

innovations in the Swedish industry during the post-war period more than 80 occurred in large firms

(see Granstrand and Alänge (1995)).

        Through strong path dependency, the old established, large scale industrial structure is thus

pushed to its limits by political and endogenous economic decisions that determine the investment

strategies and how they are financed. After 100 years of unprecedented growth (among the 3

highest ever recorded for a 100 year period), Sweden ranked as one of the three wealthiest OECD


                                                  46
countries in 1970. Due to lack of resiliency of the stale economic and political structures, recurrent

and prolonged adjustment problems in the aftermath of the oil crises (6 devaluations), growth has

been significantly lower during the last 30 years and Sweden now ranks behind neighboring

countries. The relationships presented here between the characteristics of heavily entrenched

corporate control and growth provide a more plausible and direct explanation of why the Swedish

economy has shown signs of stagnation than the alternative that pinpoints the negative effects of

higher taxes and of a larger public sector; see Lindbeck (1997).27


Maintained private control by increasing separation of votes from capital makes the capital base
too small and increases agency costs and inefficiencies.

When the increased international competitive pressure in the 60s and 70s forced highly levered

Swedish firms to invest more, particularly in R&D, and needed to finance takeovers and mergers to

exploit scale advantages, the volume of SEOs increased considerably for the first time since the 30s.

Because of the strong preference for maintained control, the frequency of listed firms that use dual-

class shares increased significantly; from 18% in 1950 to 32% in 1968; 54% in 1981 and peaked at

around 80% in 1992 to settle at 63% in 1998 and below 60% after the IT-bubble busted (see

Agnblad et al (2001), Holmén and Högfeldt (2004a) and Henreksson and Jakobsson (2003a and

b)).28 The high frequency of dual-class shares to separate votes from capital is thus a fairly recent

phenomenon and most prevalent among family controlled firms (see Agnblad et al (2001)). This

development has received political support since firms with well-defined private owners in control

are believed to be more efficient; families have a long-term commitment as the growth of private

fortune is tied to the firm’s development. In the 80s and particularly after 1993, when all restrictions

on foreign ownership of shares were abolished, the political ambition (sometimes explicit but most

often implicit) has been to promote maintained control in order to keep corporate headquarters,



27
   It is ironic that since 1997 when Lindbeck presented his dire and one-sided predictions about the future development of
the Swedish economy, the macroeconomic performance and growth has at least equaled if not surpassed that of
comparable EU countries.
28
   In 1950 only 18% of 100 largest firms used dual-class shares; 29% in 1963; and 42% in 1978.


                                                           47
specifically R&D, marketing and strategic functions, in Sweden. This illustrates the political

foundation and sensitivity of corporate control in Sweden. The political support for extensive use of

dual-class shares and pyramiding is traded-off against the indirect (direct) promise that the largest

firms continue to invest in Sweden and do not migrate. Dual-class shares and pyramiding are in fact

the very cornerstones of the Social Democratic model of corporate ownership. 30

          Despite much larger foreign ownership (35% of outstanding shares), almost exclusively via

B-shares, and much more institutional ownership, the old families and closed-end investment funds

have been able to maintain a somewhat diluted control by increasing use of dual-class shares

combined with reinforced protection of incumbent owners via mandatory bid rules and more

stringent takeover rules that de facto increase entrenchment. However, in very large international

mergers motivated by scale effects and very large R&D costs, the separation of votes and capital

has not been enough to maintain control; Investor lost control of Stora (pulp and paper) and Astra

(pharmaceutical) in mergers with Enso and Zeneca, and earlier of ASEA in a merger with Brown

Boveri— ABB. Despite some dilution of control and much larger capital needs, it is remarkable that

established families and closed-end funds are still very often in control. But the increased separation

between votes and capital undercuts the very justification for capitalistic firms as a small capital

contribution generates control over all other investors´ capital, in particular as the vote lever is often

justified on historical grounds. The system therefore also becomes more politically vulnerable as for

example the recent EU-initiative to abolish dual-class shares shows.

          The strong separation between votes and capital generates two principal types of costs that

are primarily borne by the non-controlling shareholders. Either costs because of extraction of

   A public inquiry about voting rights states explicitly that dual-class shares could be useful to ascertain that Swedish
firms remain controlled by Swedish interests (see SOU 1986:23). More recently, the fight against EU proposals to in
effect abolish the use of dual-class shares has been spearheaded by the Wallenberg family via Investor whose shareholders
paid for the campaign. The Social Democratic government announced that it would do everything within its power to back
the Wallenbergs and fight the proposal. The right to use dual-class shares is declared to be a national interest.

pecuniary benefits (self-dealing) by the controlling owners or agency costs due to bad (inefficient)

decision making. Since the corporate law is designed to handle the problems with self-dealing and

legal as well as tax enforcement are stringent, agency costs are the most likely reason behind the

discounts on firms with levered control structure; see Roe (2002a). For example, Holmén and

Högfeldt (2004b) did not find any indication of tunneling (corporate stealing) in Swedish pyramids

that have the most levered control structures. Moreover, since the increased use of dual-class shares

to maintain control implies that the capital base for control becomes smaller, i.e. the leverage effect

in votes increases, which tend to increase the agency costs as the difference between the power to

make pivotal decisions and the private value at risk for controlling owners increases. This effect is

amplified by the lock-in of control for generations by the same family. In Schumpeterian spirit,

such dynamic agency costs can be substantial as the entrepreneurial genes and drive do not replicate

easily; see Holmén and Högfeldt (2004a)). The discounts on family controlled firms thus most

likely gauge such agency costs due to misallocation of control rights to heirs that make inefficient

decisions, e.g. due to significant lower returns on investments financed via retained earnings; see

Cronqvist and Nilsson (2003) and Villalonga and Amit (2004).

        The importance of agency costs due to a significant lock-in of control over the largest firms

for a very long time can best be illustrated by the very large discounts on closed-end investment

funds (CEIF -- the pyramid holding companies); see Holmén and Högfeldt (2004b). The vote lever

is particularly large since Swedish funds combine separation via pyramiding and dual-class shares,

which generates a multiplicative effect. Since Investor has a voting differential of 1:10 while

Ericsson was the only listed firm on the SSE (until 2004) that had a 1:1000 differential, the

multiplier for the ownership of the Wallenberg family in Ericsson is 125— their own contribution is

only about 0.8% of Ericsson’s capital while they control +80% of the votes jointly with

Industrivärden. After the reform, the two major owners control around 40% of the votes.

        Fig 6 shows that the discount on Investor’s share price relative the fund’s net asset value

from 1930 to 2002 has been substantial (averages about 30%), in particular in the 70s when its was


                                                  49
around 40%. After being cut to almost 20% in the early 90s, the discount is now again back at

around 35%. In addition, the portfolio firms have a 6% discount due to being under pyramidal

control. Analyzing all CEIFs, Holmén and Högfeldt (2004b) find that the discount increases linearly

with the controlling owner’s degree of separation between votes and capital in the fund and with the

number of years the present owner has been in control. The discount is thus significantly higher for

founder-controlled pyramids, i.e. it gauges the cost of pyramidal power as it becomes more levered

and more entrenched. The results are consistent with controlling owners becoming more dependent

on the multiplicative separation between votes and capital over time. Pyramidal separation is thus

not a static phenomenon since the use of dual class shares is intensified in order to maintain control.

        The discounts are primarily explained by dynamic agency costs (inefficient decisions)

associated with the heavily entrenched power. For example, Holmén and Högfeldt (2004b) report

that the CEIFs’ active portfolio management generates a return that is significantly below their cost

of capital when capital gains are re-invested instead of being distributed. In particular, a passive

portfolio management by just holding the portfolio generates a significantly higher return than

actively managing it according to the pivotal owners’ specific interests. This in effect limits their

investments to projects where they have a controlling interest, which in turn often implies that bad

projects are supported too long; the soft return requirements on retained earnings reinforce these

effects. The lower returns translate to into a loss (outflow) in the shareholders’ return stream from

the investment.

        A standard neoclassical model predicts that the discount is simply the ratio of the

capitalized value of the outflow, which does not go to the CEIF’s shareholders, to the total value of

all outflows from the CEIF, i.e. including the dividends going to the shareholders, see Ross (2002).

Holmén and Högfeldt (2004b) empirical estimate of this theoretical ratio— fraction of all outflows

that do not go to the shareholders— gives a discount of 25.3 percent compared to the actual average

discount of 26 percent. The size of the agency costs is on average 0.7 percent of the CEIFs portfolio

value, and increase with separation between votes and capital in the CEIF. Since the size of the


                                                  50
discount is directly linked to the control structure and power of the controlling owners, the model in

effect explains the large discounts in Sweden, and provides a solution to the closed-end fund puzzle.

         Shareholders are in principle privately compensated for the costs of pyramidal ownership

through the discounts, but pyramiding has also a negative impact on the efficiency of the capital

allocation in the economy that is probably significantly larger. Almeida and Wolfenzon (2004a) has

developed an interesting model of the equilibrium allocation of capital when the comparative

advantage of capital markets in reallocating capital, especially in time of change, is not at work.

They show that the overall efficiency may decrease in the presence of conglomerates, even when

capital is allocated efficiently within the conglomerate. The reason is that local efficiency within a

subset of firms does not correspond to global efficiency as capital is not efficiently allocated

between all firms.

         Unlike with conglomerates, the problem with pyramidal control is not inefficient internal

capital markets since no direct capital transfers between pyramid firms are possible. The major

problem is instead that too much capital is locked into the separate firms within the pyramid and not

redistributed since the highly levered control structure causes an enhanced (political) pecking order

since external capital is significantly more expensive than internal capital.31 Firms controlled by

pyramids are thus likely to be overcapitalized by relatively cheap internal capital, which may lead

to overinvestment, particularly in fixed assets (PPE) and R&D, and lower returns than required by

the market (cost of capital). Pyramids may thus have a strategic negative impact on corporate

financing and investments because of their limited dependence on the primary equity markets and

because they retain too much earnings in firms that are primarily in mature industries.32 Since not

enough of the old capital (for control reasons) is reallocated via the external equity markets to e.g.

fledgling firms in new, growing industries, pyramiding hampers both the development of financial

31
   Unlike the discount on conglomerates, the large discount on pyramid holding companies cannot be explained by
inefficiencies in the portfolio firms since this is already reflected in the value of the holding firm’s portfolio.
32
   The reason why pyramids exist is profoundly political; see Morck (2003) and Holmén and Högfeldt (2004b). Their
structure is however not primarily explained by the controlling owners desire to exert power as such but to get control
over a large and relatively cheap source of financing; control over very large cash flows via a small but strategic
investment; see Holmén and Högfeldt (2004b).

markets and the overall growth. These negative effects may be particular significant in Sweden

since the pyramids have had strategic control over the largest and oldest listed firms for decades.


Preference for maintained control implies limited use of equity financing and that too few firms
grow to became large
Egalitarianism may be conducive to dynamic changes as evident from the labor market policies that

were designed to promote mobility and structural changes in socially more acceptable forms. But

when the objective to promote or contain a less dispersed distribution of wealth disfavors equity

financing in general, and, in particular, limits the possibilities for newly founded firms to grow fast

using equity financing, there exists a conflict between egalitarianism and dynamic growth. The

opportunities for entrepreneurs to build private fortunes by developing new firms have been limited

because of tax reasons but also since the strong preference for maintained control in effect limits the

volume of equity financing, and in particular the use of public offers. This preference might be

primarily a cultural trait but is more likely to be an equilibrium outcome that is endogenously

generated by the corporate ownership model reinforced by the design of the tax system, i.e. by the

enhanced political pecking order of financing. The preference for control implies limited use of

equity financing because it disperses ownership and slow growth rate since the capital infusions are

relatively small— too few firms grow fast to become large. The political disfavoring of equity

financing and favoring of retained earnings and loans have reinforced this effect. Hence, there are

effects both on the demand and on the supply side that limit equity financing in equilibrium.

        In line with the pecking order theory of SEOs, the largest offers for IPO firms are rights

issues that dilute control the least (see Holmén and Högfeldt (2004a)). However, they are still too

small to generate a high growth rate for newly listed firms controlled by the founding entrepreneur.

In general, family controlled IPO firms are undercapitalized because of the preference for control.

The strong preference for maintained control and use of retained earnings as the preferred method

of financing also limits the growth rate of SMEs. For a sample of 1248 firms with 5-49 employees,

Wiklund, Davidsson and Delmar (2002) report that the entrepreneur prioritizes growth only if



                                                  52
he/she does not lose control and independence of other stakeholders while the well-being of their

employees is not compromised. They strongly prefer financing via retained earnings even if they

are aware that the firm will follow a trajectory with lower growth than with equity financing. 44%

say that they would rather sell the whole firm than share control even if it would improve

performance and growth. Moreover, firms where the founder’s family owns a smaller fraction

and/or have more ownership categories are more likely to grow faster.

         Since the formation of new firms has been relatively low and decreasing until the mid-90s,

the addition of new firms that grow fast has been limited. Together with the limited use of equity

financing to support fast-growing firms this implies a skewed size and age distribution of firms with

negative effects on future growth. The incapacity to use equity financing to promote growth of new

firms in advancing industries may be the real Achilles´ heal of the Swedish model.

A summary: An integrated answer
An integrated, general answer to the three questions about how corporate ownership developed in

Sweden, why the Social Democrats accepted a very concentrated private ownership and control

over listed firms and why ownership did not separate widely in Sweden is structured as follows.

         The Swedish corporate ownership model is built on a basic understanding between the

Social Democrats (labor) and capital: political support and legitimacy of heavy entrenched private

ownership is traded-off against the implicit guarantee that the largest listed firms do not migrate and

that they continue to invest. The strong separation of ownership and control causes an enhanced

(political) pecking order of financing that is endogenously supported by the interests of the two

incumbencies.

         The incumbent capital’s strong preference for maintained control of listed firms implies a

priority for financing via retained earnings and loans, and only limited use of equity financing when

needed since this would disperse ownership and eventually control, in particular if public offers are


33
   Using somewhat fragmentary data, Braunerhjelm and Carlsson— Entrepreneurship, small firms and industrial growth in
Ekonomisk Debatt 1995— report that annual entry rates of new manufacturing firms with more than one employee have
been very low and fell from about 4% to 2% rates from 1920 to 1950, to 1.5% in the 70s and below that in the 80s.


                                                         53
used. For different reasons, the political ordering of financing alternatives by the Social Democrats

was the same. The ideological focus on the largest listed firms and their investments combined with

skepticism towards equity markets in general, and the primary markets in particular for egalitarian

reasons, implied a strong preference for retained earnings and loans. The existing strongly relation-

based banking system supported this ordering and so did the explicit political support for use of

devices to separate votes from capital via pyramids and specifically for dual-class shares when the

firms needed more equity financing. As the incumbent capital became more institutionalized while

creation of large private fortunes in new firms via significant equity financing is limited and does

not threaten to disperse the distribution of wealth too much, the order was also politically

acceptable. It is worth emphasizing that this line of arguments pinpoints the political sensitivity of

the equity markets’ primary function and not their secondary function to provide liquidity, which is

more standard.

        The resulting equilibrium perpetuates and reinforces the initially concentrated ownership of

the largest listed firms since ownership does not have to disperse because of significant need for

equity financing— ownership becomes more entrenched as separation of votes and capital increases

over time. Since historical profits determine future investments and not expected future profits, the

equilibrium entails a strong path dependency: dominance of very large and old firms in mature

industries that tend to overinvest while there are relative few new and fast-growing firms in

advancing lines of business. Since the labor market policies promote tenure with the existing

employer, both labor and corporate control are locked-in with the existing firms. The old industrial

structure is thus taken to its limits by the strong path dependency of corporate control, investments,

labor and political power. The almost innate entrenchment of both the political and corporate

powers breeds economic stagnation as well as lack of social dynamics.


   5. Why did corporate ownership in Sweden follow this particular historical path?




                                                 54
The purpose of this section is to very briefly outline some general factors and correlations between

them that have been particularly important determinants of the development of corporate ownership

in Sweden. My conjectures are of course subjective, very speculative and incomplete as I focus on

the overall picture from a specific financial perspective but the institutional and political stability

makes it perhaps both easier and more interesting at the same time to outline a hypothetical answer.

I conjecture that the following causal chain between some of these categories (factors) have been

particularly important.34

          When Sweden started its modern economic development about 150 years ago, the country

was relatively well endowed with natural resources (e.g. minerals, forests and water power), mainly

located in the northern part of the country, but large capital investments were needed to fully exploit

the endowments. The lack of domestic capital and of a sufficiently large group of wealthy people,

left two alternative ways to raise the necessary capital: collection of many peoples small savings via

a domestic system of saving and deposit banks and borrowing via issuing of bond loans abroad

(perhaps also migration of wealthy persons and entrepreneurs). The very large emigration wave to

North America increased the political pressure to modernize the very poor country. The reasons

behind the country’s poverty and what to do about it were the major political issues. How to

organize an efficient banking system, and how to reform it as the financing demands changed were

hotly debated questions for many decades. Political reforms paved the way for a banking system of

Scottish type and very large bond loans to finance infra-structural investments were sold to French,

German but also to English investors.

          Economic geography is very important since the country is located on the northern rim of

Europe but has a very long costal line. Since the Hanseatic times Sweden has been connected with

34
   In general, I think (without explicitly motivating it here) that an empirically relevant theory of the historical
development of corporate ownership and its importance for financial development and growth should consider (at least)
seven broad categories: 1. Endowments (natural resources, geography and population) and production technologies; 2.
Level and distribution of wealth (poverty); 3. Openness of society (transparency and competitiveness); 4. Legal system
and enforcement; 5. Political system (ideology, electoral system, tax system); 6. Structure of financial system (relation
based – arm’s length); and 7. Major “random” events (e.g. wars and The Great Reversal). The ordering is convenient and
does not reflect the categories’ relative importance. The two literatures on finance and growth (see e.g. Beck et al (2000)
and Carlin and Mayer (2003)) and on the political economy of corporate finance (see e.g. Pagano and Volpin (2001)) have
identified specific factors for crucial for financial development but it would take me too far astray to discuss it now.


                                                            55
Continental Europe and partly integrated via the Baltic Sea but also with the British Isles,

Amsterdam and Hamburg via the North Sea, and later also part of a North Atlantic economy after

the great emigration. The export of raw materials had gone on for centuries, which developed an

awareness of being part of an international market economy and fostered market discipline.

Financial transfers had also been crucial as for example Sweden’s wars were financed out of

Hamburg and Amsterdam. Trade credits and short term borrowing were later used efficiently as

they de facto became long term capital. As people migrated to develop their know-how and skills

abroad, cultural values, ideas, technological knowledge and market knowledge were transferred to

Sweden when they returned. Being a small country, the national culture is the cumulative result of

influences from several different cultures. Despite an under-developed civic society, the country

was thus relatively open; the tensions within the elites were between the international modernity

and the parochial Swedish traditionalism. The long-time international integration into a larger

market economy provided the necessary basis for the late but fast and successful industrialization of

Sweden. The early formation of several new firms based on break-trough innovations that are still

important today would probably not have taken place if not the engineers and entrepreneurs had

traveled and been internationally connected and the basic skills and training already in place via the

long experience of export-oriented production.

        When the capital demands for large scale industrial investments increased about 100 years

ago, the financial system could in principle have developed into a market-based system of equity

and bond financing but the political power of the commercial banks, combined with support from

the Social Democrats, instead extended the intermediated system into equity financing by the

banking law of 1911 that permitted banks to operate as investment banks and directly own equity.

The fledgling stock market was too speculative to become an alternative source of outside

financing. The relatively large equity issues in the 1910s and 1920s were primarily financed the

levered Issuing Companies controlled by banks at very short arm’s length, and not via public offers.




                                                 56
        Without the bank law of 1911 it is likely that corporate ownership would have developed

quite differently; the law was the pivotal reason banks ended up holding large equity portfolios of

very financially distressed firms in the early 1930s. When the new bank law of 1934 prohibited

banks to directly own equity, they were allowed to transfer them to closed-end investment funds

instead of forcing the banks to sooner or later sell these assets back to the market when prices

rebounded. The leading banks could thus continue to exert control over the largest listed firms, even

if it formerly was at arm’s length. Unlike in the US, the banks were not the problem in Sweden but

the solution to the problem of how to create financial and social stability, and to restructure the

large industrials. The main banks were financially healthy enough, experienced as investment

bankers and had developed the political contacts.

        Like in the US, the policies after the deep financial crises shaped the future developments

through a strong political and regulatory path dependency. This large random event had however an

even larger impact in Sweden as the crises was the start of both the political hegemony of the

Social Democrats and of the political model of entrenched corporate ownership with the banks as

the pivotal nodes for corporate control; financial intermediation was de facto extended into highly

levered corporate control via pyramiding. A short term and acute solution to the poorly functioning

financial markets was extended for decades through the political hegemony and the basic

understanding between labor and capital. Corporate ownership is thus very political indeed.

        In the early 1980s when deregulation of financial markets started and stock markets were

re-activated, the increased use of dual-class shares was backed by strong political support. The B-

shares provided the necessary liquidity and dispersion of ownership (capital) while the control

rested firmly with the traditional private owners that increased their separation between control and

ownership when market values and capital demands increased. Because of the control structure, the

primary market for equity did not develop fully and the system in effect continued to be very

dependent on intermediated financing and retained earnings (a reactive financing mode) even




                                                    57
though the tensions between ownership and control are growing and attracting attention from

politicians who would reform the system.

        I thus think it is possible to identify a simple causal chain that explains why the Swedish

financial system has not developed into a fully market-based financial system with very active

primary markets and dispersed corporate ownership. Given the poverty and lack of wealthy

individuals, and the use relatively capital-intensive technologies and large-scale production, a

system of intermediated financing was politically chosen to collect and allocate the capital. The

defining moments for the developments of the financial system are 1911, 1934-37 and 1984 when

the intermediated system was extended into equity financing (banks were allowed to directly own

shares), when banks became the pivotal controlling owners of the largest firms and when the equity

markets were re-activated (The Great Reversal was reversed) but the heavily entrenched control

structure was maintained and reinforced by increased use of dual-class shares, respectively. At these

three turning points the development of the financial system as well as of corporate ownership and

control could have followed other paths than they did if the political decisions had been different.

Because of the strong path dependency in an intermediated financial system when it is supported by

political powers united by common interests, a genuinely market-based financial system has not

developed in Sweden.

        However, it is almost impossible to underestimate the persistent effects even today of the

major random event: the crises in the early in the early 1930s that was the catalyst of both the

political hegemony of the Social Democrats and the very strong and growing entrenchment of

private corporate control. Even if these two phenomena are not always analyzed as causally

connected, it is almost inevitable not to regard them as Siamese twins in an analysis of the

development of corporate ownership in Sweden as I have done in this paper.




                                           6. Conclusions


                                                 58
100 years ago modernity in Sweden was spearheaded by the rapidly advancing industrial sector and

carried by its two new social groups— capital and labor-- that reshaped the economic, political and

social arenas. A relatively small group of leading industrialists and bankers, most often recruited

outside the establishment, represented the commercial interests, had a pronounced Anglo-Saxon

orientation and were politically active with a stress on rational reforms to promote changes. The

well-organized labor movement (SAP and LO) transformed their more radical, original

revolutionary objectives into a reformist agenda pursued by democratic, parliamentary means, and

viewed itself as the carrier of future social and economic changes of historical proportions. Despite

significant ideological influence from Germany, the leadership was primarily stimulated by ideas

from the British labor movement that could be implemented politically. Even though labor and

capital had adversarial interests, they shared a common sense of being harbingers of modernity.

Together with the Liberal Party the Social Democrats successfully fought for general and equal

suffrage (implemented in 1921) against The old Right that was organized around the (autocratic)

king and supported by the nobility, the church, the military, the leading civil servants and the large

farmers. The Right had by tradition looked towards Germany for guidance and emphasized social

and cultural values embodied in strong Lutheranism, nationalism and traditionalism with support

for the monarchy and social order, mixed with disdain for the commercial Anglo-Saxon countries

and their (lack of) values.

        Unlike in Germany where the Old Right was fuelled by revenge after WW1 and the

transition to modernity was violent and resulted in the direst consequences for Europe, the transition

in Sweden was peaceful despite weak governments and economic crises of the 20s and early 30s. In

1932 the Social Democratic vision of The Good Home (Folkhemmet) was not only the political

answer to the turbulent economic and political times with its focus on full employment policies but

represented also the democratic modernity with strong emphasis on egalitarian values, and

encompassing policies based on social and economic rationality with a (benevolent) paternalistic

flavor mixed with some mild nationalism. To implement the vision of the good society, the


                                                 59
economic policies promoted growth and full employment, particularly in the post-war period until

the 70s, and development of a large public sector. Embodied in the elaborate welfare state and in

the political hegemony of the Social Democrats, it is the most successful and long-lived political

vision ever in a democracy.

           But when the industrial society reached its peak in the mid 70s, and 40 years of strong

growth turned into almost 30 years of relative stagnation and recurrent economic, financial and

budget deficit crises, and significant loss of economic welfare, the weaknesses became all too

apparent: the lack of resilience of a too small base of very large, old and highly specialized firms in

stagnating industries and lack of new growing firms in advancing industries. On ideological

grounds the Social Democrats focused on the largest listed firms, in particular their investments and

R&D spending, and promoted policies that supported financing via retained earnings and borrowing

from a strongly relation-based banking system but disfavored equity markets as supplier of capital

for egalitarian reasons. Their political support for use of dual-class shares and pyramiding in effect

aligned the interests of the incumbent political power with incumbent capital (in particular the

leading banks) as corporate control is maintained and actually reinforced. Capital is locked in with

the incumbent firms since the separation of control from ownership drives a wedge between the

costs of internal and external capital that causes an enhanced (political) pecking order of corporate

financing. Investments are thus primarily determined by historical profits, not by expected future

profits.

           Listed firms have indeed not been dependent on the primary equity markets while

formation of private fortunes tied to new, fast-growing firms fuelled by equity market financing has

been very limited. This explains both why ownership did not disperse and why addition of new

firms has been so poor. Since labor market rules are designed to protect incumbent workers, both

labor and control over capital are therefore locked into the existing corporate structure while the

Social Democrats have locked in the political sector. The real problem with the Swedish model of




                                                  60
corporate ownership is thus the lack of economic and social dynamics— modernity has become

stale and embedded.

            The strong historical and political path dependency is apparent in the fact that the two

socio-economic groups that spearheaded modernity 100 years ago— leading capitalists and

organized labor— are still the heavily entrenched incumbencies even if the importance of the

industrial society has been declining for decades.35 The real irony is that corporate control, although

diluted in recent years by increased institutional ownership, is still in the hands of very few, well-

established families and banks, not despite but because of Social Democratic policies.

            The Social Democrats in effect became the guarantor of heavily entrenched private

corporate ownership rather than the terminator of capitalism since the political and corporate

incumbencies have been united by strong common interests. Incumbent owners need the political

support to legitimize that their corporate power rests on extensive use of dual-class shares and

pyramiding. While the Social Democrats only get the necessary resources and indirect support for

their social and economic policies from the private sector if the largest firms remain under Swedish

control so that capital does not migrate. By not encouraging outsiders to create new firms and

fortunes, and by not fully activating the primary equity markets, the heavy politicized system has

redistributed incomes but not property rights and wealth. The result is an ageing economy with an

unusually large proportion of very old and very large firms with well-defined owners in control.

Note: All calculations are based on the actual asset composition in manufacturing and conform to the general
framework developed by King and Fullerton (1984). The average holding period is assumed to be 10 years. A
negative tax rate implies that the rate of return after tax is greater than before tax. For instance, a tax rate of –
83 percent for a debt-financed investment owned by a tax-exempt institution in 1980 tells us that a real rate of
return of 10 percent before tax becomes 18.3 percent taking the tax effects into account.

and/or board members of the bank are also board members of large firms that do their major
borrowing and other financial activities with the bank. The dotted lines show that there is only an
indirect relation as old managers or non-board members affiliated with the bank are also board
members of client firms.
