          INFLATION, INDEX-LINKED BONDS, AND ASSET ALLOCATION


                               ABSTRACT




     The recent introduction of CPI-linked bonds by several
financial institutions is a milestone in the history of the U.S.
financial system. It has potentially far—reaching effects on
individual and institutional asset allocation decisions because
these securities represent the only true long—run hedge against
inflation risk.
     CPI—linked bonds make possible the creation of additional
financial innovations that would use them as the asset base. One
such innovation that seems likely is inflation—protected
retirement annuities. The introduction of index—linked bonds
eliminates one of the main obstacles to the indexation of
benefits in private pension plans. A firm could hedge the risk
associated with a long-term indexed liability by investing in
index—linked bonds with the same duration as the indexed
liabilities.

i.   introduction
     A dramatic new development motivates this paper: the

emergence of virtually risk—free securities linked to the U.S.
consumer price level. The new securities were issued first by
the Franklin Savings Association of Ottawa, Kansas, in January

1988 in two different forms. The first is certificates of
deposit, called Inflation—PlUS CDs, insured by the Federal
Savings and Loan Insurance corporation (FSLIC), and paying an
interest rate tied to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer
Price Index (CPI). Interest is paid monthly and is equal to a
stated real rate plus the proportional increase in the CPI during

the previous month. As of this writing (November 1988), the real

rate ranges from 3% per year for a one—year maturity CD to 3.3%

per year for a ten—year maturity.
     The second form is twenty—year noncallable collateralized
bonds, called Real Yield Securities, or REALs. These offer a
 floating coupon rate of 3% per year plus the previous year's
 proportional change in the CPI, adjusted and payable quarterly.

 A recent issue of similar bonds includes a put option.

      Two   other   financial institutions have recently followed the

 lead of Franklin Savings.' If the trend continues, we have

 reached a milestone in the history of this countrytS financial


      11n August 1988 Anchor Savings Bank became the second U.S.
 institution to issue REALS, and in September 1988 JHM Acceptance
 Corporation issued modified index-linked bonds subject to a nominal
 interest rate cap of 14% per annum. The investment banking firm
 of Morgan Stanley and Company is the underwriter and market maker
 for REALS.

markets. Consider that for years prominent economists at all
points of the ideological spectrum have argued that the U.S.
Treasury should issue such securities, and scholars have
speculated why private markets for them have not hitherto
developed.2 The current innovative environment in the U.S.
financial markets appears to finally have put an end to this
speculation by producing private indexed bonds in several forms.
     This paper analyzes the gain to investors of this new

investment alternative, considers likely changes in portfolio
behavior that it might induce, and explores ways that it may be
used in the future, principally to guarantee a safe stream of
real benefits in retirement. The analytical framework is the
familiar mean—variance model of portfolio selection of Markowitz

and Tobin and the Capital Asset Pricing Model.3
     The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 analyzes the
difference between portfolio optimization in nominal and in real

terms and shows how introduction of bonds offering a real risk—

free rate of interest can improve portfolio efficiency. Section
3 discusses the difference between hedging against inflation in
the short—run and in the long—run and shows why long—term index—

linked bonds are the only true hedge against long-run inflation
risk. Section 4 explains how index-linked bonds can be the basii

for providing inflation-protected retirement benefits. In an

appendix we derive the set of equilibrium expected real rates of
return on stocks, bonds, and bills that are consistent with the

3% per year real risk—free rate now offered by the index-linked

securities.

2.   Asset Allocation in Real Terms
     The individual investor is concerned ultimately with
lifetime consumption. The appropriate focus in investment
decision—making therefore should be real as opposed to nominal
rates of return. A portfolio is therefore efficient if it offers
the minimum variance of real rate of return for any given mean

real rate of return.
     Most real world applications of portfolio theory, however,

are cast in nominal terms. Typically, Treasurybills are taken
as the risk—free asset, and the optimal combination of risky
assets, or the tangency portfolio, is constructed on the basis of

the covariance matrix of nominal returns. All efficient
portfolios are combinations of bills and the tangency portfolio.

     Now let us consider the portfolio optimization in real
terms. When there is no risk—free asset in real terms, there is

no tangency portfolio, that is, no single optimal combination of
risky assets that can be combined with the risk-free asset to

generate the efficient frontier.
      Let us give a specific numerical illustration, using the
 probability distribution of real rates of return presented in
 Table 1. The standard deviations and correlations in the table

                                —3—
were estimated from monthly real rate of return data for the

period 1983 through 1987, and the expected returns were computed
according to the CAPM assuming market weights of 60% for stocks,
15% for bonds, and 25% for bills (as explained in the Appendix).
    When we add a real risk—free asset offering a real interest

rate of 3% per year to the other assets, the efficient portfolio
frontier becomes a straight line that is tangent to the original
efficient frontier of risky assets only. Table 2 and Figure 1
compare the efficient frontier with and without REALs.

     It is clear that there is virtually no gain in efficiency
front adding REALs to the set of other assets, stocks, bonds, and
bills. The efficient frontier of risky assets only is almost a
straight line and indistinguishable from the frontier obtained

when we add REALs. This is because despite the fact that bills
do not offer a completely risk—free real rate of return, their
standard deviation is so small that for practical purposes they
are virtually risk—free in the short—run. The main impact of
adding REALs is to substitute for bills in the low risk and low

expected return end of the frontier.

                  The expected returns were computed according to the
                  CAPM as explained below assuming market weights of 60%
                  for stocks, 15% for bonds, and 25% for bills; relative
                  risk aversion of 4; and a riskless real rate of 3% per

3.   Short-Run vs Long-Run Inflation Hedging
     While a policy of investing in bills is an effective hedge

against inflation in the short run, it is not an effective way to
lock in a real rate of interest for the longer run. For example,

suppose you are an investor with an investment horizon of 10

years; let us say you are saving for a child's college education
10 years from now. While you can be reasonably sure of earning a
real rate of return on bills of 3% per year for the next year or

so, there is considerable uncertainty about the rate beyond that.
Figure 2 plots the annual real rate of return on a policy of
rolling over 1-month Treasury bills over the 60 year period 1926—

1986.
        It is clear from the graph that while the real rate on bills
has been stable over periods as long as 10 or even 18 years

 (e.g., from 1953 to 1971), it has also exhibited considerable
variability. Just in the most recent two decades its behavior
has changed dramatically. In the l970s the real rate on bills

 was substantially negative, averaging —1% per year for the 10
 years from January 1970 to December 1979.    In the 1980s, it has

 averaged 4% per year.

    This instability of the real rate of return on money market
instruments over long periods of time makes them unsuitable for

investors who want to hedge long term liabilities that are fixed
in real terms, such as the cost of a college education ten years
from now. What you really need in order to hedge this liability
is a 10 year zero coupon bond indexed to the cost of living,
promising a fixed real interest rate like the Franklin Savings
Association Inflation Plus CD described earlier in this paper.'

     In this context it is worth pointing out a major
disadvantage of REALs in the form of the coupon bonds issued by
Franklin Savings Association. While the coupon interest rate on

these bonds is fixed in real terms, their face value is fixed in
nominal terms. Consequently, their duration is a function of the

realized rate of inflation. Putting it in a slightly different
way, the rate at which the real value of the principal declines
is a function of the inflation rate. This is in contrast to
bonds whose face value is fixed in real terms, such as the index-
linked bonds issued by the government of the United Kingdom. In
practical terms this means that REALs in their coupon bond form

are of limited use in any duration—matching strategy that an
investor would want to implement in order to hedge or "immunize"

long-term indexed liabilities.




     4A better hedge would be a bond linked to the cost of college
education. Such securities are currently available.

4.   Inflation—Proof Retirement Annuities

     CPI-linked bonds make other innovations possible. Perhaps
the most important of these is inflation-protected retirement an-
nuities. Retired people have long been considered the most vul-

nerable to inflation risk, but proposals for private market solu-
tions to this problem have been stymied by the lack of a real

risk—free asset..5

      In 1980, for example, Bodie proposed the idea of a variable

annuity offering at least limited protection against inflation
risk by hedging money market instruments with a small position in

a diversified portfolio of commodity futures contracts.6 Working
against the proposal, however, was the low mean real rate of
return available on money market instruments at that time (bet-

ween 0 and 1% per year). The situation is markedly different now
with the availability of virtually risk-free securities offering
real rates in excess of 3% per year. Pension funds and other

providers of retirement benefits, which currently offer only
nominal annuities, could also offer attractive real annuity
options to retirees.
     To illustrate how such a real annuity option might work,
assume at retirement that you are entitled to a benefit with a
present value of $100,000. Your retirement plan currently offers


     5Feldstein (1983) and Summers (1983) have both argued that
the elderly may in fact be over—indexed already because of their
claims to Social Security benefits and their ownership of real
estate.

     6See Bodie (1980).

                               —10—
you a conventional nominal annuity computed on the assumption of
a nominal interest rate of 8% per year and a life expectancy of
15 years. Assuming the first payment is to be received
immediately, the annual benefit is $10,818. The plan hedges its
liability to you by investing in risk-free nominal bonds paying a

nominal rate of 8% per year.
     From your perspective, the real value of this stream of

benefits is uncertain. Consider the purchasing power of the
final benefit payment to be received 14 years from now. If the
rate of inflation turns out to be 5% per year, the real value of
the final benefit will be $5,464, about half the value of the
first payment. If the rate of inflation turns out to be 10% per
year, the real value of the final payment drops to $2,849.
     Contrast this with a hypothetical real annuity.   Your plan
can now invest your $100,000 to earn a real risk—free rate of 3%

per year, so it could offer you a real annuity computed on the
assumption of 3% per year. Your annual benefit would be $8,133
guaranteed in real terms. While the initial payment is lower
than under the nominal option, the real value of the benefit is

insured against inflation.
     The real annuity, however, need not start at a lower value

than the conventional nominal annuity. Bodie and Pesando (1983)
have shown how real annuities can be designed with the same
starting value as conventional nominal annuities. Such a real

annuity would have to pay decreasing benefit amounts, just as the
expected real value of the benefit stream from the nominal

                               —11—
annuity decreases. The essential difference is that the real

annuity is insured against inflation, while the nominal annuity

is not.
     Indexing a retirement annuity after retirement is only one

aspect of inflation-proofing private pension plans.   Another is

to index benefit accruals prior to retirement. Under private
defined benefit (DB) plans the value of accrued benefits is
extremely sensitive to inflation because once an employee stops

working for the plan sponsor or once the sponsor terminates the
plan, pension benefits are fixed in nominal terms.
     For example, suppose you are 45 years old and have worked

for the same employer for 20 years. Assume that your DB plan

promises 1% of final salary per year of service; that your most
recent salary was $50,000; that normal retirement age is 65, and
that your life expectancy is 80 years. Your claim on the pension

fund is a deferred annuity of $10,000 per year starting at age 65

and lasting for 15 years.
      If you leave this employer, what do you have? The benefit

 is not indexed to any wage or price level the way Social Security
 is, so the benefit loses real value as prices rise. Assuming
 inflation of 5% per year, the value of a dollar will have fallen

 to $.38 by the time you retire in another twenty years, and your
 first year benefit of $10,000 will have a real value of only

 $3,800. That value will continue to fall each year as inflation

 continues. If, however, you stay with your employer, your salary
 increases at the rate of inflation, and your employer indexes

                               —12—
your benefit to the cost of living after retirement, you will

have an annuity worth $10,000 of today's purchasing power per
year for life.
     Looking at the situation in terms of present values

(assuming a nominal discount rate of 8% per year and a real

discount rate of 3% per year), your accrued benefit if you switch
jobs or if the plan is terminated has a present value of $18,364.
If you continue, with complete indexation both before and after
retirement, the accrued benefit has a present value of $66,097.

     It is often said that DB plans lack portability. But this
is not exactly correct. Once employees are vested in a DB plan
they cannot lose the annuity they have earned. Rather, they lose
value: because the annuity is not indexed to the cost of living

or to wages, its worth is greatly diminished if the employee
switches jobs or if the plan is terminated.
     This feature of DB plans may be a deterrent to employee
turnover and as such could be an efficient long—term labor
contracting device. But the strength of this deterrent depends

mainly on inflation, which is not subject to anyone's control,
except perhaps that of the fiscal and monetary policy
authorities. It seems unlikely that it could be efficient to
have the strength of the incentive be hostage to inflation.
Furthermore, inflation so complicates the calculation of both the

future real value of the stream of pension benefits and the
present value of that stream that it is unlikely that workers can

fully understand the set of incentives being offered.

                               —1.3—
     Pension fund asset allocation could be profoundly affected

were pension plans actually to offer indexed benefits to their
employees. Many pension funds currently hedge their nominal
pension liabilities by means of duration matching strategies that

result in investments in long—term fixed—income securities. A
switch to indexed pensions probably would result in hedging
strategies involving investment in long-term index-linked

securities.



5.   Summary and Conclusions
     The introduction of CPI-linked bonds by several financial
institutions is a milestone in the history of the U.S. financial

system. It has potentially far-reaching effects on individual
and institutional asset allocation decisions because they offer

the only true long-run hedge against inflation risk. Risk-averse
investors may achieve substantial efficiency gains by
 substituting these real risk-free securities for bills in their
portfolios, especially since the real rate being offered by flALs

 seems quite high in light of the historical average returns on
 securities with low variance of real returns.
      The existence of CPI-linked bonds may spur the creation of
 other financial innovations relying on such an asset base. The

 most likely innovation would appear to be inflation—protected
 retirement annuities.

Appendix: Equilibrium Real Rates of Return on Stocks, Bonds, and
            Bills

     What set of expected rates of return on stocks, bonds, and
bills is consistent with an observed real risk—free rate of 3%

per year in equilibrium? By this we mean what set of expected
real rates would make the average investor (that is, an investor
with an average degree of risk aversion) willing to hold all

assets in the proportions that they actually exist in the

economy?
     As Bodie, Kane, and McDonald (1985) have shown, under the

assumptions of the Capital Asset Pricing Model the equilibrium
risk premium on any asset is equal to the covariance of its real

rate of return with the market portfolio times the average degree
of relative risk aversion of market participants.7




     7me equilibrium risk premium on security i is given by the
                E(r) —    = &Oim
                         rf
formula:
where   a  is the  covariance between the real rate of return on
security i and the market portfolio and 6 is the aggregate measure
of relative risk aversion (a weighted harmonic mean).
aim, in turn, is given by the formula: 0jm = E W-C-
where   w- is the weight of security j in the   mare portfolio, and
   is tl!le covariance between the real rates of return on securities
i and j.

            Assumed market weights: stocks .6, bonds .15, cash   .25
                = .02031484
                = .00615951
                = .00009479

                                —15—
    Table 3 shows the equilibrium real rates of return
corresponding to three sets of assumptions about the proportions

of assets outstanding for an average degree of relative risk
aversion of 4. Table 4 displays the full set of means and
standard deviations, including a market portfolio that is 60%

stocks, 15% bonds, and 25% bills.
     Perhaps the most striking result is how small the risk

premium on bills is: less than 10 basis points in every case.

The last line in Table 3 probably represents the best estimate of
the current asset proportions in the U.S. economy and therefore

we chose it for our market portfolio in Table   48
     One way to judge the "reasonableness of these numbers is to
make an assumption about the expected rate of inflation, add it
to the equilibrium expected real rates of return, and then
compare the resulting numbers to the observed nominal yields.9
Of course, this will work only for bills and bonds, whose nominal
yields are directly observable. If we assume an expected rate of

inflation of 4% per year, then the implied nominal rates for
outstanding asset proportions of 60% stocks, 15% bonds, and 25%

bills are:

stocks 15.12% per year, bonds 9.46%, and bills 7.04%.




     8See Rouse (1988).

     9As Fischer (1975) has shown, the relationship between the
expected nominal and real rates of return is: expected nominal rate
= expected real rate + expected rate of inflation + covariance
between the real rate and the rate of inflation. We are ignoring
the covariance term here because it is so small.

                        in Table 1, and the risk aversion parameter is 4.
                        The risk—free real rate is 3% per year.

    The 7% nominal yield on bills and the 9.46% yield on bonds

are close to the observed market rates on Treasury securities as
                                     therefore conclude that the
of this writing (NoVember 1988). We
                                  calculations are not
set of assumptions underlying our
inconsistent with reality, even if they are not entirely correct.

     The small risk premium on bills reported in Table 3 is
explained by the fact that bills are such a good substitute for

REALS   in   the short run. The long-run is quite a different story.
