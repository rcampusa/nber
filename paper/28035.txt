Russian Holidays Predict Troll Activity 2015-2017

                                          ABSTRACT

While international election interference is not new, Russia is credited with "industrializing"
trolling on English-language social media platforms. In October 2018, Twitter retrospectively
identified 2.9 million English-language tweets as covertly written by trolls from Russia's Internet
Research Agency. Most active 2015-2017, these Russian trolls generally supported the Trump
campaign (Senate Intelligence Committee, 2019) and researchers have traced how this content
disseminated across Twitter. Here, we take a different tack and seek exogenous drivers of
Russian troll activity. We find that trolling fell 35% on Russian holidays and to a lesser extent,
when temperatures were cold in St. Petersburg. More recent trolls released by Twitter do not
show any systematic relationship to holidays and temperature, although substantially fewer of
these that have been made public to date. Our finding for the pre-2018 interference period may
furnish a natural experiment for evaluating the causal effect of Russian trolling on indirectly-
affected outcomes and political behaviors -- outcomes that are less traceable to troll content
and potentially more important to policymakers than the direct dissemination activities
previously studied. As a case in point, we describe suggestive evidence that Russian holidays
impacted daily trading prices in 2016 election betting markets.

           Professional Russian trolling is malevolent and murky. The February 2018 US
       grand-jury indictment states that the Internet Research Agency (IRA) in St. Peters-
       burg conducted "information warfare against the United State of America" by using
       "fictitious U.S. personas on social media platforms...." (US Department of Justice,
       2018). These fake personas communicated with "unwitting" members of the public to
       sow distrust in the US political system, discourage minorities from voting, make asser-
       tions of voter fraud, organize political rallies, stoke racial divisions,1 assist the Trump
       campaign,2 and other illicit activities.3 Employees used an Internet proxy service to
       conceal their I.P. addresses (Chen, 2015) and "covering tracks" was a goal of the IRA
       operation (US Department of Justice, 2018). As has been widely reported, Russian
       interference is believed by many to continue during the current election cycle.
           In October 2018, Twitter released 2.9 million English-language tweets from 3,841
       accounts as "affiliated with the IRA", which we refer to as "Wave 1" tweets. Twitter's
       stated goal was to "enable independent academic research and investigation". Since
       January 2019, Twitter has blocked an additional 770,000 English-language tweets of
       surreptitiously Russian origin, without explicitly attributing them to the IRA. What
       caused Twitter's suspicions of particular accounts and tweets they have flagged was
       not disclosed.4 Nevertheless, Twitter's disclosure of the suspicious Twitter accounts
       and tweets they think are tied to professional Russian trolling provides the requisite
       data for our empirical analysis.5
           Empirically, Russian trolling activity is correlated with the timing of other legit-
       imate activities, including breaking news stories6 and overall internet traffic levels.
       Additionally, trolling activity exhibits time trends, seasonality, and the influence of the
       day of the week. This can make it difficult to ascribe time-series variation in trolling
       intensity and its effects to the work of trolls per se, as opposed to other factors.
           Here we explore factors behind Russian trolling activity in the US that are likely
       specific to Russia. This forensic exercise may be useful for shedding light on the pro-
       duction function of Russian trolling (Zitzewitz, 2012). To the extent they are indeed
       coordinated in Russia, this would be consistent with Twitter's identification of particu-
       lar English-language tweets as of surreptitiously Russian-origin. Furthermore, it might
   1
      According to the Senate Intelligence Committee's bipartisan report in 2019, "The Committee found the
IRA targeted African-Americans more than any other group or demographic. Through individual posts,
location targeting, Facebook pages, Instagram accounts, and Twitter trends, the IRA focused much of its
efforts on stoking divisions around hot-button issues with racial undertones."
    2
      The Senate Intelligence Committee's bipartisan report stated: "The Committee found that the IRA
sought to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election by harming Hillary Clinton's chances of success and
supporting Donald Trump at the direction of the Kremlin. The Committee found that IRA social media
activity was overtly and almost invariably supportive of then-candidate Trump to the detriment of Secretary
Clinton's campaign."
    3
      The Federal Election Campaign Act "prohibits foreign nationals from making any contributions, expen-
ditures, independent expenditures, or disbursements for electioneering communications" (US Department of
Justice, 2018).
    4
      In June 2019, Twitter stated: "...we employ a range of open-source and proprietary signals and tools
to identify when attempted coordinated manipulation may be taking place, as well as the actors responsible
for it."
    5
      Twitter blocking occurs after a substantial period of unchecked online activity, which is what we analyze.
    6
      For example, Russian troll accounts "respond to shifts in political circumstances", e.g. "the well-known
faint/stumble by Hillary Clinton leaving a 9/11 commemoration event, followed by her pausing the campaign
with an announcement of pneumonia." (Linvill and Warren, 2020)


                                                       2
       help social media, cybersecurity firms, and government agencies to identify ongoing
       interference activities. Finally, and most important for future research, our approach
       might allow researchers to isolate exogenous drivers of trolling activity in the US ­
       neglected by research to date ­ and thereby its true and full effect.
           We find that Russian holidays decrease trolling by 35% in the corpus of Twitter's
       primary data release on October 2018 of 2.9 million tweets. The decrease in overall
       holiday tweeting is largest for original tweets, which may be more impactful than
       retweets. To a lesser extent, warmer temperatures in St. Petersburg also increased
       trolling.
           From January 2019 to June 2020, Twitter released another 770,000 English language
       tweets as of surreptitiously Russian origin, but without explicitly attributing them to
       the IRA in St. Petersburg.7 The reduced number of recently-released trolls could
       indicate: 1) less trolling recently on Twitter by Russians, 2) that Twitter is holding on
       to this "wave 5" information so as not to compromise its defensive methods in the run-
       up to the 2020 election, or 3) Russians have gotten better at "covering their tracks".
       Indeed, following the glare of publicity their trolling received around the February 2018
       US indictment of the IRA, Russians may have adopted new methods of interference.
       While we have less statistical power to detect effects in the 2018-2020 period because
       there are far fewer suspicious tweets to analyze, we see no relationship between Russian
       holidays or St. Petersburg's temperature in the most recent period. Power issues aside,
       this null finding is consistent with Russia getting better at "`covering its tracks".
           Despite its importance and popular interest, little is known about the causal ef-
       fects of Russian trolling on outcomes politicians and policymakers actually care about,
       such as campaign donations or election probabilities. Arguably, these outcomes are
       more important than the direct observed dissemination of troll content itself that has
       previously been studied. Such indirect effects would include the downstream impact
       of Russian trolls on unwitting internet users who do not retweet the (surreptitiously)
       Russian tweet or its content and how they and their US compatriots behave when off
       Twitter. This is where exogenous variation in Russian trolling could be useful in forg-
       ing a link. To the extent local Russian factors drive English-language trolling, this may
       provide a natural experiment for considering impacts on higher-stakes, election-related
       behaviors.
           Instead, previous research has focused on persons who had direct interactions with
       Russian trolls and automated bots and how trolling content disseminated. Importantly,
       this direct dissemination can and has been observed.
           Bail et al. (2020) surveyed Twitter users in the fall of 2017 and observed in longi-
       tudinal data whether they directly accessed content from IRA accounts, the true IRA
       identities of which had not been disclosed to the public at that time. Bail et al. (2020)
       note that prior to their paper:
            Yet, to our knowledge, no studies have examined whether these efforts actu-
            ally impacted the attitudes and behaviors of the American public.
       At follow-up, Bail et al. (2020) found "no evidence that interacting with these accounts
       substantially impacted 6 political attitudes and behaviors." They reason that IRA ac-
       tivity may not show its intended effect because it was accessed disproportionately
   7
    For waves 2 and 4, Twitter noted: "We cannot render definitive attribution to the IRA for these (418)
accounts, although most appear to originate in Russia", and "accounts are associated with Current Policy,
engaging in state-backed political propaganda within Russia". See link1, link2.

                                                   3
       by (US) Twitter users who were already polarized. Bail et al. (2020) also note that
       "[s]tudies of political communications and campaigns, for example, have repeatedly
       demonstrated that it is very difficult to change people's views". In contrast, a working
       paper by Dutta et al. (2020) analyzes Twitter behavior of those users who were actively
       contacted by IRA bots and provide "some of the first evidence that contacted Twitter
       users' behavior underwent significant changes...following interactions with Russia's In-
       ternet Research Agency." They characterize their working paper's findings of changes
       in tweeting frequency and tweet sentiment as correlational: "The intent of this paper
       is not to establish causality" (Dutta et al., 2020). Focussing on Russian bots, Gorod-
       nichenko et al. (2018) find that "diffusion of information on Twitter is largely complete
       within 1-2 hours" and have a "tangible effect on the tweeting activity of humans". A
       working paper by Im et al. (2020) builds a machine learning algorithm to predict the
       likelihood that an account is a Russian troll, unbeknownst to other Twitter users. They
       then see to what extent these likely-troll accounts diffuse content to journalists.8
           All of these findings are for observed and direct links to trolling content. For social
       media content more broadly, impacts on "downstream" political outcomes like street
       protests or voter turnout have been shown using natural experiments, e.g. within Russia
       itself (Enikolopov, Makarin, and Petrova, 2020). In terms of content dissemination
       via social media, Zhuravskaya, Petrova, and Enikolopov (2020) note: "As immediate
       reactions are often based on emotions rather than reason, fake news, which evokes fear
       or anger, may spread faster than real news, which is often less emotionally charged."
           For Russian trolling specifically, we know of no natural experiment-based evidence
       that it has affected the more important downstream outcomes that may not be directly
       linkable with tweet- or account-level trolling data. To capture the full downstream im-
       pacts of trolling, such outcomes also need to be considered alongside the more "trace-
       able" ones. As a case in point, we describe suggestive evidence that Russian holidays
       impacted daily trading prices in 2016 election betting markets in the Discussion section.


       1       Methods and Research Design
       1.1     Data
       1.1.1    Russian Tweets
       According to the federal indictment, IRA began its interference in the US around 2014
       with its English-language "translator project" (US Department of Justice, 2018).9 This
       English-language group was "elite and secretive" (Chen, 2015). In July 2016, more than
       eighty IRA employees were assigned to this covert effort.
           In October 2018, Twitter announced:
             [W]e are releasing the full, comprehensive archives of the Tweets and media
             that are connected with these two previously disclosed and potentially state-
             backed operations on our service. We are making this data available with the
             goal of encouraging open research and investigation of these behaviors from
   8
     Anecdotally, the Washington Post noted that Eric Trump, Donald Trump Jr., and Kellyanne Conway all
posted information from a likely Russian troll @TEN GOP in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election.
   9
     Bail et al. (2020) cite a US Senate Intelligence Committee that IRA has been active since 2013. Twitter
blocked suspicious tweets posted back to 2009.


                                                     4
            researchers and academics around the world. These large datasets comprise
            3,841 accounts affiliated with the IRA, originating in Russia, and 770 other
            accounts, potentially originating in Iran. They include more than 10 million
            Tweets and more than 2 million images, GIFs, videos, and Periscope broad-
            casts, including the earliest on-Twitter activity from accounts connected with
            these campaigns, dating back to 2009.
           Among these were 2.9 million English-language tweets from the 3,841 IRA-affiliated
       accounts. Since October 2018, Twitter has been detecting and suspending accounts
       with known state-backed information operations. As of October 2020, Twitter released
       418, 4 and 1,152 blocked accounts linked with Russia in January 2019, June 2019 and
       June 2020, respectively. We refer to these releases as "waves" 2-4. Unfortunately, the
       date/time at which the individual account was blocked or removed is not disclosed by
       Twitter.10 Nor do we know whether the suspect accounts disclosed in the same blocking
       announcement were blocked simultaneously or separately. We focus on English tweets
       on the "day shift": 9am-9pm Russia time.11 Finally and descriptively, Linvill and
       Warren (2020) document "enormous heterogeneity in theme and approach across IRA
       accounts". For example, some tweets appear targeted at right-wing followers and others
       to sow discord on the left.
           The time series of Russian trolling activities by wave is shown in Figure 1. We see
       very little (unmasked) trolling activity after the fall of 2018. Also, the vast majority
       of English tweets ­ some 80% ­ come from wave 1, which were most active from late
       2014 through the end of 2017.

       1.1.2    Downstream outcomes
       According to February 2018 indictment, IRA sought to develop "certain fictitious U.S.
       personas into "leader[s] of public opinion in the United States" (US Department of
       Justice, 2018). Therefore, we look at the Hedonometer, a summary, widely-referenced12
       metric of "average happiness" of English tweets on Twitter. Hedonometer notes on its
       website: "Our Hedonometer is based on people's online expressions, capitalizing on
       data-rich social media, and we're measuring how people present themselves to the
       outside world". Dodds et al. (2011) provide detailed information on their scoring
       algorithm. An advantage to analyzing these downstream data is that they are available
       for all the initial posting dates of the subsequently-blocked accounts and tweets. As
       only 1,702 tweets posted before 2012 were subsequently blocked, we use 2012 as the
       start year of our study period.
           Rhode and Strumpf (2004) note there have been "large and well-organized markets
       for betting on presidential elections" stretching back to at least 1868. 2020 Election
       odds come from BetData, which tracks odds for 105 potential candidates beginning in
  10
      See supplementary material section 4 for an attempt at analyzing inferred blocking dates. We thank Joe
Doyle for a conversation that spurred this RD-style investigation.
   11
      Chen (2015) notes that IRA work shifts began at 9am and finished at 9pm. Linvill and Warren (2020)
likewise note: "IRA employees tasked with making social media posts are reported to have been organized
into 12-hour shifts, a day shift and night shift, and instructed to make posts at times appropriate to U.S.
time zones."
   12
      On October 3, Google scholar showed 680 citations of Dodds et al. (2011). The popular press has also
frequently invoked the Hedonometer, e.g. The Washington Post in August 2019 and The New York Times
in February 2015.


                                                     5
       November 2016. Because the identified trolls were most active before the November
       2016 election, we have less overlap between our election odds data and observed troll
       activity. 2016 Presidential election betting data come from Iowa Election Markets
       (IEM) and PredictIt, which both begin in November 2014. Since we observe daily
       price for 2016 Election odds and hourly price for 2020 Election odds, we use the daily
       closing price for 2016 election odds and hourly price at 2pm EST (9pm Russian time) for
       2020 odds. We use the implied probability of winning for Republican's and Democrat's
       candidates as outcome variables. A key difference of these markets is that PredictIt
       only allows traders in the US, BetData (Betfair) forbids US traders.13 IEM is open to
       traders worldwide.14


       1.2     Research Design
       1.2.1    Russian Holidays
       We define Russian holidays using the eight Federal holidays enumerated within the
       Labor Code of the Russian Federation. The eight Russian holidays are:

             New Years (January 1)
             Eastern Orthodox Christmas (January 7)
             Defender of the Fatherland Day (February 25)
             International Women's Day (March 8)
             Labor Day (May 1)
             Victory Day (May 9)
             Russia Day (June 12)
             Unity Day (November 4).

       We do not use January 1 because it coincides with a US holiday (which we also control
       for).
           We are not the first to notice a relationship between Russian holidays and Russian
       malfeasance in the US. In 2015, a cybersecurity firm in California was studying "an
       advanced persistent threat group that we suspect the Russian government sponsors",
       which they referred to as APT29. Their focus was not on Russian trolling by the
       IRA, but instead non-public actions by Russian intelligence itself. Released in July
       2015, the "Hamertoss" threat intelligence report by Fireeye Inc. noted in passing that
       "APT29 appeared to cease operations on Russian holidays....". They did not present
       any additional details or empirical evidence. To our knowledge, this holiday effect
       has not been picked up in the academic literature studying Russian interference. And
       fortunately for us, Russian holidays differ from US holidays, which may have distinct
       effects on outcomes of interest.

     From Betfair: "You will not bet or attempt to bet with us if you are located in the United States of
America or in any other country with a comparable legal situation. These countries will be determined by
Betfair from time to time."
  14
     From the IEM Trader's Manual: "Participation in the IEM is open to students, faculty, and staff at
colleges and universities worldwide; IEM political markets are also open to non-academic participants."

       1.2.2     Ambient Temperature
       Daily temperature data is from the National Climatic Data Center Global Summary
       of the Day (GSOD) dataset.15 We use mean temperature from weather stations in St.
       Petersburg 2012-2019 for the main result, and add London and other cities in U.S. in
       Supplementary Material Section 1.3.

       1.2.3     Wave-specific Factors
       Figure 1 shows that the level of tweeting differs markedly by wave of release. Ad-
       ditionally, Wave 1 was specifically attributed to the Internet Research Agency, while
       subsequent waves of blocked Russian tweets were not. Trolling tactics and practices
       evolved over time and it is possible that different groups of actors in differing locations
       within Russia were involved in different waves. For these reasons, our regression spec-
       ifications include wave-specific fixed effects and allow the effect of temperature and
       holiday to vary by wave:

                           4                                    4
                  Ywt =         w Holiday RUt × W avew +            w T emperaturet × W avew
                          w=1                                 w=1
                                                                                                     (1)
               +t Holiday U St + DOWt + (W ave  Y ear)wt + (W ave  M onth)wt + wt

       where Ywt denotes the number of wave w tweets posted 9am-9pm Russian time on day
       t.16 Coefficients 1 to 4 capture wave-specific impacts of Russian holidays, and 1 to 4
       capture temperature impacts. We also include a Holiday USt dummy and day of week
       fixed effects that are common across waves. (W ave  Y ear)wt and (W ave  M onth)wt
       denote year and month FE that are interacted with the wave dummies.


       2       Results
       2.1      Wave by Day Results
       In Table 1, we analyze how Russian holidays and temperature in St. Petersburg affect
       the total number of suspect (i.e. subsequently-blocked) tweets at the wave-day level.
       To isolate the holiday effect, we control for day-of-week fixed effects (FE), wave by
       year FE, and wave-specific seasonality (wave by calendar month FE). The number of
       blocked tweets released in the first wave during Russian holidays decreases by 0.29
       standard deviations or 35.1% relative to the mean, as compared with non-holidays.
       The .29 point estimate is fairly precise, with a standard error of .09 to .10. Also on the
       first wave, a one standard deviation increase in temperature more modestly increases
       blocked tweets by 0.056 standard deviations, or 6.8% relative to the mean. Holiday and
       temperature estimates appear driven by the subset of original tweets (Panel B), which
  15

  16
    We drop tweets with blank tweet text for further analysis. Among non-blank tweets, we consider pure
retweets without comments as retweets, non-retweets or retweets with comments as original tweets. In
practice, we label tweet as retweet if it starts with "RT" and its field is retweet is true. In Appendix Section
6, we add back blank tweets and only use field is retweet to label retweets. Results are very similar to main
results without blank tweets.


                                                       7
       might be expected to have a greater impact on downstream outcomes than retweets
       (Panel C).
           In Column (2)-(4), we add linear, quadratic, and cubic day trends in the regression
       to allow for the nonlinear time trend in Russian trolling activity. Since we already
       control for wave by year FE, we assume the same within-year trends for the four waves
       after controlling wave-specific seasonality. R2 s are similar in Column (1)-(4), indicating
       a poor explanatory contribution from the time trends. Estimates on holidays and
       temperature remain stable with these additional controls. In Column (5) and (6), we
       conduct a more aggressive control strategy, leveraging within year-by-month-by-wave
       comparisons. Adding these fixed effects increases the R2 from .36 to .5.17 The impact
       estimate for Russian holidays is highly robust, the point estimate remaining at -.29
       standard deviations. Though estimates on temperature are not significant, we think
       seasonality of temperature in St. Petersburg is sufficiently controlled with calendar
       month FE and we will only use Column (1)-(4) estimates to gauge the impact of local
       temperature fluctuations. Adding year-month FE may absorb temperature fluctuations
       that last for several days and are registered by the year by month FE.
           In contrast to the first wave, the impact of holiday or temperature on tweets released
       in other three waves is not significantly different from 0. As mentioned above, the latter
       three releases together contain 20% of the total English-language troll tweets Twitter
       has tied to Russia to date.


       2.2      Wave 1 Event Study
       We show the holiday impact on the first wave "mother lode" of tweets in Figure 2.
       Over the 2012-2017 activity period for wave 1 accounts, we use 42 holidays for original
       tweets and 44 holidays for retweets. Without any control variables, the number of
       tweets decreases by roughly 200 on day 0 and the magnitude is very similar to our
       point estimates in Table 1 Panel A, which includes a more extensive set of controls.
       In the event that holidays coincide with weekends or are otherwise correlated with the
       day of the week, we add day-of-week FE (only, no other control variables) in the middle
       panel. The pattern is quite similar and the trough on day 0 (the holiday itself) is more
       obvious.
           In addition to day of the week FE, Appendix Table S6 adds additional control
       variables and shows that the holiday effect is robust and statistically significant. These
       regression controls include year and month FE, and even year by month FE, thereby
       restricting comparisons to be within the same month. The bottom panel of Figure 2
       displays the same-month comparisons. Residuals with day-of-week and year-month FE
       decrease by 85 original tweets and 70 retweets on day 0.
           Figure 3 focusses on the sub-period of the 2016 election campaign: November 2014-
       November 2016. The holiday pattern is if anything more pronounced during these
       two years, this despite using only 11 holidays for original tweets and 15 holidays for
       retweets. Again, this pattern is highly robust to regression controls.
17
     R2 s are higher for the retweeting operations than original tweets.

       2.3     Robustness
       First stage estimates are robust when we drop the top 10 busiest days for each wave
       2012-2019 (SI Section 1.2). The magnitude of holiday effect is somewhat smaller than
       that in Table 1. Although very busy trolling days contribute some to the estimated
       holiday effect, we still see a qualitatively-similar decrease in the number of tweets
       on holidays as compared with the non-busiest days.18 Dropping the temperature in
       St. Petersburg variable, i.e. only focussing on holiday, also yields similar first stage
       estimates (SI Section 1.1). We also control for daily temperature in other major Amer-
       ican/English cities: London, New York, Los Angeles, and Washington DC (SI Section
       1.3). The first stage point estimates have slightly larger magnitudes with the inclusion
       of temperature controls in the four Western cities.


       2.4     First Stage Mechanism
       Holiday timing is an intuitive and common natural experiment in economics. For exam-
       ple, avoidance by physicians of holiday deliveries creates a pronounced dip in induced
       deliveries, which can be used to evaluate health impacts of induction on surrounding
       days (Jacobson et al., 2020). Part of the reason is that the shadow cost of leisure in-
       creases markedly on holidays. This is a fairly straight-forward mechanism for reduced
       Russian trolling activity on Russian holidays.
           Turning to temperature, St. Petersburg is cold. In July, the average daily high tem-
       perature is 72  F and daily high temperatures in January are typically below freezing.
       IRA work has been characterized as occurring indoors and concentrated for a time at
       an office building at 55 Savushkina Street in St. Petersburg. In an office environment,
       task productivity peaks around 72  F (Sepp¨   anen et al., 2006; Heal et al., 2017). To the
       extent that indoor climate control is imperfect at trolling workplaces, warmer ambient
       temperatures may bring the indoor temperature closer to the productivity optimum.
       Alternatively, it could be that cold experienced outside of work has a persistent effect
       on productivity while at work. Finally, colder temperatures may be associated with
       factors like ice that make it more difficult to get to work.
           For completeness, we note factors that did not appear to affect trolling activity.
       Domestic Russian protests may have distracted IRA workers from the US-interference
       operation. Motivated by the observation that "Employees were mostly in their 20s"
       (Chen, 2015), we considered the schedule of local hockey games. Neither appeared
       to affect the intensity of English-language trolling activity. Finally, increased Brexit
       trolling did not appear to decrease non-Brexit trolling (through a trolling supply con-
       straint).


       3     Discussion
       International political interference is anything but new. Britain interfered in the 1940
       U.S. election to support Roosevelt. The CIA covertly placed ideological content in East
       German media (Yaffa, 2020) and orchestrated the overthrow of Iran's democratically-
       elected prime minister Mohammad Mossadeq in 1953. The CIA also interfered in the
       1996 Russian election. Scott Shane (The New York Times ) noted in a 2018 interview:
18
     Busiest days may also be an outcome of the Russian holiday schedule.


                                                    9
             But we have certainly put our thumb on the scales in elections once in Rus-
             sia, trying to prevent the election of a communist in 1996 who was leading
             in the polls against Boris Yeltsin. And so we, you know, we intervened in a
             significant way to help Yeltsin's re-election.
       What is more novel about election interference by the IRA is that it "industrialized the
       art of trolling" (Chen, 2015). Indeed, a former IRA employee relayed to the Washington
       Post : "Your first feeling, when you ended up there, was that you were in some kind of
       factory that turned lying, telling untruths, into an industrial assembly line...."
           The null findings in Bail et al. (2020) resonate with a broader suspicion that while
       salacious, Russian trolling does not have important "downstream" effects, say to elec-
       tion outcomes. As the New Yorker recently put it, the impactful IRA narrative may
       be an "overly convenient" explanation for our home-grown problems and:
             What if, to borrow an old horror-movie trope, the call is coming from inside
             the house? (Yaffa, 2020)
       That is, domestic election interference by the President, news media disinformation,
       domestic conspiracy theories, etc. may be more consequential. President Trump himself
       has repeatedly questioned the integrity of mail-in voting and the Director of the US
       Postal Service has been accused of deliberately slowing mail deliveries. Switching to
       COVID-19, Bursztyn et al. (2020) attribute higher mortality to watching Sean Hannity
       on Fox, who has consistently downplayed the risks of infection. These culprits are all
       domestic.
           Our novel approach to trolling attempts to isolate variation in disinformation com-
       ing from abroad. We find that Russian holidays and temperatures in St. Petersburg
       help predict daily variation in Russian trolling activity. That is, we argue a phone call
       is indeed also coming from "outside the house".
           Moreover, if Russian holidays and temperature are exogenous, then they may help
       address the issue for causal inference posed by endogenous selection into who accesses
       (Bail et al., 2020) or is the target of (Dutta et al., 2020) IRA content. And if additional
       exogenous factors can be identified, this could be a powerful approach for assessing
       trolling impacts. As troll tweets include a time stamp, this might include utilizing
       variation at a higher frequency than the daily variation we consider.19 When Twitter
       discloses more recent Troll activity ­ perhaps after the November 2020 election ­ these
       again can be explored for their relationship to exogenous drivers and thereby their
       potential causal effect on recent election-related outcomes. Twitter accounts from
       Turkey, China, Iran, and Venezuela have also been blocked by Twitter alongside those
       from Russia, so our approach could be extended to consider other source country-
       specific factors behind trolling.
           To illustrate both "proof of concept" as well as some limitations, the appendix
       sections 2.2, 3.2, and 3.3 consider two downstream outcomes: daily Hedonometer and
       election odds. The Hedonometer measures sentiment and inferred happiness of English-
       language tweets. Reduced form impacts for Russian holidays are not distinguishable
       from 0, implying no detectable impact on happiness. Standard errors are similar to
       point estimates. If we take double the point estimates, we can reject impacts of around
       .01. For comparison, we see that the Hedonometer increases .056 on US holidays, fell
       0.06 when Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed for the Supreme Court, and fell .2 on the
19
     For example, election odds are available from BetData by the hour.


                                                    10
       day of the mass shooting in Dayton (SI Table S16). Analyzing the Hedonometer has
       the advantage of leveraging daily variation across the full time period of wave 1 tweets.
           We can also consider daily presidential election odds as inferred from betting mar-
       kets. A drawback in considering election odds is that we are forced to analyze a shorter
       time period, which renders our reduced form (but not the first stage) noisier. Consid-
       ering the 2016 election odds, Iowa Election Markets data began November 17, 2014
       and ended November 10, 2016. This means we can analyze 2016 odds around just 15
       holiday events20 and 315 betting days in total.21 The reduced form event study figures
       are shown in Figures S1. Democratic odds peak on Russian holidays, while Republican
       odds hit their nadir. Unadjusted event study estimates (top panel, Figure S1) are very
       similar to the regression-adjusted ones (middle and bottom panels, Figure S1). Tables
       S13 and S14 show a statistically significant increase in 2016 Democratic odds on Rus-
       sian holidays when trolling fell by around a third (Figure 3).22 Conversely, odds for
       Republicans fell by a similar amount on the 15 Russian holidays. Notably, the reduced
       form estimates do not change at all with alternative sets of control variable in Tables
       S13 and S14 ­ including month by year fixed effects ­ suggesting a robust relationship.
           We repeat the analysis of 2016 election odds using data from the PredictIt betting
       market.23 While newer, the PredictIt market is likely thicker than the Iowa Election
       Market.24 Additionally, only US Citizens may bet on the PredictIt market for presiden-
       tial candidates,25 appealing for a reason we note below. The unadjusted reduced form
       for 2016 again shows a Democratic peak in odds on Russian holidays and a Republican
       minimum (Figure S2). This basic pattern persists with regression adjustment.26 The
       reduced form effect of holidays is distinguishable from 0 at the 5% significance level,
       as show in Table S15. Effect magnitudes are around .01. If in Instrumental-Variables
       fashion one is willing to scale this by the first stage to extrapolate to the elimination
       of Russian trolling (see Footnote 28), 2016 odds move by around .03. In contrast,
       US holidays show no impact on election odds (Table S15). Finally, we note Russian
       holidays have similar-sized effects in the Iowa and PredictIt data.27
  20
      There are 16 Russian holidays over this period. The last holiday, Nov 4, 2016, is dropped due to
incomplete "post" betting data.
   21
      Using a 21 day window around each holiday. If we drop the busiest trolling days and events, we analyze
only 11 holidays and 231 days for all and original tweets, and 15 holidays and 315 days for retweeted tweets.
   22
      Appendix Table S11 shows first stage in tables for the November 2014-November 2016 period. If anything,
the holiday-indued reduction is more obvious than in the full sample.
   23
      We sum prices from the candidate-specific market as it permits analysis of more holidays and more
betting days (315 betting days, same as with the the Iowa data). The candidate-specific PredictIt market is
substantially thicker than the political party PredictIt market, the former having nine times more trading
volume over our sample period.
   24
      Indeed, the trading volume over our 315 day period is two orders of magnitude higher on PredictIt than
Iowa Election Markets. We thank Koleman Strumpf for flagging the differences in thickness/liquidity across
exchanges.
   25
       PredictIt's Parker Howell emailed us on October 19, 2020: "All traders on PredictIt have to be American
citizens who have passed ID verification. Anyone trying to trade from a Russian IP address would have been
blocked in 2016. If ever we suspect a trader of fraud their account is frozen until they can upload a US-issued
photo ID."
   26
      The vertical scale makes the regression-adjusted pattern appear noisier than the unadjusted reduced
form (Figure S2).
   27
      The Democrats' probability increases by 2.5% on Russian holidays in the Iowa data (Table S14) and
increases 2.1% in the PredictIt data (Table S15). Conversely, Republicans' probability decreases by 1.7% on


                                                      11
          Our 2020 election odds data begin in November 2016. Wave 1 tweets stop at the
      end of 2017. This permits a reduced form analysis of just 168 betting days (and 8
      holiday events in total) that are, moreover, extremely early in the 2020 campaign.
      While holidays if anything matter more for the first stage in original tweets from late
      2016 through 2017, in the reduced form we detect no impact on 2020 election odds
      that is distinguishable statistically from zero.
          The above reduced form estimates for holidays can be interpreted causally if the
      conditional independence assumption is satisfied (Angrist and Pischke, 2009).28 While
      that seems likely enough to us, the noise in the reduced form figures is a reason for
      caution. But even if Russian holidays are conditionally independent of potential out-
      comes, this does not imply that the reduced form impacts are attributable to Russian
      trolling. One obvious threat is that Russian holidays might have a direct effect on US
      election odds or internet happiness, e.g. through non-trolling Russians living in the US.
      Unfortunately we have been unable to find information on the number of undisguised
      Russians or Russian-Americans placing election bets or tweeting in English, let alone
      the effect of Russian holidays on their betting behavior or happiness (as expressed in
      English on Twitter). For the Hedonometer null result, our prior is that this is very
      small relative to the roughly 59 million non-Russian Twitter users in the US. To the
      extent that only US citizens can bet on the PredictIt market, we are less concerned
      about direct effects of Russian holidays on 2016 election odds, although US citizens
      who observe Russian holidays could still exert a direct effect on election odds. That US
      holidays appear to have no effect on US election odds (cf. the Hedonometer increase
      on US holidays) may suggest the direct effect of Russian holidays on betting behavior
      by Russian-Americans in PredictIt markets might also be modest.
          Our reduced form approach readily generalizes to the analysis of other high-frequency
      US outcomes that may be of interest to researchers and are believed to impact elec-
      tions, such as time-series variation in political campaign donations, street protests, etc.
      Our analysis here can be viewed as initial "proof of concept" for future analyses that
      emphasize:
         1. Exogenous drivers of Russian trolling activity ­ neglected by the existing litera-
            ture.
         2. Trolling's causal effect on indirectly-affected outcomes of interest, i.e. outcomes
            where the precise path of content sharing, dissemination, and downstream impacts
            cannot be traced.
      These indirect channels may be the most challenging and important ones to understand.


Russian holidays in the Iowa data (Table S14), and decreases by 2.8% in the PredictIt data (Table S15).
   28
      We do not conduct an instrumental variables (IV) analysis that predicts subsequently-exposed trolling
activity on Twitter from Russian holidays and St. Petersburg's weather. There would be some familiar
reasons to take such IV estimates with a grain of salt. Most obvious is that Twitter was not the only online
platform the IRA has targeted. Part of the effect, assuming there is one, could be coming from variation in
trolling on platforms like Facebook or Instagram, which would not be captured by the endogenous variable
Twitter provided. Similarly, Russian Twitter accounts that were not blocked could be undetected Trolls and
follow a similar (unobserved) first stage on Twitter. These omissions would violate the exclusion restriction
for the blocked suspected-IRA tweets (endogenous variable) we can observe and analyze. And as always, the
strength of the instruments in the first stage for the particular outcome of interest would need to be assessed
(Staiger and Stock, 1997; Lee et al., 2020).

Figure 2: Event Study of Wave 1 tweets (day shift) around Russian holidays 2012-2017
(We drop top 10 busiest days for each category (all, original, retweeted tweets) 2012-2017, and only keep holiday
events with complete data over the 21-day window. This results in a smaller number of events than 48 (8 events per year over
6 years) and a different number of events for each category, reported in parentheses. For Panel A, we calculate the simple
average of tweets on each event day. For Panel B and C, we add day-of-week FE and year-month FE and calculate the average
of predicted residuals.)
