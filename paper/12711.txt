A Stable International Monetary System Emerges: Inflation Targeting is Bretton Woods, Reversed

                                              ABSTRACT

A stable international monetary system has emerged since the early 1990s. A large number of industrial
and a growing number of developing countries now have domestic inflation targets administered by
independent and transparent central banks. These countries place few restrictions on capital mobility
and allow their exchange rates to float. The domestic focus of monetary policy in these countries does
not have any obvious international cost. Inflation targeters have lower exchange rate volatility and
less frequent sudden stops of capital flows than similar countries that do not target inflation. Inflation
targeting countries also do not have current accounts or international reserves that look different from
other countries. This system was not planned and does not rely on international coordination. There
is no role for a center country, the IMF, or gold. It is durable; in contrast to other monetary regimes,
no country has been forced to abandon an inflation-targeting regime. Succinctly, it is the diametric
opposite of the post-war system; Bretton Woods, reversed.

1. Motivation and Introduction

       All countries choose their monetary policy. Collectively, the interaction of these policies

constitutes the international monetary system. For instance, during the “Bretton Woods” regime

after WWII, countries fixed their exchange rates to the American dollar. A fixed exchange rate

is a well-defined monetary policy that is still used by a number of countries. In the presence of

capital mobility, it subordinates monetary policy to the objective of exchange rate stability at the

expense of other domestic interests. Because of this conflict, most fixed exchange rates do not

stayed fixed for long. But when countries float their exchange rates, they have to choose another

monetary regime; floating is not a coherent monetary policy. Some countries have tried to

pursue money growth targets, often without success. Others have hybrid strategies involving

multiple or moving targets; some countries do not even have clearly-defined monetary policies.

       Fourteen of the thirty OECD countries currently have a monetary policy that explicitly

targets inflation. These countries have a combined population exceeding 430 million, and

produce over an eighth of global output, so inflation targeting is an important monetary policy.

But even these impressive numbers understate the importance of inflation targeting (hereafter

“IT”). Twelve OECD countries are in EMU, which is almost a formal inflation targeter

(Wyplosz, 2006), and may become one soon; another pair (Denmark and the Slovak Republic)

are waiting to join EMU.1 The United States has been an implicit IT country for years

(Goodfriend, 2003), and may become an explicit one soon. There is speculation that Japan may

adopt IT when its deflationary days are definitively over. So the entire OECD may soon be

using the same monetary strategy.

       But inflation targeting is not simply a policy of rich countries. As of June 2006, ten

developing countries with 750 million people have also adopted IT. Altogether, countries that




                                                 1
formally target inflation currently constitute over a quarter of the global economy. And IT is not

only important but likely to grow in significance as the remaining OECD and more developing

countries adopt it.

        This paper examines the implications of this widespread policy for the international

monetary system.



Targeting Inflation, Floating Exchange Rates

        Mishkin (2004) lists five components to an inflation targeting regime:

   1.   The public announcement of medium-term numerical targets for inflation,
   2.   An institutional commitment to price stability as the primary goal of monetary policy,
   3.   An information-inclusive strategy to set policy instruments,
   4.   Increased transparency of the monetary policy strategy, and
   5.   Increased accountability of central bank for attaining its inflation objectives.


While inflation targeting has been defined in different ways, most are similar. Table A1 lists IT

countries, along with the dates that the IT regime began. It is not always clear precisely when an

IT regime began, and scholars sometimes disagree about these dates. For instance, Mishkin and

Schmidt-Hebbel (2001) date the start of Australia’s IT regime to September 1994 whereas the

Reserve Bank of Australia dates it to March 1993.2 Accordingly, I tabulate a default date that

represents my best judgment as to when IT began, along with a conservative date. These are

typically close together.3

        An inflation targeting regime usually entails a floating exchange rate (Taylor, 2001).

Insofar as inflation targeting countries use a formal intermediate target for monetary policy, it is

the inflation forecast, rather than, e.g., the exchange rate or money growth rate (Bernanke and

Mishkin, 1997). Most IT countries let their exchange rates float quite freely. A typical

statement comes from the Bank of Israel, which states that “the Bank of Israel has adopted a



                                                  2
strategy of no direct intervention in the determination of the exchange rate. This means allowing

the exchange rate to fluctuate continuously in response to financial and economic changes …”4

The Norwegian central bank has not intervened since January 1999, the Canadian since

September 1998, the Israeli since June 1997, and the British have intervened only once since

September 1997.5 New Zealand has not intervened in the foreign exchange market in over

twenty years!6 There are exceptions of course; the Reserve Bank of Australia intervened in the

1990s, the developing countries sometimes intervene, and a few have even maintained exchange

rate targets for a while along with their inflation target. But the trend is clearly towards flexible

rates; when countries do intervene, the IT countries now do so in order to hit their inflation

targets, not to maintain fixed exchange rates.7

       So the international monetary system seems likely to be increasingly dominated by IT

countries with floating exchange rates. Despite the relatively youth of this system, some of its

properties have been already studied from a theoretical viewpoint; see e.g., Benigno and Benigno

(2005, 2006) and Obstfeld and Rogoff (2002). The characteristics of IT countries have been

studied empirically, and much is now known about monetary policy under IT; see, e.g., Ball and

Sheridan (2003), Bernanke et al (1999), IMF (2005), Levin et al (2004), and Siklos (1999).

However, the focus of empirical work in IT is almost always on domestic aspects of IT, such as

the level, volatility, or persistence of inflation or output. There has been little positive analysis

of the international effects of IT. Accordingly, the focus of this paper is empirical and

international, rather than normative or domestic.



2. Inflation Targeting: A Durable Monetary Regime




                                                   3
       Inflation targeting has proven to be quite durable. Twenty-three countries adopted

inflation targets by the end of 2004 (another four have joined in the eighteen months following).

Only two of those – Finland and Spain – have abandoned IT. Both left to join EMU in 1999,

neither under economic duress (and the ECB maintains an inflation target). This stands in stark

contrast to alternative monetary regimes experienced since WWII, which have been plagued by

crisis and failure, and accordingly transient. Fixed exchange rate regimes do not stay fixed

forever! Other monetary strategies – such as money growth targets, multiple targets, or hybrid

strategies – also tend to be short lived, unsuccessful, or both.

       Describing IT as a durable policy may seem like a bold assertion. After all, New Zealand

adopted the first IT strategy only in 1990. As of June 2006 we have at most sixteen years of

experience with inflation targeting. This is especially true of developing countries. Chile started

to target inflation in 1991, but many developing countries that have been targeting inflation have

done so for only a short while.

       Still, looking back over the last century, sixteen years turns out to be a long time for a

monetary regime. Writing before the currency crises of the late 1990s, Obstfeld and Rogoff

(1995) forcefully pointed out how very transient modern fixed exchange rate regimes seem to

be.8 Even the Bretton Woods regime of capital controls and fixed but adjustable pegged

exchange rates lasted less than thirteen years, from January 1959 (when European currencies

became convertible for current account transactions) through the crisis of August 1971.9 (Even

this period was far from smooth; Germany and the Netherlands revalued in 1961, the UK and

France devalued in 1967 and 1969 respectively, while Germany floated and then revalued in

1969.10) And most regimes that target money growth have not survived even that long.11




                                                  4
How Long do Exchange Rate Regimes Last?

       It is not possible to sensibly estimate the reasons why countries crash out of IT regimes,

since none ever has.12 Still, one can compare the durability of IT with that of monetary regimes

chosen by other (non-IT) countries during the same period of time. Accordingly, I form a

“control group” of country x year observations for the period since IT began in early 1990

through the end of most usable data in 2004. To ensure that the members of the control group

can be reasonably compared with the IT countries, I restrict my attention to non-IT countries

with a) real GDP per capita at least as high as those of the poorest IT country in 2000, and b)

population at least as big as those of the smallest IT country.13 From the universe of all countries

with their own money, I form a set of 42 control group countries.14 Since Iceland (the smallest

IT country) is something of a size outlier, as a sensitivity check I also exclude countries smaller

than New Zealand (the second-smallest IT country) but larger than Iceland.15 The members of

the control group are tabulated in Table A2; “small” countries (defined as those whose 2000

population lay between Iceland and New Zealand) are marked.16

       In Table A2 I also provide the most recent available IMF information on the monetary

framework, as well as the number of changes in exchange rate regimes experienced by each of

the control group countries.17 I use two different exchange rate regime classifications. The first

is the well-known data set of Levy-Yeyati and Sturzenegger (2003), hereafter “LYS”, who use a

combination of exchange rate behavior and central bank intervention to create a five-way

classification of regimes (float, dirty float, crawling peg, fix, and inconclusive). The second data

set is also well-known, and was created by Reinhart and Rogoff (2004), hereafter “RR”, by

comparing exchange rate behavior over time for official and market rates to create a 14-way




                                                 5
classification of exchange regimes.18 The annual LYS data are available from 1990 through the

end of 2004, while the monthly RR data extend only through 2001.19

       There are clearly issues associated with these measures of monetary policy regimes.

First, the samples considered by LYS and RR do not coincide.20 Second, there are differences

between the classifications thrown out by the two systems. For instance LYS count 7 switches

of exchange rate regime for Belarus between 1990 and 2004; in contrast, RR have none between

1990 and 2001. (The discrepancy may be more imagined than real, since RR classify Belarus as

“freely falling” throughout, thus essentially agreeing with LYS that Belarus conducted unstable

monetary policy continuously). Most significantly, it is possible that switches in the monetary

regime need not be reflected in either the RR or LYS classifications. One would like to have

measures of monetary policy regimes rather than exchange rate regimes; to repeat, a fixed

exchange rate provides a nominal anchor for monetary policy, but a float does not. Thus in both

data sets, a country that maintains a floating exchange rate and moves into or out of (say) a

money growth target may show no change in its exchange rate regime.21 So the RR and LYS are

noisy measures of switches in monetary regimes, and are likely to understate the actual amount

change in a country’s monetary regime.22

       Still, even a naïve look at Table A2 shows just how unstable most monetary policies have

been. Many of the 42 countries in the control group have experienced numerous changes in the

exchange rate regime. For instance, Jamaica switched regimes eleven times in fifteen years

according to the LYS method, and five in the twelve available years of RR data. Only five

countries experienced no changes under either classification. Of these, Morocco targets M1

growth, and maintains an exchange rate peg with many controls against a secret multilateral

basket, while Syria maintains an exchange rate peg but with many controls and multiple




                                                 6
exchange rates. So there are only three relevant countries with monetary regimes as durable as

inflation targeting. One is Hong Kong’s successful currency board. The IMF describes the other

two – Japan and the United States – as having “no explicitly stated nominal anchor, but

monitoring various indicators in conducting monetary policy.”23

       It is possible to look at the data on exchange rate regime switches more comprehensively

and rigorously. I use standard statistical techniques (see e.g., Gopinath and Rigobon, 2006) and

define three measures of regime persistence as:



       Average Probability of Regime Change, country i: pˆ i ≡ ∑ # regchangesi / Observations i

       Average time in Regime, country i: ~
                                          ti ≡ ∑ Timeinregimei / regimes i

       Spell-weighted Avg time in Regime, country i: tˆi ≡ ∑ (Timeinregimei ) 2 / Observations i



where: #regchangesi is the number of regime changes for country i, Observationsi is the number

of (country*period) observations, Timeinregime is the time spent inside in a regime, and regimes

is the total number of regimes.

       The average probability of regime change may be uninteresting if a small number of

countries dominates the sample. The second measure uses each regime as a spell of time, and is

simply the inverse of the probability of change. The third measure corrects the second one for

bias by weighting observations by the length of the regime; Gopinath and Rigobon provide more

details and an example.

       I construct my measures for each country in the control group, and tabulate in Table 1

simple averages computed across countries. Levy-Yeyati and Sturzenegger (2003) present two

(similar) exchange rate regime classifications; one uses three “buckets” while the other uses five.


                                                  7
I use both, as well as the RR classification. To ensure robustness, I also calculate the statistics

after excluding the small countries identified in Table A1. Thus there are six (= three regime

classifications x with/without small countries) different estimates tabulated for each statistic.

       The estimates of Table 1 give a strong impression that exchange rate regimes for the

control group countries have not lasted long. The exact estimates vary a little depending on

whether one uses the LYS or RR classification of exchange rate regimes. The RR scheme shows

a lower probability of regime change, and a longer average time between regime switches. Still,

the most striking finding is how transient exchange rate regimes are. The probability of a regime

changing within a year is over a quarter if ones uses the LYS scheme, so that the average regime

lasts three years or less. Using the RR classification increases durability some, as does

weighting the average time spent in a regime. But overall, exchange rate regimes seem to be

ephemeral phenomena. Nothing much depends on whether one uses the 3- or 5-bucket LYS

measure, or whether one includes or excludes small countries.

       I supplement the three statistical measures presented in Table 1 with survivorship data in

Table 2. I tabulate the probability of exchange rate regimes surviving for different periods of

time, in particular through two, four, six and eight years. To check the sensitivity of my results, I

again use all three exchange rate regime classifications, and both include and exclude small

countries. Since there are different ways to treat the interaction between countries and exchange

rate regimes, I produce three sets of results. In the top panel, I treat countries as having country-

specific characteristics since countries may have different probabilities of having exchange rate

regimes survive. Alternatively, one can treat each exchange rate regime as an independent

observation, as I do in the middle panel. Finally, one can consider only the regime that a country

began the sample with, and determine the probability of that initial regime surviving.




                                                  8
       No matter how you chop up the data, the impression one gets from Table 2 echoes that of

Table 1; exchange rate regimes tend to be fleeting. The default results of Table 2a indicate that

the probability of a regime surviving even eight years is below .3; for the 5-regime LYS scheme,

it is below .1. The exact survivorship rates vary somewhat, but essentially all are low even six or

eight years out. This implies that the data we have on the duration of existing IT countries is

starting to be of meaningful duration. Nine IT regimes have already survived eight years; if

inflation targeting was comparable in durability to an exchange rate regime, this would be

extremely unlikely.24 I conclude that IT has already proven to be a durable monetary regime, in

stark contrast to exchange rate regimes.25



3. Bretton Woods, Reversed

       A number of IT countries are currently in an apparently durable monetary regime; this is

the most striking contrast with previous international monetary systems such as the Bretton

Woods system. But there are many others. In fact, there are so many points of comparisons

between the features of the Bretton Woods system and the behavior of the inflation targeters that

I have collected them together in Table 3.

       Most of the differences are straightforward between the systems are straightforward.

Mundell’s celebrated “Incompatible Trinity” states that fixed exchange rates, free capital flows

and a domestic focus for monetary policy are desirable goals that are mutually exclusive. Most

IT countries have liberalized capital markets and relinquished control over their exchange rates,

the exact opposite of the Bretton Woods system.26 Since the IT countries float, there is typically

no important role for public capital flows any more; speculative activity on the foreign exchange

markets revolves around floaters, not speculators trying to attack a country’s fixed rate. And the




                                                 9
increased volume of private capital flows has allowed the system to handle large sustained

current account imbalances, which are proportionately larger now than during the Bretton Woods

regime.

        The current system seems to be delivering different (often better) economic outcomes

than the Bretton Woods regime. But it is also interesting to trace the history of the system. The

Bretton Woods system was deliberately planned, the outcome of a long series of negotiations

between eminent economists representing the interests of critical countries. “Bretton Woods”

itself is the name of the resort town in New Hampshire where the conference delegates signed

the agreements for the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the ITO/GATT in July

1944.

        The deliberate design and construction of the Bretton Woods system can be contrasted

with the evolution of the current system. Countries that adopt IT do not agree to join an

internationally recognized monetary system and do not accept commonly accepted “rules of the

game” either implicitly or explicitly. Rather, the system has grown in a more Darwinian style,

simply because of its manifest success. International cooperation is simply not a key part of the

current international monetary system. This is another difference with the Bretton Woods

system which required massive international cooperation to function.27 Accordingly, many of

the key institutions of the Bretton Woods system are now essentially irrelevant. The

International Monetary Fund has evolved into a crisis-manager for developing countries (often

those suffering speculative attacks on their fixed exchange rate regimes), and plays no real role

in the new system. There is no special role for a center or anchor country like the United States

– that is, no “N/N-1 problem.” Gold is irrelevant (as is the SDR). Developing countries are

participating more quickly and fully in the system than they did under Bretton Woods. The key




                                                10
players are central banks; these are now more independent, accountable and transparent than

under Bretton Woods.

       One final point is of interest. Serious objections had been made to the Bretton Woods

system by well-known economists long before its demise. Robert Triffin observed as early as

1947 that the system had a tendency to meet the demand for reserves through the growth of

foreign dollar balances, making it dynamically unstable. Milton Friedman famously made the

case for floating exchange rates in 1950, a case emphatically echoed by Harry Johnson in 1969.

By way of contrast, there is a much greater alignment of IT with academic thought. Indeed,

much of the case for inflation targeting was made by distinguished academics including Ben

Bernanke, Rick Mishkin, and Lars Svensson.



4. Exchange Rate Volatility

       Inflation targeting requires exchange rate flexibility. But do countries with IT experience

systematically higher exchange rate volatility in practice? Does the domestic focus of monetary

policy under IT impose a “cost” on the country in the form of substantially higher exchange rate

volatility? Many countries seem to have a “fear of floating” (especially in developing countries);

when they adopt IT, are their fears justified? Or does the presence of a durable monetary

framework eliminate policy shocks that cause exchange rate volatility? I now attempt to answer

such questions by comparing exchange rate volatility between the IT and control group

countries.28

       I use multilateral (effective) exchange rates for both IT and control group countries from

the International Monetary Fund’s International Financial Statistics data set. I use both nominal

(IFS line “neu” for industrial countries, “nec” for developing countries) and real exchange rate




                                                11
measures; the latter are based on relative CPIs (IFS line “rec”). The series are available monthly

from 1990 through December 2005. Data on nominal effective exchange rates are available for

45 IT and control group countries, while real rates are available for 42 of them (the three missing

are Hong Kong, SAR China; the Dominican Republic, and Lebanon).

       To measure volatility, I take natural logarithms of effective exchange rates, and then

estimate the standard deviation of a country’s log effective exchange rate over an interval of

time. The appropriate period for the data is not obvious, so I use three alternatives to split the

data into sensible mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive periods. First, for each country I

estimate four standard deviations, one over each four-year long period between January 1990 and

December 2005. (Thus the first standard deviation for Australia is estimated using data from

1990m1 through 1993m12; the second one from 1994m1 through 1997m12 and so forth.)

Second, for each country I estimate two standard deviations, one from each of the two eight-year

periods. Finally, for each country I estimate one standard deviation over the entire sixteen year

period. Thus, at (say) the four-year horizon I have observations from a number of different IT

and control-group countries, each contributing a maximum of four observations over time.29 I

use all available data for the control group countries, and the IT regime observations for the IT

countries.30

       I then regress exchange rate volatility on a binary dummy variable which is one for

countries that use IT, and zero otherwise. I use OLS and also include an intercept, time-specific

fixed effects, and a set of control variables. That is, I estimate:



        Vol (eer ) it = βITit + α + Σ t γ tTt + Σ jδ j X jit + ε it




                                                             12
where: Vol(eer)it is the volatility of the effective exchange rate for country i over period t, ITit is

a dummy variable that is one if i is an inflation targeter over period t and zero otherwise, Tt is a

period-specific fixed effect, Xjit is a set of controls, ε is a well-behaved disturbance term, and α,

γ, and δ are nuisance parameters. The regressors that I include as controls are the average values

of: 1) the current account (expressed as a percentage of GDP); 2) the natural logarithm of

openness (exports plus imports, again as a percentage of GDP); 3) log population; and 4) log

PPP-adjusted real GDP per capita. The data for the control variables are all taken from the

World Bank’s World Development Indicators.31

        Table 4 reports coefficient estimates for this dummy variable, along with standard errors

in parentheses; estimates that are significantly different from zero at the .05 (.01) level are

marked by one (two) asterisk(s). A negative coefficient indicates that exchange rate volatility is

lower under IT. There are six columns of results. Three use the nominal exchange rate to

construct the dependent variable at the 4- 8- and 16-year intervals; the other three use the real

exchange rate (at the same intervals).

        A caveat. Since I ignore how countries choose their monetary regime, I am implicitly

ignoring potential simultaneity and selection issues. Since not all countries have adopted it,

inflation targeting is clearly not a panacea.32 But as no IT regimes have yet failed, we cannot

seriously address the reasons why they might fail with quantitative tools. More generally, we do

not currently have a good understanding of how countries choose their monetary regime in

practice. This is a fruitful area for future research.

        The default estimates are presented in the top row of the table. All six coefficients are

negative, though only one is significantly different from zero (for nominal exchange rate

volatility using a single cross-section of volatility calculated over all sixteen years of data). Still,




                                                  13
the striking feature is that the coefficients are negative at all. This implies that exchange rate

volatility (both real and nominal) is actually lower for IT countries than for the control group,

some of whom maintain fixed exchange rate regimes!

        An additional twelve rows present a variety of robustness checks. The first few change

the default specification by successively dropping: 1) the time-specific fixed effects; 2) the four

controls; and 3) just the population and current account controls. I also try a specification where

the level rather than the log of openness is used. I then handle outliers in two different ways.

First, I drop all observations where the residual is large (more than 1.5 standard deviations from

the mean). Second, I use a quantile (least absolute deviations) estimator. The next three

experiments change the sample by dropping: 1) small countries, 2) poor countries (those with

real GDP per capita below $5000), and 3) the four countries that switched to IT after 2004. I

then weight observations by log real GDP. The final two checks change the regressand so as to

measure volatility in different ways. Since the nominal effective exchange rate could be non-

stationary, I calculate my standard deviations from the first-difference of natural logarithms. As

an additional robustness check, I then replace the standard deviation of the log of the nominal

effective exchange rate with the mean absolute first-difference of the log exchange rate. None of

this sensitivity analysis undermines the initial finding. Of the 64 coefficients presented, only five

are positive, none significantly so. Seventeen of the 64 coefficients are significantly negative at

the .05 level, eight of these at the .01 level.

        To summarize: exchange rate volatility for IT countries is typically (though often

insignificantly) lower for IT countries than for others. That is, the domestic focus of inflation

targeting does not seem to come at the expense of higher exchange rate volatility.




                                                  14
5. “Sudden Stops” of Capital Inflows

       There has been much discussion in the literature recently concerning “sudden stops” of

international capital. These dramatic shifts in capital flows are often associated with

considerable economic distress, and have thus been examined extensively; Calvo, Izquierdo and

Talvi (2006) provide a recent treatment. Accordingly, I now briefly examine whether IT

countries have the same propensity to be affected by sudden stops as non-IT countries.33

       Since there is no universally-accepted definition of sudden stops, I examine a number of

definitions. In particular, I use five sets of sudden stop dates – all that I could find – from Calvo,

Izquierdo, and Mejía (2004), Calvo, Izquierdo and Talvi (2006), Eichengreen, Gupta and Mody

(2006), Frankel and Cavallo (2004), and Frankel and Wei (2004). These dates differ in a number

of respects, including the countries and periods covered, the method of identifying sudden stops,

and so forth.

       Table 5a presents a tabulation of the 294 observations in my sample that overlap with

Calvo, Izquierdo, and Mejía (2004). Each (country x year) observation can be classified by

whether it is a) a sudden stop or not (in which case it is labeled “tranquil”); and b) its monetary

regime: control observation (for non-IT countries); IT observation; or a pre-IT observation (for

the observations before the country changed to IT). The other definitions of sudden stops are

presented in panels 5b-5e.

       It is apparent from all five panels that it is rare for an IT country to experience a sudden

stop. For instance, Table 5a indicates that the Calvo, Izquierdo, and Mejía (2004) definition

delivers only one sudden stop for an IT country out of the 94 possible observations. However,

eight of the 72 possible control-group observations are sudden stops. Further, in the 128

observations available before the IT countries switched to inflation targeting, they experienced




                                                 15
nine sudden stops. For all five definitions of sudden stops, IT countries were less likely to

experience sudden stops than they were either a) before they switched to inflation targeting, or b)

compared with the control-group countries with other monetary regimes.

        That said, sudden stops are rare events, so that these differences are usually statistically

insignificant; only the Calvo, Izquierdo, and Mejía (2004) register at conventional levels. The

last panel of Table 5 presents formal t-tests for equality of frequency of sudden stops, along with

the associated p-values. The first row tests the hypothesis of equal frequency of sudden stops

between control-group and IT countries; a positive t-statistic indicates that control group

observations were more likely to experience sudden stops than IT countries. The second row

compares pre- and post-IT observations for countries that adopted IT between 1990 and 2004; a

negative value indicates that the frequency of sudden stops fell after the adoption of inflation

targeting. IT countries experienced fewer sudden stops than either the period before they

adopted IT, or than comparable countries with other monetary regimes, but only two of the ten

differences are statistically significant.

        Succinctly, countries that switch to inflation targeting experience a drop in the frequency

of sudden stops. Sudden stops are also less common in inflation targeters than they are in control

group countries. These differences are usually statistically insignificant, which seems

unsurprising given the rarity of sudden stops. Still, they support the conjecture that the financial

crises that plagued the world in the 1990s may soon be a thing of the past.



6. Reserves and Current Accounts

        There is much interest these days in reserve accumulation and current account

imbalances, especially for East Asian economies. Accordingly it is interesting to examine the




                                                  16
behavior of international reserves and current account imbalances, especially to compare the IT

and control group countries.

       I use two conventional measures of international reserves. The more traditional one

compares international reserves with trade flows by measuring reserves in months of imports.

The newer convention is to measure broad money (M2) as a ratio to reserves. The current

account is measured as a percentage of GDP, positive figures indicating surpluses. The data are

annual WDI series, available from 1990 through 2004.

       To smooth out the data, I construct (country-specific) averages over time for the three

variables of interest (M2/reserves, reserves in import months, and the current account as a

percentage of GDP). I follow the strategy I used for exchange rate volatility, and compute my

averages over each four-year periods (1990-93, 1994-97, 1998-2001, and 2002-04), eight-year

periods (1990-97, 1998-2004), and the whole sample (1990-2004). For each sample, I then

tabulate the averages for IT countries, and for the control group countries. These are presented

in the top rows of Table 6; the three panels correspond to the three variables of interest.

       Average values for reserves and current accounts for IT countries are generally close to

those for the control group. Reserves look smaller for the IT countries compared with the

control group, but only really for the mid-1990s and when normalized by money. Reserves look

similar between IT and other countries for other samples, or when normalized by trade. The

differences are never statistically significant; simple t-tests cannot reject the hypothesis of equal

means at standard confidence levels. Similarly, current account imbalances also look similar

across IT and control group countries.

       The average values mask considerable dispersion across countries. For instance, even if

one restricts attention to the control group during the 1990-93 period, Jordan averaged a current




                                                  17
account deficit of 10.5% of GDP, while Singapore maintained a mean current account surplus of

9.7%. Even if the average values are similar across IT and control group countries, other parts of

the distribution may be different. To test this hypothesis rigorously, I conduct non-parametric

Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests for equality of distributions between the IT and control group

countries. The p-values for the hypothesis of equal distributions are tabulated in Table 6. With

the exception noted above (M2/Reserves in the mid-1990s), the hypothesis of equal distribution

cannot be rejected at conventional levels.

       To summarize, reserves and current account imbalances for inflation targeters look

similar to those of the control group. Again, the domestic focus of monetary policy under IT

does not have significant consequences for key features of the international monetary landscape.



6. Conclusion

       Countries have a limited number of choices for their monetary strategy. Historically a

large but declining number of countries have fixed their exchange rates. A number of countries

have experimented with the idea of setting money growth targets. Some countries pursue hybrid

or ill-defined strategies. And an increasing number of countries grant their central banks

independence to pursue a domestic inflation target.

       Inflation targeters let their exchange rates float, usually without controls on capital flows

and often without intervention. Because the goal of monetary policy is aligned with national

interests, inflation targeting seems remarkably durable, especially by way of contrast with the

alternatives. It is striking that no country has ever been forced to abandon an inflation-targeting

regime. But the domestic focus of inflation targeting does not seem to have observable

international costs. Countries that target inflation experience lower exchange rate volatility and




                                                18
fewer “sudden stops” of capital flows than their counterparts; nor do they have different current

accounts imbalances, or reserve levels.

       As a result of its manifest success, inflation targeting has continued to spread; it now

includes a number of developing countries as well as a large chunk of the OECD. Indeed the

spread of this monetary strategy has been remarkably fast in the conservative world of monetary

policy. The system of domestically-oriented monetary policy with floating exchange rates and

capital mobility was not formally planned. It does not have a central role for the United States,

gold, or the International Monetary Fund. In short, it is the diametric opposite of the postwar

system; Bretton Woods, reversed.

       Sustainability is currently the biggest policy issue in international monetary affairs.

There is much heated discussion over global imbalances and the Chinese-American exchange

rate; is there a “revived” Bretton Woods system? In the midst of this debate, we should not lose

sight of the resilience and stability of the emerging international monetary system, which can be

accurately described as “Bretton Woods, reversed.”

Figures tabulated are OLS coefficient estimates from regressions of exchange rate volatility on inflation targeting
dummy. Controls not reported but included: a) current account (as percentage of GDP, mnemonic
BN.CAB.XOKA.GD.ZS), b) natural logarithm of openness (trade as percentage of GDP, mnemonic
NE.TRD.GNFS.ZS), c) log population (mnemonic SP.POP.TOTL), and d) log real PPP-adjusted GDP per capita
(mnemonic NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.KD). All series are averages of annual series from World Development Indicators.
Intercept and comprehensive time controls also included but not reported.
Regressand is effective exchange rate volatility, calculated as standard deviation of natural monthly logarithms.
Nominal rate is IFS line “neu” or “nec”; real rate is IFS line “rec.”
Standard errors recorded in parentheses; * (**) denotes significance at the .05 (.01) level.

  http://www.bis.org/publ/bppdf/bispap24s.pdf. Despite this, Calvo and Reinhart (2000) characterize New Zealand
as having a “fear of floating.” Calvo and Reinhart focus on the difference between de facto and de jure behavior of
exchange rates using non-structural techniques, and do not consider separately the (small number of) IT countries
that are in their sample.
7
  A number of IT countries have reduced the importance of the exchange rate (as either an indicator or target of
monetary policy) over time, including Chile, Israel, New Zealand. Alternatively, consider the countries pursuing
inflation targeting according to the IMF’s de facto monetary policy classifications. At the end of 2005 the inflation,
there were: 2 countries with pegged exchange rates; 6 managed floaters; and 16 independent floaters. See
http://www.imf.org/external/np/mfd/er/2005/1205.htm.

  Obstfeld and Rogoff (1995, p87) wrote “The number of long-lived fixed exchange rates still remaining in the
world today is remarkably small … The striking conclusion … is that, aside from some small tourism economies, oil
sheikdoms and highly dependent principalities, literally only a handful of countries in the world today have
continuously maintained tightly fixed exchange rates against any currency for five years or more.”
9
  Eichengreen (1996, p114) writes “… it was only when the foreign-exchange markets opened for business in
January 1959, with the major currencies fully convertible for current-account transactions, that the Bretton Woods
System can be said to have come into full operation.”
10
   The European Monetary System lasted from 1979 through the start of EMU in 1999, but only with a large number
of realignments and crises, including the unceremonious withdrawal of the British pound and the Italian lira,
surviving in the end only because the sterling and currency departures (and entries), and a remarkably wide
fluctuation band of +/- 15%.
11
   Indeed, it is worth pointing out that eleven countries hit by recent currency crises have switched to inflation
targeting (Brazil, Czech Republic, Finland, Indonesia, Korea, Mexico, Philippines, Sweden, Thailand, Turkey, and
the UK). Of the countries hit by major currency crises since 1990, only Argentina, Malaysia and Russia have not
adopted inflation targeting.
12
   Both Finland and Spain used IT during their drives to enter EMU, and had 1998 inflation targets of 2% which
were slightly undershot.
13
   I use PWT6.1 data, for which 2000 is the last available year. The Philippines was the poorest IT country in 2000
with income per capita of $3400; Peru was next at $4600.
14
   Since EMU began half-way through the sample period, I do not include it or any EMU members in the control
group. I also drop developing countries in currency unions, six of which would otherwise qualify for membership in
the control group (Ecuador, El Salvador, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Panama, and Swaziland). None of the results
below are substantially affected if the six LDCs are included in the control group.
15
   Iceland had just over 280,000 people in 2000, while New Zealand had over 3.8 million; the third-smallest country
was Norway with almost 4.5 million.
16
   Thus far, four countries in the control group (Indonesia, Romania, Slovakia, and Turkey) have adopted IT in
2005-06.

   The IMF provides the framework as of December 31, 2004 in its “Classification of Exchange Rate Arrangements
and Monetary Policy Frameworks”; see http://www.imf.org/external/np/mfd/er/2004/eng/1204.htm

18
   In passing, exchange rate realignments (as e.g., occurred frequently during the EMS) are consistent with an
unchanged exchange rate regime.
19
   The IMF reported de jure measures of exchange rate regimes until they switched in 1999 towards a more de facto
based measure. Using this data, I find that there have been 45 fixes of exchange rate from 1990 onwards. Of these,
23 have now ended. Of the 22 that have not ended yet, there are three dollarizations (Ecuador, El Salvador, Timor
Leste), and four European Currency Boards (Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania). There are also twelve young
(since 2000) fixes (Belarus, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Mauritania, Pakistan, Solomon Islands, Trinidad & Tobago,
Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Venezuela, Vietnam); these usually are associated with capital controls. This leaves three
other countries (China, Guinea-Bissau, Morocco), all of whom also have strong controls.
20
   For instance there are missing gaps in LYS for important countries like China and the UK. Again: Reinhart and
Rogoff cover the switches of Estonia and Latvia into current boards, whereas the LYS data begin after these dates.
21
   RR classify America as “freely floating” since February 1978 despite the change in operating procedures of
October 1979. They also classify Canada as maintaining a “De facto crawling band that is narrower than or equal to
+/-2%” since June 1970, despite Canada’s switch to IT.
22
   In their IMF Working Paper 02/155 “The Evolution of Exchange Rate Regimes Since 1990: Evidence from De
Facto Policies” Andrea Bubula and Inci Ötker-Robe construct a monthly data set for the de facto exchange rate
regimes of all IMF members between 1990 and 2001. Their classification delivers regime switches that are typically
between LYS5 and RR; the mean number of year-end regime switches for BÖ-R/LYS5/RR are 2.2/4.8/1.5 while
medians are 2/5/1. Eight countries had no regime switches according to BÖ-R, while there were ten and seven with
LYS5 and RR respectively.
23
   The other countries currently in the same IMF classification are the Dominican Republic, Liberia, and Papua New
Guinea.
24
   The maximal survivorship rate at eight years in Table 2 is .39 (for the LYS 3-way regime, allowing each country
to have only the regime with which it started the sample. If we treat the nine IT countries that began at least eight
years ago independently, this would be expected to happen with probability (.39)9≈.0002. Other survivorship
assumptions or exchange rate classifications lower this number still further.
25
   Since IT regimes share a number of common features that differ from other monetary policies, I do not speculate
on the reason(s) for this durability. This is a fruitful area for future research.
26
   Indeed, countries with fixed exchange rates (such as China) are more likely now to be viewed as suspiciously
manipulating their rates than floaters, another contrast with the Bretton Woods period.
27
   Eichengreen (1996, p135) states “That this [Bretton Woods] system functioned at all is testimony to the
international cooperation that operated in its support.”
28
   Since my focus in this paper is on the international aspects of inflation targeting, I do not consider domestic issues
like growth, inflation, and banking crises.
29
   Some observations are missing, since countries started IT well after the start of the sample. Thus e.g., Brazil does
not contribute observations to either the group of countries before it starts IT in 1999.
30
   This makes country-specific fixed effects estimation infeasible, since no country experiences a regime change.
Thus this test relies on cross-sectional variation.
31
   The data on the control variables are only available through the end of 2004, so that the regressand and regressor
are sometimes not aligned perfectly. This is probably of negligible importance, since the regressor tend to add little
explanatory power and are highly autoregressive in any case.
32
   For instance, developing countries in particular may find it difficult to adopt IT because of problems with: fiscal
dominance, imperfect central bank independence, and weak financial systems.
33
   Parenthetically, I note in passing that no inflation targeter has ever, to the best of my knowledge, experienced a
banking crisis. Ho and von Hagen (2004) review dates of banking crises from eight studies and create their own;
none of the countries with long IT regimes (Australia, Canada, Chile, Israel, New Zealand, Sweden, and the UK)
experienced a banking crisis during inflation targeting. Kroszner et al (2006) delivers the same message.
