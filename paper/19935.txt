                                           ABSTRACT

A considerable fraction of college students and bachelor's degree recipients enroll in multiple
postsecondary institutions. Despite this fact, there is scant research that examines the nature of the
paths – both the number and types of institutions – that students take to obtain a bachelor's degree
or through the higher education system more generally. We also know little about enrollment in
multiple institutions of varying quality relates to postgraduate life outcomes. We use a unique panel
data set from Texas that allows us to both examine in detail the paths that students take towards a
bachelor's degree and estimate how multiple institution enrollment is related to degree completion
and subsequent earnings. We show that the paths to a bachelor's degree are diverse and that earnings
and BA receipt vary systematically with these paths. Our results call attention to the importance of
developing a more complete understanding of why students transfer and what causal role transferring
has on the returns to postsecondary educational investment.

         The paths students take through the postsecondary sector are heterogeneous and have

become more so over time. For example, in the high school class of 1972, 59.5% of students

enrolled in one institution, and this proportion fell to 53.8% (a 9.6% decline) among the high

school class of 1992. The majority of multi-institutional contact is due to student transferring. 1

Despite the increasing prevalence of transferring behavior, the extent and character of transferring,

as well as the underlying reasons students change institutions, are poorly understood. A critical

constraint in developing a better understand of student transferring behavior is the lack of datasets

with sufficient detail and size to allow one to describe the myriad ways in which students transfer,

what types of students are making different types of transfer decisions, and how transferring is

related to long-run student outcomes such as BA completion and earnings. Ultimately of interest is

understanding the reasons students make different transfer decisions and identifying the causal

effect of transferring on student outcomes. Without a detailed description of these patterns, though,

it is difficult to even generate plausible hypotheses about transfer behavior that can be tested.

         Given the need to more fully examine how students transfer and the correlates of this

decision with student characteristics and longer-run outcomes, this paper provides a

comprehensive descriptive analysis of transferring using a large administrative dataset with

detailed student information and earnings. Our analysis is split into two parts. First, using

administrative data from the University of Texas at Dallas's Education Research Center, we

provide a detailed description of the educational paths that students take through the postsecondary

educational system in Texas. Our data contain rich information about all in-state postsecondary

institutions attended by all students in Texas, which allows us to trace out the numerous ways in

which students move through the state's higher education system. Somewhat akin to Adelman


1
  McCormick (2003) reports that about 2/3 of multi-institutional contact is due to student transferring, while the
remainder is driven by summer and dual enrollment.
(2004) and Jargowsky, McFarlin, Jr. and Holovchenko (2005), we show that transferring is

prevalent and that “traditional” transfer pathways – e.g., attending a two year school and then a

four-year college or transferring once between four-year colleges – are inadequate to capture the

multitude of ways that students progress through the system. Unlike these previous analyses,

however, we have a sufficiently large sample size to examine a complex and comprehensive set of

transferring patterns among postsecondary students. This descriptive analysis highlights the

importance of many different forms of multi-institutional contact in higher education and is

strongly suggestive that such issues deserve more consideration among education researchers.

       The second goal of this paper is to offer descriptive evidence about the relationship

between a student's pathway through college and subsequent outcomes. Our analysis focuses on

the likelihood of graduating with a bachelor's (BA) degree and on subsequent earnings. There is

evidence that school quality impacts the ability of students to obtain a BA (Bound, Lovenheim and

Turner, 2010). There also is a sizable literature that seeks to estimate the labor market returns to

college quality (e.g, Brewer, Eide and Ehrenberg, 1999; Dale and Krueger, 2002; Black and Smith,

2006; Hoekstra, 2009; Long, 2010; Andews, Li and Lovenheim, 2012). On the main, this literature

finds large returns, as measured by subsequent wages or earnings, to attending a college of higher

quality. Identification of the effect of higher education quality on BA receipt and future labor

market success typically characterizes quality as a function of the first school attended by a

student. However, a focus on the first institution attended ignores the fact that the first institution

may not be sufficient to encapsulate a student's educational experience because of transferring. We

show that a substantial portion of students have contact with multiple institutions, so it is not clear

what the simple metric of first college affiliation used in the previous work actually represents.




                                                   2
         There are few published papers that examine how the returns to college vary with transfer

status. Hilmer (2000) finds that direct attendees (i.e., students who begin and graduate from the

same institution), students who transfer to four-year schools from community colleges, and

students who transfer from lower-quality universities to universities of high-quality (defined as a

university with an average age SAT score of at least 1200 points) experience large and statistically

significant wage gains from college. Students who transfer from high-quality universities to

institutions of lower quality, however, experience significant wage penalties relative to these other

groups. That students who “transfer down” perform worse in the labor market is notable and

suggests that transferring behavior does impact the returns to investing in a college degree. But,

because transfer students tend to have lower academic achievement and tend to be from lower

socioeconomic backgrounds, it is difficult to interpret such evidence as causal.

         Light and Strayer (2004) analyze data from NLSY79 and show that transferring is

prevalent among BA and non-BA recipients as well as among eventual associates degree

recipients. They also find evidence that transferring increases earnings relative to observationally-

equivalent non-transfer students. The mechanisms hypothesized are that transferring increases

match quality and also facilitates graduating. This analysis focuses on returns to different levels of

schooling by transfer status, but due to sample size limitations, they cannot examine the role of

institutional quality beyond the general two-year, four-year distinction. It also is not possible in the

NLSY79 to trace out transfer paths with a high degree of specificity. 2

         Our analysis makes several contributions to the literature. First, with our large data set of

over 1.1 million college students in Texas, we are able to examine a richer set of educational paths

2
 There is a literature as well on the effects of transferring from two-year to four-year schools. Long and Kurlaender
(2009) and Reynolds (2012) show that students who begin at a two-year college are less likely to complete a BA.
Kalogrides and Grodsky (2011) highlight the role of community colleges as “safety nets,” however, which help
mitigate against students dropping out of higher education. Agan (2013) shows lifecycle earnings differ substantially
based on the paths students take through college as measured broadly across the two- and four-year sectors.

                                                         3
than in previous work (e.g., Hilmer, (2000) observes only 794 male graduates and Adelman (2006)

uses the approximately 6,000 students with a postsecondary transcript file in the NELS:88). Our

larger sample size combined with our use of state administrative data allow us to trace out in a

detailed manner the heterogeneous ways in which students move through the postsecondary

system. 3 Our data include state unemployment insurance earnings records as well, which permits

us to link these pathways to differences in future earnings. Additionally, we are able to examine

these relationships for the overall sample and differently by race and ethnicity. Such an analysis is

novel in this literature.

        Although we use a large and rich dataset, we only observe students in Texas. This is a more

geographically-limited sample than has been used in prior work. But, the higher education system

in Texas is very similar to those in most other states, with a large amount of heterogeneity in

quality ranging from elite flagship universities to less-selective four-year schools and community

colleges. This vertically-differentiated system is found in almost every state, and the high rates of

public school enrollment in Texas are common throughout the US as well. The similar structure of

the higher education market in Texas to the rest of the country suggests our estimates in Texas are

likely to be reflective of patterns more generally in the United States.

        Our findings uncover a large amount of heterogeneity in the paths students take through

college that involve more than two-year to four-year transfers and single institution switches. In

line with previous work, we find that, among those who eventually obtain a four-year degree,

students who “transfer up” to more selective institutions, such as transferring from a non-flagship

four-year school to a state flagship, have lower measured academic achievement in high school

and are more likely to be black or Hispanic. Transfer students also tend to have slightly lower

3
 A drawback of using these data is that we are unable to observe private school attendance. However, higher
education in Texas is dominated by the public institutions, so we do not miss many students due to the absence of
private schools from our data.

                                                         4
college GPAs, take about 0.4 more years to graduate, and are less likely to major in technical

subjects, such as engineering.

       With respect to completion, we find that transfer students earn BAs at about the same rate

as direct attendees. Transfers into UT-Austin from a community college have a BA attainment rate

3% lower than UT-Austin direct attendees, but these rates are identical for Texas A&M students.

Among non-flagship students, transfers in from all other sectors are more likely to graduate than

direct attendees. These estimates are inconsistent with the hypothesis that transferring has a

deleterious effect on BA attainment. However, a caveat to these results is that we find large

differences in completion likelihoods among students who transfer in their second year (compared

to all second year students) versus those who transfer in their third year (compared to all third year

students), with the latter group being far less likely to graduate. This result is suggestive that the

timing of transferring is meaningfully related to college completion.

       Despite its small and typically positive correlation with four-year graduation, we show

evidence that transfers earn substantially less than direct attendees. Among UT-Austin graduates,

transfer students from non-flagship four-year and community colleges who graduate earn between

11% and 14% less than direct attendee graduates, while among Texas A&M graduates this

difference is about 6%. Those who transfer to a non-flagship four-year school from universities

outside the flagship sector also earn between 2-4 percent less than direct attendees. Controlling for

college major and GPA, however, significantly reduces these differences, indicating that

differences in majors and college performance between transfer students and direct attendees can

explain some of the earnings gaps we identify. Finally, we document a significant amount of

heterogeneity in these patterns by race, ethnicity and gender.

         The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 1 describes the data. Section 2

presents detailed tabulations of transfer behavior, and Section 3 describes the relationship between

the path to a BA, college completion and the earnings premium associated with graduating from

different types of schools. The 4th Section concludes.

         Section 1. Data

         The data used in this study are derived from three sources: Pre-K to 12th grade

administrative data from the Texas Education Agency (TEA), college administrative data from the

Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board (THECB), and quarterly earnings data from the

Texas Workforce Commission (TWC). The data are housed at the Texas Schools Project, a

University of Texas at Dallas Education Research Center (ERC). Individual social security

numbers allow us to link the data from these three sources. Thus, we can follow each Texas

student from Pre-K all the way through college until entering into the job market as long as this

student stays in Texas. 4

         Section 1.1. Sample to Study Transfer Behavior

         Using the ERC data, we first generate a sample to investigate the transfer behavior of the

college students enrolled in Texas public colleges or universities. Due to data availability, we

focus on students who graduate from Texas public high schools between 1992 and 2002 and who

start their college education in Texas public colleges or universities within two years after high

school graduation. 5 We have a total of 1,141,186 students in our sample.



4
  This data set is the same one used in Andrews, Li and Lovenheim (2012). That paper shows detailed evidence that
graduates from each college sector we consider are not missing from the data differentially with respect to their pre-
collegiate observable characteristics. Individuals can be missing from our postsecondary data because they attend a
private university or because they attend school out of state. They can be missing from our earnings sample because
they do not work or because they leave the state after college. Table 2 in Andrews, Li and Lovenheim (2012) shows
that there are no systematic differences in the characteristics of those excluded from our data across college sectors.
5
  The time limit of college enrollment we impose allows us to focus on first-time, “traditional” college students.
Note that because we do not observe out of state attendance, if students begin college in another state and transfer to

                                                           6
         To observe the possible different transfer behaviors for students starting from different

institutions, we group our sample into four subsamples: UT-Austin (UT), Texas A&M-College

Station (TAMU), other 4-year colleges or universities, and community colleges. 6 There are

57,881, 58,618, 341,541, and 683,149 students that started their college education at UT, TAMU,

other 4-year colleges or universities, and community colleges, respectively (See Table 1). These

sectors also represent the different quality levels of public institutions in Texas. 7

         To observe the transfer behavior of the students in our sample, we use enrollment histories

collected by the THECB for each semester. We stack all enrollment records of a student in order to

sequence each student's enrollment history. Because college students take various lengths to finish

their college education, we limit our observation of transferring behavior in an eight-year window

by dropping any enrollments beyond eight years after high school graduation. 8 For the bachelor

degree recipients, we drop all the enrollment records after they received their first bachelor's

degree or from before high school graduation. Meanwhile, students often choose to take courses at

community colleges or universities close to their homes in summer semesters, with the intention of

returning to their full-time institution in the fall or spring. These types of enrollment changes are

not traditionally viewed as transfer behaviors, and so we drop all the enrollment records in summer

semesters and do not count such enrollment as part of our multiple institutional contact measure.




a Texas public university within two years of high school graduation, we will not observe this behavior as a transfer.
This will cause us to understate transferring prevalence to some degree.
6
  Hereafter, we will use “UT” to stand for UT-Austin and “TAMU” to stand for Texas A&M-College Station. These
two flagship universities are distinguished from other UT campuses and other Texas A&M campuses, which are part
of the other four-year, or “non-flagship” sector.
7
  College quality is very difficult to measure with a single variable or set of variables (Black and Smith, 2006). Our
use of broad sectors to differentiate schools of different quality follows much of the previous literature (e.g., Brewer,
Eide and Ehrenberg, 1999; Hoekstra, 2009; Bound, Lovenheim and Turner, 2010; Lovenheim and Reynolds, 2011,
2013).
8
  Bound, Lovenheim and Turner (2010) show that most “traditional” students who graduate do so within eight years
of high school graduation.

                                                           7
       We follow THECB's definition of a transfer. When a student's current enrolled institution is

different from the institution she enrolled in during the previous semester in which we observe her,

excluding summer semesters, we view that as a transfer. Sometimes, students enroll in multiple

institutions simultaneously. In such cases, we do not count this student as having transferred.

Combined with our exclusion of summer enrollment, this restriction on our definition of

transferring leads to a conservative measure of the number of transfers.

       Our definition of a transfer is similar to what has been done previously. Like Goldrick-Rab

(2006), we exclude summer enrollment; however, the focus of that paper is on contact with

multiple institutions, and a count of the number of institutions on the transcript is used to measure

multi-institution contact. This measure thus conflates dual enrollment with transferring. Goldrick-

Rab and Pfeffer (2009) first define one’s “primary institution” as the institution where a student

took the most credits for a given year. A transfer is defined as switching one’s primary institution

in the subsequent year. Overall, this definition is similar to our own; however, this definition could

over-count transfers to the extent that the identity of the primary institution may switch without an

actual transfer if there is dual enrollment and the proportion of credits is shifted across schools.

Light and Strayer (2004) define transferring in the NLSY79 as a student attending multiple

colleges within 12 months of each other. Our definition of transfer does not impose the time limit.

Therefore, our measure classifies changes in institution that occur more than a year apart as a

transfer while the definition used in Light and Strayer (2004) would not. Otherwise, the definitions

match closely with one another.

       Section 1.2. Sample to Study Differences in BA Receipt and Earnings

       In order to examine how transferring relates to completion likelihoods and post-collegiate

earnings, we use data on graduation timing, status, and institutions attended from the THECB and



                                                  8
first define a “direct attendee” as any student who begins and finishes at a given institution and

who does not transfer. In categorizing multiple institution enrollment while examining outcomes,

we only consider one's first postsecondary institution and one's graduating institution, which

means we ignore the transfer paths in between starting and graduating from colleges. We simplify

college paths in this manner in order to give us a tractable way to examine the heterogeneity in

completion and earnings based on students’ college paths. Examining these outcomes separately

for each of the different paths we consider in the first part of the analysis would generate a large

volume of estimates, many of which would be based on small sample sizes. Our simplification

dramatically reduces the number of potential estimates while still allowing us to examine

differences in earnings and BA receipt among students taking different core pathways to obtain a

degree at a given institution type.

        We focus on students who graduate from Texas public high schools during the years 1996

– 2002, 9 and for our earnings analysis we restrict our sample to those who have earned bachelor

degrees from Texas' public colleges and universities. The sample includes all students in public

universities in Texas over this time period who meet the following restrictions: 1) No missing data

for any of the covariates, 2) The student must start college education within two years after high

school graduation and must graduate no later than eight years after high school, 3) The graduate's

earnings for a given year are included only if he or she worked for four consecutive quarters in the

year, with the exception of 2009 where the requirement for inclusion is three consecutive quarters

as we only have three quarters of available earnings data for 2009, and 4) The student must not be



9
 Our earnings and completion analyses exclude students who graduated between 1992 and 1995 because the state
high school exams switched between the 1995 and 1996 cohorts. Given the importance of controlling for measured
high school academic ability, we focus on students who take the same exam. We include the 1992-1995 cohorts in
our tabulations of transfer paths due to the need to maximize sample size to identify the large number of different
paths students take. Results are similar using only the 1996-2002 cohorts and are available upon request.

                                                         9
currently enrolled in graduate school when the earnings are measured. 10 These restrictions are

meant to isolate the earnings of full-time workers, and they are similar to the sample restrictions

imposed by Hoekstra (2009) and Andrews, Li and Lovenheim (2012).

         The sample includes 155,345 graduates. Among the 20,886 UT-Austin graduates, there are

17,583 direct attendees, 1,286 transfers from Texas's other four-year public colleges and

universities, and 2,017 transfers from Texas' community colleges. At Texas A&M, there are

27,036 graduates, with 20,153 direct attendees, 1,733 transfers from Texas' other four-year public

colleges and universities, and 5,150 transfers from Texas' community colleges. Among the non-

flagship public universities in Texas, we observe 107,423 graduates, 61,274 of whom are direct

attendees, 9,524 are transfers from other non-flagship four-year public colleges and universities in

Texas, 2,023 are transfers from UT or TAMU, and 34,602 are transfers from Texas' community

colleges. There are 941 students who do not fall into any of the above groups. Because there are

very few UT graduates who transferred from TAMU as well as TAMU graduates who transferred

from UT, we do not include them in our earnings analysis.

         We obtain records of each individual's quarterly earnings from the TWC and examine

earnings data for the years 2007 – 2009. In order to generate one earnings estimate per respondent,

we stack an individual's log quarterly earnings (subject to the inclusion criteria) and regress them

on year, quarter-of-year, and high school cohort indicators. We use the within-graduate average

residual from this regression as the earnings measure in our empirical models. This method isolates

the constant component of earnings for each individual over the period for which we observe his

earnings and allows us to control for time- and cohort-specific shocks as well as for seasonality.

10
  Students who earn a graduate degree are included. The fourth restriction ignores earnings while students are
enrolled in graduate school because they are likely not reflective of the student's permanent earnings. Furthermore,
note that there are very few private universities in Texas with graduate schools, and those programs tend to be quite
small. Thus, there will be few earnings observations in our data that we include because we cannot observe private
graduate school enrollment in Texas.

                                                         10
         A major strength of our data from TEA is that they include a rich set of individual

academic, demographic and high school information that allows us to control in a detailed manner

for selection of students into universities of different quality. Individual information consists of

fourth order polynomials in math, reading and writing TAAS scores, 11 within-high school relative

rank on each exam, student race/ethnicity, Title I status, English proficiency, free and reduced

price lunch status, enrollment in gifted/talented program, special education, and technology

courses, whether the student has a college plan, and whether he was at risk of dropping out. High

school campus variables include, for each year of graduation, the ethnic composition of the high

school, the percentage of students in each economic status group, the percentage of gifted students

and students at risk, the percentage of title I eligible students, and total school enrollment. These

individual covariates represent a more powerful set of controls for student academic backgrounds

that are correlated with college paths and with collegiate and post-collegiate outcomes than are

available in the data sets used in previous analyses on transfer behavior. However, we underscore

that even conditional on these student background measures transferring is likely to be endogenous

with respect to BA and earnings outcomes. The results we present below thus are descriptive,

rather than causal, in nature. But, any endogeneity between our outcomes of interest and

transferring must be residual to the large volume of student characteristics and college preparation

measures we observe, which highlights the value of our estimates in shaping hypotheses about

transferring and its effects on student outcomes that could be examined in future work.

        Section 2. Description of Transfer Behavior

        Table 1 presents the distribution of transfers for both college attendees and for those who

receive a BA degree within eight years of high school graduation. In the first two columns, we

11
  The Texas Assessment of Academic Skills (TAAS) are state standardized exams that were given to all students in
Texas and were used, in part, to determine graduation eligibility. Thus, students have an incentive to perform well
on these exams, and they provide important measures of student academic capabilities as of 11th grade.

                                                        11
show this distribution for all Texas public postsecondary students. Among all attendees, 31.4% of

students transfer at least once. For BA recipients, almost half of the students transfer at least once,

many from a community college. Thus, transferring is relatively common, particularly among

eventual BA recipients, and many students transfer more than once. Among BA recipients, 16%

transfer more than once, with 10% among attendees doing so. Thus, 1/6 of all college completers

who begin college soon after high school transfer at least twice. In fact, 6.1% transfer three or

more times. Overall, a large proportion of students have paths through the higher education system

that are characterized by enrollment in multiple institutions. This pattern is evident both among the

attendee sample as well as among the graduating sample.

           In the remaining columns of Table 1, we examine transferring behavior by the first

institution attended. At the flagship state universities, transferring is much less prevalent: between

81% and 84% of attendees do not transfer and between 87% and 89% of BA recipients do not

transfer. However, between 10% and 12% of BA recipients at each school transfer once or twice,

which highlights that even at elite institutions transferring is not uncommon. Among those who

first attend a non-flagship four-year school, it is much more commonplace to switch institutions.

Almost 40% of attendees at such schools transfer, and 17% transfer more than once. Among

eventual BA recipients, over 19% transfer more than once and over 4% transfer more than twice.

           For those who enter the postsecondary system at community colleges, transferring among

the attendee sample is prevalent, and the transfer distribution is similar to the non-flagship transfer

distribution. 12 Among eventual BA recipients, all community college students must transfer, but

over 17% do so more than once and 11.5% do so more than twice. These paths through the higher

education system point to considerable heterogeneity that makes it difficult to classify simply the

types of schools students attend.
12
     We do not count transferring across community colleges as a transfer.

                                                           12
       Table 1 suggests that it is not easy to characterize how students move through the post-

secondary system as well as the quality of the institution to which they are exposed during college.

However, Table 1 masks a considerable portion of students' heterogeneous experiences because it

is not clear what types of schools students are transferring into and out of. We now show the full

distribution of transfers by institution type for students who transfer once (Table 2) and twice

(Table 3). We do not examine these distributions for those who go to more than 3 schools because

of the complexity of the possible paths students can take does not allow for a parsimonious

description. Furthermore, with 4% of the attendee sample and 6% of the BA sample transferring

more than twice, our analysis captures the majority of students in Texas.

       Table 2 shows the distribution of school types among those who transfer once. In the table,

each column sums to one and shows, conditional on first institution attended, the distribution of

attendance at other institution types. For example, among those who first attend UT and transfer,

51.3% transfer to a non-flagship four-year school and 44.7% transfer to a community college. A

similar pattern holds for TAMU students, although community college transferring is slightly

larger. While there is some movement between flagship universities, the predominant pattern is

movement downward in quality, with a relatively large amount of transferring into the two-year

sector. Among eventual BA recipients, the transferring to non-flagship schools is more dramatic,

although there are much fewer of such students. As Table 1 shows, there are not a lot of BA

recipients who transfer once and who start at UT-Austin or Texas A&M. The proportion of

attendees at these schools who transfer once is larger, although it still is below 10%. Thus, at the

flagship universities, there is a sizable group of students who transfer to a non-flagship school or a

community college, and a majority of these students do not obtain a BA.




                                                 13
         Among students who begin college at non-flagship schools, the 20.7% of attendees who

transfer once do so predominantly to community colleges as well as to other non-flagship four-

year universities in Texas. Among the 11% of eventual graduates who transfer once, however, over

26% transfer to a flagship university. Thus, for over a quarter of these students, transferring is

associated with an increase in college quality, while the rest of these students transfer laterally. 13

As in Table 1, this pattern suggests that some transferring may be positively correlated with the

likelihood of graduating and with subsequent earnings, while other transfers may be negatively

correlated with such outcomes. We examine these relationships more formally below.

         Most community college students who transfer switch to a non-flagship university.

However, 11% of attendees and 14% of BA recipients transfer to a flagship university. For many

students, the community college is a viable gateway to a BA degree, but the quality of schools to

which students transfer varies considerably.

          In Table 3, we examine the distribution of transfers among students who transfer twice.

The percents in each block refer to the first institution attended, and they sum to 100. 14 The first

line of schools shows the first institution attended, the second line of schools shows the second

institution attended, and the schools listed in the second column show the third institution attended.

For example, 8.17% of UT attendees transfer to a non-flagship four-year school and then back to

UT. Focusing on UT, the most common paths are to transfer to a community college and then

either back to UT or to a non-flagship four-year school. A similar pattern holds for TAMU

students, with many students transferring to a community college and then back to Texas A&M. In

general, it is quite common among those who transfer twice and who start at a flagship university


13
   Of course, students may view their transfer as a change in quality, especially if they are switching institutions for
match-specific reasons.
14
   The ** marks in the table indicate means drawn from fewer than 5 observations. Our data use agreement with the
Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board specifies that we cannot show any means with cell sizes less than 5.

                                                           14
to transfer back to the original flagship school. 15 This pattern is even more prevalent among BA

recipients (Panel B). Thus, to the extent that transferring has an effect on postsecondary outcomes

as well as on future earnings, it is important to pay attention to the fact that even those who enter

or graduate from a flagship university may have significant contact with another institution. 16

         The pattern of transferring back to one's original institution is prevalent among those who

first attend a non-flagship university as well. Over 57% of these students in Panel A and 55% in

Panel B transfer away from their original university only to return later in their postsecondary

career. Much of the remainder of the students transfer to a community college and then to a

different non-flagship school or to two different non-flagship, four-year universities. A very small

proportion of students transfers to a flagship university and then transfers away.

         Among community college students, the most common path is to transfer to two non-

flagship universities for eventual graduates. For all attendees, students typically either transfer to a

non-flagship and then transfer back to a community college or transfer to another non-flagship

university. Interestingly, among both attendees and BA recipients, some students transfer to a

flagship university and then transfer to a non-flagship university. For BA recipients, 11.7% of the

community college sample and 4.9% of the non-flagship sample follow this path. Such transfers

could be due to a lack of academic training for the higher rigor at flagship universities; this finding

is suggestive that flagship universities do not provide a good match for many students who transfer

in from community colleges.


15
   Some of these transfers could be caused by students taking “time off” from college and taking classes at other
institutions while not formally enrolled at their original school. As long as these courses were taken during the
normal academic year, we count this behavior as transferring. We believe that it is appropriate to include these
students as transfers because they are changing the school in which they are taking courses towards a degree. As
discussed in Section 1.1, prior work on student transfers also would count such institutional switches as transfers
(Goldrick-Rab, 2006; Goldrick-Rab and Pfeffer, 2009; Light and Strayer, 2004).
16
   As discussed above, we have taken care not to count dual enrollment or summer enrollment as transferring. Thus,
student transferring back to a flagship does not simply reflect taking courses over the summer at a local college or
enrolling in a course at a community college while enrolled in one of the flagship universities.

                                                         15
        Tables 1-3 show multi-institution enrollment is highly prevalent in Texas. Given this

heterogeneity in college paths, it is of interest to know how these paths relate to subsequent student

outcomes. Next, we examine how transferring correlates with four-year college completion and

with post-collegiate earnings in order to shed some light on these relationships.

Section 3. The Relationship Between College Path, College Graduation and Future Earnings

        Section 3.1. Conceptual Model and Empirical Methods

        The goal of the analysis in this section is to estimate the differences in postsecondary

completion rates and in subsequent earnings for students who take different paths through college.

Most previous studies that examine the effect of institutional quality on educational attainment and

earnings measure the quality either of the first college or university one attended or of the college

or university from which one graduated. 17 Both of these measures impose the assumption that

students accomplish their college education at one institution, which the estimates in the previous

section show is problematic. Thus, it is necessary to explore how transfer behavior correlates with

the education earnings premiums as well as with the likelihood of obtaining a four-year degree.

        In order to highlight the difficulty in identifying the causal relationship between

transferring and student outcomes, it is instructive to consider a conceptual model of a student’s

decision to transfer. A straightforward model of the transfer decision would lead to a rule that a

student will transfer if her expected net present value of the transfer is higher than the expected

cost. This framework suggests that transferring behavior will be a function of students’ perceived

returns to attending different school types, which themselves depend on observed and unobserved

attributes of students, as well as (typically unobserved) preferences for different majors and social

environments correlated with student attributes that lead to different earnings later in life. For


17
  For example, see Black and Smith (2004, 2006), Dale and Krueger (2002), Hoekstra (2009), Bound, Lovenheim
and Turner (2010), Kane and Rouse (1999), Andrews, Li and Lovenheim (2012), and Kinsler and Pavan (2011).

                                                     16
example, the best students at lower-quality schools may “transfer up” because they have the

academic skills or the motivation to be able to take advantage of a higher quality academic

environment. However, if the most academically capable or most motivated students transfer up,

then these students may be more academically capable or motivated than direct attendees at the

school from which they came but less academically able or motivated than the students at schools

into which they transfer. It also could be the case that incoming students who transfer up are more

highly motived than direct attendees at the higher quality school, since transferring itself requires a

lot of work on the student’s part. Selection based on academic ability or motivation makes it very

difficult to identify causal impacts of transferring on academic and labor market outcomes,

because accurate counterfactuals for the transferring students cannot be estimated.

       Furthermore, transferring could be driven by shocks to the match-specific quality between

students and institutions. Students gain information about their own academic interests and about

the school in which they are enrolled over time. If students gain information that suggests their

own school is a poor match for them, either academically or socially, then they may transfer.

Students also can experience changes in their personal lives, such as sickness and family troubles,

that may change their locational preferences. Such shocks are likely related to the ability of

students to finish college and to their subsequent earnings.

       Given the fact that the transfer decision is based on several variables that we cannot

observe, and since we lack an instrument that would affect the decision to change schools but not

BA receipt or earnings, we focus on providing a descriptive analysis of how earnings and BA

attainment correlate with various paths through school. Such correlations have received little

attention in previous work, which lacks the large samples and detailed earnings information




                                                 17
contained in our data, so our descriptive analysis reveals much new and important information

about how transferring behavior relates to important academic and labor market outcomes.

        As Tables 1-3 demonstrate, transfer behavior is not easy to characterize succinctly —

students take many different paths through the postsecondary sectors that vary significantly from

person to person. In order to make our analysis tractable, we only examine where one starts and

where one ends his college education. Therefore, in our earnings equations, we allow the returns to

college quality to differ by the quality of the higher education institution in which a student first

enrolls and the quality of institution from which the same student graduates. When examining

completion, we allow the likelihood of BA attainment to vary by where students first entered the

postsecondary system and where they left, where leaving includes BA receipt or dropping out.

Though a simplification, Tables 1-3 show that this characterization of transferring captures a large

amount of the variation in transferring behavior across students. One notable shortcoming of this

method is that we are not able to examine separately the returns of students who begin and end at

the same place but who transfer in between. We ignore the relationship between this set of paths

and subsequent earnings because of the small proportion of our sample who take such paths, even

though they represent a sizable fraction of those who transfer three times.

        We first examine the relationship between transferring and the likelihood of obtaining a

four-year degree. To assess whether the likelihood of degree attainment varies by transfer path, we

estimate linear regressions of the following form:

Cis = α + φTi + βX is + γ s + ε is ,                                                                 (1)

where C is is an indicator variable equal to 1 if student i from high school s graduates by the age of

25, T i is an indicator variable equal to 1 if the student transfers, and X is is a vector of individual

and high school-by-graduation year socioeconomic and academic background characteristics


                                                   18
discussed in Section 1. The model also includes high school fixed effects ( γ s ). We estimate

equation (1) separately using pairings of final and original institution attended. For example, to test

whether UT-Austin students who transferred from a non-flagship university were less likely to

finish than direct attendees, we estimate equation (1) using the sample of students who transfer in

this manner and the direct UT-Austin attendees. The coefficient φ then yields the correlation of

interest. We estimate such regressions for all pairings of direct attendees and transfers who leave

higher education at that same institution but who begin in another institution type. Note that this

method nests a specification in which we use all students and include a set of indicators for transfer

paths for non-direct attendees as well as indicators for final institution attended. Estimating

equation (1) separately by sector provides a more flexible specification that allows the coefficients

on the X variables and the school fixed effects to vary across sectors.

       To study the relationship between transferring and earnings, we begin with an earnings

function for BA recipients that specifies the relationship between entering or graduating from a

specific Texas college sector and earnings:

        Yis = α + ϑ1QiF + ϑ2QiG + βX is + γ i + ε i ,                                                 (2)

where Y is is the log quarterly earnings residual of student i from high school s that was discussed

in Section 1, QiF is the sector of the higher education institution in which student i first enrolls, QiG

is the sector of institution from which the student graduates, and all other variables are as

previously defined. We specify QiF as a set of fixed effects for an individual's sector of first

attendance, with the non-flagship public sector as the omitted category. The variable QiG is

similarly defined for the sector of graduation. This earnings function differs from previous work on

the returns to education quality in allowing for earnings to differ by the quality of the first and



                                                        19
graduating institution, which permits estimation of differences in earnings between groups of

students taking different paths.

       We first investigate whether, conditional on graduating from a given sector, there are

earnings difference between direct attendees and students who transferred in from another type of

university or colleges. The differences in earnings among graduates between direct attendees and

transfer students is important from a policy perspective because many students who are

academically capable of attending a four-year or flagship university choose not to do so, perhaps

due to cost considerations. If the earnings are the same for those who transfer in and graduate as

compared to direct attendees, then beginning college at a two-year or less selective four-year

school may be sensible for many students. However, if there are earnings penalties associated with

such paths, it could point to a value for policies that induce academically capable students to enroll

directly in four-year schools.

       To identify the differences between earnings among transfer students as compared to direct

attendees who graduate from the same sector, we first condition on graduating from a given sector.

Then, we estimate the following regression for these graduates:

        Yis = α + σTi + βX is + γ s + ε is ,                                                   (3)

where T i is a set of indicator variables that is equal to 1 if the graduate transferred in from a given

sector and is equal to zero otherwise. The coefficients of interest in equation (3) are σ , which

show the average difference in earnings between transfer students from a given sector and direct

attendees. We estimate this model separately for each of the three four-year sectors in our data,

which allows us to compare how the relationship between earnings and transferring differ by the

quality of the postsecondary sector from which one earns a degree. Thus, our estimates show not

only how transferring per se is related to earnings but how this relationship differs by the specific


                                                  20
path the transfer takes. For the non-flagship estimates, we include fixed effects for each university

from which a student graduates and cluster standard errors by this institution.

        In order to interpret σ as causal, the extensive controls for student background

characteristics in our data must be sufficient to control for the selection of students with different

underlying earnings potentials into different paths through the higher education system. Our

administrative data contain rich controls for such selection, including quartics in math, reading and

English state exams, relative rank within each high school on these exams, high school fixed

effects and detailed information regarding one's track through high school. These controls are more

extensive than have been used in most previous “selection on observables” studies of the returns to

college quality (e.g., Black and Smith, 2004, 2006; Brewer, Eide and Ehrenberg, 1999) and

transferring studies, but as discussed above we believe it unlikely that they will be able to control

fully for the endogeneity of the transfer decision. While our control variables will give us some

insight into the character of the selection that is occurring, we do not seek to make strong causal

claims about the effect of transferring on earnings in this analysis. Rather, we describe how the

returns to college are correlated with the path one takes, after accounting for a detailed series of

covariates designed to measure students' academic achievement prior to college and their

socioeconomic status. Because little previous work has been done in this area, and because our

observable background characteristics and the transfer patterns we consider are more detailed than

those used previously, 18 such correlational evidence is informative.

        In addition to estimating how earnings relate to transferring behavior among graduates of

schools in the same sector, we also wish to know how earnings differ among those who begin

college at the same type of institution and who take different paths through the higher education

18
  Both Light and Strayer (2004) and Agan (2013) examine the correlation between transferring and earnings. These
analyses use NLSY79 data, which while rich in covariates, only contains one measure of precollegiate academic
ability – AFQT scores – and contains samples that are too small to examine the types of transfers we analyze.

                                                       21
system. This part of the analysis will show whether, for example, two observationally equivalent

students who begin at a community college but who transfer to different school types have

different subsequent earnings. To explore this question, we estimate a model akin to equation (3)

but condition on first sector attended rather than on the last sector attended. The coefficients on the

transfer indicators represent the differences in earnings between any two groups of students who

start their college education at the same institution but who graduate at different institutions.

       As discussed above, the educational “paths” that we consider are a coarse presentation of

some of the paths described in the previous section. Still, we offer a more diverse set of paths than

is contained in the two existing papers most similar to this one: Hilmer (2000) and Light and

Strayer (2004). Because we are not forced to treat all transfers similarly, we can examine whether

certain types of transfer paths correlate with higher or lower earnings, which previous research has

not been able to study.

       Section 3.2. Descriptive Characteristics of Transfers and Direct Attendees

       Table 4 presents summary statistics of observable individual characteristics for our analysis

sample, separately by college paths to bachelor degrees. For both UT graduates and Texas A&M

graduates, the direct attendees have higher high school test scores in every subject than transfer

students. The direct attendees are much more likely to be in the top 10th percentile of their school

in each of these tests. They also are more likely to be gifted and less likely to be at risk of drop-out

in high school than transfer students. These estimates are in-line with previous work showing that

transfer students have lower academic achievement than their peers at the institutions to which

they transfer (McCormick, 2003; Adelman, 2006; Goldrick-Rab, 2006; Goldrick-Rab and Pfeffer,

2009). Interestingly, the background characteristics of transfers into UT look very similar with

respect to average TAAS scores and the percentage who are economically disadvantaged across



                                                  22
those who begin at a non-flagship university and those who begin at a community college.

However, the transfers in from community colleges are more likely to be white. Similar patterns

are evident for those transferring into Texas A&M, and those transferring into the flagships are

comparable on observables across the two schools. Finally, among non-flagship graduates, the

direct attendees and those who transfer across non-flagship institutions look very similar with

respect to high school test scores, but those who transfer in from a community college appear less

academically qualified than those who start at a four-year school. The students who “transfer

down” from a flagship have higher high school achievement scores, and they also are more likely

to be white and are less likely to be economically disadvantaged than direct attendees at non-

flagship, four-year institutions.

       Unsurprisingly, direct attendees at UT and Texas A&M earn more than transfer students.

Among the non-flagship graduates, it is those who transfer in from a flagship who earn the most,

followed by direct attendees and then by transfers from other four-year and community colleges.

These raw differences in log earnings residuals are driven, at least in part, by the fact that these

groups all differ on observable characteristics that are correlated with future earnings. Our

empirical analysis below seeks to understand what part of this difference remains once we control

for our extensive set of background characteristics.

       That transfers and direct attendees differ with respect to academic and socioeconomic

backgrounds suggest these groups also may have systematically different preferences over courses

of study and may perform differently in college. To the extent that different majors and/or college

performance are valued more or less by the labor market, any differences along these margins may

translate into differences in the returns to graduating from a given university sector. Table 5 shows

the distribution of majors, mean college grade point averages (GPAs), and time to BA by sector of



                                                 23
graduation and by broad transfer path. Several patterns are evident in the table. First, at UT and

Texas A&M, the GPAs of transfers are lower than those of direct attendees, although the

differences are not large. 19 For non-flagship graduates, GPAs among all groups are ostensibly the

same, with the exception of those who transfer in from flagships. These students have higher

GPAs, which are higher on average than GPAs among direct attendees at flagship schools. This

result suggests those who transfer out of the flagship sectors may not be doing so because of

academic struggles.

         Transferring also is correlated with time to degree. Across all institution types, transfers

who earn a BA take about 0.3 to 0.4 more years than direct attendees to do so. These estimates are

consistent with transferring elongating the length of time it takes one to obtain a degree, and the

large amount of transferring we document could contribute to rising degree times in the US

(Bound, Lovenheim and Turner, 2012). 20 In addition, the longer time it takes transfers to obtain a

degree means they will have slightly less experience, on average, than direct attendee graduates. 21

         Transfers and direct attendees differ in their majors as well. At UT-Austin and Texas

A&M, transfers are less likely to major in engineering and business and more likely to be in liberal

arts, communications, agriculture and social sciences. At non-flagship schools, the distribution of

majors differs little between direct attendees and transfers.

         The choice of college major, and the GPA one attains while in college, may be endogenous

to the transfer decision. If a student transferring has a causal effect on her GPA, perhaps due to the

disruption of switching institutions or if students transfer because of preferences for a degree

19
   These grade point averages are calculated for all schools attended in Texas, not just one's graduating institution.
20
   The increased time to degree could be coming about due to students “stopping out” between institutions or due to
a reduced pace of credit accumulation while enrolled. Decomposing the increased degree time into these constituent
parts is beyond the scope of our analysis, but we view this as an important question for future research.
21
   While differences in experience could drive some of the earnings differences we document, we show in Appendix
Tables A-2 and A-3 that the estimates for oldest two cohorts in our sample are very similar. Since the effects of the
differences in experience should decline over time, these estimates suggest that differential experience is not a
primary driver of any earnings effects we find.

                                                         24
program that is stronger at another school, majors and GPAs may themselves be an outcome of

transferring behavior. As such, it would be improper to include them as controls. Nonetheless, we

control for major choice and GPA in some specifications below in order to give a descriptive

accounting of how these variables impact the estimated earnings differences across groups.

Although we view them as informative about the role of college major and college performance in

driving differences in earnings by transfer type, we urge some caution in interpreting these

estimates due to the potential endogeneity of college majors and GPAs to transferring decisions.

         Further descriptive information about the composition of transfer students is shown in

Table 6, where we present estimates from OLS models that estimate the probability of transferring

as a function of student pre-collegiate observables. We also examine the likelihood of transferring

as a function of the distance between one’s high school and the first college attended. In the first

column, we present results using all attendees from the 1996-2002 high school cohorts, and in the

subsequent columns we show estimates for all BA recipients and for graduates by sector.

         Several patterns emerge from Table 6. First, student transferring is not very sensitive to

how far away from home their first school is located. 22 Although the estimates often are

statistically significant and typically are positive, they are small in magnitude. Second, across all

columns of Table 6, there is a strong negative correlation between the likelihood of transferring

and high school test scores; more academically capable students transfer less frequently. Third,

except among Texas A&M graduates, black students are much less likely to transfer than white

students and across all sectors Hispanic students are far more likely to transfer. In addition,

economically-disadvantaged attendees are more likely to transfer, but this relationship does not

hold among graduates. This finding could reflect a higher dropout likelihood among economically-

22
  We also note that when students transfer, they do not tend to move to institutions that much close to home: the
mean distance between a student’s high school and first university is 101 miles, while the mean distance with
respect to the second institution is 86 miles.

                                                         25
disadvantaged students who transfer. Finally, LEP and special education students are, on the

whole, less likely to transfer and males are slightly more likely to transfer than females. Overall,

these descriptive patterns are consistent with those shown in Table 4 as well as those from prior

work (e.g., Goldrick-Rab, 2006; Goldrick-Rab and Pfeffer, 2009).

       Section 3.3. Transferring and the Likelihood of BA Attainment

       Table 7 presents estimates of equation (1) by last institution attended. Panel A shows

estimates using the full sample, and each cell is from a separate regression that compares

completion rates among direct attendees and transfers in from another school. Results in the first

row include high school fixed effects only and those in the second row add observable student and

high school characteristics. There are two important findings shown in Table 7. First, without

exception the differences in graduation rates between transfer students and direct attendees are

small: they are at most 3% when all high school and demographic controls are added. These

findings suggest that transferring is not strongly correlated with BA completion. Second, the

estimates suggest much heterogeneity in any such correlations. Those who transfer from a

community college are 3% less likely to graduate at UT-Austin than direct attendees, and they are

3% more likely to graduate than direct attendees at non-flagship schools. Those who transfer from

a non-flagship university, however, are more likely to graduate than either UT-Austin direct

attendees or other four year direct attendees. For TAMU students, there is no relationship between

transfer status and BA attainment. Students who begin at a flagship university and transfer to a

non-flagship four-year school are about 1% more likely to graduate than non-flagship direct

attendees at the same school. Thus, for all but community college students transferring to UT-

Austin, transferring is positively associated with BA completion, although these relationships are

not strong.



                                                 26
       The estimates in Panel A are potentially misleading because they compare transfers to all

direct attendees, some of whom will drop out in their first couple years while the transfer students

are less likely to drop out in this time frame. In Panel B, we compare transfer students who transfer

in their second year to direct attendees who are present in their second year, and in Panel C we

provide the same comparisons for third year transfers and students. Though less precise, the

estimates in Panel B are very similar to those in Panel A, with the notable exception that the

estimate for community college students transferring to UT-Austin now is ostensibly zero. For all

other groups, the estimates are the same or somewhat larger in magnitude, indicating that

transferring in one’s second year of college is positively correlated with BA receipt relative to

direct attendees who persist to their second year.

       In contrast, in Panel C we see consistent evidence that transfers in their third year are

significantly less likely to graduate than are direct attendees who have persisted until their third

year. Interestingly, community college students who transfer after they obtain an Associate’s

Degree are most likely to be in this group, and they fare far worse in terms of degree completion

across the different college sectors than direct attendees. That the estimates in Panel A are much

closer to those in Panel B highlights the fact that student who transfer in their second year are

much more prevalent, but the results in Panel C underscore the large amount of heterogeneity in

student outcomes associated with when in the college career a student transfers.

       Section 3.4. Earnings Estimates

       Table 8 contains the estimates of equation (3), which shows the differences in earnings

between bachelor degree recipients who are direct attendees and bachelor degree recipients who

graduate from the same college type but who started college in a different sector. Estimates are

shown separately by graduating sector, and each set of two to three estimates in a row are from the



                                                 27
same regression. For all estimates in Table 8, the reference group is the direct attendees from the

given college sector. For example, in the first row of Table 8, those who transfer into UT-Austin

from a non-flagship university earn 14.8% less than direct UT graduates. Community college

transfers earn 18.9% less. The first row includes only high school fixed effects, the second row

adds in individual and high school-by-cohort controls, and in the third row we add in controls for

college major and GPA.

       The results show that transfer students earn less than direct attendees, even among

graduates. This is the case for all sectors except for flagship students who transfer into a non-

selective four-year school. Focusing on the estimates in the second row, which are our preferred

estimates, the coefficients are fairly consistent within sectors. For UT-Austin graduates, transfer

students earn between 11 and 14 percent less than direct attendees, and for TAMU graduates the

earnings penalty is about 6%. There is little variation across those who enter from a non-flagship

school or a community college. Among graduates from non-flagship universities, the earnings

difference between transfer students and direct attendees is much smaller, at -2 to -4%, which

suggests at least some of the flagship estimates may be due to unobserved skill differences that are

likely to be larger at more elite schools.

       One method for further controlling for unobserved characteristics that are valued by the

labor market is to include measures of college GPA and major into the regression. For example,

one reason why the UT-Austin earnings differences are so much larger than those at Texas A&M

is that Texas A&M is more focused on engineering and technical areas, which could have higher

average returns (See Andrews, Li and Lovenheim (2012) for evidence on earnings in Texas by

college major). The third row of Table 8 adds controls for college GPA and college major to

provide some evidence on this question. Because of the potential endogeneity of major and GPA



                                                 28
with respect to transferring, however, we stress that these estimates are merely suggestive. The

results are consistent with a large role for college major and performance in explaining earnings

differences by transfer status. At UT, the earnings differences drop considerably in absolute value,

to between 7 and 9 percent, but they remain both sizable and statistically significant. At Texas

A&M, all earnings differences between direct attendees and transfers disappear, as do all

differences in the non-flagship sector except for a small earnings penalty among those transferring

in from a community college. Thus, GPA and major differences, from an accounting standpoint,

explain much of the residual differences in earnings between direct and transfer students in all

sectors. These results are due to some combination of transfer students selecting majors with lower

returns and performing worse than their direct attendee counterparts. The earnings estimates show

the importance of examining earnings rather than just BA completion in developing an

understanding of how transferring behavior affects long-run student outcomes.

       It also is instructive to compare earnings among graduates based on their initial institution

rather than on their graduating institution. Such comparisons are informative because to the extent

that students who start at the same type of school but who graduate at different places earn

different amounts, it highlights the value of assessing not only whether students transfer, but to

where they transfer. Table 9 contains these estimates. In the first two columns, we compare

earnings of direct attendees among our three postsecondary four-year sectors. Once one controls

for background characteristics, UT graduates earn 9% more than non-flagship graduates, and

Texas A&M graduates earn 15% more. When we control for college major and GPA, these

estimates change to 10% and 12%, respectively. Despite the potential endogeneity of major and

GPA, these results again underscore the importance of courses of study and college performance in

driving subsequent earnings of graduates, particularly for Texas A&M graduates.



                                                29
       In the next set of columns, we compare students who begin at a non-flagship school and

transfer to one of the flagships to direct non-flagship graduates. Here, there are large differences by

whether one transfers to UT or to TAMU, with TAMU graduates earning 9.6% more than non-

flagship direct attendees and UT transfers earning 2.2% less. These estimates suggest that those

who transfer into UT-Austin earn considerably less than their counterparts who transfer into Texas

A&M, even though the transfer students are similar to each other on observables. In the third row,

once we control for college GPA and major, the UT-Austin coefficient flips signs and the Texas

A&M estimate becomes larger. These results are consistent with those in Table 8 in suggesting

that UT-Austin transfer students in particular might be majoring in “low return” subjects and/or are

performing worse in ways that reduce their future earnings. Unconditional on college major and

GPA, non-flagship four-year students who transfer into UT-Austin are not better off in terms of

earnings than their counterparts who did not transfer.

       These patterns are similar when we compare those who begin at non-flagship schools and

transfer to a flagship to those who begin at a non-flagship and transfer to another non-flagship or to

students who start at a community college and transfer to a non-flagship. Relative to both

comparison groups, UT-Austin transfers earn about the same and Texas A&M transfers earn 12-15

percent more. Controlling for GPA and college majors makes the UT transfer estimates positive

and significant at the 5% level, with coefficients that range from 3-6 percent, and the Texas A&M

estimates become slightly smaller. Thus, even relative to other transfer students, those who transfer

into UT-Austin from the non-flagship or community college sectors appear to select less lucrative

majors and perform worse in college (as Table 5 indicates).

       Taken together, Table 8 and Table 9 demonstrate that there is significant heterogeneity in

relationship between earnings and transferring behavior that is not simple to characterize with the



                                                 30
quality of the starting or finishing institution. In effect, movement towards institutions of higher

quality are not universally positive. These estimates show that any decision rule that attempts to

ascertain whether a particular inter-college move is optimal depends greatly on the point of

reference, the course of study a student selects and his performance in that course of study.

Understanding more fully how institutional quality and college major map to earnings is a ripe area

for future research given these findings.

       Section 3.5. Earnings Estimates by Race/Ethnicity and Gender

       Finally, we explore heterogeneity by race/ethnicity and gender in the earnings estimates in

Tables 10 and 11. In Table 10, we show results similar to Table 8 across different groups that

exclude college GPA and major. Estimates that include college controls are shown in Appendix

Table A-1. Given that white students constitute the majority of the sample, it is unsurprising that

the estimates we observe closely mirror the estimates we see in Table 8. The only notable

difference is a coefficient of -0.022 for flagship transfers into non-flagship schools. Though the

estimate is imprecise, it suggests white students who transfer in this way earn less than direct non-

flagship attendees.

       The estimates for Hispanic students are largely similar to those for white students, except

community college transfers into UT and other four year schools earn the same as direct attendees.

Hispanic students who begin at a flagship university and transfer also earn about 2.6% more than

non-flagship direct attendees. Even though most of the estimates are statistically insignificant for

black students, the estimates for these students are substantively very different than for Hispanics

and whites. The earnings premiums associated with transferring into UT from either the non-

flagship or community college sectors are positive and large, at 14 and 6 percent, respectively.

Conversely, African American transfers into Texas A&M earn substantially less than direct



                                                 31
attendees of the same race. Among those transferring to non-flagship schools, there is a small

negative earnings difference associated with those who transfer in from another four year school or

from a community college, but there is a sizable (though not significant) positive difference

between flagship transfers and non-flagship direct attendees. These results are suggestive of a large

amount of heterogeneity in returns to college across sectors and transfer type among African

American students, but the lack of sufficient sample sizes precludes us from drawing more

definitive conclusions.

       The estimates for Asian students typically indicate a negative relationship between

transferring and earnings compared to direct attendees, with the estimates for those who transfer

into a non-flagship school from another non-flagship school or a community college being the only

estimates that are statistically significantly different from zero at even the 10% level.

       We also show estimates by gender in Table 10, which are particularly of interest because

we cannot disentangle unemployment from non-labor force participation in our data. As women

are much more likely to not be in the labor force, and since women are an increasingly large

proportion of college graduates, understanding the extent of heterogeneity in our results by gender

is important. The estimates in Table 10 do not point to large differences between men and women.

For UT-Austin graduates, the coefficients for men are larger in absolute value, with the opposite

pattern among Texas A&M graduates. Aside from the 11% lower earnings experienced by women

who transfer into Texas A&M from the non-flagship sector, these estimates are qualitatively very

similar across genders. Among the non-flagship graduates, the estimates also are similar across

genders, with the estimates for men being slightly larger in absolute value.




                                                 32
           Table 11 shows results akin to those in Table 9 for men and women separately. 23 On the

whole, earnings differences are smaller in magnitude for women than for men. This is particularly

true comparing earnings among direct attendees as well as for the estimates examining earnings

among those who transfer into Texas A&M. Males who transfer to Texas A&M earn significantly

more than other transfer students, while the earnings differences for women either are zero or are

much smaller (as is the case for the community college to TAMU transfers). That these differences

persist after college GPA and major are included in the regressions suggest this difference cannot

be explained by these college outcome measures.

           Section 4. Conclusion

           With student transferring becoming more prevalent and multiple institutional contact

becoming more the norm in higher education, it is critically important to understand the different

paths students take through the postsecondary system and how these paths relate to college

outcomes and earnings. We use detailed administrative data in Texas to examine these questions.

Our data contain sample sizes that are sufficient to detect very complex paths that students take,

and our ability to link these paths to subsequent earnings is rather unique in the literature.

           We first show that transferring is prevalent in Texas and that looking only at where

students begin or exit college is not sufficient to characterize their college experiences. There are

many students who transfer more than once and have complex transfer patterns.

           We next show that transferring is correlated with both BA completion rates and future

earnings in interesting ways. In particular, aside from transfers to UT-Austin from community

college, transfer students graduate at the same rate or higher than direct attendees. However, these

positive correlations are reversed when examining students who transfer after their second year.

These estimates highlight the significant heterogeneity that exists with respect to when students
23
     Similar results by race/ethnicity are available from the authors upon request.

                                                            33
transfer and their likelihood of completion. That transfer students are more likely to graduate than

observationally equivalent direct attendees suggests a role for match quality as well.

       When we examine earnings, the broad finding is that direct attendee graduates earn more

than transfers into their institutions, but for the non-flagship sector, this difference is small. We

provide suggestive evidence that some of the differences across institutions are due to the different

major choices of transfers relative to direct attendees.

       Overall, this paper describes the heterogeneous paths students take through college and

demonstrates that these paths relate in interesting ways to both college completion and to

subsequent earnings. The goal of this paper is to describe these patterns and how they relate to

student outcomes, but an important limitation of this work is that we are unable to examine why

these patterns look the way they do; that is, we are unable to identify a causal relationship between

transferring and college completion or earnings. That we are able to control for detailed student

background and pre-collegiate academic characteristics indicates that the graduation and earnings

effects we find must be driven by other factors, such as match quality, adverse life outcomes

affecting both transfer and graduation/earnings, or a signaling model in which transferring itself is

treated as a signal of lower productivity. Given the increasing prevalence of multiple institutional

enrollment and the importance of understanding the economic returns to college quality and the

process by which students decide to complete college or drop out, investigating the relevance of

such mechanisms in future research would be of high value.

  Source: Authors' calculations from the University of Texas at Dallas Education Research Center data as described in the text. The "Attendee" sample consists of
  all students who attend college within two years of high school graduation. The “BA” sample consists of all BA recipients who obtain a degree within 8 years of
  high school graduation. First institution attended is the first post-secondary institution at which a student enrolls after high school graduation. The second
  institution attended is the subsequent institution in which the student enrolls in a non-summer semester. The third institution attended is similarly defined. Dual
  enrollment does not count as transferring nor does switching across community colleges.

The Earnings sample consists of graduates from a public Texas college or university who attend college within two years of high school graduation and who
graduate within eight years. All earnings are measured from 2007-2009 and are restricted to those not concurrently enrolled in graduate school and for whom we
observe at least three consecutive quarters of earnings. The Log Quarterly Earnings measure is the residual from a regression of quarterly earnings that fit our
sample criteria on year, quarter, and birth cohort indicators.

  Each column is a separate regression, using data from 1996-2002. Estimates are from linear probability
  models with an indicator for whether a student ever transfers as the dependent variable. The first
  column includes all attendees, while the subsequent columns include only those students who obtain a
  BA within 8 years.
2
  Robust standard errors are in parentheses: ** indicates statistical significance at the 5% level and *
  indicates statistical significance at the 10% level.
