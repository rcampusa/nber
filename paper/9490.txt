                                          ABSTRACT

In a series of papers, my colleagues and I have demonstrated that levels of per capita income,
economic growth, and other economic and demographic dimensions are strongly correlated with
geographical and ecological variables such as climate zone, disease ecology, and distance from the

coast. Three recent papers purport to show that the role of geography in explaining cross-country
patterns of income per capita operates predominantly or exclusively through the choice of

institutions, with little direct effect of geography on income after controlling for the quality
institutions. This note shows that malaria transmission, which is strongly affected by ecological
conditions, directly affects the level of per capita income after controlling for the quality of
institutions.

Introduction

        In a series of papers, my colleagues and I (Gallup, Sachs, and Mellinger, 1998, 2000;

Gallup and Sachs, 2001; Sachs and Malaney, 2002) have demonstrated that levels of per capita

income, economic growth, and other economic and demographic dimensions are strongly

correlated with key geographical and ecological variables, such as climate zone, disease ecology,

and distance from the coast. Several recent papers have explored this link between geography

and development, testing whether the effects of geography on economic activity work mainly

through various direct channels (e.g. through effects on productivity, population growth, trade

and investment) or indirect channels (e.g. through effects on the choice of political and economic

institutions). Of course, both kinds of channels may be present simultaneously, and Gallup,

Sachs, and Mellinger (1998) offer a theoretical illustration as to why a disadvantageous physical

environment may be conducive to the adoption of less productive institutional arrangements as

well.

        Three papers in particular (Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson, 2001; Easterly and

Levine, 2002; and Rodrik, Subramanian, and Trebbis, 2002) purport to show that the role of

geography in explaining cross-country patterns of income per capita operates predominantly or

exclusively through the choice of institutions, with little direct effect of geography on income.

This would indeed be a surprising conclusion, since many of the reasons why geography seems

to have affected institutional choices in the past (e.g. the suitability of locations for European

technologies, the disease environment and risks to survival of immigrants, the productivity of

agriculture, the transport costs between far-flung regions and major markets) are indeed based on

direct effects of geography on production systems, human health, and environmental

sustainability, and many of those very same channels would still be likely to apply today. Thus,




                                                  2
the logic of the geography-institutions linkage is also the logic of a direct geography-productivity

linkage.

         Fortunately, these three papers propose a testable – and refutable – hypothesis that

geography matters only through institutions, based on the following cross-country regression

model:

         (1)    ln(Yi) = β0 + β1 QIi + β2’ Zi       + εi

The log of income per capita of country i, ln(Yi) , is specified to be a function of the “quality of

institutions,” according to an index QIi , and one or more other variables Zi, which may include

geographical, historical or policy variables. Since income is affected by geography (Z), the

argument suggests that Z works only through QI, with no direct effects once QI is entered into

the regression equation. Specifically, the papers advance the null hypothesis that the coefficient

vector β2’ is zero, so geographical (and other “non-institutional”) variables have no additional

explanatory power beyond their possible indirect role in affecting the quality of institutions:

         (2) H0 : β2’ = 0

In the empirical test of H0 in the three recent papers, the income variable is purchasing-power-

parity adjusted GNP per capita in 1995 and the institutions variable is a proxy measure of

institutional quality.

         This current note shows that the null hypothesis in (2) is rejected when the Zi variable is a

measure of malaria transmission. In other words, I provide evidence that malaria transmission

directly impacts the level of per capita income after controlling for institutional quality. The

likely reasons for this linkage are described in Gallup and Sachs, 2001, and Sachs and Malaney,

2002.      Before proceeding to the statistical test, however, it is important to stress that the model

in (1) is worryingly oversimplified in any case (and thus is certainly not the model of choice that



                                                    3
I would specify or prefer to test). No reliable conclusions about the primacy of institutions over

other variables should. The first obvious specification problem is one of statics versus dynamics.

Economic theory suggests that the determination of per capita income should be specified as a

dynamic process (e.g. Barro and Sala-i-Martin, 1997), in which the growth of income during a

time interval [0,T] is a function of the income level at the start of the period and some kind of

average of the values of the “forcing variables” during the time interval [0,T]:

        (3) (1/T)ln(YiT/Yi0) = β0 + β1 QIi[0,T] + β2 ’ Zi[0,T] + β3 ln(Yi0) + εi

It is much more likely that the quality of institutions in a given time period will affect the growth

rate of the economy during that period (controlling for initial income), as opposed to the

contemporaneous level of national income. It is also very doubtful that a process as complex as

economic development can possibly be explained by two or three variables alone, much less the

particular “geography” variables stressed by AJR and RST. Distance from the equator, the

centerpiece of testing in RST, is an exceedingly poor choice for a serious test of geographical

variables.1 It is at best a proxy, and a poor one at that, for climate or possibly for distance from

major markets, and should not be used as the basis of the bulk of the tests in the RST paper when

much better alternatives are available. In any event, most geographical analyses stress several

factors (climate, geographical isolation, disease environment), so that testing these variables one

at a time is subject to extreme risk of left-out-variable error.

        The purpose of this note, however, is to show that even within narrow confines of

equation (1) the null hypothesis is easily refuted. I focus on one particular variable, malaria risk.

It is easy to show that highly malarious regions of the world (i.e. regions where there is a high


1
  I have made this point elsewhere in Sachs (2000). It is interesting in this regard that when this variable was
introduced by Hall and Jones (1999), it was taken to be a proxy for European settlement, not a proxy for geography
per se. It is, incidentally, a fairly miserable measure for European settlement as well, another case in which much
more direct measures are readily available.


                                                         4
risk of malaria transmission) have lower per capita income that non-malarious regions,

controlling for the quality of government institutions. Moreover, since malaria transmission is

strongly related to ecological conditions (specifically the type of mosquito vectors and the

climate conditions) there is an excellent instrumental variable that can be used for malaria

prevalence to help us to test the proposition that malaria “causes” poverty rather than vice versa.



Malaria Risk

       As the main measure of malaria risk, I use an indicator based on the 1994 WHO world

map of malaria risk. By overlaying the world map of malaria risk with a map of world

population, my colleagues and I have calculated the proportion of each country’s population that

live with risk of malaria transmission, labeled MAL94P. An alternative measure, introduced in

Gallup and Sachs (1998), and used in AJR and RST, multiplies the MALP94 index by an

estimate of the proportion of national malaria cases that involve the fatal species, Plasmodium

falciparum, as opposed to three largely non-fatal species of the malaria pathogen (P. vivax, P.

malariae, and P. ovale). This index is called MALFAL. Sub-Saharan Africa has a very high

proportion of malaria cases that are falciparum malaria, whereas in the Americas, Europe, and

much of Asia, a higher proportion of malaria vivax cases is found.

       Neither measure is a completely satisfactory index of the intensity of disease transmission

or the burden of the disease in terms of morbidity and mortality. The basic problem is that the

number of cases of malaria reported annually to WHO is a tiny fraction of the total number of

malaria cases in a given year. That is why we rely on a measure of population at risk rather than

actual infections. Most malaria cases in Africa are self treated if they are treated at all. Even

deaths due to malaria are often unreported or are not classified by cause of death. There are also




                                                  5
deep clinical issues in the attribution of cause of death in the case of malaria. Two kinds of

errors can occur. Some deaths may occur due to other causes but be attributed to malaria since

the individual may simultaneously be infected by malaria. Alternatively, some deaths attributed

to other causes may indeed have malaria as a co-factor, but not the sole or even principle cause.

Also, multiplying MALP94 by the share of falciparum introduces one error while correcting

another. It is important to distinguish countries burdened by falciparum from those suffering

mainly or solely from non-fatal variants. On the other hand, in a case where falciparum is, say,

50% of all clinical cases, it may still be true that 100% of the public is at risk of falciparum

infection. It would be best to make an index of percent of population at risk of falciparum

infection, but we don’t have data of that sort available.

       Malaria is intrinsically a disease of warm environments because a key part of the life

cycle of the parasite (sporogony) depends on a high ambient temperature. This is, in essence,

why malaria is a disease of the tropics and the sub-tropics. Falciparum malaria requires even

higher temperatures than vivax malaria. Malaria also depends on adequate conditions for

mosquito breeding, mainly pools of clean water, usually due to rainfall ending up in puddles,

cisterns, discarded tires, and the like. As a result, malaria has a distinct seasonality in the sub-

humid tropics, where wet and dry seasons alternate, and mosquito breeding and hence malaria

follows the rainy season. Additionally, the intensity of malaria transmission depends on the

specific mosquito vectors that are present. All malaria is transmitted by mosquitos of the genus

anopheles. Some anopheles species, especially those in sub-Saharan Africa, show a high

preference for taking their blood meals from humans (anthropophagy) as opposed to animals

such as cattle. These human-biting vectors lead to much more intensive transmission of the

disease.




                                                  6
           The temperature, mosquito abundance, and vector specificity can be combined into a

single measure of Malaria Ecology (ME), an ecologically-based variable that is predictive of

malaria risk. (Kiszewski et. al., forthcoming). The basic formula for ME includes temperature,

species abundance, and vector type. The underlying index is measured on a highly disaggregated

sub-national level, and then is averaged for the entire country. Because ME is built upon

climatological and vector conditions on a country-by-country basis, and is therefore exogenous

to public health interventions and economic conditions, ME provides an ideal instrumental

variable for malaria risk.2



Estimation Strategy

           The key is to estimate equation (1), in order to test whether malaria risk helps to explain

cross-country patterns of national income after controlling for the quality of institutions. In

order to do this, both the institutional quality and the malaria prevalence variables should be

instrumented. I use three instruments.

           KGPTEMP. This variable measures the share of a country’s population in
           temperate ecozones, based on the Koeppen-Geiger ecozone classification system.
           (Mellinger, Gallup, and Sachs, 2000).

           LOGMORT. This variable, created by AJR based on a range of source materials,
           is an estimate of mortality rates of British soldiers and other populations in the
           early 19th century, and has been used as an instrumental variable for institutional
           quality in all three papers.

           ME. This variable, described above, provides an instrument for malaria risk that
           controls for the fact that causation may run not only from malaria to income but
           also from income to malaria.


Since the AJR sample of ex-colonies covers only 64 countries, it is convenient to use KGPTEMP

as an additional instrument for institutional quality in order to estimate (1) for a larger sample of
2
    This variable was generated together with colleagues of mine at the Harvard Center for International Development.


                                                           7
countries in the AJR and RST data sets.3 Institutional quality is strongly positively correlated

with the percentage of the population living in temperate-zone ecologies, so that KGPTEMP is a

useful instrument.4

        The left-hand-side variable in each case is GNP per capita, PPP adjusted, in 1995. Each

paper uses a slightly different version of this variable, so I use the same definition as in the

original paper. Each paper also uses a distinct measure of institutional quality, and again, I use

the same variable as in the respective papers.

        The regression results are shown in Table 1. Each regression uses two-stage-least-

squares to estimate the log income in 1995 as a function of institutional quality and malaria risk.

For the large sample of countries, we use two instruments (KGPTEMP and ME), while for the

smaller set of countries in the AJR and EL papers, LOGMORT is added as an instrument. For

each of the three papers there are four regressions, based on the two malaria variables, and the

smaller or larger set of instruments.

        The results are strong and robust. In every single regression, both the quality of

institutions and the malaria risk variables are statistically significant at the 0.05 percent level, and

in most cases at the 0.01 percent level. The null hypothesis is decisively rejected in all three data

sets, both for the larger number of countries (using KGPTEMP and ME as instruments) and for

the smaller number of countries (using all three instrumental variables).

        In Table 2, I add an additional right-hand-side geographical variable, the share of the

national population living within 100km of the coast. For a variety of reasons, including

overland transport costs, we should expect that countries with coastal populations should enjoy

 In the EL paper, the quality of institutions variable is defined only for 62 countries in any event.

 The positive relationship between institutional quality and KGPTEMP may be due to the fact that European settlers
preferred to settle in familiar temperate-zone settings, as suggested by AJR, though many alternative hypotheses are
also possible.


                                                         8
higher per capita incomes than countries with substantially hinterland or even landlocked

populations. We see that this is true in the large sample of countries (using AJR and RST) but is

not evident in the smaller sample of countries in the EL data set.



Conclusions

       The chief strength of the AJR, EL, and RST papers is that a clear null hypothesis is

advanced. As Karl Popper taught many years ago, the failure to reject a null hypothesis on one

set of data does not imply the correctness of the hypothesis more generally. This paper shows,

indeed, that the null hypothesis may be readily rejected using an alternative geographical

variable: malaria risk. A more complete model of development, however, will require that we

move beyond the simple specifications tested in the three papers reviewed in this note. There is

good theoretical and empirical reason to believe that the development process reflects a complex

interaction of institutions, policies, and geography.

t-statistics are indicated in parentheses.
All regression equations are estimates with two-stage least squares and include a constant term (not reported).
First-stage regressions and (where relevant) overidentification tests support the use of the instruments in each case.
MALFAL and LOGMORT cover slightly different countries across papers, for consistency the corresponding authors' version of the variable is used.
The sample size in each regression varies slightly compared to the original regressions in AJR, EL and RST, respectively, due to differing coverage of the
malaria and KGPTEMP variables. These minor variations in sample size do not appear to affect the substantive results.
