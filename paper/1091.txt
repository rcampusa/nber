              Inflation and the Role of Bonds in Investor Portfolios
                                     Abstract

         This paper explores both theoretically and enirically the role of
nominal bonds of various maturities in investor portfolios in the U.S. One of
its principal goals is to determine whether an investor who is constrained to
limit his investment in bonds to a single portfolio of money—fixed debt instru-
ments will suffer a serious welfare loss. Our interest in this question stems
in part from the observation that many employer—sponsored savings plans limit a
participant's investment choices to two types, a common stock fund and a money—
fixed bond fund of a particular maturity. A second goal is to study the desira-
bility and feasibility of introducing a market for index bonds (i.e. an asset
offering a riskiess real rate of return) in the U.S. capital markets.

         The theoretical framework is Merton's (1971) continuous time model of
consumption and portfolio choice. Our measure of the welfare gain or loss from
a given change in the investor's opportunity set is the increment to current
wealth needed to completely offset the effect of the change. A novel feature of
our empirical approach is the method of deriving equilibrium risk premia on the
various asset classes. We employ the variance—covariance matrix of real rates
of return estimated from historical data in combination with "reasonable"
assumptions about net asset supplies and the econonbr_wide average degree of risk
aversion to derive numerical values for these risk premia. This procedure
allows us to circumvent the formidable estimation problems associated with using
historical   means, which are negative during some subperiods.

         Our main results are: (i) There can be a substantial loss in welfare
for participants in savings plans offering a choice of only two funds, a diver-
sified stock fund and an intermediate—term bond fund. !bst of this loss can be
eliminated by introducing as a third option a money market fund.   (2) The
potential welfare gain from the introduction of private index bonds in the U.S.
capital market is probably not large enough to justify the costs of innovation.
The major reason for the swall gain is that one month bills with their small
variance of real returns are an effective substitute for index bonds.

         Inflation   and the Bole   of Bonds in Investor Portfolios.

I.     Introduction

             The inflation of the past decade and a half has dispelled the notion

that    default—free nominal bonds are a riskless investment. Conventional      wisdom
used to be that the conservative investor invested principally in bonds, and the
aggressive or speculative investor invested principally in stocks. Short—term
bills were considered to be only a temporary "parking place" for funds awaiting
investment in either bonds or stocks. Thdv many academics and practitioners in
the field of finance have come       to   the view that for an investor who is concerned

about his real rate of return, long—term nominal bonds are a risky investment

even   when held to maturity.
             The alternative view that a policy of rolling—over short term bills

might be a sound long—term investment strate' for the conservative Investor has

recently gained credibility. The rationale behind this view is the observation

that   for   the past few decades, bills have yielded the least variable real rate

of   return of all the major investment instruments traded in U.S. financial
markets. Stated a bit differently, the nominal rate of return on bills has
tended   to mirror changes in   the rate of inflation so that their real rate bf
return has remained relatively stable as compared to stocks or longer term
fixed—interest bonds.
             This is, of course, not a coincidence. All market—determined interest
rates contain an "inflation premium," which reflects expectations about the
declining purchasing power of the money borrowed      the life of the loan. As
                                                        over

the rate of inflation has increased in recent years, so too has the Inflation
premium built into interest rates. While long—terni as well as short—term
                                         _0

 interest rates contain such a premium, conventional
                                                 long—term bonds lock the
 investor into the current interest rate for the life of the bond. If long—term
 interest rates on new bonds subsequently rise as a result of unexpected infla-
tion,    the funds already locked in can be released only   by selling the bonds on
the secondary market at a price well below their face value. But       if   an investor
buys only short—term bonds with an average maturity of about thirty days, then

the interest rate he earns will la€ behind changes in the inflation rate by at

most one month. For the investor who is concerned about his real rate of

return, bills may therefore be less risky than bonds, even in the long run.

           The main purpose of this paper is to explore both theoretically and

empirically the role of nominal bonds of various maturities in
                                                                    investor port-
folios.    i-low important is it for the investor to diversify his bond holdings

fully across the range of bond maturities? We provide a way to measure the

importance of diversification, and this enables us to determine the value of

holding stocks and a variety of bonds, for example, as      opposed to following a
less   cumbersome investment strater, such as concentrating in stocks and bills

alone.

           One of our principal goals is to determine whether an investor who is

constrained to limit his investment in bonds to a single portfolio of money—

fixed debt instruments will suffer a serious welfare loss. In part, our

interest in this question stems from the observation that many employer—

sponsored tax—deferred savings plans limit a participantts investment choices to

two types, a common stock fund and a money—fixed bond fund of a particular

maturity?

           A second goal is to study the desirability of introducing a market for

indexed bonds (i.e. an asset offering a riskiess real rate of return). There

is a substantial literature on this subject,2 but to our knowledge no one has

attempted to measure the magnitude of the welfare gain to an individual investor

from the introduction of trading in such securities in the U.S. capital market.

           In the first part of the paper we develop a mean—variance model for

measuring the value to an investor of a particular set of investment instruments

as a function of his degree of risk aversion, rate of time   preference   and

investment time horizon. We then take ianthly data on real rates of return on

stocks, bills and U.S. government bonds of eight different durations, their

covariance structure, and combine these estimates with reasonable assumptions

about net asset supplies and aggregate risk aversion in order to derive a set of

equilibrium risk premia. This procedure allows us to circumvent the formidable

problems of deriving reliable estimates of these risk premia from the historical

means, which are negative during many subperiods. We then employ these para-

meter values in our ndel of optimal consumption and portfolio selection in

order   to address the two empirical issues of principal concern to us. The paper
concludes with a section summarizing the main results and pointing out possible
implications   for private and public policy.
II. Theoretical Jbdel

        A. tdel Structure and Assumptions

              Our basic model of portfolio selection is that of Markowitz (1952) as

extended by Merton (1969 and 1911). Merton has shown that when asset prices

follow a Geometric Browr-xian Motion in continuous time and portfolios can be con—

tinuously revised, then as in the original Markowitz model, only the means,

variances and covariances of the joint distribution of returns need to be con-

sidered in the portfolio selection process.

              In   more formal terms we assume that the real return dynamics on all n
assets are described by stochastic differential equations of the form:
                    dQ
                     Q.
                           =   R.dt + a.dz ii
where R. is the mean                                                                     2
                                    real rate of return per unit time on asset i   and       the
variance      per unit time. For notational convenience we will let R represent the

n—vector of means and 1               the   nxn covariance matrix, whose diagonal elements are

the variances             and whose off—diagonal elements are the cowariances

              Investors are assumed to have homogeneous expectations about the values

of    these                                        all n assets are continuously
              parameters. Furthermore, we assume that

and costlessJ,y traded and that there are no taxes.3
              The change in the individual's real wealth in any instant is given by:
                               11                      n
(i)                 dW = WSw•R•dt           —   Cdt + WEw,a•dz
                               111                    111 1
where W is real wealth, C is the rate of consumption, and w• is the proportion
of his real wealth invested in asset i.
                                                    —5—




           The   individual's optirial consumption and portfolio rules are derived by
finding:

                                  —p
(2)               1uax1 E0J e          U(C)dt
                  n,,Wj                  U




where E is the expectation operator, p is the rate of time preference, u(c)

the utility from consumption at time t, and H is the end of the investor's

planning horizon.

           The individual's derived utility of wealth function is defined as;


(3)              J(W) =     max
                                  Et


           J is interpreted as the discounted expected value of lifetime utility,

tonditional upon the investor's following the rules for optimal consumption and

portfolio behavior. This value can be computed as a function of current wealth.

The specific utility function with which we have chosen to work is the well—

known constant relative risk aversion form:


                              I

                 u(c)   =                    for   y C 1 and I   0


                             logC            fory=0
with 6 E 1 — y representing Pratt's measure of relative risk aversion. This

functional form has several desirable properties for our purposes. First, the

investor' s degree of relative risk aversion is independent of his wealth, which

in turn inlies that the optinal portfolio proportions are also independent of

wealth. Secondly, actually solving the problem in (2) allows us to find      an
explicit   solution for the derived utility of wealth function (Merton 1971),

which takes the relatively simple form:

           The degree of relative risk aversion plays an important   role in the

specific   numerical results which follow, so we interpret this parameter by   means

of a simple example. Suppose an individual faces a situation in which there is
a .5 probability of losing a proportion x of his current wealth and a .5 proba-
bility of gaining the same proportion. What proportion of current wealth would
the individual be willing to pay a an insurance premium in order to eliminate
this risk?5
           Table 1 displays the value of this insurance premium for various values
of x and 6. The second row, for example, shows that for a risk which involves a
gain or loss of 10% of current wealth an investor with a coefficient of relative

risk    aversion of 1 would only pay one half of one per cent of his wealth (or 5%
of    the magnitude of' the possible loss) to insure against it, while an investor
with a 6 of 10 would pay b.142% of his wealth (which is fully 14b.2% of the nugni—
tude of the possible loss). If the investor with a 6 of 10 faces a risky
prospect    involving a possible gain or loss of 50%        of his wealth, he would     be

willing to pay 92% of the possible loss to avoid the risk.




       B. Optimal Portfolio Proportions and Equilibrium Risk Premia

           The   vector of optimal portfolio weights derived from the optimization
model described above is given by;


(6)              w*
                           l1(R —-      j)    +



Note that these weights are independent of the investor's rate of
                                                                  tine pre-

ference and his investment horizon. Merton (1912) has shown that
                                                                           4-
                                                                                is   the mean
                                                                    —l
rate of return on the minimum variance portfolio and that                is the vector of

portfolio weights of the n assets in the minimum variance portfolio.             Denoting
these by Ri and WI, respectively, we can rewrite equation (6) as:

                   *   1    —l
(6')              w
                       6
                           U (R —   B
                                        nan
                                              i) +   w
                                                      nan

           The demand for any individual asset can thus be decomposed into two

parts represented by the two terms on the right hand side of equation (7):
                                                —8—

                          ii —R•
                               nan.1                  i,min

where   v•, is the th element of       the inverse of the covariance matrix. The
first of these two parts is a "speculative demand" for asset i, which depends
inversely on the investor's degree of risk aversion and directly on a weighted
sum of the risk prenia on the n assets. The second coxnponent is a "hedging
demand" for asset i which is that asset's weight in the minilmlm_variance
portfolio. 6
           Under our assuniption of homogeneous expectations the equilibriwn risk
preinia on the n assets are found by aggregating the individual demands for each
asset (equation 6') and setting them equal to the supplies. The resulting
equilibrium    yield relationships can be expressed in vector form as:

                              —             2

                                  M         nan 1)


where 6 is a harmonic nan of the individual investors'              asures   of risk aver-

sion weighted by their shares of total wealth,                is the vector of net supplies

of the n assets each expressed as a proportion of the total value of all assets,

and a2 is the variance of the miniraim variance portfolio.
          The portfolio whose weights are given by              has co to be known in the
literature on asset pricing as the "market" portfolio, and we            will   adopt that
same   terminolor here. Equation (8) implies          that:

where a    is the covariance between the real rate of return on asset i and the
rate of return on the market portfolio.
         This relationship holds for any individual asset and for any portfolio
of assets. Thus for the market portfolio we get:

(10)           R—       B           =   Z(2 — 2
               M            man           M       nan

It is interesting to compare this with the traditional form of the Capital Asset
Pricing Model which assumes the existence of a riskless asset. In that special
case B.        sLIiy the riskless rate and a2 mm is zero.
          By substituting the equilibrium values of B. —         R   from equation (8)

into equation (61), we get for investor k;



(11)          wk —v         6

This implies that in equilibrium every investor will hold some combination of
the market and the minimum variance portfolios. If the investor is rmz're risk
averse than the average he will divide his portfolio into positive positions in
both the market portfolio and the mininum variance portfolio, with a higher
proportion in the latter the greater his degree of risk aversion. If he is
less risk averse than the average he will sell the mininum variance portfolio
short in order to invest more than 100 percent of his funds in the market port-
folio.

       c. The Welfare Loss from Incomplete Diversification

             Suppose the invesbor faces an investment opportunity set
                                                                               consisti of
 less than the full set of n assets. How much additional
                                                                      current wealth would he
 have to be given in order to make him as well off as he was with the fall set of

 n assets?

          Let        n) be the lifetime utility of an investor who chooses             from
among n assets, and let (w n — in) be the lifetime utility of an investor

choosing from among a restricted set of assets. Let W represent the investor's

actual Level of current wealth and W the level at which his welfare would be the

same under the restricted opportunity set. W is defined by:


                 n) = J(w j n - m)


          Thus W —   W   is the extra wealth necessary to compensate the investor for

having a restricted opportunity set and is greater than or equal to zero. From

equation (4) we get:



                                                                           6
                                        —_YV)
(12)             Q=w[ i±-e              6              (p—yv)
                                                                          yr
                               (p —   iv)                       —   IV\

where v is calculated according to equation (5) and corresponds to the

restricted opportunity set.1

         Equation (12) implies that the magnitude of the welfare loss will in

general depend on the investorts risk aversion, 6, rate of time preference, P,

and investment horizon, H. Since W is proportional to 4! a convenient measure of

this loss, which is independent of the investor's wealth level, is 1..
                                                                                  1,    the

loss per dollar of current wealth. Since W>W, this number is always greater

than or equal to zero.

            Of course,       certain restrictions on the investment opportunity set need
not     decrease investor welfare. We know from equation (ii) that even if the

investor had only two mutual funds to choose from, there would be no loss in

welfare, provided they were the market portfolio and the rainimunt               variance   port-
folio. trton (1972) has shown that any two portfolios along the mean—variance

portfolio frontier would serve as well. But, in general, restricting the number
of assets in the opportunity set does lead to a loss in investor welfare.


        D. The Shadow RLskless Hate and the Gain from Introducing a Riskiess Asset
            We define the shadow riskless real rate of interest as that rate                at
which an investor would have no change in welfare if                 his opportunity set were

expanded    to include a riskless asset. When the investment opportunity set
includes    a riskiess asset, Merton (1971)               shows that the lifetime utility of
wealth    function is the same as (14),              except that V is replaced by A, where:


                                                  —1
                               (R —R1i)'               (B—ni)
(13)
                                                26


            We   find the expression for the shadow riskless rate by setting U equal
to   A, and solving for              This gives:


(11e)                  = B      —   'Sc2
                   F     mtn               mm


This implies that a risk averse investor will always have a shadow riskiess real

rate which is less than the mean real return on the minimum variance portfolio.

The return differential is equal to his degree of relative risk aversion times

the variance of the minintun variance                portfolio.

                 If there is a zero net supply of this riskless asset in the econontr,
the equilibrium value of            will just be B. — ci21. Therefore, by assump-
tion, an investor with         average risk aversion will not gain from the introduction
of      a market for index bonds. For an investor whose risk aversion is different

from the average there will be a welfare gain, ignoring the costs of

establishing and operating such a market. We measure this gain analogously to

the way we measured the welfare cost of incomplete diversification in the pre-

vious section.

                 As before, let W be the investor's actual level of wealth and W the

level at which his welfare would be the same under an opportunity set expanded

to      include a riskless asset offering a real rate of          —         Since   in

this         case W<W, we take as our measure of the welfare gain from indexation
        Tn
1   —         or the amount the investor would be willing to give up per dollar of
current        wealth for the opportunity to trade index bonds.

III. The Data and }rameter Estimates
            In   this section we will describe our data and how we used them   to   esti-

mate the parameters needed in evaluating the welfare loss from restricting an

investor's opportunity set and the gain from introducing a real riskless asset.

It must be borne in mind that we were not trying to empirically test the model

of capital market equilibrium presented in section II but rather to derive its

implications for the specific questions being addressed in this paper. It was

therefore important to maintain consistency between the underlying theoretical

model and the parameter estimates derived from the historical data, even if that

meant ignoring some of the descriptive statistics yielded by those data.

           Our raw data were monthly real rates of return on stocks, one—month

U.S. Government Treasury Bills, and eight different U.S. bond portfolios. We

used monthly data     in order to best approximate the continuous trading assumption
of    Merton's model, and because one month is the shortest interval for which

information about the rate of inflation is available. The measure of the price

level that we used in computing real rates of return was the Bureau of labor

Statistics' Consumer Price Index, excluding the cost—of—shelter component. We

excluded the cost of shelter component because it gives rise to well—known

distortions in the measured rate of inflation.

           The bill data are from Ibbotson and Sinquefield (1982), while the bond

data are from the U.S. Government Bond File of the Center for Research in

Security Prices (CRSP) at the University of'     Chicago.   The stock data are from
the   CRSP monthly NYSE file. We divided the bonds into eight different port-
folios based on duration. We felt that duration was superior to maturity as a
                                                     —1



criterion for grouping the bonds since it takes into account a bond's coupon as
well as its maturity.8 The durations of the bond portfolios range from one to
eight years.
             Table   2 presents the means, variances and correlation coefficients of

the monthly real rates of return on the ten asset categories for three sub—

periods     between January 1953 and December 1981. The first is the twelve years
from January 1953 to December 19614, a period of relative price stability; the
second      is the eight years from 1965 to 1972, a period of moderate inflation; and

the third is the nine years from 1973 to 1981, a period of relatively rapid

inflation.

             The measure of the real rate of return used in all cases was      the
natural logarithm of the monthly real wealth relatives Q.(t)/Qjt —           i).     On the

assumption that these returns follow a geometric          Brownian motion in continuous
t   line:




                  dQ.         =   R.dt   +   a.dz.

the log of the wealth relative over a discrete time interval is normally distri-

buted with mean          and variance a2 where

                                   2
                                  a.
                     =   R.
                              —4
The means reported in 'lb1e 2 were converted to annual rates by multiplying

them by 12 and the standard deviations by multiplying them by /T.           This
makes them comparable to the means and standard deviations one would obtain

using a one year holding period.

                  one would obtain using a one year holding period.

            A most striking aspect of these descriptive statistics can be seen in

part C of the table: all assets have negative mean returns over the last sub—

period.     This presents a dilemma for anyone requiring estiimtes of the risk
premia called for in models of capital market equilibrium, since their recent
historical pattern is grossly inconsistent with the pattern implied by the
variance—covariance matrix estimated from the same data.

            As Merton (1980) has shown, in order to get a reliable estimate of the

mean of a continuous time stochastic process, it is necessary to observe the

process over a long span of time.    Variances   and covariances, however, can be

measured fairly accurately over much   shorter observation periods. We therefore
chose   to ignore the historical means reported in Table 2, while using the esti-

mated covariance matrix.

          Thestandard deviations of all ten assets reported in Table 2 increased
significantly over the three periods. Since we were interested in computing
welfare losses and gains for investors in today's U.S. capital markets, we used

in our calculations the variances and correlation coefficients estimated for the

most recent period, 1913—1981.

          The standard deviations for this last subperiod fall into a clear pat-

tern. The lowest is for bills, .0126, which is well below that on 1 year bonds,

the next lowest reported in the table. The standard deviation on bonds rises

continuously    with duration, reaching a maxinnm   of .1095 on duration   8.   Stocks
have a standard deviation of .1735, which is 1.6 times that of duration 8 bonds
and about       times that of bills. In the previous two subperiods, while all the

standard deviations are lover than in the 1973—1981 subperiod, they fall into

approximately the same pattern of relative magnitudes.
                                         —16—



           Turning to the matrix of correlation coefficients, we see that in the

last subperiod all of the correlations are positive. Stocks had correlations

ranging from .20 (with bills) to .33 (with duration 8 bonds), and they do not

rise uniformly with the duration of the bonds. The pattern for bonds and bills

isthat correlations are highest among bonds of adjacent durations and fall off
more or less uniformly as one moves to more distant durations. In the 1965—1972
subperiod the pattern of correlations is quite similar to 1973—1981 for all
assets, but in the non—inflationary 1953—1965 subperiod the correlations    among
bills   and bonds follow the same pattern, while the real returns on stocks appear

to be essentially uncorrelated with the real returns on bills and bonds.

           In addition to the variance—covariance matrix, the next input we need

for equation (8) in order to generate numerical results is the vector of weights

for the market portfolio. Here we face some problems of both a theoretical and

an   empirical sort.
           At the theoretical level, one issue is whether to treat U.S. govern-
ment bonds as net wealth. There is considerable controversy among monetary

theorists on this issue and a substantial literature on it exists.9     We decided

to treat U.S. government debt as net wealth of the private sector.

          We also ignore the default risk premium on corporate bonds by lumping

them together with Treasury bonds. This amounts to assuming that they have the

same variarice—covariance structure.

          Another   problem is our exclusion of some important categories of assets
in our computation of the xrket portfolio. ttst notable among these is resi-
dential real estate, consumer durables, human capital and social security
wealth)° While we do not include these in the present paper, our plan for
                                         —17—




future extensions of this research is to seek appropriate data on these other
asset classes and redo our calculations to include them.
         There remains the empirical problem of determining the relative weights
of those assets which we do include in the market portfolio in the present
study.    The ratio of the market value of corporate equity to the book value of

total government debt was approximately 1.5 in 1980.          Thus, 60% was the   equity
weight    in the market portfolio. The relative supplies of government debt by
duration were approxbnated froai a table in the Treasury Bulletin which breaks
down the quantities of government debt by maturity: issues maturing in less than
one year, in one to five years, and so forth. We arbitrarily spread the weights
evenly anong the years within each of these groupings.
           This procedure   obviously omits corporate debt. However, using

Flow—of—Funds data we conuted the percentage of equity by treating both cor-

porate equity and the net worth of unincorporated businesses as equity. Debt

then consisted of federal, corporate and unincorporated business credit market

liabilities. This procedure also yielded a 60%       equity   to wealth ratio. By

lumping corporate debt together with U.S. government debt we are ignoring any
default   risk prenila.

         The foregoing ignores financial intermediaries, in effect supposing
that households hold the securities of non—financial businesses and the govern-
ment directly. A different procedure would be to net out securities held by
intermediaries,   and consider the public's holding of bank liabilities as debt.

(Deposits could be treated as treasury bills,      for example.) We plan to experi-
ment with   this alternative in future research.
                                                —18—




            The ultimate set of weights we used for the market
                                                                         portfolio was;

            Finally, in order to determine the equilibrium risk premia we need to

set a value for 6, the econonr.ç—wide average degree of relative risk aversion.

In a recent paper Grossman and Shiner (1981) concluded that a value of 4 is

most consistent with the observed movements of the value of the stock market

over the past ninety years. Friend and Blume (1975) estimated it to be 2, while

Friend and Flasbrouck (1982) found 6 to be sore appropriate. As we show below, a

value   of 14 produces an imputed risk premium on stocks which is in line with
direct time series estimates of this premium obtained by other researchers using
a variety of estimation techniques. We therefore choose 14 as our value for 6 in
the calculation of the equilibrium risk premia which we use in the rerriainder of
the paper. Tb a large extent the particular value of           6 is unimportant, since

the deviation of            from   6, and not the level, is what natters most for our
re salts.

                 2. The variances and covariances reported above were computed from
                     the distribution of the natural logs of the monthly real wealth
                      relatives. They were annualized by multiplying them by 12.

           The   table shows that the real risk premium on the market portfolio is
approximately 5% per year, which is almost four times its variance of 1.26% per
year.    Since we have set Z at      ,   the risk premium on the market portfolio would
be exactly 4 times its variance if the variance of the minimum variance port-
folio were zero rather than .Olhh% per year. The risk premium on bills is only
9 basis points, and the variance is only slightly higher than the minimum,
which   is not surprising since as we shall see in the next section the minimum

variance portfolio is essentially bills.

           With the sole exception of duration 5, the risk preinia on bonds rise

uniformly with    duration reaching a maximum       of 2.21% per year.   Finally, the risk
premium on   stocks is 7.60%   per   year or approximately 1.5 times the risk premium

on   the market portfolio. Since the beta of stocks is approximately 1.5, this
result should not be surprising to readers familiar with the Capital Asset
Pricing tbdel.'1      It is also in line with the long run time series estimates

derived by Ibbotson and Sinquefield (1982) and Merton (1980).

IV. The Welfare Loss     from Incomplete    Diversification

           In this section we address the question of how much      welfare   an investor

loses   by having his choice of assets limited. The main conclusion of the
theoretical discussion in part II was that even if an investor's opportunity set
is limited to only two assets, there will be no loss in welfare provided that
these two assets are the market portfolio and the minimum variance portfolio (or
arw other set of two frontier portfolios). But we are interested in the actual
menu of asset choices offered in practice by many employer—sponsored tax—
sheltered savings plans in the U.S. •        plans usual1- offer participants a
                                            These

choice of two or three funds: a stock fund, an intennediate-term fixed—interest
bond fund, and sometimes as a third option a monr riarket fund.
           Table 14 presents    the risk premia, variances and asset compositions of
the optimal portfolios chosen from the full set of ten assets for investors with
coefficients of   relative      risk aversion ranging from 2 to 10. Figure 1, which is
the   familiar efficient portfolio frontier, displays graphically the mean—

variance   combinations tabulated in the second and third columns of Table 1.
           The middle row of Table 14 corresponds to the market portfolio and the
last row to the minimum variance portfolio, which consists essentially of bills,
hedged with small offsetting short and long positions in bonds of the various
durations. ¶Th.ble 14   shows   that a very risk averse investor, with a coefficient
of risk aversion of 6,    would    hold 1t0% of his portfolio in stocks, Iio% in bills
and the remaining 20% in bonds of various durations. He would thereby attain a
risk premium of about 3.3% per year with a variance of .51% per year. Even an
extremely risk averse investor, one whose iS value is 10, would still invest
roughly 214 percent of his funds in stocks, 61 percent in bills and the remainder

in bonds of various durations, in order to attain a mean risk premium of 1.95%
per year with a variance of only .21% per year.
         Note that for coefficients of relative risk aversion smaller than the
econon—wide average of'   4,   the
                              investor takes larger short positions in bills
and long positions in stocks and bonds ofmost durations. In the first row, for
example, we see that an investor with a risk aversion coefficient of 2 nearly
doubles the mean risk premium on his portfolio relative to the average investor,
but also increases the variance by a factor of four.
         Short—selling treasury bills is difficult in practice. This difficulty

can be overcome in two ways. First, a large investment house or pension fund

could allow its less risk—averse investors to short—sell to the more risk—averse

investors,   as a purely internal transaction. Second, and more likely, a less
risk—averse   investor can simply take a long position in stock market futures as

a way to hold a levered position in stocks.

         Table 5 and Figure 2 present our estimates of the welfare loss to an

investor from having his opportunity set restricted to various subsets of the

ten asset classes. The numbers in this table represent the amount of money the

investor would need to be given per $10,000 of his current wealth to make him as

well off with the restricted choice set as he would be with the full set of ten

assets. In order to do these calculations we had to determine the mean rates of

return themselves, not Just the risk premia. We did this by assuming that the

mean on bills is zero and calibrating all other rates accordingly. This assump-

tion was based on the actual mean real return on bills observed over the past 30

years.

             We also had to assume a rate of time preference and a specific planning

horizon. We arbitrarily set these at 14% per year            and   infinity, respectively,

but did a sensittvity analysis which we report below in Table 6.                It should be

noted that the infinite horizon assumption is really meant to represent the case

where tine of death is uncertain and the parameter p in (2) incorporates the

rate of nortality as in Merton (1911). Note also that Table 5 shows the welfare

loss from restricting the investor's portfolio choice forever, not just for a

limited   period.
             Table 5   and                   the investor is restricted to only
                             Figure 2 show that   when

two assets, the welfare impact of the restriction can be quite sensitive to his

coefficient of risk aversion, If the two assets are stocks and bonds of duration
2 years (curve 1), we see that the welfare loss is small for an investor with a
risk aversion coefficient equal to the average, 14, but increases sharply on
either side of this       value. If, on   the other      hand, the two   assets are stocks and

bonds   of   duration 1 year (curve 2), then the welfare loss is greatest for the

least risk averse investor, but is not extreri for any investor. Investors with
coefficients of risk aversion equal to 3 or 14 are better off with stocks and
bonds of duration 2 years, whereas investors who are either more or less risk
averse   than that     would prefer stocks and bonds of duration 1 year.

             A coqarison of the first two columns in Table 5 reveals that stocks
and bonds of duration one year are preferable to stocks and bills for all
investors except those with risk aversion of 2. Mving across Table 5 we see
that as the duration of the bond fund increases the welfare loss becomes more
sensitive to the coefficient of risk aversion. Thus for bonds of duration 14
years the smallest welfare loss relative to the full 10 asset opportunity set

occurs at a coefficient of risk aversion of 3,            rising   quite sharply   on   either

side   of that value and becoming particularly severe for very risk averse

investors.

          The last column in Ible 5 shows that when the choice set is expanded

from two to three assets, stocks, bills and bonds of duration two years, the

magnitude of the welfare loss rails dramatically for all investors, regardless

of their degree of risk aversion. Itving these three assets to choose from is

thus almost as good as having all ten.

          The effects of changing our assumptions about the rate of time pre—

ference and the horizon are shown in Table 6. The magnitude of the welfare loss

from restricting the choice set to stocks and bills is greater the lower the

rate of time   preference   and the longer the horizon.

          These   numerical results suggest that if an employer—sponsored savings
plan   is going to restrict its participants to a choice of only two funds, then

since the sponsor does not know the exact degree of risk aversion of the patici—

pants, it would make sense to let the two     funds   be stocks and bonds of duration

1   or 2 years. If, however, the sponsor is willing to expand the number of funds
to three, then stocks, bills and bonds of duration two years will eliminate
alw,st all of the welfare loss relative to the full ten asset opportunity set.
          The applicability of our analysis to employer—sponsored tax—deferred
savings plans is limited by two factors; assets held outside the plan, and
taxes. Without taxes it is trivially obvious that the omission of bills from a
savings plan is of no consequence if investors can hold a money market fund on

their   own account. When there are tax advantages to investing in a savings

plan, however, on the margin the investor prefers to hold assets inside the

plan. If the plan fails to offer a full menu of assets, the investor will

suffer a welfare loss. Our numerical calculations can be viewed as applying to
a world in which all assets are invested in a tax—deferred savings plan with a
restricted      menu of assets. In general, however, our numerical calculations

still provide an upper bound on the possible welfare loss, for the following

reason: if the investor could in principle invest all wealth in the plan, and

chooses not to do so, in order to diversify, then the welfare loss must be less

than for an investor who is (as in our      calculations)   constrained to hold only

those assets offered by the plan.

           In   practice, of course, additional complications reduce the importance
of tax—deferred savings plans. The IRS imposes a limit on the contributions to
these plans, and frequently there are penalties or delays associated with the
Dreunture   withdrawal of funds. These considerations will reduce the percentage
of   an investor's wealth s.thich is held in such savings plans. Therefore the

failure of the plan to offer certain assets is less important, since freely

chosen assets held outside the plan will undo the effect of restrictions imposed

within the plan. Our      numerical   estimates again provide an upper bound on the

welfare   loss.

V. Shadow Riskiess Rates and the Welfare Gain from Introduction of a Riskless

      Real Asset

            In part II we defined the shadow riskless rate of interest as that rate

at which an investor would have a zero gain in welfare from havIng his choice

set    expanded to include an asset which was riskless in real terms. Equation
(12) showed that this rate is below the mean real rate of return on the minimum
variance portfolio by an amount equal to the investor's degree of relative risk
aversion tints the variance of the minimum variance portfolio. Given that our
estinnte of this variance is a mere .Oiblt%         per   year, it   follows   that even a very
risk averse   investor (6 = 6) would be willing to give up less than 9 basis

points.

           Since   the avera€e degree of risk aversion is b, if a market for
riskless real bonds could be established costlessly, the market clearing real
interest rate would be about 6 basis points below the mean rate on the mininum
variance   portfolio.    Th,ble 7   shows what the welfare gain would be to investors
with   varying degrees of risk aversion.

           The magnitude of the welfare gain to investors does not appear to be

large. The numbers in the first column of Thble 7 show the results obtained

using the actual covariance matrix estimated for the 1913—1981 subperiod. The

second    column shows the results of an experiment in which we made all nominal
debt securities twice as risky by doubling their variances and covariances,
leaving the variance of stocks unchanged. While the effect is to approximately
double the welfare gain to investors at any degree of risk aversion, the magni-
tude of the gain still appears small.

        These results suggest one possible reason for the nonexistence of index

bonds in the U.S. capital market. Since there would probably be some costs

associated with   creating   a new market for such bonds, the benefits would have to

exceed those costs. Given the assumptions of our model, in particular the

assumption of homogeneous expectations, the benefit from trading in index bonds

would have to arise from differences in the degree of risk aversion among

investors. If as Table 7 suggests, the welfare gain does not appear to be large

over a fairly broad range of risk aversion coefficients, then one should not be

surprised at the failure of a market for index bonds to appear.

         One   should bear in mind that Table 7 is derived assuming a zero net
aggregate supply of index bonds. Thus it does not answer the question of
whether the welfare gain from indexing government debt would be significant.

VI. Summary and Discussion of Findings

          We undertook this research with two main policy questions in mind: Ci)

Is   there a significant welfare loss stemming from the practice on the part of

many employer—sponsored savings plans of restricting a participant's choice of

investments to two or three asset classes?        (2) What is the potential welfare

gain from the introduction of trading in privately issued index bonds? In this

section we summarize and discuss the implications of our findings for each.

           With regard to the first of these, we have shown that there is no

necessary   loss of welfare from   restricting   an investor' s choice set to   only two

funds,   provided these two are properly chosen. If they are the market portfolio
and the xniniraim variance portfolio, then there will be no loss at all. In prac-
tice, however, many plans offer a diversified common stock fund and an
interdiate—ten fixed—interest bond fund as the only two assets, and in such
cases there can be a substantial welfare loss to participants whose degree of
risk   aversion differs appreciably from the average. ?tst of this loss can be

eliminated for risk averse participants by introducing as a third option a money

market fund.

            With regard to the second question, our results indicate that the

potential welfare gain from the introduction of index bonds in the current U.S.

capital market is probably not large enough to justify the costs of innovation.

The    major reason for the small gain we calculate is the fact that one month
bills with their small variance of real returns are an effective substitute for
 index bonds.
            There are some important factors bearing on these two policy questions,
 which we either excluded or ignored in our analysis, and we need to at least
                                            —28—



consider their potential impact on our conclusions. The first is the fact that

we limited ourselves to onJj a subset of the assets which individuals in the

U.S. hold in their portfolios. Specifically, we excluded residential real

estate, consumer durables, and nontradeable assets like human capital and social

security wealth.

           UndoubtedJj   the inclusion of   these other assets would affect the nagni—

tude of the welfare effects we calculated. Thus the welfare loss to an indivi-

dual whose employer—sponsored savings plan offers only a stock fund and a bond

fund would almost surely be smaller. The loss would appear smaller still, were

we to take into account the fact that individuals have access to other assets

outside of the plan. Nonetheless, it is probably still true to say that not

having a money market option lowers the welfare of investors who are more risk

averse than the average. Similarly, the swall welfare gain from index bonds,

which   we calculated, would probably become even smaller, in the context of the
broader spectrum of assets, especially when one considers that Social Security
is indexed.
           Our agenda for future research starts with a more detailed quantitative
analysis   of the impact of these additional assets.

        Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association and offered by mary private
        educational institutions in the U.S. Under this plan the participant can
        choose between a common stock fund, the College Retirement Equities Fund
        (CREF), and a second fund which is essentially a portfolio of intermediate
        term nominal bonds.

        there is a considerable literature on the effect of relaxing each of them.
        The only one which we think would materially affect the main results in
        this paper is the no taxes assumption. We discuss its likely effects in
        section IY, p. 23.

8.      Duration, as defined by Macaulay (1938) is a weighted average of the years
        to naturity of each of the cash flows from a security. The weights are
        the present value of each year's cash flow as a proportion of the total
        present value of the security. Duration equals final maturity only in the
        case of pure discount bonds. For coupon bonds and mortgages, duration is
        always less than maturity. The difference between maturity and duration
        for ordinary coupon bonds and mortgages is greater the longer the final
        maturity and the higher the level of interest rates. In our sample of
        bonds this difference rose steadily over the 1953—1981 period due to the
        rising trend in interest rates. The most pronounced differences were in
        the 8 year duration category. In 1953 the average maturity of the bonds
        in our 8 year duration portfolio was just under 9 years whereas in 1981
        the average maturity of the 8 year duration portfolio was 23 years. This
        variation over the last 30 years calls into question the appropriateness
        of a bond return series with a constant maturity of 20 years, such as the
        one tabulated by Ibbotson and Sinquefield (1982).

10.   Including residential real estate would raise another theoretical issue.
      Individual holdings of residential real estate serve both to diversify the
      portfolio and to hedge against changes in the relative price of housing
      services. This hedging denand is ignored in our model and including it
      would substantially increase the difficulty of solving for the J function.
11.   Equation (9)   in our model implies that:

                                  2
                         (a.

                          M      win

      Since   a2 is very small relative to the covariance of stocks with the
      market and to the variance of the market, we get:
