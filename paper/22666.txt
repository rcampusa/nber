                                         ABSTRACT

We estimate the effect of physician-patient relationships on clinical decisions in a setting where
the treating physician is as good as randomly assigned. OBs are 25% (4 percentage points) more
likely to perform a C-section when delivering patients with whom they have a pre-existing
clinical relationship (their “own patients”) than when delivering patients with whom they had no
prior relationship. OBs’ decisions are consistent with receiving greater disutility from their own
patients’ difficult labors. After a string of difficult labors, OBs are more likely to perform C-
sections on their own patients, and this can explain the entire own patient effect.

       Every day physicians face complex and subjective treatment decisions. The influ-
ences of financial incentives, personal convenience and malpractice concerns on their deci-
sions are well documented. Less studied, but potentially as important in clinical decision-
making, is the effect of physicians’ relationships with their patients. Physicians do not
make arm’s length decisions for faceless files. They often make clinical recommendations
for, perform procedures on, and see the resulting outcomes for patients over the course of
repeated interactions. However, little is known about how these physician-patient relation-
ships affect physicians’ medical decisions. Do they lead to more intensive treatment? Do
they affect patient health?
   These phenomena have broad implications for understanding the effect of familiarity
in any transaction that depends on human interaction. In health care they are critical for
assessing the implications of recent widespread organizational changes in health care de-
livery. Over the last two decades, the United States has shifted to more finely specialized
and fragmented care delivery models. Two key questions are how the rearrangement of
physician-patient relationships affects the delivery of care, and the mechanisms through
which it operates. A key challenge in isolating the direct effect of physician-patient rela-
tionships on physicians’ decision-making is that settings in which random assignment of
providers is possible often do not involve significant pre-existing relationships (e.g. emer-
gency departments). To our knowledge, this is the first paper to quantify the direct effect
of the physician-patient relationship on practice style and treatment decisions.
   One such organizational change in health delivery is the rapid rise of hospitalists, physi-
cians who provide inpatient care in place of the patient’s personal physician. Hospitalists
were virtually nonexistent in 1996, but with 44,000 hospitalists as of 2014, the specialty
is now larger than cardiology (Clark 2014). As of 2010, 38% of hospitals also reported
employing obstetric hospitalists (“laborists”), obstetricians who handle labor and delivery
but who do not provide prenatal care (Srinivas et al. 2012). Obstetrics is particularly well-
                                                                                                3


suited to studying physician-patient relationships. Prenatal care includes a standard set of
10-12 prenatal appointments over the course of the pregnancy. This concentrated set of
interactions creates the opportunity for obstetricians (OBs) to establish relationships with
their patients. As a result (and in contrast to other clinical settings), strong physician-patient
relationships are less likely to be concentrated among the least healthy patients or among
those with a high affinity for medical care. Childbirth is also an important component of
health care in its own right. It is the leading reason for hospitalization in the United States,
and over $12 billion is spent on childbirth each year (Moore, Witt, and Elixhauser 2014).
   The first contribution of this paper is to isolate the effect of the physician-patient re-
lationship on physicians’ treatment decisions and patient health by exploiting the unique
organizational features of labor and delivery. We use the rotating call schedule of three
OB groups at a leading academic medical center. The delivering OB for a patient in these
practices is the physician who is on call when the patient is ready to deliver. Since the
exact timing of the onset of labor is a random event in unscheduled deliveries, patients who
go into labor spontaneously are effectively randomly assigned to their prenatal provider
or another OB in the group. OBs are therefore treating, on the same day and in the same
hospital, patients with whom they have a longstanding relationship and patients with whom
they have very little, if any, familiarity. Moreover, the patients with whom they have a long-
standing relationship differ only in that respect, because they are randomly assigned. This
setting thus provides a unique opportunity to study a population with both well-established
physician-patient relationships and random assignment of providers. This enables us to
isolate the effect of the pre-existing physician-patient relationship and abstract away from
differences in practice style (Epstein and Nicholson 2009) or skill (Currie and MacLeod
2013).
   When OBs deliver patients for whom they were also the prenatal provider, they are 25%
more likely to perform a C-section (4 percentage points). This effect is large and robust.
                                                                                                 4


It represents the total effect of the reorganization of the physician-patient relationship on
clinical decisions. The treatment effect also varies with the OB’s degree of familiarity with
the patient, suggesting familiarity is driving the results.
    We further investigate the mechanism behind this effect. OB decisions may differ with
familiarity for a wide variety of reasons that fall into the general categories of (i) agency
problems between physician and patient, (ii) OB reputation concerns, (iii) rational decision-
making under less uncertainty with familiar patients, and (iv) behavioral biases. Although
it is naturally difficult to isolate each of these mechanisms, we appeal to a source of exoge-
nous variation that is particular to this setting to gain insights. In obstetrics, difficult labors
are random events that are salient to OBs and occur frequently enough to be observed in the
data. We use recent laceration rates among the OB’s patients delivered by other OBs. This
measure of the OB’s recent experience with difficult labors is plausibly unrelated to the
OB’s current patient’s risk. Under this exclusion restriction we are able to examine the role
of behavioral biases in our main effect. In particular, we ask whether OBs are subject to
forecast error or psychic costs that are greater with patients with whom they have become
familiar.
    We present a simple model of the potential role of physician-patient relationships in
treatment decisions. The model illustrates the roles of “objective” channels, such as finan-
cial considerations and patient health, and “empathetic” channels. The OB’s utility is a
function of profits, patient health, and their private cost of observing mothers’ complica-
tions and discomfort. Specifically, OBs experience an empathetic utility penalty above the
effect on patient health when they see their patients experience difficult vaginal deliveries
and associated complications. This penalty is stronger for more familiar patients. Consis-
tent with our findings, the model predicts OBs will perform more C-sections on patients
they know, and this effect will be increasing in the OB’s familiarity with the patient. The
model also predicts the effect will be larger when vaginal birth’s complications and dis-
                                                                                             5


comfort are more likely or more salient. We use the OB’s patients’ recent experiences in
labor to isolate variation in the OB’s perception of or reaction to vaginal birth’s compli-
cations that is unrelated to the current patient’s true clinical risk, her preferences, and any
information the OB may have about her health. The own patient effect is larger among
OBs whose patients have recently experienced a string of difficult labors, consistent with
the empathetic channel playing an important role in treatment decisions.
    Consistent with attempting to minimize the mother’s immediate complications and dis-
comfort, OBs are 25% less likely to employ vacuum extraction or forceps (2.5 percentage
points) on their own patients, procedures that are associated with high rates of maternal
trauma. When OBs deliver their own patients the mothers are significantly less likely to
experience complications of long or difficult labors such as a laceration in need of repair,
fevers, and birth trauma. However, these differences in health appear short-lived, suggest-
ing the complications OBs avoid may not have lasting health impacts. Even in the short-run,
there is no difference in hospital stays after accounting for the longer stay needed to recover
from the extra C-sections. In addition, the infants of OBs’ own patients have comparable
health outcomes to the other infants they deliver. The results, taken together, are consis-
tent with physician-patient relationships affecting clinical decisions through the empathetic
channel. We consider the leading alternative mechanisms through which familiarity might
affect treatment and conclude that these other mechanisms are unlikely to fully explain our
results.
    The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Sections I and II summarize the ex-
isting literature and relevant clinical information on childbirth, respectively. Section III
presents the theoretical framework, while Section IV describes the empirical strategy. Sec-
tion V presents the results, which are discussed in Section VI, and Section VII concludes.

                                  I.   Existing Literature

   Patients express more satisfaction when they are treated by physicians they know and
who are perceived to be empathetic (Mager and Andrykowski 2002). Patients treated by
such physicians may also be more likely to adhere to treatment regimens (Kim, Kaplowitz,
and Johnston 2004) and less likely to sue in the event of adverse outcomes (Levinson et
al. 1997). There is also experimental evidence that patients’ beliefs about a physician’s
expertise are increasing in the number of visits with the physician (Wasson et al. 1984).
Consistent with these stated beliefs and preferences, individuals are willing to pay substan-
tially higher health insurance premiums to continue being treated by providers they know
(Dahl and Forbes 2016).
   Whether and how familiarity causes physicians to make different decisions remain un-
clear. The medical community worries that close prior relationships will affect clinical
judgment. In the extreme, the American Medical Association (AMA) recommends that
physicians refrain from treating close family members, as “the physician’s personal feel-
ings may unduly influence his or her professional medical judgment” (AMA 1993). The
literature on cognitive biases also suggests that relationships could have substantial effects
on clinical judgment if they lead to increased emotional investment. It is well established
that decision-making is affected by being in an emotionally aroused state, often termed
a “hot” or “visceral” state. In such states, decision-makers typically overreact and over-
weight short-run or present gains (see, for example, Loewenstein 2000 and Loewenstein
2005). In the context of labor and delivery this could lead OBs to overweight the risk of
complications or to prioritize the immediate (short run) health of the mother. More broadly,
it has been hypothesized that agents are influenced by “emotional” considerations in a wide
number of settings (Koszegi 2006).
   While there is little direct evidence on the effect of physician-patient relationships on
                                                                                               7


clinical decisions, the strength of physician-patient relationships is one of many factors that
vary with the fragmentation of care. Much of the existing literature on these innovations has
focused on the potential for information loss and duplication of efforts with multiple physi-
cians. Several studies have documented a cross-sectional association between fragmented
care and health utilization and outcomes (Skinner, Staiger, and Fisher 2006; Romano, Se-
gal, and Pollack 2015). Agha, Frandsen, and Rebitzer (2016) find those who move to an
area characterized by higher fragmentation experience significant increases in health care
utilization. Chandra, Wright, and Howell (2012) exploit an intervention that increased care
continuity in a hospitalist group and find it decreased length of stay and hospital charges.
Similarly, two experimental studies find evidence that care continuity increases efficiency
(Wachter et al. 1998; Wasson et al. 1984).
   The implentation of a hospitalist care model also implictly fragments care and limits
the physician-patient relationship. Wachter and Goldman’s (2002) meta-analysis of 19 sin-
gle hospital introductions of hospitalist programs concludes hospitalists improve efficiency
without harming patient satisfaction. Abenhaim et al. (2007) finds that treatment decisions
do not meaningfully vary across patients OBs deliver themselves and the minority of pa-
tients they elect to handoff to a laborist during labor. Other OB laborist studies find a fall in
C-section rates following a hospital’s adoption of a combined laborist-midwife care model,
but cannot separate the effect of the midwife from the laborist (Iriye et al. 2013 and Nijagal
et al. 2015). More broadly, the implementation of a hospitalist model is a large bundled
intervention. These studies conflate the effects of care continuity, specialization, and being
treated by a physician who selects into and is hired as a hospitalist. These confounds could
be large. For example, Meltzer et al. (2002) shows that being treated by a physician who
specializes in inpatient care reduces mortality, length of stay, and costs. Understanding
the mechanisms through which these effects occur is essential for policy design. The es-
timates that follow isolate the effect of the pre-existing physician-patient relationship and
                                                                                                         8


inpatient-outpatient care continuity while holding provider specialization in inpatient care
fixed. In fact, the providers are held constant as are the hospital setting, nurses, the patient
population and the organizational structure of the practice groups. The only factor that
varies is the provider’s pre-existing relationship with the patient, providing direct insight
into the effect of familiarity in the physician-patient relationship.


                             II.   Clinical Background: Childbirth

    OBs have the opportunity to form strong relationships with their patients. Prenatal
care typically begins in the 8-10th week of pregnancy. The recommended schedule of
care is one appointment every four weeks in the first 28 weeks, one appointment every
two to three weeks until 36 weeks, and one appointment per week for the last four weeks
of the pregnancy. This amounts to an average of 12 prenatal visits for an uncomplicated
pregnancy. This concentrated, high volume of visits creates the opportunity to establish a
strong relationship, particularly when compared with other providers who may see a patient
once or twice a year and could take half a dozen years or more to amass a comparable
number of visits.
    This study focuses on decision-making during labor and delivery. The primary treat-
ment decision once labor has begun is the delivery method: vaginal birth or C-section.1
According to the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), vaginal
birth is the preferred method of delivery in uncomplicated, routine labors (ACOG 2014).
Vaginal deliveries avoid major abdominal surgery and the associated maternal mortality
and morbidity (Hall and Bewley 1999; Lydon-Rochelle et al. 2000). Vaginal births also
utilize fewer resources, require shorter hospital stays, have faster recoveries, and avoid the
1. OBs typically schedule C-sections without attempting labor in situations in which laboring is unsafe or
likely to lead to a poor outcome (for example, breech presentation). OBs may also schedule the delivery via
medical induction of labor. This is often used when continuing the pregnancy is unsafe for the mother or
infant, in cases of maternal hypertension or in pregnancies exceeding 41 weeks gestation.
                                                                                             9


adverse effects of uterine scar tissue on future fertility and pregnancies (Ananth, Smulian,
and Vintzileos 1997; Alpay, Saed, and Diamond 2008; Norberg and Pantano 2016).
   However, vaginal delivery is neither safe nor possible for all patients. As labor pro-
gresses the OB must trade off the risks of allowing labor to continue against the risks of
abdominal surgery. Vaginal deliveries have higher incidence of perineal lacerations and
pelvic floor damage, which can lead to sexual dysfunction and incontinence (Fenner et al.
2003; Kammerer-Doak and Rogers 2008). Long or difficult vaginal deliveries carry with
them additional risks for mothers and infants. In these labors there is a risk of physical in-
jury to the infant (broken clavicle or humerus), and allowing vaginal labor to progress when
infants are not tolerating labor well can result in brain damage or infant death (Baskett et
al. 2007). Long labors are also associated with fever and infection for mothers (Allen et al.
2009). Forceps and vacuum extraction can make it possible to avoid a C-section or expedite
the vaginal delivery of the infant in critical situations. However, the OB’s application of
force to extract the infant can result in neonatal birth injury and perineal trauma with rates
as high as 20% (Bailit et al. 2016).


                              III.     Theoretical Framework

   The following stylized model of OB decision-making in childbirth illustrates how objec-
tive and empathetic channels can affect treatment decisions. While empathetic considera-
tions have received less attention in traditional models, there is reason to believe they could
play an important role. We abstract away from a number of potentially relevant issues,
such as OBs’ reputation, or malpractice concerns, which are discussed in Section VII. In
the model, the OB maximizes her utility by choosing the delivery method for each patient
i she treats. Patients differ in how well the OB knows them prior to the birth, Dij ∈ {0, 1},
where Dij = 1 indicates the OB knows patient i and Dij = 0 indicates patient i is un-
                                                                                                               10


known.2 Patients also vary in the clinical risk associated with delivering vaginally, ri ,
which we assume is known to the OB.3
    The OB’s ex ante utility consists of her own private return and patient health (see, for
example, Ellis and McGuire 1986):

                              
                        Vijt = cij π − (1 − cij )Dij S(ri , zjt ) + H(cij , ri ).


Patient health, H, is a function of patient risk and the delivery method: H(cij , ri ) = (1 −
cij )h(ri ). cij is an indicator that the patient had a C-section and h(ri ) is the patient’s health
in a vaginal delivery relative to a C-section, normalized such that patient health in a C-
section is zero. For mothers who are unlikely to experience complications in vaginal birth
(low ri ), health after a vaginal delivery is higher than health after a C-section (h(ri ) > 0),
reflecting the fact that C-sections are major surgery with the associated risks and extended
                                                                                                   ∂h
recovery time. The health of a mother after a vaginal birth is decreasing in ri ,                  ∂ri
                                                                                                         < 0, and
the point in the distribution where h(ri ) = 0 determines the C-section rate that maximizes
patient health.
    The OB’s private return has two components. The first is the OB’s relative profits from
performing a C-section, π.4 The second component and the one of interesst, S(ri , zjt ),
is the OB’s disutility (“psychic cost”) of witnessing the complications and discomfort of
vaginal birth, including perineal lacerations and vaginal trauma, as well as the discomfort
and physical stress of a long second stage of labor. These psychic costs are present when
the OB knows the patient and are over and above any health effects on the patient which
2. For expositional purposes, we assume Dij is binary, but the comparative statics would be unchanged if it
were a continuous variable that depended on relationship strength.
3. In Appendix A we extend the model to allow OBs to have better information about patients they know.
Patient risk, ri , is comprised of two components, ωj and ηj . OBs observe ωj for all patients. They observe ηj
only for the patients they know. The extended model clarifies how our estimation strategy identifies psychic
costs separately from information.
4. π is included because it is a key factor in physician decisions in the literature, but it does not differ across
own and others’ patients in this setting.
                                                                                                             11


enter the OB’s utility through h(ri ). Complications of vaginal delivery may be particularly
salient to the delivering OB because they occur in her presence at the time of treatment.5
S(ri , zjt ) naturally varies with true patient risk in vaginal birth, ri . However, the OB’s
expected psychic costs also varies with factors zjt that are unrelated to the current patient’s
true difficulty of vaginal birth. As such zjt vary across OBs and over time. By definition,
                       ∂S                                ∂S
S(ri , zjt ) > 0 and   ∂ri
                             > 0. We also assume        ∂zjt
                                                               > 0.
    The OB’s resulting maximization problem depends on Dij :

OBs perform C-sections with the following probabilities:

                                        

For unknown patients, the OB performs vaginal deliveries as long as the improvement in
patient health is greater than the foregone profits. For her own patients, the OB compares
the improvement in patient health less her psychic cost, S(ri , zjt ), with profits. Because
Sijt > 0, Pr (cij = 1) is higher when OBs know patients (Dij = 1). OBs are more likely
to perform C-sections on patients they know because these patients’ difficult vaginal births
will have larger psychic costs. That is, ∆ Pr(cij = 1) ≡ Pr(cij = 1|Dij = 1) − Pr(cij =
1|Dij = 0) > 0.
5. Complications of a difficult vaginal delivery are readily apparent during the delivery, and the OB witnesses
the difficulty of the labor, lacerations and vaginal trauma occurring. By comparison, serious complications
of C-sections are rare, and many of them do not become apparent until after the delivery, when the delivering
OB is unlikely to witness them. OBs may also experience disutility from the complications of vaginal deliv-
ery, because a different delivery method decision would have avoided the complication (it may cause feelings
of regret). Regret is likely to be most severe in the extreme case of a difficult and unsuccessful vaginal deliv-
ery. Finally, the longer recovery time associated with a C-section mostly occurs after discharge, decreasing
salience for the OB.
                                                                                                        12


    In addition, the gap between the C-section rate of the OB’s own and others’ patients,
∆ Pr(cij = 1), will be larger when the risks of complications from vaginal birth are higher
or more salient to the OB. This can occur if there is an increase in objective patient risk, ri ,
or due to a change in zjt , which is unrelated to objective risk and therefore patient health.
Separating factors that influence the OB’s psychic cost of vaginal complications into those
that operate through the patient’s health and those that are uncorrelated with the true risk of
vaginal delivery will provide empirical identification as to whether the effect of Dij occurs
through Sijt , as described below.


                                      IV.   Empirical Strategy

IV.A.    The hospital and physician practices

   The clinical setting for this study is a large elite academic medical center in the United
States with a highly ranked obstetrics and gynecology program. The hospital has a 31%
C-section rate, compared with the national rate of 32% in 2014.6 We focus on deliveries to
the three physician groups, herein Groups A, B, and C, for whom we are able to observe
records from outpatient prenatal visits as well as inpatient deliveries. Group A is owned by
the same firm as the hospital, and OBs are salaried. Groups B and C are private practices
and physicians in each group pool revenue.7 Group A is the largest with an average of
7 OBs who perform 851 deliveries per year. Groups B and C are smaller, with 3 OBs
per group and an average of 412 and 301 deliveries per year, respectively. All the groups
only employ “attending physicians” as OBs. They do not utilize any medical residents
or students. The three groups treat patients of average medical risk (none specialize in
“high risk” pregnancies) and have similar practice styles. They choose to induce labor at
6. http://www.cesareanrates.com/2015/02/Massachusettscesareanrates.html, visited on August 26, 2016.
7. Even within groups B and C the finanical incentive to perform a C-section is diffuse and small. Payments
from Blue Cross Blue Shield, a large insurer, to these providers do not vary with the birth method. The
reimbursements from the other insurers are only 5-10% higher for C-sections.
                                                                                          13


nearly identical rates: 35%, 34%, and 34%, respectively. They also perform unscheduled
C-sections at similar rates (16%, 15%, and 16%).
   Patients choose a specific OB in their group to be their prenatal provider. Patients may
choose to see other OBs in the group for prenatal care, but in practice the overwhelming
majority of visits are with their chosen prenatal OB. All three groups employ a shared call
model. One OB is designated as on call during each shift and handles all deliveries to
group patients that take place during the shift. The groups’ offices are not located at the
hospital. Therefore, the on-call OB does not schedule clinic appointments during her call
shift, though she may perform minor gynecological procedures at the hospital during her
call shift. The OBs rigorously follow these rules. We only observe more than one OB
delivering during a shift on extremely busy days when the designated back-up OB needed
to be called in to assist. Groups B and C share call with each other, such that the OB on
call handles deliveries of patients from both B and C during her shift. Only one OB is on
call from the two groups at any given time. Groups B and C do not share an office, and do
not see each other’s patients for prenatal appointments. The payment for the delivery goes
to the prenatal provider’s practice group. In all groups, patients are informed of the shared
call model during their first prenatal visit and the post-natal follow-up visit is scheduled
with the patient’s prenatal OB.


IV.B.   Data and Key Variables

   The data used in this study come from electronic medical records (EMRs) and billing
databases which cover both inpatient and outpatient care for the practice groups. The EMR
provides the date and time of the birth, the delivery method, and information on clini-
cal risk, measures of complications arising during labor and delivery, and infant APGAR
scores. The billing record for the birth includes up to 12 diagnosis and procedure codes for
each mother and infant, providing standardized information on patient risk factors, treat-
                                                                                                          14


 ments, and outcomes. It also includes the Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) as well as the
 admission and discharge date for the mother and the infant. We augment these data with
 patient demographics for mothers and infants, including age, race and ZIP code from the
 patient master record.
     Between 2006 and 2012, 10,408 babies were delivered by physicians in the three prac-
 tice groups.8 500 multiple births, 1 birth with a missing estimated due date and 2 patients
 from Groups B and C who do not match to the billing records are excluded from the es-
 timation sample. We match the hospital record of the birth to all outpatient prenatal care
 visits in the 40 weeks prior to the estimated due date.9 We drop 1,837 Group A patients and
 34 Group B and C patients who received their prenatal care at a different site and therefore
 do not match to prenatal records, leaving 8,036 births.
     The exogenous variation in our paper comes from the timing of the natural onset of
 labor. By definition, scheduled C-sections and scheduled inductions of labor do not have a
 random onset of labor and are therefore excluded from the study. After these exclusions,
 3,800 unscheduled births remain. 15 births with missing parity or mother’s ZIP code are
 also excluded for a final estimation sample of 3,785 births.
     In this sample, the average and median patient have in excess of 75% of their prenatal
 visits with their prenatal OB. In contrast, when the OB delivers a colleague’s patient, she is
 delivering a woman for whom she provided less than 5% of the prenatal care. We therefore
 use whether the OB is the primary prenatal provider as an indicator for the presence of a
 pre-existing physician-patient relationship. We define OBs’ own patients as those patients
 who saw the OB for the majority of their prenatal care.10
 8. For practices B and C the sample begins in October of 2006, because prenatal visit data is only available
 for these practice groups beginning in March of 2006.
 9. Group A uses the hospital electronic medical record system for outpatient visits. Group B and C use
 a different electronic medical records system for outpatient visits, but we were able to obtain access to all
 obstetric outpatient visits for these groups as well.
10. Alternately, one could define the primary prenatal provider as the OB seen in the patient’s first prenatal
 visit. 87% of the time the first OB seen for prenatal care is also the most frequently seen OB (82% for Group
                                                                                               15


   In our sample of patients with a natural onset of labor, OBs deliver 711 of their own
patients (19%) and 3,074 of their colleagues’ patients (Table I). Figure I shows the distri-
bution of the OB’s prenatal visits with the patients she delivers for each of these groups.
OBs are much more familiar with their own patients. The median patient delivered by their
prenatal OB has had 9 prenatal visits with them. Delivering OBs are much less familiar
with their colleagues’ patients. They have never met 70% of them (prior to the onset of
labor) and have had only one visit with 18% of them.
   The mechanism proposed in our model suggests treatment differences arise from OBs’
attempts to avoid the perceived psychic costs of their own patients’ difficult deliveries. To
test this, we need a source of exogenous variation in the OB’s expected psychic cost of a
vaginal birth, zjt , that is uncorrelated with patient risk. In our setting, OBs’ patients’ recent
experiences in the handful of births prior to the patient’s random onset of labor provides
a second source of exogenous variation. In order to ensure that the measure only captures
fluctuations in the OB’s perception of the difficulty of vaginal birth and the salience of its
complications, we also exclude any patients the OB delivered herself. This leaves the dif-
ficulty of recent labors of the OB’s prenatal patients who were delivered by her colleagues.
This measure should be uncorrelated with any characteristics of the patient the OB is cur-
rently delivering, including her true probability of complication or her objective need for a
C-section.
   One complication that arises in difficult vaginal deliveries is perineal lacerations. While
lacerations are not the most serious maternal complication that can occur and most can be
repaired without permanent injury to the mother, they are a good proxy for the overall
difficulty of the delivery. OBs receive information on and provide the subsequent follow
up care for their patients delivered by their colleagues. They are therefore aware of the
difficulty of their patients’ labors. Established cognitive biases suggest maternal risk in
A, 92% for Group B and 91% for Group C.)
                                                                                                             16


 a vaginal birth may be more salient to or perceived to be inflated by OBs whose patients
 have just experienced a higher than average rate of difficult labors.11 Lacerations result
 from both OB practice style and factors outside of the OB’s control, such as the size and
 positioning of the infant. Reflecting this, there is wide variation in OBs’ average laceration
 rates in their deliveries, with rates ranging from 30% to 77%. While laceration rates of
 patients the OB delivers herself are a function of her practice style, the laceration rates of
 her prenatal patients delivered by other OBs are independent of her treatment choices.12
 Furthemore, other factors that may differ across own and others’ patients, such as the OB’s
 information about the patient and patient trust of the OB, should not vary with the recent
 experiences of the delivering OB’s prenatal patients when delivered by other OBs. We
 therefore use the laceration rate of the OB’s last 15 prenatal patients delivered by other
 OBs as a measure of the difficulty of the OB’s patients’ recent deliveries.13
     The average laceration rate in each OB’s last 15 prenatal patients delivered by her col-
 leagues is 0.53 with a within-OB standard deviation of 0.180. Consistent with this rate
 being the result of factors outside the OB’s control, virtually all of the variation in this
 rate is within OB over time. Importantly, the within-OB variation in the recent laceration
 rate of her patients who were delivered by her colleagues is uncorrelated with her current
 patient’s predicted underlying laceration and C-section probability. In a regression of the
 patient’s predicted laceration rate on on the delivering OB’s patients’ recent laceration rate
 and OB fixed effects, the point estimate is 0.004 (s.e. 0.013). Similarly when the underlying
11. For example, the “clustering illusion” is a cognitive bias in which individuals update beliefs too much
 following a small streak of outcomes similar to a “hot hand” effect. This phenomenon could be reinforced
 by the availability or recency effect in which more recent occurrences come to mind more easily and dis-
 tort perceptions of the base probability of a given complication or outcome (Tversky and Kahneman 1974;
 Croskerry 2002).
12. Results are robust to using the laceration rate from the OBs’ own deliveries of her patients, as an alternate
 measure.
13. OBs do not only attend unscheduled births. Therefore, this rate is calculated using the birth outcomes in
 all deliveries to all mothers who attempted a vaginal birth including those whose labors were induced. It does
 not include scheduled C-sections as there is no attempt at vaginal birth in those instances.

 IV.C.    Econometric Model

     To identify the effect of the pre-existing physician-patient relationship we assume the
 onset of labor is orthogonal to the call schedule. For women who go into labor naturally,
 the delivering OB is as good as randomly assigned. To support this assumption, we show
 that OBs’ own patients are statistically indistinguishable from patients of other providers.
 Table I summarizes the characteristics of OBs’ own patients and the patients of other prena-
 tal providers whom they deliver. The two groups have similar demographic characteristics
 and socio-economic status. Both groups of patients are 33 years of age, they have the same
 racial make-up on average, and they live in ZIP codes with nearly identical per capita in-
 come. Their clinical risk factors are also comparable. The only notable difference is that
 OBs’ own patients are slightly less likely to be experiencing a first birth.15 However, pre-
 dicted C-section probabilities based on all the variables listed in Table I do not significantly
 differ across OB’s own and others’ patients. Moreover, the results that follow are robust
 to limiting the sample to first births or to low risk first births (those with no risk factors
 present).
     If the delivering OB is as good as randomly assigned, the differences in means across
 treatments and outcomes are the causal effects of delivering one’s own patient relative to a
 colleague’s patient. To improve precision, we also estimate OLS regressions, making use
14. Each patient’s ex ante laceration and C-section probabilities are estimated by logistic regression using all
 the explanatory variables in Table I. These probabilities are then regressed on the laceration rate of the last
 15 of the delivering OB’s patients who were delivered by other OBs along with delivering and prenatal OB
 fixed effects.
15. There are also small, but not systematic, differences in the rates of previous C-section or scar, asthma, and
 isoimmunity. Less than 10% of previous C-sections and uterine scars occur in women attempting a first birth.
                                                                                                              18


 of the full set of clinical and demographic controls.


                                 yijpt = βDijp + Xit0 γ + δj + δp + ijpt                                     (1)


 where yijpt is a dummy variable indicating whether patient i with delivering OB j and
 prenatal OB p had a C-section during shift t.16 Dijp is an indicator that the patient was
 delivered by their prenatal OB, and Xit is the set of all variables listed in Table I, including
 socio-economic status and clinical risk factors. Because we observe each OB delivering
 their own and others’ patients, we can include both prenatal provider and delivering OB
 fixed effects. Prenatal provider fixed effects control for any sorting of unobserved pa-
 tient characteristics to providers and groups, while delivering OB fixed effects absorb each
 provider’s practice style in the delivery room. β is the causal effect of the physician-patient
 relationship. It is the difference, ceteris paribus, in the probability of a C-section for an
 OB’s own patients relative to the patients she delivers of other providers. The model pre-
 dicts β > 0. OBs perform more C-sections on their own patients to avoid the psychic cost
 of witnessing mothers they know experiencing complications in vaginal birth.
     Another measure of the pre-existing physician-patient relationship is their exposure to
 the delivering OB during prenatal care, as proxied by the fraction or number of visits. Both
 capture similar information about relationship strength. We estimate a version of the model
 replacing Dijp with the share of the patient’s prenatal care provided by the delivering OB.
 This is not our preferred specification because the share of prenatal visits with the primary
 prenatal OB is in the patient’s control and therefore not randomly assigned by the timing
 of the onset of labor.
     Next, we test whether the probability of receiving a C-section varies among the OB’s
16. 442 patients deliver more than once during the sample period, and they can have different clinical char-
 acteristics at each delivery. All results are robust to including year fixed effects and delivering doctor - year
 interactions.
                                                                                           19


own patients with the extent of the OB’s previous interactions with the patient. We estimate:


              yijpt = β1 Dijp + β2 Fip ∗ Dijp + β3 Fip + Xit0 γ + δj + δp + ijpt         (2)


where Fip is an indicator that the patient’s fraction of visits with her prenatal OB was above
the median (79%). If the relationship is driving treatment differences, one would expect the
C-section rate to be higher for the OB’s patients with whom she has had the most contact
(β2 > 0). In addition, the strength of relationship with the prenatal OB should not directly
affect treatment decisions when patients are delivered by another OB.
   Next we turn to the mechanism. We test the hypothesis that the C-section gap between
OBs’ own and others’ patients is increasing in the OB’s expected psychic cost of a vaginal
birth. We estimate models of the following form:


              yijpt = β1 Dijp + β2 zjt ∗ Dijp + β3 zjt + Xit0 γ + δj + δp + ijpt         (3)


where zjt is the laceration rate for delivering OB j’s last 15 prenatal patients who were
delivered by other OBs prior to the shift t in which patient i delivers. The model predicts
β2 > 0. All else equal, the gap between the OB’s own and others’ patients will be larger
after a recent string of difficult vaginal deliveries. Because zjt is both independent of the
current patient’s risk and uncorrelated with other factors that may differ across own and
others’ patients, such as patient preferences or the quality of clinical information, β2 iso-
lates the treatment difference that arises from the OB’s expected psychic costs. Because
we use OBs’ patients delivered by other OBs it is also unrelated to time-varying trends in
an OB’s differential practice decisions on own versus other patients. β3 reflects short-term
objective considerations that apply to both own and others’ patients and co-vary with the
recent laceration rate, such as short-run hospital shocks while β1 captures the part of the
                                                                                           20


own-patient effect that does not vary with zjt . To further filter out norms and other con-
temporaneous factors around the time of delivery we also estimate Equation 3 with year
dummies and with a separate delivering OB fixed effect for each year.
   The C-section decision is important, but it is the not the only treatment decision that
affects the mother’s risk of injury or discomfort. We also estimate the base model for other
treatment choices. Because some of the other treatments are not as common as C-sections
(assisted vaginal delivery occurs in less than 10% of births, for example), we estimate logit
models as follows:
                          logit(yijpt ) = βDijp + Xit0 γ + δj + δp ,                      (4)

where yijpt is an indicator variable for the treatment of interest, and the marginal effect of
Dijp gives the difference in treatment rates for OBs’ own and others’ patients.
   Lastly, we test whether OBs are successful in their efforts to avoid unpleasant com-
plications in their own patients’ vaginal births. We re-estimate (4) for each maternal and
infant health outcome that occurs in at least 1% of births. If OBs’ efforts are successful
their own patients should have lower rates of maternal complications. The most serious
adverse outcomes for mothers and infants are too rare to study in a sample of this size.
However, mothers or infants who suffer serious complications are likely to require longer
hospital stays. We therefore use the length of the hospital stay as a summary measure of
the mother and infant’s overall health, and we estimate OLS models of log length of stay
on the own patient indicator, as in (1).


                                           V.   Results

   OBs make different treatment decisions for patients they know. Substantive and signif-
icant differences in treatment are evident even in the raw means (Table II). The C-section
rate when OBs deliver their own patients is 20.1%. It is more than 4 percentage points
                                                                                                            21


 lower at 15.4% when delivering another OB’s patient. This differential also appears to be
 a function of the OB’s familiarity with the patient. Figure II presents the C-section rate
 when the OB delivers her own patients and colleagues’ patients, broken out by the number
 of prenatal visits the primary prenatal OB had with the patient.17 The C-section differen-
 tial is highest when OBs deliver the patients with whom they had the most contact during
 pregnancy. There is no significant C-section differential when OBs deliver patients who
 are nominally their patient, but with whom they have had very little contact prior to the
 delivery (patients who had fewer than 6 visits with their prenatal OB over the course of the
 pregnancy).18
     However, OBs do not treat their patients more intensively on all margins and actually
 perform fewer total procedures on them. OBs are approximately 30% less likely to employ
 vacuum extraction and forceps on their own patients (3 percentage points), are more likely
 to allow them to forgo continuous electronic fetal monitoring (EFM), and are less likely to
 order ultrasounds during labor and delivery. There is no difference in their use of epidural
 anesthesia, as one would expect in a hospital where almost all patients receive epidurals.
 There is also no difference in the use of labor augmenting drugs.
     Table III displays results from OLS regressions of an indicator that the patient received
 a C-section on an indicator that the OB has a pre-existing relationship with the patient (1).
 The first column contains no controls and is thus the raw difference in C-section rates by
 pre-existing relationship. After including controls for all of the clinical and socio-economic
 factors listed in Table I, the substantial treatment differences documented in the raw means
17. The number of visits with the primary prenatal OB is broken into quantiles such that 20% of patients have
 the specified range of visits with their primary prenatal OB. Appendix Figure B.I instead breaks patients into
 categories based on the fraction of visits with their primary prenatal OB.
18. The same pattern emerges when patients are grouped by the percent of prenatal visits scheduled with their
 primary prenatal OB (Figure B.I). While the number of prenatal visits is a more natural unit of measurement,
 an advantage of grouping patients by the percentage of visits with their OB is that it abstracts from the total
 number of visits required and avoids conflating the health of the patient with their familiarity with the OB.
 When patients are not delivered by their prenatal OB their probability of receiving a C-section is uncorrelated
 with the fraction of visits they had with their prenatal OB.
                                                                                                           22


 persist. All else equal, patients delivered by their own prenatal provider are 3.9 percentage
 points (25%) more likely to receive a C-section (Column 2). The estimates are unchanged
 by the inclusion of prenatal and delivering OB fixed effects, suggesting that individual
 OBs make different clinical decisions for patients they know (Column 3).19 A similar
 phenomena emerges when the the fraction of prenatal care provided by the delivering OB
 is used as a proxy for the strength of the pre-existing relationship in place of the own
 patient indicator. A one standard deviation increase in the fraction of visits provided by
 the delivering OB is associated with a 1.8 percentage point increase in the C-section rate
 (0.304×0.059, Column 6).
     We find that the differential treatment of the OBs’ own patients is a general and robust
 phenomenon. A similar picture emerges when the prenatal OB is defined as the first OB
 the patient saw in the practice (Table IV, Row 2) instead of the most frequently seen OB.
 The estimates are also robust to restricting the sample to women giving birth for the first
 time (Table IV, Row 3).20 All else equal, women experiencing first births are 4.4 percentage
 points more likely to receive a C-section when they are delivered by their prenatal provider.
     The practices’ policies should generate random assignment and, consistent with that,
 the ex-ante predicted probability of a C-section is the same for the own and others’ patients
 the OBs deliver. However, policies can be violated. Of most concern would be if the
 prenatal OB came in specially for high-risk situations that are also more likely to result
 in a C-section. By observing the exact timing of all births in the practices we are able
 to reconstruct the shift and find no evidence of this. Furthermore, the point estimates are
 unchanged when the sample is limited to first births with no pre-existing conditions, a
19. The results are robust to estimation with a logistic regression in lieu of OLS (Appendix Table B.2), to the
 inclusion of year fixed effects along with their interaction with the delivering OB fixed effects (Appendix
 Table B.3), and to using the number of visits with the delivering OB in lieu of the share of visits (Appendix
 Table B.3). The estimates are also not driven by the effect of any individual OB and are robust to excluding
 each delivering OB in turn (Appendix Table B.4).
20. By definition, the sample of women experiencing a first birth also excludes all women who previously had
 a C-section.
                                                                                                     23


group very unlikely to be high risk or draw extra concern from the OB. They are also
robust to excluding preterm births, the babies with a high risk of adverse outcomes at the
onset of labor. The other threat to identification would occur if scheduled C-sections or
informally scheduled inductions were not recorded as such in the record and thus slipped
into the sample. The electronic medical records are extremely rich and, reassuringly, all
of the women in the sample had ruptured membranes (colloquially, their “water broke”),
indicating that all the women in the sample were in fact in labor. This would not be the case
if the sample included any scheduled C-sections. The estimates are also robust to excluding
all women with diagnoses for which performing a C-section witout an attempt at vaginal
birth is recommended.21 Inductions are most likely to occur when the infant is over 41
weeks gestational age. The estimates are robust to excluding those deliveries. There is also
no difference in the rates of artificial rupture of membranes for own and others’ patients, a
procedure performed to induce or accelerate labor.
     A natural question is whether these findings represent a higher incidence of C-sections
or patients simply being more likely to have their C-section performed by their prenatal OB.
For example, patients and OBs delivering near shift changes could consider the identity of
the next on-call provider in making decisions to speed up or delay a transition to surgical
delivery. If patients near shift changes wait until their provider comes on call to do the
C-section, or if patients near the end of their OB’s shift speed up a C-section, this would
bias results upwards. Table IV, Rows 8 and 9 exclude births in the three hours prior to and
following any shift change. The effects in both samples are similar to each other, and they
are not smaller than the effect in the full sample. Similarly, during shifts with a high volume
of births (more than 4 births) a second OB may be called in to assist and the allocation of
patients to the two OBs could be affected by pre-existing relationships. The estimates are
21. At the time of this study, an attempt at vaginal birth was considered contraindicated for women with
 placenta previa, a prior classical C-section, and malpresented infants.
                                                                                                            24


 robust to excluding high volume shifts.
     If the physician-patient relationship is driving this difference in treatment, the effect
 should be concentrated among the OBs’ patients with the strongest prior relationship. They
 are (Table V, Columns (1) and (2)). The difference in C-section rates is coming from pa-
 tients who had above median fractions of their prenatal appointments with their delivering
 OB. These patients are more likely to receive a C-section when delivered by their prenatal
 OB. While the fraction of prenatal visits scheduled with the patient’s primary prenatal OB
 is not random, it does not appear to be correlated with patients’ need or preferences for C-
 sections. When not delivered by their prenatal OBs, patients with above median fractions
 of prenatal visits with their prenatal OBs have the same C-section rate as patients with less
 concentrated prenatal care.
     In order to test our proposed mechanism for the physician-patient effect, we estimate
 (3), which interacts the own patient indicator with laceration rate of the OB’s last 15 prena-
 tal patients delivered by other OBs (Table V, Columns 3-6). OBs are more likely to perform
 C-sections on their own patients when this recent laceration rate is high, suggesting psychic
 costs are important. This does not mean OBs view C-sections as preferable to lacerations
 in general; rather, having recently been exposed to more difficult labors OBs are quicker to
 switch to a C-section on the margin.
     The effect is virtually unchanged with the addition of OB-year fixed effects. OBs are
 responding to a recent string of (bad) luck rather than responding based on their skill at
 vaginal birth.22 In fact, it appears that the OB’s reaction to her patients’ recent experi-
 ences can explain the entire own-patient increase in the C-section rate. The point estimate
 of the coefficient on Dijp is negative after including this interaction, though not precisely
22. If the increase in lacerations is due to short-run fluctuations in the hospital’s suitability for managing a
 long and difficult labor or a change in clinical guidelines, then it would be optimal for the OB to temporarily
 change her practice style to compensate. However, such a phenomena should effect all the patients she
 delivers equally. Additionally, the estimates are robust to the inclusion of delivering OB × quarter-year fixed
 effects (Appendix Table B.7).
                                                                                                            25


 estimated. Consistent with this, having been exposed to a high laceration rate does not
 generally lead OBs to perform more C-sections. The effects are limited to the patients
 with whom they have pre-existing relationships and are presumably more emotionally in-
 vested.23 OBs appear only to adjust their treatment decisions in response to the most recent
 birth experiences, but not the births that preceded them. Their laceration rate in 16-30 prior
 births has no additional effect on their probability of performing a C-section (Columns (5)
 and (6)). The effect of the OB’s recent laceration rate is not a response to a hospital-level
 or seasonal shock to the true difficulty of vaginal delivery. The coefficient on the recent
 laceration rate, β3 , is negative and insignificant, suggesting the response is not the result of
 general time-varying factors that are correlated with laceration rates and affect both own
 and others’ patients.24
     The decision to perform a C-section is a key choice in labor and delivery, but it is not
 the only treatment decision. Vacuum and forceps are used in 11% of vaginal births (assisted
 vaginal delivery). These tools can be lifesaving in a difficult delivery, but are also associated
 with increased risk of serious maternal laceration, pelvic floor damage and increased risk
 to the infant. These complications may be particularly salient to the OB as they occur while
 she performs the procedure. Consistent with OBs performing C-sections to avoid the most
 difficult vaginal births, OBs are 2.5 percentage points less likely to choose to use these tools
 on patients they know (Table VI, Columns 1 and 2).25 In addition, women delivered by their
23. As further evidence of this, results from the triple difference regression in which the laceration rate is
 interacted with the own patient indicator as well as the strong relationship indicator (from Table 5, Columns
 1 and 2), suggests that OBs response to recent laceration rates are concentrated among the patients they know
 best (Appendix Table B.5).
24. Appendix Table B.5 shows the estimates are robust to all of the sample restrictions in Table IV. They are
 also robust to using fewer or more births in the laceration rate calculation and to and alternative definitions
 of the recent laceration rate. Appendix Table B.7, Columns 1-3 and 7-9 use laceration rates in the last 10 and
 last 20 births. Appendix Table B.6 presents triple difference estimates using both our preferred measure and
 a recent laceration rate calculated from the last 15 deliveries the OB personally performed.
25. This does not appear to be a purely mechanical result of a lower rate of vaginal birth. When the C-section
 is included as a control or when the sample is limited to vaginal births, OBs are still 1.7 and 2.1 percentage
 points less likely to use these tools, respectively. Results are similar in a nested logit of vaginal delivery,
 assisted vaginal delivery and C-section, assisted vaginal delivery. Assisted vaginal delivery can account for a
                                                                                                      26


own OBs have shorter second stages of labor (the “pushing phase”). Thus OBs appear to be
avoiding long, difficult vaginal births when they have a pre-existing relationship with the
mother. Beyond the choice of delivery method, other margins of care also suggest that OBs
are placing more weight on the comfort and experience of mothers they have relationships
with. They are more likely to allow those mothers to forgo continuous EFM (Table VI,
Columns 5-6).26
     The result of all of these decisions is that women delivered by their prenatal OBs have
lower rates of morbidity during their hospital stays (Table VII). They have lower rates
of fever and trauma and lacerations in need of repair. However, these reduced morbidity
rates do not appear to be significant enough to result in shorter hospital stays (Table VIII).
The extra hospital stay to recover from the higher C-section rate offsets any gains from the
lower complication rates. After accounting for the extra hospital stay necessitated by the
higher rate of C-section, there is no measurable difference in the length of the hospital stays
of those delivered by their own OBs. These results suggest that the complications avoided
are easily treated or relatively minor. However, we cannot rule out that the lower rates of
birth trauma and laceration are associated with less long-run pelvic floor damage and thus
improved quality of life.
     The infants of mothers who are delivered by their own OBs also do not appear to be sub-
stantially healthier (Table IX). While they are significantly less likely to have any breath-
ing issues recorded in first births (Panel B, Columns (1) and (2)), there is no difference
in the rate of serious respiratory issues such as meconium aspiration and respiratory dis-
tress (Panel B, Columns (3) and (4)). These infants are otherwise indistinguishable from
those delivered by other OBs. They are not less likely to have low APGAR scores nor do
they have fewer NICU admissions. Finally, like their mothers they do not have measurably
 maximum of two thirds of the C-section effect.
26. Continuous EFM is convenient for providers, because it allows remote monitoring of patients. However,
 the monitor limits patient mobility and confines them to bed.

shorter hospital stays (Table VIII).


                                       VI.   Discussion

   We find that physicians make different treatment decisions for patients they know. They
do more C-sections in place of difficult and prolonged vaginal deliveries and extend other
comfort-related courtesies to patients they know. These choices are consistent with OBs
attempting to spare patients they know complications and discomfort, but can they be ex-
plained by other mechanisms?
   Concerns about being sued for adverse outcomes (malpractice) are one of the most
commonly cited explanations for rising C-section rates. Physicians may believe that pa-
tients they know and have a good rapport with will be less likely to sue in the event of an
adverse outcome. If they do, OBs should be relatively less concerned about being sued
when delivering their own patients and perform fewer C-sections on them (practice less
defensive medicine). This is the opposite of what we find. If instead OBs are more fearful
of lawsuits from their own patients, one would expect to see them using higher rates of
continuous EFM and ordering more supplemental tests. Neither is the case. OBs are sig-
nificantly more likely to allow their own patients to forgo continuous EFM, and they order
fewer ultrasounds for them.
   Another possibility is that OBs are able to exploit the relationship with their patients to
induce demand more effectively. In this setting there is very little direct financial incentive
to perform a C-section, so the primary motivation would be to minimize effort or make the
birth more convenient for the OB. The OB’s personal opportunity cost of continuing labor
is highest when the patient is the only or last patient in labor during the shift. In those
cases, a completed delivery means the OB is free to leave labor and delivery. However, the
own-patient C-section effect is unaffected by the number of other women in labor at the
                                                                                                         28


time of the birth or overall that day (see Appendix Table B.10).27
     OBs gather information about the patient’s pregnancy and medical history during pre-
natal appointments. However, our results, taken together, do not appear to be the result of
OBs being better informed about their own patients’ health. It is possible that better in-
formation could lead OBs to perform more C-sections on their own patients, but the effect
of OBs’ recent laceration rates suggests psychic costs are driving the treatment gap (Ap-
pendix A). We would also expect for OBs with less information to perform more tests to
evaluate risk factors. OBs are not more likely to perform tests to assess the severity levels
of risk factors for others’ patients (for example, diabetes tests), although OBs are slightly
less likely to perform ultrasounds and slightly more likely to allow their patients to forego
continuous EFM (Appendix Table B.11 and Table VI, Columns 5-6). Additionally, the
treatment differential is the same size for the group of patients with no pre-existing con-
ditions. This is a group for whom the difference in information between the prenatal OB
and other providers is likely to be smallest. This is perhaps unsurprising since much of the
information relevant to the likely success and safety of vaginal delivery is revealed during
labor for patients attempting labor.
     Differential reputation costs could also make inducing demand in one’s own patients
less costly. One notable difference when delivering a colleague’s patient (compared to
one’s own) is that a fellow OB will get a report of the birth and form an opinion as to
the appropriateness of care. If this monitoring by colleagues and any associated reputation
concerns were the source of the C-section differential, OBs should be relatively more likely
to do a C-section on all of their own patients. Instead we find the differential is concen-
trated in the patients the OB knows best (Table V). One might also expect OBs to be most
concerned about the opinions of their partners in the practice. However C-section rates are
27. OBs may also want to speed up labor if they are especially busy, but the effect is not larger during the
 busiest shifts.
                                                                                             29


not lower for patients of OBs’ colleagues from their own practice relative to those of col-
leagues from other groups, suggesting that they are not attempting to impress their partners
with low C-section rates (Appendix Table B.9). Finally, concerns about their colleagues’
opinions of their skill cannot explain the laceration results. If they were driving the results,
we would expect OBs to be more averse to performing vaginal births on colleagues’ pa-
tients following a higher than average string of lacerations. Yet, the OB’s overall laceration
rate and the rate relative to the OB’s average only measurably affect the rate at which she
performs C-sections on her own patients.
   Treatment differences could also arise from changes in patient behavior when they
know their OB. For example, patients might be able to communicate their discomfort more
effectively to an OB they know. They might also be more likely to express their prefer-
ences over treatment options. If mothers feel social pressure to deliver vaginally, they may
be more comfortable expressing a desire to end an attempt at vaginal birth and switch to a
C-section to their own OB. Because “word of mouth” referrals are important in obstetrics,
OBs may also worry that a reputation for being too quick to perform a C-section might
result in fewer referrals. If OBs believe that their own patients will give them the benefit of
the doubt when recommending a C-section, they may be less hesitant to recommend one
to them. Similarly, the patient may be more receptive to a change in delivery method when
it is proposed by her own OB. However, the fact that the treatment effect appears driven
by OBs’ experiences in prior shifts suggests that the effect is coming from the OB, not the
patient.
   A natural question is whether the effects we document are likely to generalize beyond
obstetrics or even beyond these practices. Many of the key organizational features of ob-
stetrics are present in other specialties. Primary care, internal medicine and pediatrics have
traditionally involved repeated interactions between a patient and her physician. Like ob-
stetrics, these specialties often use call rotations, and physicians in these specialties must
                                                                                                             30


 make recommendations for treatments and procedures with the potential for varying de-
 grees of patient discomfort or risk. While relationships and the emphatic channel are likely
 broadly important in medicine, in other clinical contexts minimizing patient discomfort
 could manifest in less rather than more intensive treatment. In end of life care, for exam-
 ple, provider empathy could manifest in fewer interventions and more palliative care.
     The practices we study deliver at an elite academic medical center. Their patients are
 slightly older and wealthier than the average woman giving birth, but otherwise fairly typ-
 ical. The practices’ C-sections rates are within a percentage point of their state average.
 The hospital and providers we study do allow attempts at vaginal birth after prior Cesare-
 ans (VBACs), but the results are robust to limiting the sample to first births. The OBs we
 study and the support staff they work with may be more skilled than average, and this could
 limit the potential for adverse health outcomes and surgical complications from C-sections.
 The OBs and hospital we study could also be particularly adept at handling information
 transfers across providers.28 Information loss in hand-offs could play a larger role in set-
 tings that are not as well organized.


                                             VII.    Conclusion

    The physician’s relationship with her patient has a large effect on her clinical decisions.
 All else equal, an OB is 25% more likely to perform a C-section on her own patient. To
 achieve a similar increase in the C-section rate one would need to raise the OB’s C-section
 fee differential by $625 (150% of the average OB fee differential).29 It is also larger than
 the effect of major tort reforms which have been estimated to increase the C-section rate
28. The groups use electronic medical records and have shared call for an extended period of time. The pre-
 natal provider also submits and regularly updates a “problem list” to the hospital during the second trimester,
 which the delivering OB can reference in making treatment decisions.
29. A $100 increase (decrease) in the C-section fee differential is estimated to raise (lower) the C-section rate
 by 4% (Gruber, Kim, and Mayzlin 1999; Alexander 2015). The Healthcare Blue Book lists the physician
 fees for a vaginal birth and a C-section along with any associated postpartum care as $4,040 and $4,484,
 respectively.
                                                                                                        31


by 5-7% (Currie and MacLeod 2008; Shurtz 2014). One would need to more than double
malpractice premiums to produce an effect of this size.30 The reduced form effect of re-
lationships is also important because it demonstrates, contrary to prevailing wisdom, that
increasing provider continuity can increase healthcare costs. It is thus important to consider
the impact of relationships in evaluating any policy intervention that affects care continuity.
     When treating her own patients the OB appears to be motivated by heightened concern
for the mother’s immediate well-being. This phenomena is likely to be broadly impor-
tant within medicine, where risk, judgement and personal relationships are key features.
Nonetheless, it has received little attention in the literature on care continuity. This is
likely due to the difficulty in empirically identifying the causal effect of relationships on
decisions. In addition to the advantages of the plausibly random assignment of patients to
providers with differing degrees of familiarity, it is a further advantage that the empirical
identification occurs in a setting where the empathetic channel can be isolated from the
effects of information and financial incentives.
     The resulting treatment differences appear to be “flat of the curve” for the infant, but not
for the mother. When OBs deliver their own patients the mothers experience less trauma
and fewer fevers, but the injuries avoided are not sufficiently serious to shorten the hospital
stay.31 To determine social optimality this small benefit must be weighed against the re-
source and health costs of a substantially higher C-section rate. These are considerable. If
all patients were treated like OBs’ own patients in this hospital, the direct healthcare costs
of childbirth would increase by $650M (2%).32 It is unclear if this more intensive treatment
30. Dubay, Kaestner and Waidmann (1999) estimate that a $10,000 malpractice premium reduction reduces
 the primary C-section rate by 2% for married, college educated women. The effect varies from 1.4% to 2.4%
 for other groups. In 2014, the average OB’s malpractice premium was $70,000 (authors’ calculation of the
 birth-weighted average malpractice premium from the Medical Liability Monitor).
31. The most serious maternal and infant complications (e.g. uterine rupture, asphyxiation) are extremely
 rare, and the lower rates of maternal complications we do observe could also be associated with less long-
 term maternal morbidity.
32. There were 3,932,181 million births in 2013. Direct costs of childbirth include hospital and physician
 allowed charges. According to Truven Health Analytics Marketscan Study, in 2013 C-sections had $4,153
                                                                                                       32


improves patients’ private welfare. It depends on whether psychic costs bring the OB closer
to the weight the mother places on the discomfort and complications in a difficult vaginal
birth. However, it would be hard to conclude that a treatment differential that is largely
driven by an experienced OB’s last few draws in labor (her patients’ last 15 deliveries, but
not the 15 that preceded them) represents improved clinical decision-making.
    Policy initiatives that affect provider continuity and relationships should be evaluated
in light of these findings. For example, it suggests that the declines in C-section rates
experienced by hospitals adopting laborist models could be the product of the elimination of
the pre-existing physician-patient relationship, and not simply OB selection into the laborist
profession or specialization in labor and delivery. Similarly, health delivery innovations
such as patient centered medical homes may not just alter care by increasing coordination
and diminishing information loss. The relationships they foster between physicians and
their patients could also have direct effects on physicians’ clinical decisions. Similarly,
initiatives in medical education aimed at increasing physician empathy have been motivated
by a desire to improve communication and patient satisfaction. To the extent that such
initiatives also alter how physicians perceive their patients they could also affect treatment
decisions.
    Like obstetrics, primary care, internal medicine and pediatrics have traditionally in-
volved repeated physician-patient interactions over extended periods of time and their care
models have seen similar innovations in healthcare delivery. The effects we uncover high-
light the need for more research on the effect of the physician-patient relationship on physi-
cians’ clinical decisions and the effects of innovations in care delivery in other clinical con-
texts and hospital settings. It should also be a goal of future research to uncover the role
higher allowed charges than vaginal births. A 4 percentage point higher C-section rate (Table 3, Column 3)
increases allowed charges by 2%, or $650M. Hospital charges are a lower bound on the additional resources
used by C-sections and does not include any re-hospitalizations for wound disruptions or other C-section
complications that arise after discharge.

   This appendix extends the model of physician decision-making to allow OBs to have
more information about patients they know. Specifically, we model ri = (ωi , ηi ), where
ωi is observed by all OBs, while ηi is only observed by the patient’s prenatal OB. Without
loss of generality we further assume that ωi and ηi are orthogonal. To focus on the effect
of better information about OB’s own patients, we model the OB as having unbiased ex-
pectations of the average need for a C-section, but better information on their own patients’
individual needs for a C-section. To that end we formulate the effect of including ηi on
these object as a mean-preserving spread around E [h (ri ) |ωi ]:


                                   h (ri ) = E [h (ri ) |ωi ] + ηi ,                           (5)


where E [ηi |ωi ] = 0.

                             Pr (E [h (ri ) |ωi ] + ηi − S (ri , zjt ) < π) ,
                                                                                  Dij = 1


   Dij can influence the delivery decision, cij , in two ways. First, as in our standard model,
when Dij = 1, the OB’s psychic cost of vaginal complications, via S (ri , zjt ), increases the
likelihood of C-sections. Second, the OB has better information on the risk of patients she
knows and therefore considers ηi in addition to E [h (ri ) |ωi ].
                                                                                         35


     A further statement about the direction of the effect of ηj on Pr (cij = 1) cannot be
made without parametric restrictions. We therefore assume information is additive and
normally distributed. That is, we assume that h(ri ) = h + ωi + ηi , where h is a measure of
average net benefit of vaginal delivery over C-section, and that33
                                                                  
                               ωi       0   1 0 
                                   ∼ N   ,       .
                                ηi          0     0 1


     Then we have


         ∆ Pr (cij = 1) ≡ Pr (cij = 1|Dij = 1) − Pr (cij = 1|Dij = 0)
                                                                            
                        = Pr h + ωi + ηi − S (ri , zjt ) > π − Pr h + ωi > π

                             = Information + Psychic Cost,

                   where
                                      √              
            Information = Φ  −h + π / 2 − Φ −h + π ;
                                                 √           √ 
           Psychic Cost = Φ S (ri , zjt ) − h + π / 2 − Φ −h + π / 2 .


The former component (information) is positive as long as −h + π is negative, i.e., as long
as physicians perform vaginal deliveries (with or without ηi ). Thus, both psychic cost and
information can lead to a higher C-section rate for OBs’ own patients. The effect of each
channel is therefore an empirical question. zjt only enters the C-section decision through
psychic costs. Thus any component or shifter of zjt that is uncorrelated with ωi and ηi
will affect C-section decisions through the psychic cost channel, but not the information
channel. If the identifying assumptions stated in the paper hold, then the OB’s recent
laceration rate will satisfy these conditions and will only operate through psychic costs
33. The subscript is omitted for simplicity, but h can be heterogeneous across OBs.

even in the presence of better information about one’s own patients.
