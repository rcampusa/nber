                                              ABSTRACT

In this paper we present evidence as to the effects of the China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone
(SPFTZ) on China’s capital controls. The start of the SPFTZ in September, 2013 was a trial to introduce
a combination of exchange rate floating and capital account liberalization into China’s macro policy
mix. We employ three methods to test the SPFTZ’s impact on capital controls: price spread tests between
CNH and CNY, RMB yield gaps between onshore and offshore RMB markets, and Granger causalities
among China’s money supply and the foreign interest rates. All these tests give consistent results suggesting
that the impact of China’s capital controls is weaker since the SPFTZ.

1. Introduction and Background




The adoption of the China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone (hereafter SPFTZ) at the

end of September, 2013 is part of an ambitious trial for a new round of Chinese reform

and opening out, with stress on capital liberalization1. After one year’s operation, we

offer an evaluation of the impact of the SPFTZ on China’s capital controls.




China is the largest economy in the world which still maintains relatively rigorous

capital controls. According to the capital liberalization criteria of the IMF, China has

controls on all thirteen sub-items of capital transactions2. Although capital controls are

normal in developing countries which lack foreign exchange, it may seem strange for

China who have a large share of total foreign reserves in the world. Capital controls

have also been an obstacle to the internationalization of the RMB, but they also serve

as a seawall for the domestic financial market.




China maintains capital controls for both state security and policy independence. The

Asian financial crisis in 1990s taught China that capital liberalization can be dangerous

without enough preparation. According to the “Impossible Trinity3”, there cannot be

simultaneously a fixed exchange rate, capital liberalization and independent monetary



1 We give a detailed introduction of the SPFTZ in a separate paper, Yao and Whalley (2014).

3 The Impossible Trinity is a trilemma in international economics which states that it is impossible to have all

three of the following at the same time: A fixed exchange rate, free capital movement, and an independent
monetary policy.
                                                          2
policy. To the Chinese government which insists on independence in foreign policies,

surrendering monetary policy to others is unimaginable. Therefore China must choose

between a fixed exchange rate and capital liberalization. In the past China chose the

former: a pegged (and often under-valued) RMB; with rigorous capital controls,

especially on capital out flows and hot money in flows.




Such a policy combination induces export orientation and foreign capital competition,

and fits well with a “catching up strategy” for China. China’s GDP more than tripled in

merely twelve years after she joined the WTO in 2001, reflecting an annual rate of

growth of 10.09%. As a result, China’s foreign reserves increased sharply. The value of

China’s total reserves in 2001 was 220 billion current US$, and by 2013 they had

increased to 3.88 trillion, more than triple the second largest reserve holder Japan’s 1.27

trillion (Fig.1).




                                 Source: WDI database

But the accumulation of foreign reserve while maintaining a stable RMB has its own
                                            3
price. The balance sheet of the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), China’s central bank,

must be balanced. As the assets increased quickly with the accumulation of reserves,

the PBoC had to increase its debt equally, which meant injecting more money into the

economy. The rate of increase of China’s M0 has been in about 10 percent in recent

years, with a M2 increase of nearly 15 percent (Fig.2). At the end of September, 2014,

the M2 of China was 120205 billion of yuan. By comparison, the M2 of the U.S. at the

same time was US dollar 11473 billion. This means that although China’s GDP is only

one-third of that of the U.S., China’s money supply is about two-thirds more, which

contributes to inflation and asset price booms in recent years.




                               Source: the IMF database

Because of the problems induced by the fixed exchange rate and capital controls, the

Chinese government now seeks to adjust to a combination of a relatively open capital

account and some degree of float in the RMB, while maintaining her policy

independence. Since July 2005, China has allowed RMB crawling appreciation to a

basket of currencies, and the floating band has been enlarged to ±2%. Capital controls

                                           4
have been loosened gradually, with a RMB internationalization policy in place from

July 2009. This process continues with the SPFTZ.




Launched on Sep.29, 2013, the SPFTZ is more than a traditional “free trade area”, and

more a trial zone for China’s new opening and reform strategy. It is a unilateral set of

measures and procedures relating to a small area in Shanghai, which has promised

liberalization on capital account and trade facilitation as its main objectives. After one

year’s operation, the SPFTZ has already met several important policy objectives in

reforming legal and regulatory system; adopting a negative list management for foreign

investment; improving trade facilitations and introducing financial innovations. We

give a detailed introduction of the SPFTZ in Yao and Whalley (2014).




2. Growing Cross-Border Capital Flows Since the SPFTZ




    a) China’s Capital Flows in Recent Years




We begin with the effects of the SPFTZ on capital flows. Although the definition of

capital flows is clear, there are some difficulties in computing the cross-border capital

flows for China. Ma (2008) defines capital flows as the sum of debit and credit flows

on China’s balance of payments, excluding errors and omissions. According to his

calculation, in 2005 gross capital account flows represented 40% of China’s GDP. Ma

(2008) acknowledged that such a definition is likely to underestimate capital flows

                                            5
because some capital flows take the form of current account transactions in order to

avoid official restrictions, and most reported bank-related gross flows represent changes

between two dates and do not capture any intervening gross flows1.




We compute China’s capital flows for a more recent year following Ma (2008). These

data are calculated from the Balance of Payments database of the IMF2, and capital

flows are computed as the change between two years. As listed in Table 1, both the

capital flows in and out of China have increased rapidly since 2009.

1 In theory we can compute the net capital flow in a period by comparing the capital stock change between the
beginning and the end of that period. The actual capital flow may be larger than this if there is capital in flow and
out flow in such period. See Ma(2008), p.105, footnote 2.

3 Reserve Assets is an item in the financial accounts, whose increase means the central bank is buying foreign

assets and capital is flowing out. See IMF: Balance of payments and international investment position manual
(2009), the 6th edition, p.130. There is another item of financial account, the Financial Derivatives (Other than
Reserves) and Employee Stock Options, which is omitted here because the amount for China is very small.

The Institute of International Finance (IIF) publishes biannual reports titled “Capital

Flows to Emerging Markets”, which depicts China’s capital flows directly, but data are

restricted to its members. Fig.3 replicates the IIF’s report in October, 20144.

Although different data sources can vary substantively, we can see that capital flows

have increased during the previous years. This suggests that the Chinese economy has

become more integrated into the global economy and hence more exposed to the

fluctuation of international markets. In particular, the rapid increase of out-flow capital

points to the use of more opportunities to evade capital controls, which questions the

effectiveness of capital controls.

    b) China’s Hot Money Flows in Recent Years




Another way to evaluate the impact of capital controls is to calculate hot money flows,

defined as the difference between capital inflows and the increase of foreign reserves.

In theory all foreign exchange from international transactions must be forwarded

through banks to the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) and be

exchanged as RMB. Therefore, if the capital inflow is larger than the increase of

reserves there should be a hot money outflow which cannot be tracked by official

records.




We have calculated the hot money inflows of China between 2006 and 2012, and report

them in Table 2. We can see that the hot money fluctuated dramatically during this

period. In the beginning and the end there is hot money outflow, while in the middle

years there is hot money inflow. In the year of 2012, the outflow of hot money

skyrocketed to 326.7 billion. The hot money volume itself may be more relevant to the

market expectation of Chinese economy and the appreciation of RMB, but such a huge

increase can also be regarded as indicating that the impact of capital controls is

weakening.

       c) Capital flows since the SPFTZ




Since the start of the SPFTZ on 30th, September, 2013, capital flows of China have

increased. Table 3 is based on the Balance of Payments of China in recent quarters6.

Before the start of the SPFTZ, the inflow and outflow volumes were about 300-400

billion US dollars. From the fourth quarter of 2013, the capital outflow increased

gradually to US dollar 620 billion. The capital inflow shows a more rapid increase,

from US dollar 402 billion to 636 billion, more than a half increase in three quarters.

3. A Price Spread Test


We have shown that the capital flows in and out of China have increased in recent years,

and this increase has speeded up since the start of the SPFTZ. But the increase of capital

flows cannot itself be treated as a proxy for lowered capital control impact. If every

flow must acquire a permit from the government, volume increases can simply indicate



1 These other investment figures may seem too big, but a relatively large “Other Investment” is normal in China’s

Balance of Payments. Some analysts think there hides “hot money” flows in this account.
                                                      10
a busy government. A more direct test of capital control impact of the SPFTZ is to

check whether there exist substantial cross-border arbitrage opportunities for a

considerable period of time after the introduction of the SPFTZ. According to the law

of one price, if capital flows were free, there should be no significant and persistent

price differences for the same financial assets across the border of China. As Ma (2008)

pointed out, when price and flow measures are consistent with each other, one may

arrive at an easy conclusion regarding capital mobility, but when they point in different

directions, price evidence should be given more weight. In the following we conduct

price tests for the impact of China’s capital controls since the SPFTZ.


       a) The Offshore Exchange Market and the CNH


We already reported that the start of the SPFTZ has induced more capital flows in and

out of China. Therefore, assessment of its impact on capital controls can be achieved

by studying the price spread between CNY and CNH 1 . The CNY is the onshore

exchange rate of RMB, while the CNH is the offshore exchange rate of RMB in Hong

Kong, China. If capital controls have been loosened, this price spread should show a

tendency to diminish since the founding of SPFTZ.




       b) Data description




We can obtain the CNH daily exchange rate data from both Wind Database and



1   There is currently a dual system of RMB markets, see Chen and Whalley (2013)
                                                         11
Bloomberg. The time period is from 08/31/2012 to 09/30/2014, with September 29th,

2013 on which the SPFTZ was founded at the middle of the interval. The source of

CNY daily exchange rate data is the FRED Economic Data by the Federal Reserve

Bank of St. Louis, U.S. Although the People’s Bank of China also provide the daily

CNY data, we can use the data from FRED because it is more convenient when

comparing with other international data (for example the exchange rate of Euro).




The use of daily data brings a problem of the time gap and mismatch in transaction

dates. All the financial transaction are stopped during the weekends and holidays. While

the weekend’s data are the same all over the world, the holidays date in different

countries can vary significantly. In the FRED Data there is no transaction on the U.S.

federal holidays including New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, President’s

Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor’s Day, Columbus Day, Veterans Day,

Thanksgiving and Christmas. The CNH transaction takes in the Hong Kong Special

Administrative Region (HKSAR), where the holidays are even more complex with

three kinds: Chinese, western and local holidays. Therefore, the CNH transaction stops

on the Lunar New Year’s Day, Ching Ming Festival, Birthday of Buddha, Tuen Ng

Festival, HKSAR Establishment Day, Chinese Mid-Autumn Day, Chinese National

Day, Chung Yeung Festival and Christmas. In order to make data comparable, all such

mismatched data are deleted.




Altogether we have 493 matched transaction days and 493 pairs of CNY and CNH

                                           12
exchange rate data. The price spread of CNY to CNH can be easily computed, and we

draw a chart for it as Fig.4.




  Source: Authors’ computation based on the Wind, Fred and Bloomberg Databases




From Fig.4 we can see that generally speaking the start of the SPFTZ has brought the

price spread of CNY and CNH closer. In the year before the SPFTZ, the price spread

reached 300 basis points (1 base point equals 0.0001). But since the SPFTZ, especially

since later March, the price spread seldom reached 100 base points. Considering that

the financial liberal policy of supporting RMB cross-border use in the SPFTZ was

declared on February 21st, 2014, the price spread data fits this policy quite well.




There are several periods when the price spread is relatively high, most obviously from

early January to mid-March. It emphasizes that we cannot explain the movement of that

price spread only by the financial policy in SPFTZ. In order to give a reasonable
                                            13
explanation of such disparities, we need consider other elements determining the

exchange rates of CNY and CNH.




    c) The relationship between CNY and CNH




Since CNY and CNH are essentially the prices of the same currency, the yuan, the

fundamental elements such as exports, imports, price level and money supply are the

same. This is the reason why the two prices are very similar most of the times. In fact,

the correlation of them in the period of study is 0.9901.




As to the short term elements, the CNY is the price on the domestic foreign exchange

market, and there will be intervention by the Chinese authorities, usually the People’s

Bank of China. After the end of each transaction day, the People’s Bank of China will

decree a mid-price of CNY according to the closing prices of RMB to other currencies

on that day. The Center for Foreign Exchange Transactions of China is authorized to

publish this mid-price on the next transaction day, and all the brokers in the foreign

exchange market must offer a price within designated limits of this mid-price. The limit

was 0.3 percent from the reform of exchange rate mechanism in July 2005, enlarged to

0.5 percent in May 2007, enlarged again to 1 percent in April 2012, and currently is no

more than 2 percent, all in both directions. Although the limit is enlarged steadily,

considering that the main brokers in the market are the state-controlled banks, the CNY

is more a planning price than a market price.

                                           14
Because the offshore CNH market is much smaller than the onshore CNY market, there

is no surprise that for most of the time the CNH shows the same movement as the CNY.

But since there are less financial controls in HKSAR, the CNH is more sensitive to the

changes in international capital markets. This can be seen by analyzing the movements

of US dollar.

Fig.5 depicts the trend of trade weighted USD index and CNY in the past two years.

We can see basically the two series are negative correlated. Their correlation is -0.5821.

But in the period from mid-January to early April, 2014, while the USD index kept

stable at around 77.0, the CNY depreciated quickly from 6.06 to 6.24, with a loss in

value of more than 3%. This period corresponds to the relatively large positive price

spread between CNY and CNH. Similarly, from the mid-September the USD index has

appreciated from 78.5 to 81.3, but the CNY kept at about 6.14. This corresponds to the

negative price spread between CNY and CNH.

                                            15
As Chen and Whalley (2013) point out, the spread between CNH and CNY represents

the benefits of effective convertibility through market transactions. We can draw a

conclusion that, although CNH show the same movements along with CNY in most

time, there will be a relatively larger price difference between them if CNY moves in

the opposite direction to the USD. The underlying policy explanations for these two

periods are as follows. From mid-January to early April, 2014, Chinese authorities

manipulated the CNY to depreciate, which did not accord with the international

financial market, and the CNH value is higher than CNY. From later September,

Chinese authorities did not let the CNY depreciate as the US dollar appreciated, which

made the CNH value lower than the CNY.




Except for these two periods, the price spread between CNH and CNY is small since

the SPFTZ started. The market can operate more efficiently. This is evidence that the

financial liberalization of China has made some progress since SPFTZ, and the

effectiveness of capital controls is weaker.




4. The Effects of SPFTZ on China’s Capital Control: An Interest Parity Test




Although the price spread test is illuminating, we can conduct a formal price test by

analyzing the combination of onshore RMB interest rates, offshore US dollar interest




                                               16
rates and non-deliverable forward (NDF1) exchange rates. If the differences between

onshore RMB interest rates and those implied by the offshore NDFs in conjunction with

US dollar Libor show a tendency to diminish, it will be direct support for the position

that the impact of capital controls is lower after the SPFTZ.




     a) Theoretical Foundation




The theoretical base for such a price test is Interest Rate Parity, which requires the

revenue of the same money should be equal in different currencies if there is no capital

control. Therefore, the forward exchange rate of the home currency is linked by

arbitrage to its spot rate and the dollar offshore interest rate through the covered interest

parity condition:

             F=         $                                                                        (1)

Where the F is the forward exchange rate of RMB, S is the spot rate of RMB, r is the

                                    $
interest rate of RMB, and               is the offshore interest rate of dollar.




However, because there are capital controls in mainland China, non-residents may not

have full access to the onshore credit market. Since there is no capital control in

HKSAR, the NDF version of covered interest parity should hold:

            NDF = S          $                                                                     (2)


1 The NDF is defined as a cash-settled, short-term forward contract on a thinly traded or non-convertible foreign
currency, where the profit or loss at the time at the settlement date is calculated by taking the difference
between the agreed upon exchange rate and the spot rate at the time of settlement, for an agreed upon notional
amount of funds.
                                                          17
where i is the NDF-implied yield of RMB offshore:

                          $
          i=        1+        −1                                                 (3)




There can be a significant difference between r and i if capital controls are highly

effective. Therefore, the onshore and offshore interest rate spread            −       is an

indication of the impact of cross-border capital controls.




    b) Data Description




In order to perform the price test, we need to carefully choose the financial instruments

for their maturity, credit and liquidity. If the instruments share the same maturity, issued

by the same private parties, and enjoy the same liquidity, the price test can work better.

We choose Shibor, the Shanghai Interbank Offered Rate, as the domestic interest rate.

Shibor is computed by the interbank offer rates of 18 main banks in China, and is

regarded as the benchmark rate in the money market. The Shibor rates include overnight,

one week, two weeks, one month, three months, six months, nine months and one year.

Shibor rates shorter than three months are mainly determined by supply and demand in

the money market, while those equal and longer than three months are determined more

by expectation of future interest rates.




To compute the implied interest rate in the offshore market, we need the spot and NDF

exchange rates of RMB, as well as the US dollar offshore interest rates. Spot exchange

                                            18
rates of RMB are easy to obtain, and the Libor rates are suitable for dollar offshore

interest rates. As to the NDF exchange rates, there are currently four NDF markets for

the dollar-RMB transactions, namely New York, London, Hong Kong and Singapore.

We choose the NDF rates in Hong Kong as it is the largest NDF market.




In order to minimize the mismatch between different data sources, all the data are drawn

from the DZH database2. The data period is from October 8, 2006, the beginning date

of Shibor data, to the latest trade date when we executed this study, November 6, 2014.




     c) Price Test Based on 3-month Shibor

Fig.6 is the yield gap between onshore and offshore RMB, which is computed by

subtracting the implied offshore rates from domestic Shibor rates. If compared with the

study of Ma (2008) for the period 1999 to 2006, we find that the yield gap seldom

reached 6 percent after 2006, while it often exceeded 8 percent before that. This is

consistent with Ma (2008) that the yield gap has narrowed since the July 2005 policy

change, when the PBoC announced that RMB will peg to a basket of currencies rather

than the US dollar and can float according to market supply and demand.




The evolution of RMB yield gaps in Fig.6 moves through several phases. The first is

from September 2007 to the end of 2008, when the gaps peaked in March 2008. The

second phase is from early 2009 to the end of 2011, when the gaps increased steadily

from minus 1.5% to 5%. The third phase is from January 2012 to the end of 2014, when

the gaps maintain a relatively narrow change between 2.6% to 5.3%.




Formal statistical analysis can say more precisely what is the effect of SPFTZ on such

yield gaps. We split the data period T into two sub-periods: the first period          is

before SPFTZ, from 2006/10/08 to 2013/09/30, and the second period           !   is after

SPFTZ, from 2013/10/01 to the latest trade day in our study, 2014/11/06. We regress

the absolute value of yield gap to time, and see whether there is any trend change since

the founding of the SPFTZ.

 Note: Y is the absolute value of 3-month onshore/offshore yield gap, T is time trend.




From Table 4 we can make the following observations. Firstly, the yield gap is different

from zero, which means there are still effective capital controls in China. Secondly, the

start of the SPFTZ has alleviated capital controls. In the whole period there is a time

trend for the absolute yield gap to increase (0.0018), but since the start of the SPFTZ

this trend has changed to a decrease (－0.0038). A dummy +! = 1 when the time

period is    !   equals －0.2936. Thirdly, there is a regime break on the last day of

September 2013, when the SPFTZ was founded. If we do a Chow Test using the ESS,

we can reject the null hypothesis that there is no structural change between the two

periods.

5. The Effects of SPFTZ on China’s Capital Control: A Granger Causality Test




       a) Theoretical Foundation




Our last test on the effects of the SPFTZ employs a Granger causality test based on

VAR model. The theoretical basis of such test is quite straightforward, as expressed in

Huang (2014). If the capital control were totally effective, we may expect the expansion

of China’s monetary supply can only affect transmission internationally through trade

channels such as production, exports, investments, instead of financial channels

including interest rates and exchange rates. In fact, using data from the period 2000-

2012, Huang (2014) finds that the international transmission of the PBoC’s balance

sheet expansion is more through “trade channels” than through “financial channels.”




There are three types of methodologies for empirical examination of the international

transmission mechanisms of monetary policy: simulation experiments, dynamic

stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models, and the VAR approach. The advantage

of a VAR model is that it requires minimal identifying restrictions on the underlying

Chinese economic structure, which may differ significantly from the standard theory3.




The difference between us and Huang (2014) lies in that we check the expansion of



3   See also Christiano et al. (1996), Kim (2001), Mackowiak (2007), among others.
                                                          22
China’s M2 rather than the PBoC’s balance sheet. In China’s financial system the

commercial banks play an important role in monetary policy practices, especially the

so called “Big Four”4. In Fig.2 (see page 3) we can see the M2 increase ratio is more

stable than that of M0 or M1. Therefore the PBoC’s balance sheet may not be an

adequate representation of China’s monetary expansion.




     b) Data description




We study the relations between China’s M2 ratio increase and the interest rates of the

US and Japan. The US interest rate is the monthly average of federal fund rates, and the

Japanese interest rate is the average of commercial loan rates. The sample period is

from August 2008, the beginning month of China’s M2 data available, to the latest

Japanese exchange rate we can get, August 2014. Altogether there are 37 months of

data. All the data are drawn from the DZH database, and the data trends are depicted in

Fig.7.

Bank of China, Bank of China, and China Construction Bank.

                             Source: the DZH Database

From Fig.7 we can see while the M2 of China expanded monthly at a high speed of 14%

to 16%, the interest rates of both the US and Japan show a decreasing trend. Of course

such a decrease may result from the quantitative easing of the US Fed and the Japan’s

Abenomics financial policy, without much relevance to China’s monetary expansion.

Only by econometric analysis can we say whether there is Granger causality between

China’s M2 increase and the interest rates of the US and Japan.




    c) Granger Causality Test




We analyze a VAR model with three variables, China’s M2 increase ratio, the US

interest rate and Japan’s interest rate. We make two Granger tests, one using the data

between period 2011m8 to 2013m9, before the start of the SPFTZ (VAR1); the other

using all the samples (VAR2). We wish to see whether there is any change in the

Granger causalities among the variables. All the necessary tests for time series are
                                          24

Notes: Those variables that are not significant at a 10% level in both VAR models are

                                          omitted.

From Table 5 we can see that, before the start of the SPFTZ (model VAR1) both interest

rates of the US and Japan are Granger causes of China’s M2, but the M2 is only the

Granger cause of the interest rate in the US at a relatively low significance (9.2%). After

the SPFTZ (model VAR2), the significance of the US interest rate as the Granger cause

of China’s M2 is higher, from 5.5% to 1%; so is the reverse causality that China’s M2

as the Granger cause of US interest rate, from 9.2% to 6.4%. The Chinese financial

market is connected to the international market more closely. This is likely because the

capital flow in and out of China is becoming easier after the start of the SPFTZ.




6. Concluding Remarks




                                             25
In this paper we discuss preliminary evidence as to the effects of the SPFTZ on China’s

capital controls. China still maintains relatively rigorous capital controls to keep the

exchange rate stable along with monetary policy independence. But the foreign reserve

accumulation and money supply induced has presented China with a dilemma. The start

of the SPFTZ is a trial to introduce a middle combination of exchange rate floating and

capital account liberalization.




We employ three methods to test the SPFTZ’s impact on capital controls: price spread

tests between CNH and CNY, RMB yield gaps between onshore and offshore markets,

and Granger causalities among China’s money supply and the foreign interest rates. All

these tests give consistent results that the impact of capital controls is lower since the

SPFTZ.




With the further successful practice of the SPFTZ and more pilot policies replicated in

China as a whole, we can anticipate China’s capital control will diminish further in the

following decade. China will likely choose floating exchange rate, free capital account

and independent monetary policy, just as other developed economies do, including the

United States, the European Union and Japan.
