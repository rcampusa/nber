                                                 ABSTRACT

           Recent empirical      evidence suggests that the long-run dependence        in financial market

volatility is best characterized by a slowly mean-reverting        fractionally integrated process.     At the

same time, much shorter-lived volatility dependencies are typically observed with high-frequency

intradaily     returns.    This paper draws on the information        arrival, or mixture-of-distributions

hypothesis      interpretation   of the latent volatility   process in rationalizing   this behavior.        By

interpreting     the overall volatility as the manifestation    of numerous heterogeneous       information

arrivals, sudden bursts of volatility typically will have both short-run and long-run components.

Over intradaily frequencies, the short-run decay stands out most clearly, while the impact of the

highly persistent processes will be dominant over longer horizons. These ideas are confirmed by our

empirical analysis of a one-year time series of intradaily five-minute Deutschemark            - U.S. Dollar

returns.      Whereas traditional time series based measures for the temporal dependencies              in the

absolute returns give rise to very conflicting results across different intradaily sampling frequencies,

the corresponding semiparametric estimates for the order of fractional integration remain remarkably

stable.      Similarly,   the autocorrelogram   for the low-pass filtered absolute returns, obtained by

annihilating periods in excess of one day, exhibit a striking hyperbolic rate of decay.

                                                   1. INTRODUCTION

A large body of literature seeking to characterize the long-run dependencies in the interdaily volatility
of speculative returns has emerged over the past decade. 1 More recently, there has been an
explosicm in the amount of empirical research devoted to the determination                              of high frequency
intradaily return volatility dynamics. 2 Unfortunately, the empirical estimates pertaining to the degree
of volatili~ persistence reported in these two strands of the literature often appear at odds with one
another.     While studies using daily or lower frequency returns generally point to a very high degree
of intertemporal volatility dependence, the estimated half-lives of most identifiable intraday volatili~
shocks seem rather low, with any noticeable effects on the overall volatility level typically gone in
a matter of hours or less. The analysis in the present paper provides a theoretical justification for
these seemingly contradictory findings.              By interpreting the overall volatility as the aggregation of
numerous independent volatility components, each endowed with their own dependence structure,
we show how the aggregate volatility process may inherit the kind of long-run dependencies
associated      with     long-memory,         or    fractiomlly      integrated     processes.         Consequently,     the
autocorrelations       for more distantly spaced absolute or squared returns,                     should exhibit a slow
hyperbolic rate of decay, independent of the sampling frequency.
           This mixture-of-distributions        hypothesis interpretation of market volatility as resulting from
the aggregation of numerous components type processes apply equally well across most financial
markets and instruments.           However, for concreteness the empirical analysis in the paper is focussed
on the foreign exchange market, and a one-year time span of 5-minute Deutschemark - U.S. Dollar
(DM-$) returns.        Consistent with the notion of an underlying component structure, we find that the
dynamic response of the absolute 5-minute foreign exchange returns varies systematically across

                                                                1
some of the most important and readily identifiable macroeconomic announcements.              Furthermore,
the volatility process is shown to exhibit the kind of long-memory dependencies implied by the
theoretical aggregation of such multiple individual component processes.             This interpretation of
volatility is further underscored by the fact that the corresponding estimates for the fractional orders
of integration for the absolute returns remain remarkably stable across all of the intradaily sampling
frequencies.
        Although these empirical findings consistently point to the presence of long-memory, the
pronounced      intradaily   volatili~   patterns,   known to exist in most financial markets,     severely
complicate any further direct analysis of the long-run volatility dependencies.      However, by low-pass
filtering the absolute intradaily returns, thus annihilating any cyclical behavior with a periodicity of
less than one day, we demonstrate how it is possible to uncover the salient long-run volatility
dynamics using standard correlation based measures.           Specifically, whereas the autocorrelogram for
the raw absolute intradaily returns periodically turn negative, the autocorrelograrn for the low-pass
filtered absolute intradaily returns display a striking hyperbolic rate of decay. Consequently, these
filtered returns constitute an ideal basis for more comprehensive analyses of the important volatili~
determinants,     as illustrated by our estimation of the amouncement           effects associated with the
regularly scheduled release of different macroeconomic “news”.
        The plan for the remainder of the paper is as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews some of the
existing literature on the intradaily dependencies in the foreign exchange market.         This section also
presents preliminary estimation results for specific announcement effects that point to the existence
of multiple volatility components and long-run dependencies. The mixture-of-distributions        hypothesis
and the temporal aggregation argument are presented in section 3, where we show that, under
suitable assumptions concerning the underlying component structure, the spectrum for the overall
volatility process implies an eventual slow hyperbolic rate of decay in the autocorrelations for the
absolute returns, irrespective of the sampling frequency. The theoretical developments are validated
by the empirical analysis in section 4, which reports the results obtained from two alternative
spectral-domain estimators for the degree of fractional integration in the volatility process across a
range of different intradaily sampling frequencies.          These findings are entirely consistent with the
time-domain estimate for the fractional order of integration determined by the hyperbolic rate of
decay in the autocorrelations for the low-pass filtered absolute returns presented in section 5. This
section also illustrates how the low-pass filtered absolute returns allow for important new insights

into the structure behind the determination of the observed volatility.          Section 6 concludes,


                                 2. PRELIMINARY DATA ANALYSIS

In order to motivate the subsequent theoretical developments, the following section describes the
salient empirical features that pertain to the volatility in the DM-$ foreign exchange market.
However, the general ideas and empirical results apply equally well to other financial markets and
high frequency return series; see, e.g., Andersen and Bollerslev (1996a) for a discussion of the
parallels between the empirical properties of high frequency foreign exchange and equity index
returns.    The DM-$ exchange rate data under study consist of all the quotes that appeared on the
interbank Reuters network during the October 1, 1992 through September 29, 1993 sample period.
The data were collected and provided by Olsen and Associates.              Each quote contains a bid and an
ask price along with the time to the nearest even second,           The exchange rate corresponding to the
endpoint of a given five-minute interval was determined as the interpolated average between the
preceding and immediately following quotes weighted linearly by their inverse relative distance to
this endpoint.     The n’ th five-minute return for day ~, ~,~, is then simply defined as the difference
between the midpoint of the logarithmic bid and ask at the appropriately spaced time intervals.              All
288 five-minute returns during the 24-hour daily trading cycle are used, but in order to avoid
confounding the evidence by the decidedly slower trading patterns over the weekends, all returns
from Friday 21:00 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) through Sunday 21:00 GMT were excluded; see
Bollerslev and Domowitz (1993) for a detailed analysis of the quote activity in the DM-$ interbank
market and a justification for this “weekend” definition. Similarly, to preserve the number of returns
associated with one week we make no corrections for any worldwide or country specific Holidays
that occurred during the sample period.       All in all, this leaves us with a sample of 260 days, for a
total of 74,880 5-minute intraday return observations; i.e., R, , t= 1,2 ,...,74,880,          where ~r.l).zaa+

n
    ~ R,,., for n=l,2,.,.,288,   and 7=1,2 ,..,,260.     For further discussion of the data construction we
refer to Andersen and Bollerslev (1996a), where the same dataset has previously been analyzed from
a different perspective.
           Aside   from   the numerically   small,     but statistically   significant,   negative   first order
autocorrelation     coefficient of -0.040, the 5-minute returns appear to be well approximated by a




                                                        3
martingale     process. 3      However,       the returns are clearly not independent,                  as the first order
autocorrelation coefficient for IR!I equals 0.309. Also, the Ljung-Box statistic for up to tenth order
serial correlation in the absolute returns takes a value of 36,680, which is highly significant at
virtually any level in the corresponding asymptotic chi-square distribution.
           While the latter statistics are strongly suggestive of intraday volatility clustering,                          their
overwhelming significance is in part attributable to the strong intradaily volatility pattern that is
present in most financial markets. The importance of this phenomenon for the DM-$ rates is obvious
from figure 1, which graphs an estimate of the spectrum for the intradaily absolute 5-minute
returns. 4 The spectrum has a distinct peak at the daily frequency of approximately 2 m/288 =
0.0218, along with well defined peaks at the corresponding                        seasonal harmonics of 4“m/288 =
0.0436, 6“T1288 = 0.0654, 8. Ir/288 = 0,0873.                      This pronounced daily periodicity is also evident
in the autocorrelogram for the absolute 5-minute returns depicted out to a lag of 2,880, or ten days,
in figure 2, The intradaily pattern induces a distorted U-shape in the sample autocorrelations across
each day, with the autocorrelations spaced half-a-day apart actually turning negative.                          The shape of
the underlying intradaily volatility pattern over the 24-hour trading cycle in the foreign exchange
market, and the close connection to the market activity in the various financial centers around the
world, have previously been documented by Andersen and Bollerslev (1996a), Baillie and Bollerslev
(1991), Dacorogna et al, (1993), Ito, Lyons and Melvin (1996), and Muller et al, (1990), among
others.5
           Taken together, these results clearly point to the importance of appropriately accounting for
the strong intradaily volatility patterns when analyzing high frequency dynamic dependencies, both




      3 The small negative autocorrelation may be explained by the asymmetric positioning of quotes by the foreign exchange
dealers as a way to manage their invento~ positions, thus causing the midpoint of the quoted prices to move around in a
fashion analogous to the well documented bid-ask bounce effect on organized exchanges. This is also consistent with the
results in Bollerslev and Domowitz (1993), who Ftnd similarly constructed 5-minute DM-$ returns over a 3 months period
in 1989 to be negatively correlated, while the first order autocomelation for artificial constructed 5-minute pseudo transactions
price returns is actually positive. Similarly, the foreign exchange transactions prices analyzed by Goodhart, Ito and Payne
(1995) show no negative correlation between subsequent returns.

     4 The spectrum is estimated as the smoothed sample periodogram based on a triangular kernel with a bandwidth of ten;
see, e.g, , Hamilton (1994) or Priestley (1971). To allow for easier interpretation of the subsequent results, the plot is given
on a double logarithmic scale.

     5 Equally pronounced patterns have been documented for other financial markets, including the well known irrtradaily
U-shape for equity market volatility; see e.g., Wood, McInish and Ord (1985) and Harris (1986).

                                                               4
within and across different markets.          However, even after explicitly modeling the typical intradaily
patterns, several recent studies have found that the estimation of standard GARCH type models for
the non-periodic      intradaily volatility clustering tends to falter, in the sense rhat the estimated
parameters obtained for different intradaily sampling frequencies are at odds with the temporal
aggregation results developed by Drost and Nijman (1993), as well as the consistency theorems for
continuous time diffusions and misspecified ARCH models derived by Nelson (1990, 1992); for
existing evidence along these lines pertaining to the DM-$ rates analyzed here see Andersen and
BoIlerslev (1996a), Ghose and Kroner (1996) and Guillaume, Pictet and Dacorogna (1995).                            Thus,
it appears that multiple volatility components are necessarily required in order to fully explain the
complex intradaily dependencies that are present in all the major financial markets. b
           The attempt to associate each of the underlying volatility components with explicit economic
factors seems destined to fail.          Meanwhile, the regularly scheduled releases of macroeconomic
figures have been shown to induce heightened overall volatility immediately following the “news”
release for a number of different financial instruments; for studies on the impact of macroeconomic
announcements on high-frequency foreign exchange rates see Andersen and Bollerslev ( 1996b),
Eddelbtittel and McCurdy (1996), Ederington and Lee (1993, 1995a, 1995b), Goodhart et al, (1993),
Harvey and Huang (1991), Hogan and Melvin (1994), Ito and Roley (1987), and Payne (1996). Not
surprisingly,    the actual effect tends to vary according to the type of announcement.                       From the
analysis    in Andersen      and Bollerslev       (1996b) the three regularly           scheduled     macroeconomic
announcements with the largest instantaneous impact on DM-$ volatility during the present sample
period are the U.S. Employment Report, the biweekly Bundesbank meetings and the U.S. Durable
Goods figures.’      To gauge the dynamic impact of each of these events, we consider the following
simple AR(1) model for the standardized five-minute DM-$ absolute returns, augmented by a
separate short-lived AR(1) component,




     6 A multiple components, or Heterogeneous, ARCH model have been proposed by Muller et al. (1995) to explicitly
cap[ure this phenomenon in the modelling of high-frequency foreign exchange returns. Components type model for daily
stock return and interest rate volatility have also been estimated by Engle and Lee (1993) and Palm and Urbain (1995), and
Jones, Lament and Lurnsdaine (1996), respectively.

     7 The U.S. Employment Report, Durable Goods figures, and Business Inventories analyzed below, are all amounted
on a monthly schedule.

where the IJt) indicator variable equals unity if an amouncement                  of the given type, N, occurred
during the t‘th time interval and zero otherwise, while the “news” dummy, D~(t), equals unity for
the two hours immediately following the event; i.e., D~(t) = I~(t) + I~(t-l) + . . . + IJt-23).                      In
order to avoid confounding the dynamic dependencies by the strong intradaily volatility patterns, the
returns in equation (1) are standardized by the average absolute return for the particular 5-minute
interval; i.e. , 1~1 = 260” IR(,.[).zgg+”[ (~;:!l%r-l)zsg+nl)-’         for n=l>2!..!288!      and ~=1,2,.,260.8
The first order sample autocorrelation for these standardized returns, i.e., IJt) and D~(t) = O for
all t, equals ~ = 0.273.        However, the estimates obtained from the simple descriptive model in
equation (1) suggest that the three major amouncements                   result in their own distinct volatility
response pattern.     Specifically, for the Employment Report $~ = 5.346 (1.424) and d~ = -O.081
(0.050), respectively, where the numbers in parentheses represent robust standard errors.                        These
estimates therefore indicate an immediate increase in the volatility, but largely unaltered short-run
dynamic dependencies in the two hours following the release of the report. Meanwhile, the estimates
for the Bundesbank biweekly meetings are 1.394 (O.651) and 0.102 (0.054), suggestive of a slower
rate of decay in the volatility component associated with this “news” release.                 The Durable Goods
report also elevates volatility, $N = 1.801 (0.687), but the estimated short-run decay is actually
faster than average with & = -0.130 (O.037), or j + & = 0.144,                        Many other announcements
share this dynamic pattern. For instance, for the Business Inventory figures the same two parameters
are O.021 (O.11O) and -0.094 (O.045), respectively.
         This relatively rapid decay of the readily identifiable “news” effects at the intradaily
frequencies is in sharp contrast to the well documented highly persistent volatility clustering that is
present at the lower interdaily frequencies.          A voluminous literature surveyed in Bollerslev, Chou
and Kroner (1992) have argued that the volatility processes for most speculative returns are close to
being integrated in the variance in the sense of the IGARCH model of Engle and Bollerslev (1986);
for evidence pertaining to daily foreign exchange rates see, e, g., Baillie and Bollerslev (1989),
Bollerslev and Engle (1993) and Hsieh (1989).                  More recently however, Baillie, Bollerslev and




     8 Much more elaborate standardization procedures for characterizing the average intradaily volatility patterns have
recently been developed by Andersen and Bollerslev (1996a, 1996b) and Dacorogna et al, (1993).

                                                           6
Mikkelsen (1996), Dacorogna et al. (1993), and Harvey (1994), have questioned these earlier
findings, on the grounds that the long-run dependence in the volatility of interdaily foreign exchange
returns is better characterized by a slowly mean-reverting fractionally integrated process, 9 While
shocks to the daily volatility process are highly persistent, it appears that they eventually dissipate,
albeit at a very slow hyperbolic rate. As discussed in section 4, the approximate linear behavior of
the estimated spectrum for IR, 1, when plotted on the double logarithmic scale in figure 1, is
consistent with this long-memory type dependence.                 Similarly, the rapid initial decay followed by
the decidedly slower rate of dissipation for the longer-run autocorrelations                      in figure 2 are also
suggestive about the existence of long-memory type dependencies, although the marked intradaily
periodicity severely complicates the interpretation of the overall pattern in the autocorrelogram                       for
the raw absolute returns.


                            3. THE THEORETICAL VOLATILITY MODEL

This section demonstrates that the mixture-of-distributions             hypothesis, originally advocated by Clark
(1973), Epps and Epps (1976), and Tauchen and Pitts (1983), provides a framework for rationalizing
the complicated, and seemingly conflicting, behavior of the return volatility dynamics that exist at
the inter- and intradaily frequencies; see also the analyses in Andersen (1996), Harris (1987), Ross
(1989), and Taylor (1994).           Intuitively, the mixture-of-distributions         hypothesis stipulates that the
return generating process reflects the impact of a large number of imovations                        to the information
processes associated witi the economic factors of relevance for the valuation of the asset in question.
While the imovations,       by definition, are serially uncorrelated, they are not likely to be independent
since information of a particular kind tends to be positively autocorrelated, thus inducing the kind
of dependence in the absolute, or second order, moments of the returns discussed above.
         To formalize these ideas, consider the following representation for the intradaily returns,

    9 Similar long-run dependencies in daily stock market volatility have been observed by Bollerslev and Mikkelsen ( 1996a,
1996b), Breidt, Crato and de Lima (1995), Ding and Granger (1996), Ding, Granger and Engle (1993), Gallant, Hsieh and
Tauchen (1994), Granger and Ding (1996a, 1996b), Liu (1995), and McCurdy and Michaud (1996).

where m~denotes the conditional mean of the raw returns, rl , Z, is an i. id. stochastic process with
mean zero and variance one, and the non-negative, positively serially-correlated mixing variable, V, ,
serves as a proxy for the aggregate amount of information flow to the market. Equation (2) assumes
the typical form associated with the discrete time ARCH class of models in which both m, and V,
are assumed measurable                   with respect to the time t-1 observable   information set, so that the
conditional variance of the return equals Vart.[(~ ) = Var~.i(r, ) = V, . More generally, however,
the information flow is not directly observable, and V, is naturally modeled as a latent, or stochastic,
volatility process; see, e.g., Andersen (1992) for further discussion.             Of course, lacking additional
assumptions regarding the temporal dependencies in the V, process, the model in equation (2) is void
of testable empirical implications in regards to the observed volatility dynamics.
        The rest of this section develops a specific representation of equation (2) that affords an
interpretation of volatility as governed by heterogeneous information arrivals, while retaining the
capacity of reconciling the seemingly conflicting evidence regarding volatility at the various return
frequencies, and producing interesting empirical implications that are directly testable.


                3.1 Volatility as a Manifestation of Heterogeneous Information Arrivals

Motivated by the empirical observations in section 2, we assume that the volatility process reflects
the aggregate impact of N distinct information arrival processes; say Vj,~>0,             where j = 1, 2, . . .,N.
Also, following Andersen (1994), the temporal dependence of each constituent component is
expressed in terms of a standard log-normal stochastic volatility, or Exponential SARV, model,


        Vj, [   =   O!j” Vj, [.[   +   tj, [ ,                                                                 (3)


where ~j,t ~ ln(Vj,, ) - ~j , ~j = E[ln(Vj,r )], and the ~j,~’sare assumed to be i.i.d. N(O,~ ) for all j,
j=l,2   ,, ... N. The logarithmic formulation in equation (3) ensures that the number of information
arrivals dictated by the j ‘th component process, Vj,l = exp(~j,, + ~j ), is positive. The autoregressive
coefficient, ~j , reflects the degree of persistence in the j ‘th information arrival process.        Consistent
with the notion of positively serially-correlated             but stationary “news” arrivals, we restrict these
parameters to fall within the unit interval; i.e., O <            Uj   <   1.
        According to the mixture-of-distributions             hypothesis, each information arrival process has an
effect on the aggregate latent volatility process.          Assume that this combined effect may be
represented by the geometric average of the constituent volatility components,


        V, = exp(v, + p.),                                                                             (4)


where V[ = Z!.,   JJj,t and   p, = Z!. ~pj . Note, the spectrum for the aggregate v, process at frequency
u is simply given by the sum of the spectra for the N underlying independent AR(1) processes, i.e.,




where O < ti < m. For small values of N, this spectral representation for v, can in principle be
used to maximize Whittle’s frequency domain approximation to the likelihood function for ln(R~) =
p, + v, + ln(Z~) as specified by equations (2), (3) and (4); see Breidt, Crato and de Lima (1995)
for an application of this frequency-domain           based likelihood procedure in the estimation of a
stochastic volatility model.      Alternatively,   the model may be estimated by any one of the Markov
Chain Monte Carlo methods described in Jacquier, Poison and Rossi (1994) and Shephard (1996),
or by the Efficient Method of Moments developed by Gallant and Tauchen (1996) as applied by
Andersen and Lund (1996) and Gallant, Hsieh and Tauchen (1994).               Yet, in the actual empirical
implementation    with high frequency data, a large number of heterogeneous            information arrival
processes is likely called for, rendering any of these direct estimation procedures for determining the
~j’s as well as the remaining model parameters intractable.
        In light of this, suppose that the heterogeneity in the individual component processes, as
dictated by the AR(1) parameters, may be approximated by the normalized beta distribution,


        dFa(a)    = 2 “B(p,q)-l “cr’p-i“(1-a2)q”1da ,                                                   (6)


where O < a < 1, 0 < p, 1 < q < 2, and the beta function is given by B(p,q) =              ~~xP-l(l-x)q-ldx
= I_’(p)“l?(q) “17(p+q)-l. This parametric density function allows for a wide variety of shapes in the
bounded distribution of the ~j ‘s, and thus provides a flexible way of characterizing different forms
for dynamic dependencies in the latent information arrival processes; see, e.g., Johnson and Kotz
(1970) for a discussion of the beta distribution.      Moreover, this particular distributional assumption

                                                        9
regarding the heterogeneity in the underlying Pj,[ processes has a number of testable implications in
regards to the dynamic dependencies in the observable process for the absolute returns.
            Specifically, consider the situation in which the number of component processes is arbitrarily
large; i.e., N ~ m, so that N-l times the sum of the individual AR(1) spectra in equation (5)
converges           to the probability         weighted integral over the distribution               for the ~j coefficients. 10
Following Granger (1980), the resulting spectrum for the Vtprocess may then be evaluated as,


            fV(u) =               (27r)-1~~ c j ~ I 1- a“exp(-i” U) I‘2dFm(a)

                                  E;=.m[Np+kljl)       “I’(p+q-l+         ’/21jl)-’] “exp(-i’u”     j),


where ~ = lim~.. N-l Ey.l ~.                    Alternatively, the spectrum for the v, process maybe written as f,(u)

               , =.~ P(v,, j) “exp(-i” u “j), where < and P(P,, j) denote the variance and the j’th order
autocorrelation for V[, respectively.                Thus, by equating terms in the identical powers of j, it follows
that the autocorrelations for v, must be proportional to r(p + % Ij I)” J7(p+ q-1 + % Ij I)-1. This implies
that for large Ij 1, the autocorrelations for the aggregate latent logarithmic volatility process behaves

The dependence in v, will therefore dissipate at the slow hyperbolic rate of decay associated with the

      12 This same idea has recently been employed by Ding and Granger (1996) in imposing a slowly hyperbolically decaying
structure on the parameters in a GARCH type model for daily stock returns.

                                                                     10
covariance stationary fractionally integrated, or I(d), class of models, with d = 1- YZ.q,’3
          Of course, the mixture-of-distributions               hypothesis in equation (2) is phrased in terms of the
latent volatility process, V, , and not Vt. However, it is readily demonstrated that the long-run
dependence induced in the autocorrelations for v, , for O < d = 1- %q < % , carries over to any
positive power transform of the fundamental V, process; say V: = expd(v, + p,), where 0 > 0.
First, note that E(V~”V[_j)= [E(V~)]2exp[02”p(v, , j) ~]; see Granger and Newbold (1976) for a
general discussion regarding the autocorrelation                     functions of power transforms of normals, and
Andersen (1994) for a more detailed analysis of the particular case analyzed here.                            Consequently,
the j’ th order autocorrelation for V? may be written as,


          P(Y,      j)   =   [exp(02”~) -1 ]-’”[exp{02~p(~,,                 j)} - 1].                                       (9)


However,         p(v, , j)   -       j2d-’ +   O for j ~    m, so that by a first order Taylor series expansion

exp[oz”~”~(~t, j)] = 1 + 02”~’p(v,,                 j).   From this it follows immediately that, for large j,


         P(V!, j)        =       [exp(~’~)      -1 ]-’02”~op(u,, j)      -    j2d-’,                                       (lo)


Thus, the V; and the v, processes share the same long-run decay in their autocorrelation functions,
          More importantly, this long-run dependence in the V: process is propagated to the process
for the absolute returns raised to an arbitrary power, 2-6. To see this, note that from equation (2)
any power transform of the absolute returns is directly related to the latent volatility process by
lRt12° = V: IZ,12”.                   Thus, because Z: is an i, id.            process,   it follows that P( I~ 12“’, j) is
proportional to P(V:, j). The return volatility will therefore exhibit the identical slow hyperbolic rate
of decay whether measured in terms of the absolute returns, I~ 1, the squared returns, R?, or any
other power transform,                IR, 12“0;i.e., for large j,



         P(lR[120 , j)           -    jz”-1.
                                                                                                                           (11)



      13 The process y, is integrated of order d, or I(d), if (1-L)~y, is stationa~ and ergodic with a positive and bounded
spectrum across all frequencies, where the fractional differencing operator (1-L)~ is de ftned by the binomial expansion, ( l-L)~

hyperbolic rate. For recent surveys of the relevant literature see e.g. Bail lie (1996), Beran (1994) and Robinson ( 1994b).

                                                                    11
This result is important because it demonstrates how the long-memory features of volatility may arise
naturally through the interaction of a large number of diverse information processes.                     From a
conceptual perspective, it implies that the long-memory characteristics reflect inherent properties of
the return generating process, rather than external shocks that induce a structural shift in the volatility
process, as, e.g., suggested by Lamoureux and Lastrapes (1990).                  In other words, the mechanism
responsible for the fractional integration in volatility is generic to the returns process, and thus ever
present, so that with high frequency data it may be feasible to identify the manifestation of the
phenomenon even over relatively short spans of calendar time. We pursue this possibility in section
4.
        For now, we simply note that the result in equation (11) is consistent with the empirical
behavior of the autocorrelograms        for the various power transforms of daily equity returns reported
in Ding, Granger and Engle (1993).                Although Harvey and Streibel (1996) argue that it is
impossible,   by theoretical means, to ascertain which value of 0 will uniformly                   maximize the
autocorrelations   for the simple stochastic volatility model, corresponding to N = 1 in the current
setup, it is noteworthy that the sample autocorrelations              for the daily returns analyzed in Ding,
Granger and Engle (1993) attain their maxima for 0 very close to one-half. 14 Motivated by this
observation, we concentrate on the correlation structure for the intradaily absolute returns in the
empirical investigations reported on below. 15


                                  3.2 Temporal Aggregation of Volatility

The long memory characterization obtained in equation (11) may appear incomplete, because the
mixture-of-distributions     hypothesis is silent regarding the proper discrete time sampling interval for
the intradaily return series.        While the complex volatility structure entertained renders a full
distributional characterization of the volatility process for arbitrary sampling frequencies infeasible,
it is possible to show that the autocorrelations for temporally aggregated squared returns eventually
exhibit the identical long-run hyperbolic rate of decay across all sampling intervals.              In particular,
let Rfk) = RT.~+ R,.~.l + . . . + RT~.~+l= v:? “Z,.k + v;~-1 “Z,.k.l + . . . + ‘Yt.k+l “‘,k-k+l, where


     14 This phenomenon is referred to as the Taylor effect by Granger and Ding ( 1996b).

     15 For the 5-minute DM-$ returns the first order sample autocomelations for I~ I and R; equal 0.309 and 0.201,
respectively.

the weights corresponding to h = -k+ 1, -k+2, . . . . k-1 are given by (k - Ih I), and zero otherwise.
Consequently, for long lags, j,

                                =    (j   .k)z’-l




                                -   j2d-1.

That is, the long-memory features of the squared returns are consistent with the characteristics of
a self-similar process in the sense of Mandelbrot and van Ness (1968) and Mandelbrot and Wallis
(1969). Moreover, by analogy to the k = 1 case detailed above, if the temporally aggregated latent
volatility process is log-normally distributed, then the Iong-mn autocorrelation structure for I~) Iz 0
will be identical for all 6. Thus, in this case the autocorrelations for any power transform of the
temporally aggregated absolute returns should again eventually decay at the identical hyperbolic rate
of jzd-( u“respective of the sampling frequency, k. 17


                                                    3.3 Extensions

Before we describe the empirical findings pertaining to the propositions developed so far, we should



     16 For the 74,880 5-minute returns analyzed here an aggregation factor of k = 2 would correspond to the Lime series
of 37,440 10-minute returns, whereas k = 3 refers to the time series of 24,960 15-minute returns, etc.

     17 Previous empirical work with much simpler dependency structures have found the log-normal distribution to work
remarkably well at various return frequencies; see e.g. Andersen (1996), Shephard (1996) and Taylor (1994).

                                                           13
emphasize that the theoretical model readily accommodates extensions in a number of directions
which allow for added flexibility and realism in the portrayal of the volatili~ dynamics without
affecting the salient long-nm dependencies.                    Firstly, the mixture-of-distributions            hypothesis in
equations (2), (3) and (4) obviously neglects the repetitive intradaily pattern in the volatility that is
evident in the spectrum and the autocorrelogram for the 5-minute absolute DM-$ returns in figures
1 and 2. To incorporate this periodicity, let s(t) denote the stage of the periodic cycle at time t. A
slight modification of the model in equation (2), that explicitly allows for the pronounced intradaily
pattern, takes the form,


                                                                                                                             (13)


where the spectrum for the independent seasonal component S1,,([)has no mass at frequencies lower
than one day. 18 Since ln(R~ ) = p v + v~+ ln(S~~(~)
                                                  ) + ln(Z~ ), it follows that the long-run behavior,
as dictated by the spectrum for v~near frequency zero, is unaffected by this additional periodic
component.        Of course, the autocorrelation             structure in the absolute returns may be severely
influenced by the presence of the repetitive intradaily pattern. However, as demonstrated below, by
explicitly filtering out the daily and higher frequency dynamics in the absolute returns process, it is
possible to uncover the long-run hyperbolic rate of decay implied by the aggregation of the
component processes.
         Rather than being independent, the “news” arrivals might more realistically share a number
of common factors related to the state of the overall economy, while still exhibiting their own
separate influence on the valuation of the asset.                 To allow for such common effects, consider the
following generalization of the simple logarithmic AR(1) processes in equation (3),




where ~~~represents the de-meaned k’ th common factor, and the factor loading for the j‘ th arrival




     18 A particularly simple representation that restricts S,.,(,)to depend ody on the stage of the periodic cycle. s(t), has been
successtldly employed by Andersen and Bollerslev (1996a) in modelling the periodicity in the DM-$ return series analyzed
here. Note also that periodicities at, say, the weekty frequency may be accommodated analogously.

                                                                14
process associated with common factor k is denoted by ~j,~.19 provided that each of the common
factors are covariance stationary, so that their spectra are bounded across all frequencies, and that
the heterogeneity in the individual persistence parameters, aj , is determined by the beta distribution
in equation (6), it follows immediately by analogy to the results in Granger (1980), that the
hyperbolic      decay in the autocorrelation        function for V, is preserved under this more general
specification.     The independence assumption in equation (3) merely serves to simplify the exposition.
The implied degree of long-run dependence in the absolute returns remains intact under the more
realistic assumptions in equation (14).
          Finally, while the derivation above explicitly relies on the beta distribution in equation (6)
for characterizing      the heterogeneity in the individual component processes, it is obvious that the
degree of fractional integration, d = 1 - lA”q, is independent of the p parameter in the beta
distribution.      Only the shape of the distribution for a close to unity, as dictated by q, is important.
Intuitively,     if a sufficient number of the individual information                  arrival processes have high
persistence,     albeit ~j < 1, the aggregate information arrival process will display long-memory
characteristics,     This suggests that the aggregation argument behind the long-n.m dependence in Vt
is somewhat more general than portrayed above. Indeed, Lin ( 199 1) and Granger and Ding (1996a)
show that the so-called Generalized Integrated class of models, discussed by Granger (1987, 1988),
may arise through the aggregation of a closely related component type structure. 20


                         4. ESTIMATING LONG-MEMORY IN VOLATILITY

The theoretical framework developed in the previous section builds on the idea that the aggregate
market volatili~       represents    the manifestation      of numerous heterogeneous              information     arrival
processes; some with short-run volatility dependencies, others possessing more highly persistent
volatility patterns.    As time passes the short-run processes decay significantly, while the more highly
persistent processes remain influential. Hence, while sudden bursts of volatility typically will possess
both short-run and long-inn components,               the short-run decay stands out most clearly over the

     20 A related method for use in the simulation of fractional Gaussian noise has been proposed by Mandelbrot and Wallis

horizons,     However, traditional correlation based measures for the degree of volatility persistence,
obtained from high frequency intradaily data, will tend to pick up only the effects of the complex
interaction between the short-run decay associated with the less persistent processes and the strong
intradaily periodicity, thus missing the importance of the long-run volatility components.
         To illustrate,     consider the third row in table 1 which reports the first order sample
autocorrelation,    j(k), for the temporally aggregated absolute 5-minute returns; i.e., IR~k)I for ~ =
1, 2, ,.., 74,880/k.      The first order sample autocorrelations for the highest intradaily frequencies all
indicate very significant positive serial correlation in the absolute returns.                However, there is sharp
drop off in the value of the sample autocorrelations at the three hour sampling frequency, i.e., k =
36. In fact, the first order autocorrelations for the eight and twelve hours absolute returns, i.e., k
= 96 and 144, are both negative, suggestive of an anti-persistent volatility process .2122
         The latter conclusion is, of course, grossly misleading, being driven by the combined effects
of the intradaily periodic pattern and the complex multiple volatility component structure,                           thus
creating an overall system that conforms to the law of motion outlined in equation (13). In order
to justify this interpretation,      however, we must develop an alternative estimation approach.                       In
particular,    while strong intraday periodici~             and pronounced        volatili~    clustering    have been
extensively documented at the high frequency level, there is little direct evidence for the existence
of longer-inn      volatility components that induce the type of long-memory behavior in the high
frequency volatility process implied by our information aggregation rendition of the mixture-of-
distributions hypothesis.
         Specifically, from the model detailed in the previous section, the absolute returns should
exhibit the identical long-run dependence irrespective of the sampling frequency, say I(d), where O
< d < %. On representing the process for the absolute returns as (1-L)d I~k) I = ~~), where #)
is a stationary and ergodic process with a bounded spectrum, f~,k(~), for all frequencies, u, the




      21 Muller et al. (1993, 1995) attribute this negative correlation for the half-day lag to a heterogeneous market wlth
different groups of traders participating during their regular business hours.

     22 This is also consistent with the GARCH(l, 1) model estimates for the degree of volatility persistence in intradaily
exchange rates reported in Andersen and Bollerslev (1996a), Ghose and Kroner (1996), and Guillaume, Pictet and Dacorogna
(1995). The half-lives implied by the parameter estimates differ markedly across the intradaily sampling frequencies.

spectrum for IR~k)I may therefore be written as,23


          ‘1RI ,k(”) = I [1 - exp(-i.~)]”d I2 “fq,k(u)
                                                                                                                      (15)

Since, lim&m U-l”sin(l/2.u) = ‘/2, it follows that for the frequencies close to zero, i.e., u = O,


          f, RI,~(ti) =           f~,@) 1~1-2’d,                                                                      (16)
or,

          ln[fl RI   ,k(”)]       =   ln[f,,~(0)] -2 “d I in(u) .                                                     (17)


Hence, the spectrum should be approximately log-linear for the long-n-m frequencies.                        Indeed, when
viewed on the double logarithmic scale in figure 1, the spectrum for the 5-minute absolute returns,
i.e., k = 1, is very close to a straight line over the interdaily frequencies, O < u < 2“r/288                           =
0.0218.
          The Geweke and Porter-Hudak (1983) log-periodogram regression estimate for the fractional
order of integration is based directly on this relationship.                      These estimates for the dependence in
IR!’)1, obtained across all of the intradaily frequencies, are reported in the column labelled d~~) in
table 1. Formally,




where ti’,~,~ = (m-f)-l “ ~~=f+~~j,k,                 and IIRi,~(~j,k) denotes the sample periodogram for IR!’)I at the
j’ th Fourier frequency, i.e.,             ‘&)j,k =   2” m“j”   k/T. Although this estimator for d has been fairly widely
used in the literature, consistency for O < d < % has only recently been established by Robinson
(1995) under regularity conditions that include the truncation and trimming parameters both tending
to infinity, albeit at a slower rate than the sample size; i.e., m - ~, 1 ~ m, I/m ~ O, and m“k/T




      23 Formal conditions for the equivalence between this spectral definition of long-memory and the hyperbolic decay rate
in the au[ocorrelation function are discussed in Beran (1994) and Robinson (1994b); see also Granger and Ding (1996a).

                                                                       17
~ O. However, the regulari~ conditions also require that I~k) I be normally distributed, which in
turn implies that the estimator itself, d~~), is asymptotically normal with a variance equal to m-
1”(#/24),     independent of the sample size, T/k.
         For derivation of the results reported on in table 1, we took m = [(T/k)L’2]and 1?= [m’”],
respectively, where [“] denotes the integer value.                   However, in order to avoid any confounding
effects from frequencies corresponding to less than one day, the estimate for ~~~) is based on m =
255 and 1 = 3. Note that, in contrast to the sample autocorrelations reported in the ~(k)column, the
6~&)estimates for the degree of long-run volatility dependence are remarkably stable across the
different intradaily return intervals.           In fact, when judged by the asymptotic normal distributions,
all of the estimates are within less than one asymptotic standard error of d = 0.359.24 To illustrate,
consider the estimate for &~) = O.321, corresponding to the average slope of the spectrum for the
5-minute absolute returns in figure 1 over the frequencies O < u s 255”2 T/74,888 = 0,0214.25
The theoretical standard error for this estimate equals m“(24255)-1’2 = 0.040. As such, the estimates
for k = 1, 2, .. . . 144 confirm the proposition that the degree of fractional integration in the absolute
returns is invariant with respect to the sampling frequency. 26
            Unfortunately, the assumption of normality underlying the formal statistical justification for
the &.&)estimates is clearly violated in the present context.                  For instance, the sample skewness and
kurtosis for the absolute 5-minute returns equal 0.367 and 21.5, respectively.                          The last column in
table 1 therefore reports the results from a less restrictive semiparametric estimation procedure for
determining d, based on the ratio of the periodogram for two frequencies close to zero. 27 To
motivate this estimator, let


                                                                                                                             (19)



     24 This value of d corresponds to the estimated hyperbolic decay rate in the low-pass filtered 5-minute absolute returns
described further in section 5 below.

     25 Including all of the frequencies up to j = [74,880”2] = 273, the estimate for d&) drops to a value of only 0.242,
highlighting the importance of explicitly excluding the intradaily effects in the estimation.

      26 This is also consistent with the notion of an intrinsic time scale in the foreign exchange market as discussed by Mi-iller
et al. (1993).

     27 The same log-Perlodogram        and average periodogram      estimators for d implemented here have Previously been
employed by Delgado and Robinson (1994) in the analysis of a time series of monthly Spanish inflation rates.

                                                                18
denote the average periodogram for the frequencies j = 1, 2, .. . . m.                     Then, following Robinson
(1994a), for O < d < 1Aand m+                m, but ink/T -0,


        ln(G~,, ) - ln(G1,~l,~) + (1 -2 “d)” h(q)             =    0,                                                   (20)


where O < q < 1. Thus, upon rearranging the terms in equation (20), the following estimator for
d becomes apparent,


        dfi)   =    % + % “in(q)-’ [ln(G~,k) - ln(G[,~l,, )1.                                                           (21)


Consistency of this frequency-domain             estimator for d has been established by Robinson (1994a)
under much weaker regularity conditions than those available for d~~), Furthermore,                                given the
assumption of normality underlying the existing consistency proof for the log-periodogram estimator,
~~~), Lobato and Robinson (1996) have recently shown that the alternative ~~~) estimator                                  is
asymptotically normal for O < d < %, but non-normally distributed for M < d < %.
        The estimates reported in the last column of table 1 are based on a truncation parameter of
m = [(T/k)l’2] for k = 2, 3, ,..,              144, whereas m = 255 for k = 1 in order to avoid any
confounding effects from the intradaily dependencies in the estimation of d~~). The value for the
scalar q was fixed at 0,25 across all the sampling frequencies.                In line with the simulation evidence
reported in Lobato and Robinson (1996), some informal sensitivity analysis revealed the results to
be fairly robust with respect to this choice.           Turning to the actual estimates, the similarities across
the different values of k are even more striking than for the log-periodogram estimates.                     The average
value of ~~~)equals 0.321, while ranging from a low of 0.270 for k = 72 to a high of only 0.385
for k = 1.28
        Consistent with the notion of a heterogeneous component structure and the invariance under
temporal aggregation, these estimates for d, based on a single year of intradaily returns, are also
very much in line with previously reported estimates for much longer time spans of daily data, For
instance, on calculating the same Iog-periodograrn regression and average periodogram estimates for
the fractional order of integration for the time series of 3,649 daily DM-$ absolute returns from



    28 The estimate for ~~~)corrupted by the intradaily frequencies, or j = 256, 257, . . . . 273, equals 0.172.

                                                             19
March 14, 1979 through September 29, 1993, the estimates are 0.344 and 0.301, respectively. z9
Thus, the relatively simple semiparametric frequency-domain estimators in equations (18) and (2 1)
are both capable of uncovering the inherent long-run volatility dependencies in the time series of
high-frequency intradaily returns, without having to impose any specific structure on the short-run
behavior of the system in order to accommodate the complex intradaily dynamics and repetitive
periodic patterns that corrupt the conventional correlation based measures.
        To further appreciate the notion of long-memory volatility dynamics, consider the properties
of the (1-L)d filter designed to annihilate the long-run dependence in the absolute returns. Expressing
the fractional differencing operator in terms of its binomial expansion, the gain of the corresponding
filter may be written as,


         I[1 - exp(-iu)]d     I =     { [Z.-,-0, ,,maj“CMO”J)12+ [ ‘j=(l,,,mbj sin(uj) ]2 }“2,                          (22)



where O < u < r, and bj = llj-d) “I’(j+l)-l “r(-d) for j = O, 1, . .                            Intuitively, the gain at
frequency u represents the magnitude by which the filter multiplies the component of the time series
with a repetitive cycle of 2”T/U periods. The enhanced flexibility provided by allowing for fractional
orders of integration is evident from figure 3, which plots the gains of (1-L~ for d = O, 0.25, 0.359,
0.5, and 1. Although all the fractional differencing operators with d > 0 completely eliminate the
zero frequency component, the filters differ greatly in terms of their gains over the finite frequencies,
0 < u < m.’” The filter gain of [2 -2 ICOS(U)]l’2for the first difference operator, (1-L), associated
with the Integrated GARCH, or IGARCH, class of models for ~, implies a much greater down-
weighting of the long-run dependencies than the fractional differencing filter with d = 0.359.
         The justification, within the frequency domain, of filtering the five-minute DM-$ absolute
                    is evident from the plot of the estimated spectrum for (1-L)0359I~ ) given in
returns by (1-L)O-359




    29 Both estimates are based on m = 168 corresponding to a period of 3 ,648/ 168 = 21.7 trading days, or approximately
one month, along with ( = 4 and q = 0.25.

     313Since the autocorrelatlons of a long-memory process with d > 0 is not summable, all of the (1-L)~ filters necessarily
eliminate the zero frequency component in order to achieve a bounded spectrum for the fractionally difference     series.

                                                             20
figure 4.3’     The   flat spectrum for       O < u < 2cT/288 = 0,0218                   reveals that the fractional
differencing operator is, indeed, successful in eliminating the longer-run dependencies.                   At the same
time, the pronounced peaks associated with the daily periodicity remain very similar across figures
1 and 4. These results are further underscored by the time-domain autocorrelogram for (1-L)0359I~ I
depicted in figure 5.       Although more noisy, the autocorrelations exhibit the same repetitive daily
cycles as the autocorrelations       for the raw absolute returns in figure 2.3* However, in contrast to
the autocorrelogram      for the raw absolute returns, which display an overall slow hyperbolic rate of
decay, the daily periodic patterns in the autocorrelogram for the fractionally difference five-minute

          5. LOW-PASS FILTERING AND LONG-RUN VOLATILITY DYNAMICS

The frequency domain based estimators outlined in the previous section allow for the determination
of the degree of long-run volatili~ dependence across the different sampling frequencies by explicitly
focussing on tie shape of the spectrum around the origin.                   Alternatively,    a non-structural time-
domain estimation procedure could be based on the eventual hyperbolic decay of the autocorrelation
function implied by the presence of long-memory.               However, as the sample autocorrelogram for the
five-minute absolute returns in figure 2 clearly illustrates, the implementation of this idea is obscured
by the strong intradaily periodicity.            Various standardization procedures have previously been
proposed for modeling the systematic intradaily patterns in the volatility of high frequency foreign
exchange rates, including the time-deformation              approach advocated by Muller et al. (1990) and
Ghysels and Jasiak (1995), and the flexible Fourier functional form utilized by Andersen and
Bollerslev (1996a, 1996b) .33 These procedures are directly applicable in a forecasting context.                       In
contrast, the low-pass filtering technique developed below is based on a two-sided weighted average
of both past and future absolute returns.                By explicitly annihilating the dependencies              with a



     31 The binomial expansion for (l-L) 0’59 was truncated at a lag length of 1440, corresponding to one week. Also,
following Baillie, Bollerslev and Mikkelsen (1996) all of the pre-sample values for I~ I were fixed at their unconditional
sample analogues.

     32 Note that the scales for the two autocomelograms differ across figures 2 and 5,      Also, the first order sample
autocorrelation of -0.160 for (1-L)O’59I~ I does not fit on the scale in figure 5.

     33 The notion of time deformation also underlies the motivation behind the Autoregressive Conditional Duration model
in Engle and Russell (1996).
periodicity of less than one day, the in-sample low-pass filtered absolute returns are designed to be
void of any short-run intradaily dynamics, and as such provide a framework for the ex-post analysis
of the long-run volatility determinants based on conventional time-domain metiods.
             Restricting the attention to daily and longer run dynamics, the ideal low-pass filter would
have a gain, or a frequency response function, of zero for all of the intradaily frequencies, and a gain
of unity for the interdaily frequencies; i.e., /3(u) = 1 for O < u < u~ and (3(u) = O for WD< u
< T, where u~ denotes the daily frequency. 34 By standard filter theory the weights in the
corresponding infinite two-sided time-domain filter, b=(L) = E ~..~ba ,jLj , is readily found by the
inverse Fourier transform; i.e., b~,j =             ~ VD(u) exp(i”u”j)du        = sin(’jGu~)/(j~m) for j # O and b~,O
= j ~p(u)du = u./m.            Of course, in practice, with a finite number of data points, this infinite filter
is not applicable.      However, the weights in the finite dimensional two-sided approximate filter,


             bp(L) =   E~e.pbp,jLJ ,                                                                                      (23)


that achieves the minimum squared approximation error, subject to the constraint that the filter
weights sum to unity, is given by bp,j = b~,j - (b~,O + 2“E~=,b~,~ - 1)/(2p                      + 1) forj = -p, -p+l,
. . . . p;   see, e.g., Baxter and King (1995).35 Since the weights are symmetric, the gain of this
approximate low-pass filter may be conveniently written as ,36


                                                                                                                          (24)


The higher the value of p, the more accurate this gain approximates the ideal gain of 13(u). Of
course, in practice a tradeoff is necessarily called for in terms of the shape of the gain given by




    34 In terms of the theoretical framework in section 3, this low-pass falter would effectively eliminate all of the spectral
mass in V, with a periodicity of less than one day, along with any seasonalcomponent St,(,) as defined in equation (13).

       35 FormaIly, this set of weights minimizes the squared approximation error given by j :[bP(exp(i. u)) - (3(u)]2du. The
constraint that the weights sum to unity ensures that the long-nut zero frequency behavior of the series is unaltered by the
filtering.

      36 The symmetry of the filter also guarantees that the phase is equal to zero across all frequencies; i e., 4(u) =
tan”’{Im[bP(exp(i.u))]/Re[bP(exp(i, u))]} = O. Intuitively, @(u)/u represents tie amount by which the filter shifts the series
back in time at frequency m; see e.g. Koopmans (1974) for a general discussion of linear filter theory.

                                                              22
equation (24) and the number of observations that have to be sacrificed at the begiming and end of
the sample in the implementation of bP(L).
         For the five-minute returns analyzed here, we took u~ = 0.021, corresponding to roughly
299 periods or close to 25 hours, along with p = 1440, or one week.                             The corresponding filter
weights, P.luo, P.1439, . . . . PWWare given in figure 6. The aCCUraCYafforded by this choice of P is
illustrated in figure 7, which graphs the gain of the ideal low-pass filter along with this two-sided
approximation.       The overall coherence between the gain of the two filters is generally very good.
Only for the frequencies close to u~ is there some evidence that the frequencies greater than u~ do
not receive a zero weight and that the frequency gains for u < u~ are different from unity.                              Such
“leakage” and “compression” is inevitable with a finite value of p.
         The effectiveness of this approximate low-pass filter in eliminating the short-run intradaily
volatility components is clearly seen from figure 8. The estimated spectrum for the filtered five-
minute absolute returns, blddO(L)IR, 1, where t = 1441, 1442, . . .. . 73440, has virtually no-mass at
the frequencies higher than u~. 37 Of course , the log-linear relation for the interdaily frequencies,
implied by the presence of long-memory, remains intact.
         This long-run dependence is also evident in the autocorrelation function for the low-pass
filtered absolute returns. In contrast to the overall decay of the autocorrelogram for the raw absolute
returns in figure 2, which is masked by the strong recurring daily pattern, the autocorrelation
function for blao(L) I~ 1, depicted in figure 9, display a distinct hyperbolic rate of decay .3a The
actual magnitude of the correlations have also increased substantially.                    Even out to lag 2,880, or ten
days, the autocorrelations all remain above 0.2.               Matching the sample autocorrelations for the low-
pass filtered absolute returns with the hyperbolic decay implied by the p~esence of long-memory thus
provides an alternative time-domain procedure for estimating d.
         In general, since the autocorrelations of a long-memory process are eventually all positive,
it follows that, for large j,




     37 Due to the loss of one week of observations at the beginning and the end of the sample, the filtered time series consist
of “only” 74,880-21,440      = 72,000 observations. Of course, the logarithmic scale in tigure 7 may be slightly misleading
as the spectrum is not identically equal to zero for ti > ~.

    ‘a A similarly shaped autocorrelogram for twenty-minute absolute DM-$ returns standardized by a measure of the degree
of market activity, or “theta-time”, has been reported by Dacorogna et al. (1993).

                                                              23

where pj denotes the j‘ th order autocorrelation, and c is just a factor of proportionality.                      Replacing

        (3Ac= y. +        y2 . { ~r+n
                                  ,=[+,[MD ‘ir,nl     “ Mbj        )}   {   ~il?+i[Uj ) -Ir.n
                                                                                            12}-’                        (26)

       —
where j~,n = n‘[”Zjl;+lln(j     ), and r ~ m, but r/T ~ O. This semi-parametric time-domain estimator
for the fractional degree of integration, proposed by Robinson ( 1994b), is closely related to the
minimum distance estimators recently analyzed by Tieslau, Schmidt and Baillie (1996). No formal
asymptotic distribution theory is yet available for the estimator in equation (26), although it seems
likely that d*~ will be consistent under rather weak regulari~ conditions.
        Applying this estimator to the sample autocorrelations                     for the low-pass filtered absolute
returns, j5(b[ddO(L)lR,l ,j) forj = 5, 6, . .. . 2880, yields &~ = 0.359.                     This estimate is thus fully
consistent with the results from the frequency based procedures reported in the previous section.
It is furthermore evident from the plot in figure 9, that the implied hyperbolic rate of decay, j2”0359-1
= j-0.2E2,is in close accordance with the actual shape of the autocorrelogram.                        It is worth stressing
that, due to the strong intradaily volatility patterns and the associated recurring negative sample
autocorrelations at the half-day lags, this estimation procedure for determining the fractional order
of integration simply is not applicable with the raw absolute returns.                    Only by explicitly eliminating
the intradaily dependencies do the sample autocorrelations all become positive and the hyperbolic
decay stand out clearly.
        The low-pass filtered returns also set the stage for a more structural investigation of the
determinants behind the important volatili~ components.                       A detailed analysis along these lines is
beyond the scope of the present paper .39 However, to illustrate consider the announcement effects
associated with the Employment report, the Bundesbardc biweekly meeting, the Durable Goods
figures, and the report on Business Inventories discussed in section 2 above.                           On estimating the

analogous band-pass filtering techniques have recently been conducted by Baxter (1994) and King and Watson (1996).

                                                              24
average increase in the absolute five-minute DM-$ returns in the two-hours immediately following
the amouncements,


                                                                                                                            (27)



the four coefficient estimates for y~ with robust standard errors in parentheses are 0.0091 (0.0052),
0.0133 (0.0025), 0.0067 (0.0032) and 0.0143 (0.0023), respectively ,40 Thus, the effect associated
with the Employment report is not significant at the conventional five percent level, while the
Durable Goods report is only marginally significant.                     Also, the figures on Business Inventories
appear to be the most significant of the four “news” events.                      These estimates should be carefully
interpreted, however, as the intradaily pattern is prone to obscure the fundamental relationships,                            In
fact, on estimating the identical regressions, given by equation (27), for the low-pass filtered returns,
blMO(L)IR, 1, the four estimates for TN are 0.0076 (0.0005), 0.0078 (0.0004), 0.0032 (0.0004),                              and
-0.0005 (O.0005), respectively.             The t-statistics for the three former announcements are now all
overwhelmingly        significant, while the release of the new figures for Business Inventories have no
apparent effect on the volatility once the intradaily patterns in the absolute returns are filtered out. 41
These results demonstrate how the low-pass filtered absolute returns provide a valuable framework
for the further study of the structural determinants behind financial market volatility clustering.


                                                   6.   CONCLUSION

The temporal dependence in the volatility of speculative returns is of the utmost importance for the
pricing and hedging of financial contracts.              Yet, the empirical analysis of low frequency interdaily
and high frequency intradaily returns have hitherto given rise to very different conclusions regarding
the degree of volatility persistence for any particular asset. The mixture-of-distributions                        hypothesis



    40 In order to be compatible with the results for the low-pass filtered returns, the estimates are based on observations
t = 1441, 1442, ..,, 73440, Orlfy.

      41 These results are in line with the evidence reported in Andersen and Bollerslev (1996b) and Payne (1996), who rely
on relatively complicated flexible Fourier functional forms in explicitly modeling the periodicity in the intradail y volatility,
These studies also suggest that the armouncement effects may be better approximated by the imposition of a declining weight
structure, as opposed to the simplistic two-hour fixed weighting scheme in the naive regression in equation (27). Jones,
Lament and Lumsdaine (1996) also report evidence in favor of a significant increase in daily bond market volatility following
the release of the Employment report.

                                                               25
developed here provides a justification for these conflicting empirical findings by interpreting the
volatility as resulting from the aggregation of numerous constituent component processes; some with
very short-run decay rates and others possessing much longer-run dependencies.         When analyzing
intradaily returns the short-run components will tend to dominate the estimates obtained with
traditional time series models, whereas for daily or longer-run return intervals the estimates will be
driven by tie more persistent components.     However, under suitable conditions the aggregation of
these multiple components implies, that the process for the volatility should exhibit the identical form
of long-memory dependence irrespective of the sampling intervals.       This proposition is confirmed
by our empirical analysis, which also demonstrates that, by amihilating the intradaily dependencies
in time series of intradaily returns, it is possible to uncover this inherent long-memory dependence
in relatively short calendar time spans of high frequency data using simple correlation based
procedures.   As such the techniques discussed here set the stage for the development of improved
long-run interdaily volatility forecasts based on the large samples of intradaily prices which have
recently become available for a wide variety of different instruments.       Only fiture research will
reveal the extent to which these techniques will support the development of new and improved
empirical pricing relationships.

Notes: The percentage returns are based on interpolated5-minutelogarithmicaverage bid-ask
quotes for the Deutschemark- U.S. Dollar spot exchangerate from October 1, 1992through
September29, 1993. Quotes from Friday 21:00 GreenwichMean Time (GMT) through
Sunday 21:00 GMT have been excluded, resulting in a total of 74,880 5-minute return
observations.    The length of the different intraday sampling intervals equal 5 k minutes.              Each
absolute return series consists of a total of 74,880/k       non-overlapping     observations;   i.e.,   IR~kJI
= IR,., + R,.k., + ,.. K.k.k+,l where ~ = 1,2,            . . . . T/k and T = 74,880.    The D(k)COIU~
gives the first order autocorrelations    for I~) 1. The Log-Periodogram           estimates for d from
equation (18) me denoted by &~).         The truncation    and trimming parameters       for k = 2, 3, ..,,
144 are determined    by m = [(T/k) ID] and 1? = [ml’4], respectively,          where [“] denotes the
integer value.   In order to avoid any confounding        effects from frequencies      corresponding     to
less than one day, the estimate for &!/ is based on m = 255 and f = 3. The d~j) column
gives the average periodogmn      estimates for d defined in equation (21). The truncation
parameters are determined by m = [(T/k) ’n] for k = 2, 3 , . . .. 144, while ~,QJis based on m
= 255. The scalar q is fixed at % across all sampling frequencies.
