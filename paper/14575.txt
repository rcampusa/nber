   I.      Introduction
   The following article discusses a large database of scientific papers, assembled and

processed over a period of time, which might prove useful in understanding the role of

science in the economy. The study of science is interwoven with the study of industrial

innovation (Jaffe, 1989; Adams, 1990; Mansfield, 1991). Furthermore, it is clearly in the

air that the economic role of science, measured by its role in commercialization, has

increased markedly during the 20th and 21st centuries (Audretsch and Stephan, 1996;

Narin, Hamilton, and Olivastro, 1997; Zucker, Darby, and Brewer, 1998; Adams, Chiang,

and Starkey, 2001), suggesting that a country’s scientific research is increasingly a key to

growth. At the same time, the precise role of science in industrial invention and new

product development remains largely unknown. Given the differences between scientific

discovery and industrial innovation, controversy continues to surround the question as to

whether the knowledge contained in papers matters to the same degree as the scientific

training and human capital of industrial researchers. We hope that the database described

in these pages will contribute to an eventual resolution of this and other puzzles

concerning the economic role of science.

   We refer to the collection of files and data as the NBER-Rensselaer Scientific Papers

Database. Included are more than two million papers, written to varying degrees in the

United States during 1981-1999, as well as citations made to and received by the papers.

The institutions whose scientists and engineers author the papers consist of top U.S.

universities and R&D-performing firms. The data also include collaborations between

scientific institutions. This is significant because co-authorships typically indicate large

investments of time and resources in the production of scientific research. Finally, the
data incorporate our efforts to fractionalize papers and citations, thereby reflecting

collaborative research and avoiding multiple counting of scientific output in the economy

as a whole.

   Questions that the data could be used to address include the following: Who thinks

about whose research, and in what fields? Who works with whom, and Why does this

happen? What are the effects of thinking about and working with other scientists and

engineers on invention and real output? How do these behaviors and their outcomes

change over time?

   This project originated in conversations between one of us (Adams) and the late Zvi

Griliches as to how one might undertake database construction on the economics of

science that would promote research on the topic at the NBER and elsewhere. It was an

honor to be recruited in this way by so peerless an economist, as those who know best

must realize. Later, Adams was fortunate in bringing Clemmons on board. Clemmons’

skill in handling data, his insistence on asking the right questions, and his work ethic

have kept the project going when it would otherwise have ended badly.

   In many ways the project was intended to parallel and complement the research on

patents that had been ongoing at NBER over a period of time, as this is reflected first in

Griliches (1986) and later in Jaffe and Trajtenberg (2002). It was immediately

understood that the project would be risky and that it would not be fashionable. The idea

of working with citations is of course, not new. To our knowledge, maps that link

industries together go back to at least Terleckyj (1974) and Scherer (1982a, b). However,

the development of citations in economics to measure the importance of ideas and their




                                              2
flow is contained in the work of Trajtenberg (1990) on CT scanner patents and the

compendium of work in Jaffe and Trajtenberg (2002).

       Papers that have used the data include Adams, Clemmons and Stephan (2004 and

forthcoming 2006; and 2006), Adams, Black, Clemmons, and Stephan (2005); and

Adams and Clemmons (2008a, 2008b; and forthcoming 2009). The reader may find

additional information concerning the data in these papers.

       The rest of the paper consists of three sections. Section II describes the data from

several perspectives. In part A. of the section we discuss the form and function of the

files comprising the database. Part B. discusses the distribution of papers by fields of

science, and it does so separately for the top 110 U.S. universities and the top 200 U.S.

R&D-performing firms. The papers data are graphed in Part C., the citations data are

graphed in Part D., and finally, Part E. presents graphs of the collaborations data. Section

III is a discussion and assessment of limitations and strengths of the data. Section IV

concludes.

       II.      Description of the Database 1
                A. The File System
             The database consists of eight files. Table 1 provides an overview, listing file

names, numbers of observations, and file functions. We shall keep referring to this table

as a means of organizing our tour of the data. The eight files are a careful reworking of

archival data from Thomson-Reuters on scientific papers and citations. Arranged by

publication date their time period is January 1, 1981 to December 31, 1999. The data

begin in 1981, because in this year the company implemented a new and more

comprehensive data processing system that is not entirely incompatible with earlier data.

The data end in 1999, because during the subsequent extraction process for the project,

1999 was the latest full year available.

         The information specifically derive from Thomson-Reuters’ Current Contents

database, which at the time covered an expanding set of 5,507 journals across the

sciences2. In addition, we use a set of 1,630 discontinued or renamed journals that were

cited by Current Contents journals. Originally included are 2,836,700 scientific papers

written in one or more of the Top 110 U.S. Universities, as well as 238,277 papers

written in one or more of the Top 200 U.S. R&D Firms. Some overlap takes place

between the universities and firms, because of scientific collaboration between

institutions. A total of 21,386,007 citation pairs occur between groups of papers defined

by citing and cited institutions, fields (defined below), and years3. Likewise 797,348

collaboration pairs occur between groups of papers, defined by collaborating and

collaborated pairs of institutions, in turn arranged by field and year4.

         The designation of Top 110 University is Thomson-Reuters’. It is based on

publication volume, and indeed these universities account for the majority of academic

papers written in the U.S. The list of Top 110 universities appears as Table A.1 of the

Appendix.

         The designation of Top 200 Firm was developed for this study. With one

exception it refers to the 200 publicly traded corporations who performed the most R&D

in 1998, that were based in the United States, for which histories of reasonable length

2
  At the start of the project, the consulting group in Evaluative Bibliometrics at Thomson-Reuters was
known as the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI). We shall use this original name for the company
from time to time.
3
  Put differently, the 21,386,007 citation pairs represent counts of citations at the six-dimensional level of
citing and cited institutions, fields, and years. We discuss this in more detail below.
4
  Since papers are assigned to fields and years according to the journal where they appear, collaborations
occur in the same field and year. This leads to a four-dimensional file classified by field, year, and
collaborating and collaborated institutions.


                                                       4
could be constructed. The one exception is Bell Communications Research (Bell CORE;

ticker BELLC), which spins off from AT&T in 1984. The list of Top 200 R&D firms

appears as Table A.2 of the Appendix.

       Divestiture (and acquisition) can change the nature and amount of scientific

research in a firm. We note two major examples of this in the data. Table A.3 discusses

the treatment of the AT&T and General Motors families of firms, for which the

divestiture problem is paramount. This is because, for General Motors and AT&T,

divestiture significantly alters the practice of science and R&D in each firm. Note that

we treat papers and citations of Lucent (Bell Laboratories) and Bell Communications

Research as separate from AT&T in all years and that we treat papers of Delphi

Automotive Systems as separate from General Motors in all years. This strategy allows

the user to construct the definition of the firm that is most suitable for them. One such

definition, which we have used in our papers, retains spinoffs prior to divestiture as

divisions of the main firm, and afterwards treats them as separate firms.

        As we have said, Table 1 is an overview of the database. We discuss the eight

files in order of their appearance. The first file, UNIVERSITIES, is described in Table 2.

It includes three variables: STANDALONE, an indicator variable equal to one if a

university is a standalone campus or zero if it is a multi-campus system; UNIVID, or the

ID of the university; and UNIVNAME, the name of the university in NSF’s CASPAR

database. UNIVID is the modified Federal FICE Code for a given university. In its

original sense, the FICE code is an identifier assigned by the Federal Interagency

Committee on Education (FICE). As with any identification scheme, though, the coding

system adjusts to suit the users. Our version of the FICE code harmonizes with the




                                             5
CASPAR database of universities, a collection of university data assembled by the

National Science Foundation. Thomson-Reuters also uses the CASPAR definitions of

standalone campuses and university systems in building its institutional dictionaries for

the Top 110 universities. The CASPAR FICE codes and university definitions are the

ones used in the database.

       The top 110 universities include 26 university systems. For these 26 universities

the file UNIVERSITY_SYSTEMS includes three variables: BRANCH, the name of the

branch campus included in each system; UNIVID, the university ID; and UNIVNAME,

the university name. Since there are 142 branch campuses in the 26 systems, the average

number of branches is 5.5. Table 3 describes the file UNIVERSITY_SYSTEMS.

       The third file, UNIVERSITY_DESCRIPTION, summarizes the paper and citation

statistics for the 110 universities. Table 4 shows that these statistics are arranged by

university (UNIVID), Thomson-Reuters ISI 88 science field (ISI88), and publication year

(YEAR). The number of observations is 143,119. Besides UNIVID, ISI88, and YEAR,

the file includes ten variables. CITSFIRM is the total number of forward (future)

citations received from firms for a given university, field, and year. The citations occur

from the publication year through 1999. CITSFIRM is a citation window of variable

length. The window shortens as publication year approaches 1999, so that forward

citations, because they are right-truncated, must eventually decline. CITSFIRM5 is the

number of forward citations received from firms starting with the year of publication and

including the next four years. Since CITSFIRM5 is a fixed five-year window of citations

and the data end in 1995, it is not defined after 1995. CITSFIRM5 has the advantage of




                                              6
being a fixed window, but it has the disadvantage of truncating citations received,

especially for longer-lived papers.

        CITSUNIV is the total number of forward citations received from other

universities arranged by cited university, field, and year. The citations occur from the

publication year through 1999. Since the citation window contracts as the publication

year approaches 1999, CITSUNIV eventually declines. CITSUNIV5 is the number of

forward citations received from other universities, starting with year of publication and

including the next four. Since CITSUNIV5 is a fixed five-year window, it is not defined

after 1995. CITSUNIV and CITSUNIV5 exclude institutional self-citations from a

university to itself.

        The variable PAPERS is the total number of papers written in a university, field

and year. Remaining variables are fractional counterparts to the previous variables.

FRPAPERS is the “fractional” version of PAPERS. The relationship between the two is

this: FRPAPERS is the sum over all papers of the institutional fraction for each paper that

is accounted for by the university in question, for a given field and year. To understand

this, consider some examples. If Harvard writes a paper by itself, it is assigned a fraction

of 1.0. If it writes a paper with Yale and IBM, it is assigned a fraction of 1/3. And if it

writes a paper with MIT, Princeton, Biogen, and Merck, then it receives a fraction of 1/5.

Summing over paper fractions yields FRPAPERS. By definition this is less than or equal

to PAPERS.

        The same idea applies to citations. This yields FRCITSFIRM, the fractional

version of CITSFIRM: fractional citations received from firms on each paper, summed

over papers. Clearly FRCITSFIRM is less than or equal to CITSFIRM.




                                              7
        The same is true of FRCITSFIRM5 and CITSFIRM5, of FRCITSUNIV and

CITSUNIV, and of FRCITSUNIV5 and CITUNIV5. Our reason for offering fractional

counterparts to “whole” citations is simple: fractional citations preserve totals over the

entire system of universities and firms, whereas “whole” papers and citations count

papers and citations multiple times and overstate totals in the system as a whole.

        The fourth file in Table 1 marks a transition from universities to firms. FIRMS

lists the top 200 companies and Table 5 describes its contents. The three variables are

FIRMID, the ticker symbol of the firm in 1998; FIRMNAME, the name of the firm in

Compustat; and SIC4, the largest four digit industry of the firm in Compustat, based on

the 1987 Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) classification system.

        FIRM_DESCRIPTION appears fifth. It is the analogue of file

UNIVERSITY_DESCRIPTION. As Table 6 explains, the file includes three classifying

variables: FIRMID, ISI88, and YEAR, as well as descriptive variables. The latter include:

PAPERS, the number of papers; CITSFIRM, total forward citations received from other

firms; CITSFIRM5, forward citations received from other firms in the first five years;

CITSUNIV, total forward citations received from universities; and CITSUNIV5, forward

citations received from universities in the first five years. Included besides are five

“fractional” descriptive variables: FRPAPERS, FRCITSFIRM, FRCITSFIRM5,

FRCITSUNIV, and FRCITUNIV5. Since these variables are the same as those in

UNIVERSITY_DESCRIPTION, we refer the reader to the discussion of Table 4 for

further details.

        The file FIELDS appears sixth in Table 1. FIELDS describes the 88 Thomson-

Reuters (ISI) field codes that we use throughout the database. These are known




                                              8
collectively as ISI88. The table maps the detailed 88 field codes into more aggregative

CASPAR NSF12 and NSF20 field codes, and describes the codes5. Table 7 lists the

variables in FIELDS. Appendix Table A.4 records field codes and descriptive labels.

           In Table 7 ISI88_DESCRIPTION labels the variable ISI88. For the 12 main NSF

fields in NSF12 we provide NSF12_DESCRIPTION. And for the details of engineering

and earth science fields in NSF20, we provide NSF20_DESCRIPTION. It is inevitable

that an element of judgment should enter the mapping between ISI88, NSF12, and

NSF20. This is due to field overlap. The point is especially pertinent for the life

sciences. The major fields of biology and medicine, for example, clearly share similar

scientific research. The mapping that we offer is a compromise: it assigns agricultural

ISI88 fields to agriculture, basic biomedicine in ISI88 to biology, and clinical

biomedicine in ISI88 to medicine. Thus for example, we interpret the ISI88 field, CGX

as the fundamental biology of cancer and ONC as clinical intervention and cancer

treatment. Because of this overlap, it is important to take note of the following design

feature. Since the data are classified throughout in term of the detailed ISI88 fields, the

user is free to pursue an alternative mapping of detailed fields into aggregates than the

ones we have chosen in Table 7 and Table A.4.

           The final two files in Table 1 link citing-cited and collaborating-collaborated

observations. CITATION_PAIRS does this for citing-cited observations. It consists of

21,386,007 observations in six dimensions consisting of citing and cited institutions,

fields, and years. The file includes ten variables. These are: citations made, or backward

citations (CITATIONS), and potentially citing and cited scientific papers (PAPERSCTG,

PAPERSCTD) all by citing and cited university or firm (INSTCTG, INSTCTD), citing

                                                     9
and cited ISI 88 field (ISI88CTG, ISI88CTD), and citing and cited year (YEARCTG,

YEARCTD). In addition, it includes a character variable, CTG_CTD, which identifies

the type of citing and cited institution, university (UNV) or firm (FRM). It follows, for

instance, that to select a sample of firms citing universities, one would apply the substring

operator to CTG_CTD to choose CTG=’FRM’ and CTD=’UNV’.

         COLLABORATION_PAIRS performs a similar linking function for

collaborating-collaborated observations. It consists of 797,348 observations in four

dimensions consisted of collaborating and collaborated institutions, field and year, since

collaboration occurs in the same field and year. The eight variables consist of

“collaborating” and “collaborated” institutions (INSTCLBG, INSTCBD), ISI 88 field

(ISI88), and year (YEAR). Included are collaborations (COLLABORATIONS),

numbers of potentially collaborating and collaborated papers (PAPERSCLBG,

PAPERSCLBD), and a character variable, CLBG_CLBD, which identifies type of

collaborating and collaborated institution, university (UNV) or firm (FRM). So to select

a sample of universities collaborating with firms, apply the substring operator to

CLBG_CLBD to select CLBG=’UNV’ and CLBD=’FRM’.

             B. Distribution of Scientific Papers
         Table 10 displays distributions of fractional and whole scientific papers in

universities and firms6. This is done by the 12 main fields included in NSF12 in the

National Science Foundation classification scheme. Field-specific totals and percentages

are shown above; grand totals are shown in the bottom row.


6
  Recall that fractional papers are the sum of institutional fractions on all papers to which a university or
firm contributes. Thus, for each paper, the fraction is 1.0 if the paper is written entirely within an
institution, ½ if it is coauthored with another institution, and so on. Again, fractional papers are the sum of
such fractions for a given “cell”.


                                                      10
       Notice that whole scientific papers overstate “true” scientific papers because of

institutional collaborations. When we compare whole with fractional papers we see that

3,074,977 whole papers are written across all institutions and fields, but that the actual

total, measured by fractional papers is 2,604,324. Thus whole papers overstate scientific

“output” in the system as a whole by 18 percent (3,074,977/2,604,324≈1.18).

       When we examine the university data by field, it is clear that most papers are

written in the life sciences (agriculture, biology, and medicine). Together these fields

account for 61.5 percent of all (fractional) papers. Second largest are papers in the

natural sciences (chemistry and physics) and “technology” (computer science and

engineering), which together account for another 24.8 percent. The remaining 13.7

percent of fractional university papers consists of astronomy, earth sciences, economics

and business, mathematics and statistics, and psychology, which are trace elements in the

universe of scientific papers. Note that percentages contributed by the fields of

agriculture, chemistry, and engineering are higher among fractional than whole papers.

Conversely, percentages of medicine and physics are lower among fractional papers than

among whole. This is because institutional collaboration occurs less frequently than

average in agriculture, chemistry, and engineering, while it occurs more frequently in

medicine and physics.

       Turning to the firm data, we observe a quite different distribution by field. Life

sciences (agriculture, biology, and medicine) account for 31.4 percent of (fractional)

industrial papers, compared with 61.5 percent in universities. Of course, the share of the

life sciences in firm papers has increased in recent years, but overall the share is smaller

in industry. Conversely, the share of natural sciences (chemistry and physics) and




                                             11
technology (computer science and engineering) is 65.2 percent compared with 24.8

percent in universities. Observe that chemistry and engineering take up a larger share of

fractional papers than whole papers, whereas the reverse is true of medicine. As before,

this is because institutional collaboration is less common in industrial chemistry and

engineering and more common in industrial medicine.

           C. Graphical Depiction of the Papers Data
       The following sections present time series graphs consisting of Figures 1-9. Time

is represented in calendar years or as a lag between calendar years. In several cases,

when we wish to present the data by sector or science field, graphs appear as multiples.

Primarily for this reason, the following sections contain 27 separate graphs of the data.

Figures 1-3 pertain to papers and are discussed in this section.

       Figure 1 presents time series of university and total (university plus firm)

fractional papers on the left scale, and time series of firm papers on the right scale.

Scientific publishing slows down in universities and as whole in the United States after

1992, and it falls in absolute terms in industry (Adams, 2007), reflecting the downsizing

and disappearance of some large industrial laboratories performing basic science research

during this period, notably AT&T Bell Laboratories.

       Figures 2 presents shares in all papers of science fields for universities while

Figure 3 does the same for firms. Fields appear as “strata” covering seven major areas

(agriculture, biology, chemistry, computer science, engineering, medicine, and physics),

plus a residual “other” field category. The flatness of the strata for universities suggests

little change in relative shares during 1981-1999. And yet a slight increase in the share of




                                              12
biology and medicine, a decline in agriculture’s share, and an increase in the engineering

and physics share can be seen in the university data.

       Figure 3, for industry, stands in sharp contrast to Figure 2. The share of biology

and medicine doubles from less than 20 percent of industrial papers in 1981 to almost 40

percent in 1999. Computer science also gains share though from a small base. And

while the share of chemistry is stable, the share of engineering and most notably physics

decline strongly in this picture. The topsy-turvy nature of the shares in Figure 3 is due to

the rise of industrial scientific research in pharmaceuticals and biotechnology, and the

decline in large industrial laboratories that specialize in natural science and technology.

           D. Graphical Depiction of the Citations Data
       Figures 4-7 illustrate the citations data. Figure 4 depicts counts of scientific

citations made (backward citations) and citations received (forward citations) over time.

The figure covers all fields. It combines citations involving university papers on the left

scale, with those involving firm papers on the right scale. Backward citations increase as

time passes, because later papers have more generations of earlier papers to cite. This is

partly an artifact of the left truncation of the data in 1981, since citations to papers before

1981 are eliminated. But it is partly real, reflecting the growth of fields and the growing

ease of generating citations.

       Citations received, or forward citations, at first grow and then decline. This is due

to the combined action of three effects. As time passes the results contained in papers

diffuse to readers, and this causes citations to go up. Second, the relevance of scientific

research often decays, and this causes citations to decline. And third, right truncation of

citations after 1999 eventually cuts citations received to zero in this window of data.




                                              13
         Figures 5A through 5G report the four curves in Figure 4 (citations made and

received by universities and firms) separately for seven major fields. As before, the left

scale refers to university citations made and received, while the right refers to firm

citations made and received.

         The general shape of the curves is similar across fields, but with some notable

differences. The date at which citations received peak varies by sector and field.

Peaking occurs sooner in sectors and fields where growth is less and where diffusion and

decay are greater, and later when the reverse is true.

         Figure 6 presents lagged or backward citation rate curves by the lag between

citing and cited years. The figure covers all fields. To reduce complexity, the figure

depicts citation curves within sectors (universities citing other universities, firms citing

other firms), but the between sector curves appear very similar to those shown. The

curves depict citation rates: these are citations made divided by papers that could be

cited. It is thus a weighted citation rate, where weights are shares of potentially cited

papers7. The university data are referred to the left axis, while the firm data are referred

to the right. Note that both curves peak at a lag of two years. The university curve is

higher because the aggregate citing population of university papers is larger relative to

the number of papers that could be cited than is true of firms.

         Figures 7A through 7G are graphs of the citation rates for seven major fields

ranging from agriculture to physics. Consider Figure 7A. The figure shows that

university citations to agriculture peaks in the third year after publication—slower than


7
  The reader needs to be aware that entire families of citation curves exist. The particular family depends
on the level of aggregation, the sectors involved, and whether the data are weighted or un-weighted, so that
the appearance of the curves can vary markedly. All the curves shown in this article are weighted curves
that pertain to all fields within a sector or to individual fields within a sector.

average. The firm citation curve choppy and irregular and exhibits multiple peaks. This

occurs because citing observations are few, especially at long lags. Other features of the

field-specific diagrams are that citation rates in physics, biology, and chemistry peak

more rapidly, that citation rates in technology, defined as computer science and

engineering, peak more slowly, and that citation rates in rapidly peaking fields decay at a

higher rate and conversely, at a lower rate for slowly peaking fields.

       For computer science in universities the citation curve reaches a plateau that is

almost unchanged between lags of four and ten years. At long lags the firm-firm

computer science curve exhibits the same choppiness as agriculture. This occurs for the

same reason, that there are relatively few industrial papers at long lags.

           E. Graphical Depiction of the Collaborations Data
       Figure 8 presents line graphs of institutional collaborations between universities,

between universities and firms, and between firms over time. The figure covers all fields

of science. The university-university curve exceeds the university-firm curve by tenfold.

The height of the university-firm curve is again ten times that of the firm-firm curve.

These size differences dictate the logarithmic scale on the vertical axis of the figure.

Underlying these differences is the fact that academic papers are ten times as many as

industrial papers. Thus, a roughly similar propensity to collaborate results in a

collaboration count among university papers that is ten times the count among firm-

university papers. For the same reason, university-firm collaborations are ten times the

firm-firm count, where one tenth as many papers are potentially collaborating with one

tenth as many papers. Figure 8 is steeply trended, with trends about the same in the




                                             15
different curves, but the small number of firm-firm collaborations, some of them initiated

in graduate school, suggests that such collaborations are a second order phenomenon.

       Figures 9A to 9G describe similar graphs for the seven major fields of science.

The field-specific curves are in the same order as for Figure 8, with relative differences

depending on comparative frequency of collaboration across sectors. Figure 9D

illustrates for computer science. Firm collaboration counts are more than a tenth of

university counts, and thus the university-university and university-firm curves are closer

than average. Also, university-firm collaborations grow more rapidly, so the curves

converge over time. In Figure 9F, for medicine, the two curves are further apart than

average, but converge over time. These patterns and those in other figures largely reflect

field-specific publication frequency in firms and universities as well as changes in these

frequencies.

   III. Discussion, Comparison, and Assessment
   Having described the data, we would like to assess their limitations and strengths.

We can think of two important limitations. First, we would like to point out that each of

the roughly 7,000 journals is assigned to a single science field. This assignment is

accurate for the vast majority of specialized journals. But the method does produce

serious errors for up to one percent of journals (approximately 70) that fall into Thomson-

Reuters’ Multidisciplinary category, some of which are highly influential. The category

is treated as part of biology, because biology accounts for the largest fraction of papers.

To see why the problem matters, note that Multidisciplinary journals include Nature,

Science, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA, and Philosophical

Transactions of the Royal Society. Clearly wholesale assignment of articles here to




                                             16
biology is wrong. But to correct the problem would require article (not journal)

assignment to fields. Moreover, some Multidisciplinary journals really are linked to

biology. Therefore, the problem applies to less than one percent of ISI journals8.

    The main alternative to journal-field assignment is to assign papers according to

perhaps multiple fields of the authors. But current practice effectively rules this out9.

This is unlike patents, where multiple class assignments are common. To carry out such

assignments would require clear criteria that would have to be acted on by a single

Scientific Papers Office, much like the Patent Office does today. In the near future

neither condition will be met.

    A second limitation is that science citation data include publication date but not the

date of first submission, or even better, the date of completion of the research. Use of

publication date produces an upward bias in the observed lag between citing and cited

papers. The true lag is the gap between cited publication date and citing first submission

date. The extra “frictional” lag, between first submission and publication date of the

citing paper, necessarily overstates the lag in scientific influence. Moreover, the problem

produces greater upward biases in fields with greater frictional lags.

        Science citations refer to prior literature and yet their motivations for doing so are

not always clear. For example, they could measure influence of earlier ideas or seek to

place limits on the problem being addressed. They could seek to refute earlier findings or

constitute a strategy to raise the odds of acceptance. Of these motives, the first two seem


8
  Examples include Bioinformatics, Biomaterials, Biometrics, Biometrika, Journal of Mathematical
Biology, Journal of Theoretical Biology and many others.
9
  We tested an alternative method of assignment using roughly 100,000 Harvard papers. We tried to assign
each paper to one of the NSF 12 main science fields using information on authors’ departmental addresses.
A third of the papers could not be assigned to a field using this information, leading us to abandon the
effort. More could be done on this problem, provided that across science, journals were to adopt a uniform
approach to encoding fields of authors.


                                                   17
most likely to truly represent scientific influence. Given negative or strategic citations of

the last two types, however, we must regard science citations as measuring prior

influence with error10.

         One strong point of the database is that science citations are controlled by authors.

While referees and editors can suggest references, including them requires authors’

assent, suggesting that observed references are known to authors. In contrast, patent

citations are often suggested by examiners and attorneys and are unknown to inventors.

         Suppose that science citations reflect credible investments of time in searching the

literature for useful knowledge. What would the earmarks of such investments be? For

starters, the number of citations would set the marginal benefit of another citation equal

to its marginal cost. This suggests that citations would span larger fractions of smaller

disciplines, since similar marginal benefit and cost relationships across disciplines would

lower the proportion of large literatures that is cited. Furthermore, literatures that require

larger investments of time per cited paper would yield a lower citation rate holding size

of the literature constant. Adams, Clemmons, and Stephan (2004, forthcoming 2006)

find patterns very similar to those suggested above.

     While voluminous, the papers and citations data are only a window on scientific

research. Since they are truncated on the left and right in time, we lack most citations to

papers from the late 1990s, which are not yet observed. And we know little about papers

that influence research in the early 1980s since citations to these papers are left truncated

and missing. The data are limited besides by sector and country, since they must have at

least one author from a top 110 U.S. university or a top 200 firm. Citations made and

opinion on the patents, to test the validity of patent citations, answered in the affirmative, as an indicator of
the importance of patents.

received by papers wholly authored in non-U.S. institutions are excluded. And so many

international interactions are left out of the analysis. But the science citations and papers

data described here are still a substantial improvement over much of the evidence that we

have had.

   IV. Conclusion
   This paper has introduced a new database on academic and industrial science that

covers the last two decades of the 20th century as well as a sample of the largest

universities and R&D performing firms in the United States. Basic science and applied

industrial research can and do overlap. It is for this very reason that the data described in

this paper could make a difference to economic research devoted to the study of growth

and technological progress. We sincerely hope that this is the case, and that these data

will foster theoretical and empirical research into economic aspects of scientific research,

both at the NBER and beyond, both now and in the future.

 Notes: ISI88 is a set of 88 detailed fields developed by Thomson-Reuters (formerly, the Institute for Scientific Information) for the
 assignment of scientific journals to disciplines. NSF12 is a set of 12 main fields used by the National Science Foundation to assign
 research expenditures, graduate students, and other survey data to universities and sciences. NSF20 is a slightly more detailed
 breakdown of fields that considers engineering and earth science sub-fields separately.
