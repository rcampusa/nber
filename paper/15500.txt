                                             ABSTRACT

In this paper we estimate China’s human capital stock from 1985 to 2007 based on the Jorgenson-Fraumeni
lifetime income approach. An individual’s human capital stock is equal to the discounted present value
of all future incomes he or she can generate. In our model, human capital accumulates through formal
education as well as on-the-job training. The value of human capital is assumed to be zero upon reaching
the mandatory retirement ages.

China’s total real human capital increased from 26.98 billion yuan in 1985 (i.e., the base year) to 118.75
billion yuan in 2007, implying an average annual growth rate of 6.78%. The annual growth rate increased
from 5.11% during 1985-1994 to 7.86% during 1995-2007. Per capita real human capital increased
from 28,044 yuan in 1985 to 106,462 yuan in 2007, implying an average annual growth rate of 6.25%.
The annual growth rate also increased from 3.9% during 1985-1994 to 7.5% during 1995-2007. Therefore,
although population growth contributed significantly to the total human capital accumulation before
1994, per capita human capital growth was primary driving force after 1995. The substantial increase
in educational attainment during 1985-2007 contributed significantly to the growth in total and per
capita real human capital.

                         China Human Capital Index Project


      “China Human Capital Measurement and Human Capital Index Project” is funded
by China National Natural Science Foundation and Central University of Finance and
Economics, conducted by China Center for Human Capital and Labor Market Research
(CHLR). The goal of this project is to establish China’s first set of systematic and
scientific measurements of human capital and quantify its distribution and dynamics. The
Indexes, once established, can be used to support empirical research as well as
government policy-making. In addition, the China human capital index we are
constructing is aimed at becoming an important part of the nascent international human
capital measurement system, and eventually being incorporated into the National Income
Accounting system.
      This project is led by CHLR Director, Professor Haizheng Li. Professor Barbara
Fraumeni, who did the pioneer work in developing the popular Jorgenson-Fraumeni
method of calculating human capital stock, and all faculty members and graduate
students at the CHLR participated in the project.
      This project requires a huge amount of data collection and processing. After one
year of daily effort, we have obtained China’s total human capital stock series from 1985
to 2007. We have also calculated disaggregated values by location (i.e. urban and rural)
and gender, and projected the series until 2020. Our results have seen rising attention
from international organizations such as the OECD, and we are actively looking for
opportunities of more international collaboration.

Executive Summary


      In this project we estimate China’s human capital stock from 1985 to 2007 based
on the Jorgenson-Fraumeni lifetime income approach. An individual’s human capital
stock is equal to the discounted present value of all future incomes he or she can generate.
In our model, human capital accumulates through formal education as well as on-the-job
training. The value of human capital is assumed to be zero upon reaching the mandatory
retirement ages.
      China’s total real human capital increased from 26.98 billion yuan in 1985 (i.e., the
base year) to 118.75 billion yuan in 2007, implying an average annual growth rate of
6.78%. The annual growth rate increased from 5.11% during 1985-1994 to 7.86% during
1995-2007. Per capita real human capital increased from 28,044 yuan in 1985 to 106,462
yuan in 2007, implying an average annual growth rate of 6.25%. The annual growth rate
also increased from 3.9% during 1985-1994 to 7.5% during 1995-2007. Therefore, although
population growth contributed significantly to the total human capital accumulation before
1994, per capita human capital growth was primary driving force after 1995. The
substantial increase in educational attainment during 1985-2007 contributed significantly to
the growth in total and per capita real human capital.
      Since human capital accumulation was slower than GDP growth and physical
capital accumulation, the ratio of human capital to GDP fell from 30 in 1985 to 18 in
2007, the ratio of human capital to physical capital declined from 16 in 1985 to 11 in
2007. These values are not far away from those obtained in studies on other countries. An
important unanswered question is whether optimal values of human capital relative to
physical capital and GDP can be defined in relationship to sustainable economic growth.
      In 2007, total male human capital was about twice that of total female human
capital, this gap is slightly larger than in 1985. However, female per capita human capital
is nearly 72% of male per capita human capital in 2007, indicating that most of the gap in
total human capital can be attributed to differences in population, returns to schooling and
work experience, and mandatory retirement age. Rural total human capital was greater
than that of urban in 1985, but urban overtook rural in the early 1990s, and by 2007 urban
total was about twice of rural total. Urban per capita human capital increased from 47,874
yuan in 1985 to 154,803 yuan in 2007, while rural per capita human capital increased
from 21,856 yuan to 66,164 yuan. The rural-urban gap increased by about 3 percentage
points (i.e., the rural-urban per capita human capital ratio was 45.7% in 1985 and 42.7%
in 2007).


                                                                                           I
      In our projection from 2007 to 2020, total human capital will grow at a much
slower annual rate of 0.61%. This is mainly because we assume future parameters and
values will remain the same as their 2007 values. Urban total human capital will continue
to rise, while rural total human capital will slowly decline, mainly due to continued
migration and urbanization. Per capita human capita, however, will remain constant in
the rural area and will grow slowly in the urban area.

I. Introduction


      Since the concept of human capital was introduced to modern economic analysis
by Schultz (1961) and Becker (1964), it has been widely used in academic studies and
policy analysis. Human capital is probably “the most important and most original
development in the economics of education” in the second part of the 20th century
(Coleman, 1990, page 304). The latest definition of human capital from the Organization
for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is “The knowledge, skills,
competencies and attributes embodied in individuals that facilitate the creation of
personal, social and economic well-being” (OECD, 2001, page 18). In most countries,
human capital accounts for more than 60% of the nation’s wealth, which includes natural
resources, physical capital and human capital (World Bank, 1997).
      It is generally believed that human capital is an important source of economic
growth and innovation, an important factor for sustainable development, and for reducing
poverty and inequality (see, for example, Stroombergen et al., 2002, and Keeley, 2007).
For example, the detailed analysis of human capital accounts for Canada, New Zealand,
Norway, Sweden, and the United States unanimously shows that human capital is a
leading source of economic growth.1
      In China, since the start of economic reforms, the economy has grown at a dramatic
rate. It is believed that human capital has played a significant role in the Chinese
economic miracle (see, for example, Fleisher and Chen, 1997, and Démurger, 2001).
Additionally, studies show that human capital also has an important effect on productivity
growth and on reducing regional inequality in China (Fleisher, Li and Zhao, 2009).
      Despite the important role of human capital in the Chinese economy, however,
until now, there has been almost no comprehensive measurement of the total stock of
human capital in China. Human capital measures for China are central to any
understanding of the global importance of human capital for a number of reasons. First,
China is the most populous country in the world. It is important to understand the
dynamics of human capital caused by demographic changes (for example, due to
one-child policy, migration, and urbanization) and by the rapid expansion of education
during the course of economic development. Second, such measures would allow for
better assessment of the contribution of human capital to growth, development, and social
well-being in empirical and theoretical research. Construction of human capital measures


1
  These include Jorgenson-Fraumeni (J-F) accounts for Canada (Gu and Ambrose 2008),
New Zealand (Le, Gibson, and Oxley 2005), Norway (Greaker and Liu 2008), Sweden
(Alroth 1997), and the United States (Jorgenson and Fraumeni 1989, 1992a, 1992b, and
Christian 2009).
                                                                                     3
is an important step in assessing the contribution of human capital to economic growth.
Currently, only partial measurement of human capital, such as education characteristics,
has been used in such studies.
      Additional benefits from human capital measures include the provision of useful
information for policy makers, such as assessing how education policies of central and
local governments affect the accumulation of human capital. This is especially important,
given the long-term nature of human capital investment. For example, since the early
1980s, there has been a remarkable increase in the educational attainment of the Chinese
population. In 1982 the largest population mass was concentrated in the “no schooling”
category (Figure III.1.4). By 2007 the largest population mass was concentrated in the
“junior middle” school category (Figure III.1.7). Developing comprehensive measures of
human capital in China provides the necessary early work for constructing China’s
human capital account and for eventually incorporating human capital into the national
accounting so that China can join the international OECD initiative. It would facilitate
international comparison of human capital accumulation and growth across nations.
      There is an ongoing international effort in developed countries to measure a
nation’s total human capital stock and to develop national human capital accounts. For
example, the United States formed the Committee on National Statistics’ Panel to Study
the Design of Nonmarket Accounts (Abraham 2005, and Christian 2009); in early 2008,
Statistics Canada set up a program “Human Development and its Contribution to the
Wealth Accounts in Canada” (Gu and Wong 2008); Australian Bureau of Statistics (Wei
2008), Statistics Norway (Greaker and Liu 2008) and New Zealand (Le, Gibson, and
Oxley 2005), have also established similar research program on the measurement of
human capital. In addition, seventeen countries: Australia, Canada, Denmark, France,
Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, New Zealand, Poland, Spain, the
United Kingdom, the United States, Romania, and Russia, and two international
organizations Eurostat and the International Labour Organization, have agreed to join the
OECD consortium to develop human capital accounts. A researcher from Statistics
Norway, Gang Liu, is at the OECD as of October 1, 2009 for nine months to coordinate
this effort. The work of this consortium will facilitate cross-country comparisons. In
addition, the Lisbon Council European Human Capital Index has been constructed for the
13 European Union (EU) states and 12 Central and Eastern European states (See Ederer
2006 and Ederer et. al. 2007). Developed countries have obviously realized the
importance of monitoring human capital accumulation, while most developing countries
have yet to start such projects, including China.
      Until now, there has been no systematic effort to construct comprehensive
measures of the total human capital stock in China. There are a few studies on human

4
capital measurement published in Chinese journals. For example, Zhang (2000) and Qian
and Liu (2004) calculated China’s human capital stock based on total investment
(cost-side); others, such as Zhu and Xu (2007), Wang and Xiang (2006), estimated
human capital from the income side. Zhou (2005) and Yue (2008) used some weighted
average of human capital attributes to construct a measurement. In most cases, these
studies partially measure human capital based on some education characteristics such as
average education, for example, Cai (1999), Hu (2002), Zhou (2004), Hou (2000), Hu
(2005), etc.
      While the above studies did contribute to the understanding of human capital in
China, there are major limitations. First, there has been no comprehensive and systematic
measurement of the total human capital stock in China from the 1980s up to date,
especially on the changes of human capital in rural and urban areas and for males and
females respectively. Second, the methodology used has been limited by data availability,
feasibility of parameter estimation, and some technical treatment difficulties. Thus, there
has no exact implementation of internationally recognized methods to China’s data for
human capital estimation.
      We attempt to construct a comprehensive measurement of human capital in China
by applying the methods used in other countries after modifying them to fit China’s
special cases. We estimate total human capital at the national level, for male and female,
for urban and rural areas from 1985 to 2007. Our estimates include nominal values, real
values, indexes, and quantity measures. We mostly adopted the Jorgensen- Fraumeni (J-F)
lifetime income based approach, which has been widely used in other countries.
      In addition to a full-implementation of the J-F approach to China’s data to estimate
the human capital series, another contribution of this study is that we combine
micro-level survey data in human capital estimation to mitigate the lack of earnings data
in China. In particular, we apply the Mincer equation to estimate earnings by using
various available household survey data. Thus, it is possible to integrate the changes of
returns to education and experience (on-the-job-training) into our estimates during the
course of economic transition.
      Moreover, by separating the calculation of human capital for urban and rural areas,
we are able to capture the changes caused by rapid urbanization as well as by the large
scale rural-urban migration since the start of economic reform in China. This framework
is not only important for any transitional economy because of its changing economic
structure and migration, it can also at least partially measure the effect of another type of
human capital investment—migration, which helps realize higher value of one’s human
capital.



                                                                                           5
      The rest of this report is arranged as follows. Section II discusses methodology for
human capital measurement. Section III describes our data and data treatments. The
estimated results of human capital are reported in Section IV. Section V concludes. All
data and technical details are reported in appendixes which can be obtained online from
the NBER web site.

II. Methodology


      In general, human capital can be produced by education and training (child bearing
and rearing are investments that increase future human capital), as well as by job turnover
and migration that help to realize the potential value of human capital. Like physical
capital stock, the human capital can be valued using two methods: i) it can be valued as
the sum of investment, minus depreciation, added over time to the initial stock; ii) it can
be valued as the net present value of the income flow it will be able to produce over an
assumed lifetime. The first method, the perpetual inventory method, is used in the cost
approach; while the second method is the income-based approach (this method is used to
estimate the value of most natural resources). When human capital is measured using the
perpetual inventory approach, only costs or expenditures are included in investment.
When physical capital is measured, investments are valued at their purchase price which
is not generally available for human capital.
      There are several measures of human capital commonly adopted by researchers:
        (1) The lifetime income approach of Jorgenson and Fraumeni (1989, 1992a,
            1992b);
        (2) The cost approach of Kendrick (1976);
        (3) The indicator approach;
        (4) Laroche and Merette (2000) construct indexes with either relative wage
            weights or relative lifetime income weights;
        (5) The Lisbon Council’s approach (2006) is described as an example of the
            indicator approach;
        (6) The World Bank residual approach (2006).
      The approach of Jorgenson-Fraumeni is discussed further next.



II.1 Jorgenson-Fraumeni income-based approach


      The Jorgenson and Fraumeni (J-F) income-based approach is the most widely used

method in estimating human capital stock, and has been adopted by a number of countries


6
in constructing human capital accounts (see footnote 1 for examples). The advantages of

this approach are that it has a sound theoretical foundation and that the data and

parameters are relatively easier to obtain than they are for other approaches.

      When estimating lifetime income to calculate human capital, an important issue is
that income (or implicit income) can be generated from both market and non-market

activities. Market activities of individuals produce goods and services, foster innovation
and growth through managerial and creative activities, and generate income that allows
for the acquisition of market goods and services. Nonmarket activities of individuals

include household production, e.g., cooking, cleaning, and care-giving. Investment is
generated from both market and nonmarket activities. Because household production
activities are difficult to quantify and value and require time-use estimates, we have opted
to exclude them in this first approximation to estimating China’s human capital.2 The J-F
approach imputes expected future lifetime incomes based on survival, enrollment, and
employment probabilities. Expected future wages and incomes are estimated from the
currently observed wages and incomes of the cross section of individuals who are older
than a given cohort at the time of observation. Future incomes are augmented with a
projected labor income growth rate and discounted to the present with a constant interest rate.
Estimation is conducted in a backward recursive fashion, from those aged 75, 74, 73, and so
forth to those aged 0.3
      With the J-F income-based approach, we first need data or estimates of individual’s

annual market labor income per capita. Then lifetime incomes are calculated by a
backward recursion, starting from the oldest cohorts in the population. The life cycle is
divided into five stages, and the equations used for calculating the lifetime expected
incomes are as follows.
      The first stage is no school and no work:




2
  Among the most recent human capital estimates, i.e., Gu and Ambrose (2008), Greaker
and Liu (2008) and Christian (2009), only Christian, for the United States, includes a full
set of nonmarket activities and estimates human capital for those too young to go to school
or to perform market work.
3
  The J-F inclusion of nonmarket lifetime income and expected lifetime income for
youngsters produces human capital estimates that are notably higher than those in the
studies mentioned above who have adopted the J-F methodology.

where the subscripts s, a, and e denote sex, age and educational attainment respectively.
mi stands for lifetime market labor income per capita, and sr is the survival rate, defined
as the probability of becoming a year older.
      The second stage is school but no work:

      mis ,a ,e = [senrs ,a +1,e+1 × srs ,a +1 × mis ,a +1,e+1 + (1 − senrs ,a +1,e+1 )× srs ,a +1 × mis ,a +1,e ]

                 ×
                           discount rate

      where senr is school enrollment rate and subscript enr refers the grade level of
enrollment, the probability that an individual with educational attainment e is enrolled in
education level e+1.

      The third stage is school and work. With ymi denoting annual market income per

capita, the equation can be written as:

      mis ,a ,e = ymis ,a ,e + [senrs ,a +1,e +1 × srs ,a +1 × mis ,a +1,e +1 + (1 − senrs ,a +1,e+1 )× srs ,a +1 × mis ,a +1,e ]
                    real income growth rate
                ×
                          discount rate



      The fourth stage is work but no school:

                                                                    real income growth rate
      mis ,a ,e = ymis ,a ,e + srs ,a +1 × mis ,a +1,e ×
                                                                          discount rate

      The fifth and final stage is retirement or no school or work:

      mis ,a ,e = 0

      Similar equations can be applied to estimate lifetime nonmarket labor income,
which can be added to lifetime market labor income to give total lifetime labor income.
      To depict the growth rate of human capital, quantity indexes are introduced by J-F
approach. Two kinds of quantity indexes are estimated for China.
       (1) Gender-based quantity index
      In this case, two weighted growth rates are used to create the Divisia index
according to the formula:




8
       Migrowth y =
                        1
                        2 s
                                                                  [
                          ∑ (Mishare y ,s + Mishare y −1,s )× ln(Pop y ,s ) − ln(Pop y −1,s )    ]
      where s=male or female, y denotes year, Migrowthy is the growth rate in year y,
Misharey,s is the share of lifetime income for males or females in year y (or y-1 when that
subscript is used). Popy,s is the number of males or females in year y (or y-1 when that
subscript is used).
        (2) Education level-based quantity index
      In this case, five weighted growth rates in all years or six weighted growth rates after
2000 are used to create the Divisia index. The formula is:


       Migrowth y =
                        1
                        2 e
                                                                  [
                          ∑ (Mishare y ,e + Mishare y −1,e )× ln(Pop y ,e ) − ln(Pop y −1,e )    ]
      where e denotes education levels, including primary school, junior middle school,
senior middle school, etc. The other notation is the same as before.

II.2 Cost approach

      Kendrick is an early pioneer in the construction of human capital accounts.
Kendrick (1976) estimates both tangible and intangible human capital. Tangible human
capital includes child rearing costs. Intangible human capital includes education, training,
medical, health and safety expenditures, and mobility costs. Human capital stocks are
created using a perpetual inventory method where investment expenditures are cumulated
and existing stocks are depreciated. Implementation of a Kendrick approach for China is
difficult as Kendrick’s human capital investment is the sum of a long list of human
capital related costs, and reliable data on such information is only available for the most
recent decades.
      Tangible human capital investment is average lifetime rearing costs including
expenditures on food, shelter, health, schooling, and so on. The cost of parental time is
not included in this measure. Intangible human capital investment in formal and informal
education includes both private and government costs. Private formal education costs
include net rental for private education sector’s plant and equipment and students’
expenditures on supplies. The estimate for the cost of rentals of books and equipment
depends on a student’s imputed potential compensation. Government formal education
costs include all types of expenditure, including those for construction. Personal informal
education expenditures include a portion of those for radio, TV, records, books,
periodicals, libraries, museums, and so forth. Business and institutional expenditures
include a portion of those for media expenditures. Religious education expenditures are
imputed from figures on religious class attendance and imputed interest on plant and
                                                                                            9
equipment of religious organizations. Government expenditures include those for library,
recreation costs and military expenditures.
      Intangible human capital investment in training values initial nonproductive time
and nonwage costs and includes explicit training expenditures. Both specific and general
training is captured, as well as military training. A substantial fraction of medical, health
and safety expenditures, which are split between investment and preventive expenditures,
are by governments. Annual rental costs for plant and equipment are imputed when not
available.
      Kendrick considers his human capital mobility investment estimates to be tentative.
These include unemployment, job-search, hiring, and moving costs, for both residents
and immigrants. Depreciation is estimated using the depreciation methodology most
widely used at the time of his research: A double declining balance formula with a switch
to a straight-line method. Lifetimes in these formulas are assumed to be the reciprocal of
the percentage of persons in the group.
      Kendrick nominal human capital is about five times Gross Domestic Product.
However, Jorgenson-Fraumeni human capital is substantially larger than Kendrick human
capital.4 The Kendrick approach covers detailed aspects of human capital formation from
the cost side and provides a very complete menu for sum up all related cost to estimate
the value of human capital. Yet, the data requirement is enormous, for example, we may
need to get government statistics ninety years back to do the calculation. This is
impossible, given the People’s Republic of China is only 60 years old in 2009.
Additionally, it lacks guideline for many technique treatments, such as for the split of
health expenses between investment and preventative costs. Therefore, we do not adopt it
here for our calculation.


II.3 Indicator approach

      An example of an indicator approach is the Human Capital Index of the Lisbon
Council. It is a human capital input cost, or cost of creation approach. This index has
been constructed for the 13 European Union (EU) states and 12 Central and Eastern
European states as previously noted.5 The Human Capital Endowment measure is an
input to two of the other three components of the overall European Human Capital Index.
The Human Capital Endowment measure sums up expenditures on formal education and


4
  See table 37 of Jorgenson-Fraumeni (1989).
5
  See Ederer (2006) and Ederer et. al.(2007). The 2006 paper states that the index was
developed by the German think tank Deutschland Denken. In addition the paper states that
the paper is part of a research project undertaken by several individuals in the think tank
and with the institutional support of Zeppelin University.
10
the opportunity cost of parental education, adult education, and learning on the job.
Parental education includes teaching their children to speak, be trustful, have empathy,
take responsibility, etc. The Human Capital Utilization Index is the endowment measure
divided by total population and the Human Capital Productivity Measure is Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) divided by the endowment employed in the country.

      Finally the Demography and Employment measure estimates the number of people
who will be employed in the year 2030 in each country by looking at economic,
demographic, and migratory trends.6 As it has cost components and index components,
it is best viewed as a blend of a cost approach and an indicator approach. Since the
technique details for this approach have not been released, we do not apply it here in our
calculation.7



II.4 Attribute-based approach


      The attribute-based approach is usually considered to be a variant of the
income-based approach (Le, Gibson and Oxley 2003, 2005). However, it constructs an
index value of human capital instead of a monetary value in other income-based methods.
The primary advantage of an index value is that it nets out the effect of aggregate
physical capital on labor income, therefore this measure captures the variation in quality
and relevance of formal education across time and country.
      Based on the pioneer work of Mulligan and Sala-i-Martin (1997), Koman and
Marin (1997) applied the attribute-based method to Austria and Germany. However, our
method is akin to Laroche and Merette (2000) in that we also incorporate work
experience into the model along with formal education. That is, we also emphasize
informal channels, such as work experience, in the accumulation of human capital.
      Specifically in this method, the logarithm of human capital per capita in a country
at any time is computed using the following formula



           ⎛H⎞
         ln⎜ ⎟ = ∑∑ ω e ,a ln (ρ e ,a )
           ⎝L⎠ e a

  We have discussed with Dr. Ederer on possible collaboration of applying the China data
to their method in the future.

where e and a denote years of formal schooling and age, respectively.                                 ρ e,a = Le,a L
is the proportion of working age individuals of age a with e years of schooling.                             ω e,a   is

the efficiency parameter defined as proportion of wage income of workers of age a with e
years of schooling in the total wage bill of the economy. exp represents work experience,
which is defined as a-e-6. s is a gender index and                              ω e,a   is the share of men and women

of age a in the population. Parameters β, γ and δ are estimates from a standard Mincer
equation. The parameter β is often considered to be the rate of return to one more year of
formal education.
      In order to implement this method, we need to construct a population data set by
age, gender and educational attainment for each year we study. Secondly, we need two
sets of estimates from Mincer equations for each year, one for each gender. It is feasible
to calculate a human capital measure based on this approach. The major issue is that in
this setup, the measurement is actually a Cobb-Douglas formula. In other words, the
proportions of different education groups by construction are not “perfect substitutes.”
When the share of one education group increases, it could cause the total measurement to
decline. For example, if we increase the proportion of population with higher education,
the measurement should increase as the overall education get higher, but it could decline
due to the Cobb-Douglas formulation. This happened in our calculation. Since we believe
that an education-based human capital measurement should be a monotonically
increasing function of the overall education, we do not report the results of the
attribute-based approach. In our future work we plan to modify the structure, using, for
example, average years of schooling.8


II.5 Residual approach

      The World Bank (2006) uses a residual approach to estimating human capital for
120 countries. Due to data and methodological limitations, total wealth in the year 2000
is measured as the net present value of an assumed future consumption stream. The value
of produced capital stocks is estimated with the perpetual inventory method. Produced
capital includes both structures and equipment. Natural capital is valued by taking the
present value of resource rents. Natural capital includes nonrenewable resources,

8
 This point was confirmed by email communication with Dr. Reinhard Koman.
12
cropland, pastureland, forested areas, and protected areas. Intangible capital is equal to
total wealth minus produced and natural capital. Intangible capital is an aggregate which
includes human capital, the infrastructure of the country, social capital, and the returns
from net foreign financial assets. Net foreign financial assets are included because debt
interest obligations will affect the level of consumption. Intangible capital represents
greater than 50% of wealth for almost 85% of the countries studied.
      Using a net present value approach to estimate total wealth requires assumptions
about the time horizon and the discount rate. The World Bank chooses 25 years as the
time horizon as it roughly corresponds to one generation. It chooses a social discount rate
rather than a private rate as governments would use a social discount rate to allocate
resources across generations. The social discount rate is set at 4%, which is at the upper
range of estimates it reviewed for industrialized countries. The same rate is used for all
countries to facilitate comparisons across countries.
      A Cobb-Douglas specification is employed to estimate the marginal returns and
contribution of three types of intangible capital in the model. The model independent
variables include per capita years of schooling of the working population, human capital
abroad, and governance/social capital. Human capital abroad is measured by remittances
by workers outside the country. Governance/social capital is measured with a rule of law
index. Although the marginal return to human capital in the aggregate is the highest of
the three included intangible capital components, the contribution decomposition
demonstrates that the relative contributions can differ significantly across countries
(World Bank, 2006, chapter 7).

III. Data

III.1 Population

      In order to implement the various methods used in estimating human capital, we
first and foremost need annual population data by age, sex, and educational attainment.
We construct such data sets according to the following procedure.
      First, data sets are available for the years 1982, 1987, 1990, 1995, 2000, and 2005.
They are reported in various issues of Population Census, Population Sampling Survey,
and Population Yearbooks. The data sets also contain disaggregated numbers for urban
and rural populations.
      For all other years, we collect population data by age and sex from various issues
of China Population Yearbooks. Then we combine birth rate (China Statistical Yearbook),
mortality rate by age and sex (China Population Yearbook), and enrollment (including
new enrollment and graduation, China Education Statistical Yearbook) at different levels

                                                                                        13
of education to impute population by age, sex and educational attainment for each and
every year. We define the following levels of educational attainment: illiterate (no
schooling), primary school (Grade 1-6), junior middle school (Grade 7-9), senior middle
school (Grade 10-12), and college and above. From 2000 on, additional information
makes it possible to separate the population at the level of college and above into two:
one is college, and the other is university and above.
      Specifically, we use the following perpetual inventory formula to deduce
population by age, sex and educational attainment in missing years:

       L ( y, e, a, s ) = L ( y − 1, e, a, s ) ⋅ (1 − δ ( y, a, s ) ) + IF ( y, e, a, s )
                        −OF ( y, e, a, s ) + EX ( y, e, a, s )
L(y,e,a,s) is the population in year y at education level e, with age a and sex s. δ(y,a,s) is
the mortality rate in year y, with age a and sex s. IF(y,e,a,s) and OF(y,e,a,s) are inflow
and outflow of this particular group. For example, inflow would include individuals just
achieved this level of education, while outflow would include those who just achieved the
next level of education. EX(y,e,a,s) is a discrepancy term. Moreover,


       IF ( y, e, a, s ) = λ ( y, e, a, s ) ⋅ ERS ( y, e, s )
      OF ( y, e, a, s ) = λ ( y, e + 1, a, s ) ⋅ ERS ( y, e + 1, s )

      ∑ λ ( y, e, a, s ) = 1
        a

ERS is the matriculation at education level e, λ is the age distribution at education level e.
In order to obtain accurate estimate for λ, we use both microeconomic data sets (China
Health and Nutrition Survey and China Household Income Project) and macroeconomic
data sets (China Education Statistical Yearbook). Next we discuss several salient features
of China’s population growth, especially the educational attainment by age, sex, and
location (i.e. urban and rural). First of all, during our sample period, China’s total
population increased from 1.02 billion in 1982 to 1.32 billion in 2007. The urban
population increased by 379 million, while the rural population decreased by 74 million
(Figure III.1.1). As a result, the urban share in the total population rose from 21% in 1982
to 45% in 2007. The male and female population almost rose at the same pace, with the
male’s share remained at around 51% (Figure III.1.2).

was relatively stable from 2000 to 2007. The number of primary school graduates
increased from 359 million in 1982 to the peak of 466 million in 1997, then declined
gradually to 399 million in 2007. This decline is expected as more primary school
graduates continue on to higher education level instead of terminating formal education.
This is also evident in the rapid growth of junior middle school graduates.
                        Junior middle school students registered the largest growth among all education
levels: the number of junior middle school graduates increased from 181 million in 1982
to 471 million in 2007. This might be related to the implementation of 9-Year
Compulsory Schooling since 1994 (9-year schooling amounts to completing junior
middle school). However, the growth slowed after 2001. Senior middle school and
college and over, both started from very low numbers and have grown significantly.
Senior middle school graduates increased from 68 million in 1982 to 166 million in 2007,
while college and above increased from only 6 million in 1982 to 76 million in 2007.

              We next take a closer look at the changes in the distribution of education
attainment in the population from 1982 to 2007. Figures III.1.4~7 show the rightward
shift of the educational attainment distribution in the population. In 1982, among the five
education levels, the illiterates take up the largest portion. The 1988 distribution is
dominated by people with primary and less education, i.e. the distribution remains
heavily skewed to the right. In 1998, the distribution is dominated by primary and junior
middle graduates. By 2007, junior middle has become the dominant education level. The
distribution is still skewed to the right, but it is much less so than in 1982. Moreover,
female educational attainment has improved more relative to that of males; the number of
illiterate females decreased faster than that of illiterate males, while the gender
differences at higher education levels shrunk considerably. As a result, the female
educational attainment distribution is becoming similar to that of the male, despite the
drastic difference in 1982.

                                                                                                                    17

              Figures III.1.8~11 disaggregate the data into rural and urban samples. Not
surprisingly, most of the illiterate population resided in the rural area. However, the rural
illiterate population fell from 349 million in 1982 to 144 million in 2007. Although the
urban illiterate population changed slightly in absolute terms, its share in the urban
population fell from nearly a quarter in 1982 to 10.86% in 2007. In the meantime, in the
highest three levels of education (junior middle, senior middle, and college and over),
urban growth outpaced rural growth. For example, the urban junior middle school
population more than tripled from 58 million to 208 million, while the rural junior middle
school population roughly doubled, from 123 million to 263 million. The comparison is
more startling in the highest two education levels. The urban senior middle school
population increased from 18 million to 122 million, while the rural senior middle school
population only increased from 35 million to 44 million. The urban college and over
population increased 14-fold, from 5 million to 71 million, while in rural areas, it grew
6-fold, but remained very small, at only 5 million individuals.
              Note that during the entire sample period, the rural population far exceeded the
urban population. Although both the urban and the rural distributions have improved, i.e.
less skewed to the right, the improvement has certainly been more rapid and obvious in
the urban area. One caveat, however, is that the result might be caused by better educated
people migrating from rural to urban areas. We take special measures to control for that
effect.


III.2 Obtaining parameter estimates of the Mincer equation

              One important component of the income approach is the estimation of future
potential earnings for all individuals in the population. We conduct estimation and make
projection based on the basic Mincer (1974) equation. It has been shown that there are

                                                                                                           19
significant differences in the structure of the earnings equation across gender and
between the rural and urban population. To ensure our income estimates to be as accurate
as possible, we estimate the parameters for the rural and urban population by gender and
year using survey data in selected years and derive their imputed values for missing years
over the period of 1985 to 2020.
        We first estimate the basic Mincer equation:

        ln ( inc ) = α + β ⋅ e + γ ⋅ exp + δ ⋅ exp 2 + u                        （1）

        where ln(inc) is the logarithm of earnings, e is years of schooling, exp and exp2 are,
respectively, years of work experience and experience squared, and u is a random error.
The coefficient α is an estimate of the average log earnings of individuals with zero years
of schooling and work experience, β is an estimate of the return to an extra year of
schooling, and γ and δ measure the return to investment in on-the-job training.
        Equation (1) has been the workhorse widely adopted in empirical research on
earnings determination. It has been estimated on a large number of data sets for numerous
countries and time periods. Many studies have applied the model to Chinese data and
found evidence consistent with the human capital theory. Notable studies include, among
others, Liu (1998), Maurer-Fazio (1999), Li (2003), Fleisher and Wang (2004), Yang
(2005), and Zhang et al. (2005). Following the convention of a large body of empirical
literature, we estimate equation (1) by ordinary least squares.9
        The data used for estimating the parameters of the earnings equation come from
two well-known household surveys in China. The first is the annual Urban Household
Survey (UHS) conducted by the National Statistical Bureau of China over the period of
1986-1997. We use this data set to estimate the parameters of equation (1) for each
gender of the urban population by year, and then extract fitted estimates by applying
linear or exponential time trends. We use the fitted time trends to generate the imputed
parameters of the earnings equation for the urban population for the period 1985 through
2020.
        The second data set we use is the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) for
the years of 1989, 1991, 1993, 1997, and 2000. This survey covers both the urban and
rural population. We use CHNS to obtain earnings-equation parameter estimates by year
for each gender and separately for the rural and urban population. We calculate the
urban-to-rural ratio for each of these parameters. We then use the ratio to fit a time trend
model (i.e. interpolate and extrapolate), which is used to generate fitted values of the

9
  Griliches (1977) finds that accounting for the endogeneity of schooling and ability bias
does not alter the estimates of earnings equation. Ashenfelter and Krueger (1994) also
conclude that omitted ability variables do not cause an upward bias in the estimated
parameters of equation (1).
20
urban-to-rural ratio over the period 1985 to 2020. We use the fitted ratios along with the
imputed parameters for the urban population to derive the imputed parameters for the
rural population over the period 1985 to 2020.

III.2.1 Imputing the earnings equation parameters for the urban population

      The UHS is a representative sample of the urban population. The sample size
varies from year to year, ranging from a low of 4,934 respondents in 1986 to a high of
31,266 respondents in 1992. Individual earnings are annual wage incomes, which include
basic wage, bonus, subsidies and other work-related incomes. Years of schooling are
calculated using the information on the level of schooling completed: primary school
equals 6 years of schooling, junior middle school 9 years, senior middle school 12 years,
professional school 11 years, community college 15 years, and college and above 16
years. Assuming schooling begins at age 6, we approximate work experience by age
minus years of schooling minus 6. As the minimum legal working age is 16 and the
retirement ages are 60 and 55 for males and females respectively, we restrict our sample
to include individuals who are currently employed and are between 16 and 60 years of
age for male workers and between 16 and 55 for female workers. Self-employed and
temporary job holders are excluded, so are those who failed to report wage income or
educational attainment.
      We use the UHS data to estimate the earnings equation for each gender by year.
They are by and large in line with the estimates reported in previous studies using the
same or similar Chinese data. The constant term, which measures the base wage for the
no-school no-experience population, clearly reveals the male advantage (Figure III.2.1.1).
Returns to schooling are positive and in general increasing over the sample years (Figure
III.2.1.2). Male return increased from a meager 1.7% in 1986 to 7.2% in 1997, while
female return also increased from 4.2% in 1986 to 10.8% in 1997. Wang, Fleisher, Li,
and Li (2009) also reports that female rates of return dominate male returns, and they
offered an explanation. Rising returns to education have been a ubiquitous phenomenon
in transitional economies when the Soviet-type wage grid was replaced by market wages
(Fleisher, Sabirianova, Wang 2005). Earnings also increase with work experience but at a
decreasing rate — a pattern found in most studies. Over time the earnings-experience
profile shifts up for male (Figure III.2.1.3) but fluctuates for females. For most recent
years the male profile doesn’t curve downward as much as that of the female (Figure
III.2.1.4), and the male profile is much higher than the female profile, indicating
uniformly higher return to experience for male than for female, ceteris paribus.

             When we plot each of the parameter estimates against time, they are generally
trended. The large changes in the values of the estimated intercepts and coefficients on
work experience and experience squared from 1986 and 1987 to 1988 are puzzling. We
suspect that these changes may have been due to inconsistency in survey methodology
adopted across the initial few years of the survey. We exclude these outliers from the
time trend estimation of the parameters. For each parameter, we regress its estimates
against time under two alternate specifications: a linear time trend model, and an
exponential trend model where the logarithm of the parameter estimate is the dependent
variable. The AIC values, a popular test for model selection, suggest that the linear time
trend specification is appropriate for the intercept and the schooling parameter, while the
exponential trend specification is suitable for the parameters associated with work
experience and experience squared. As the coefficient on experience squared is negative,
the dependent variable is defined as the log of the absolute value of the parameter
estimates.
             We use the fitted trend lines to generate imputed values of the parameters for each
gender by year over the period 1985 to 2007. While there is some evidence that the
pre-1997 trends of these parameters, particularly the one associated with schooling,
continued after 1997 and up to 2007 (see e.g., Zhang et. al. 2005), it is unclear if the
trends will extend beyond 2007. We therefore assume, probably rather conservatively,
that the earnings equation parameters remain constant for the period 2007 to 2020 and are
equal to the fitted values of their counterparts in 2007. Table III.2.1.1 reports the imputed
values of the parameters for the urban population by gender and year.

III.2.2 Imputing the earnings equation parameters for the rural population

      The CHNS is an ongoing international collaborative project between the Carolina
Population Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the National
Institute of Nutrition and Food Safety at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and
Prevention and was designed for evaluating the impact of social and economic
transformation of the Chinese society on socioeconomic, demographic, and health
behaviors of the urban and rural population. The survey also contains information on
income, age and educational attainment, which we use to estimate the earnings equation
by year for each gender and separately for the urban and rural population. For the urban
sample, earnings contain wage income and subsidies from work.
      The rural sample contains only household income, which includes family
members’ incomes from the collective or household productions or both in five distinct
activities: gardening, farming, raising livestock, fishing, and small handicraft and family
businesses. We allocate household income to each individual member according to his or
her working hours as a share of the household’s total. Years of schooling are calculated
based on the reported grade or years completed (depending on the sample year). Work
experience is approximated by age minus years of schooling minus 6. We restrict our
sample to males between 16 and 60 years of age and females between 16 and 55 who
reported information on education and income.
      We use the CHNS data to estimate equation (1) by gender and separately for the
rural and urban samples for each of the sample year (i.e., 1989, 1991, 1993, 1997, and
2000). The parameter estimates are then used to calculate the urban-to-rural ratio for each
parameter by gender. We use the ratios to fit an exponential trend model, which is used to
generate the fitted ratios for the period 1985 to 2007. We assume that the ratios remain
constant for the period 2007 to 2020 and are equal to the fitted values of their
counterparts in 1997. The fitted urban-to-rural ratios by themselves provide interesting
insights. For example, in 1985, the urban no-schooling no-experience male cohort was on
average paid 9.8% more than its rural counterpart, and by 2007 this gap has increased to
14.6%. In the meantime, the urban no-schooling no-experience female cohort was on
average paid 6.7% more than its rural counterpart, and by 2007 the rural cohort was paid
1.8% more than the urban cohort. Return to education is always higher for rural male than
for urban male. In 1985, the rate of return was 16% higher for rural male, and by 2007 it
was 33% higher. For female, however, it is a different story. Return to education for
urban female was 63% higher than rural female, but by 2007 the return to urban female
was 22% less than rural female. The relation between urban and rural return to experience
has also changed. All of these are not central to our current project, but nevertheless
deserves attention in future research.
                                                                                        25
       We use these ratios along with the imputed parameters for the urban population in
Table III.2.1.1 to impute parameters for the rural population which are presented in Table
III.2.2.1.

III.3 Growth rates of real income and the discount rate


      To measure lifetime earnings for all individuals in the population, we need to
project incomes for future years, discount these incomes back to the present, and weight
income for each individual by the age- and gender-specific probability of survival. We
use the imputed earnings equation parameters to estimate earnings for all individuals in a
given year, and then derive earnings for future years until retirement assuming real
earnings grow at a constant rate.10 The main task of this section is to estimate the
expected growth rate of real income and select an appropriate discount rate. Since the real
income grew at fairly different rates in the past for the urban and rural population, we
estimate them separately.

III.3.1 Growth rates of real income

      Assuming that the technology is labor-augmenting, we specify the aggregate
production function as:

      Y = ( AL) a K b

where Y is output, A denotes a technology factor, L denotes labor input, and K physical
capital input. The average product of labor or labor productivity is proportional to the
marginal product of labor.11 Because the marginal product of labor equals the real wage
when the labor market is in equilibrium, labor productivity and the real wage are
expected to grow at the same rate. Therefore, the growth rate of real output per employed
worker can serve as a reasonable estimate for the growth rate of the real wage.

      National Statistical Bureau of China publishes nominal GDP and real GDP index
(in 1978 prices) by sector (primary industry, secondary industry, and tertiary industry).
We derive real GDP as the product of nominal GDP in the base year and real GDP index.
The labor productivity in the rural sector is defined as real GDP of the primary industry
divided by the number of persons employed in the primary industry. The labor
productivity in the urban sector is the ratio of real GDP of the secondary and tertiary
industries to the number of persons employed in these industries.




10
   Mincer equation parameter estimates are used to calculate the cohort-wise labor income
for a given year, it is not used to project future income.
11
   The marginal product of labor is given by βQ/L, where Q/L is the average product of
labor.
28
      In the past 30 years labor productivity grew on average 4.11% and 6% per annum
in the rural and urban sectors, respectively. We assume labor productivities (and hence
the real income) continue to grow annually at these average rates.12

III.3.2 The discount rate

      The discount rate that is used to value future incomes in present terms should
reflect the rate of return one expects from investments over a long time horizon. In this
regard, the interest rate paid on government bonds is a good proxy. We choose a discount
rate of 3.14%, which is the average interest rate on the 10-year government bonds issued
to individual investors over the period 1996 to 2007, net of the average rate of inflation
over the same period. It should be noted that our discount rate is lower than the discount
rates used in the Jorgenson and Fraumeni studies cited in this report.


III.4 Additional data imputations and assumptions for the Jorgenson- Fraumeni
      estimates


      Besides annual population data by age, sex, and educational attainment, the
Jorgenson-Fraumeni method requires additional information on the lifetime income,
enrollment rate, growth rate of real wage, and discount rate. We briefly discuss how we
construct these supplemental data sets in this section. Some parameters have to be set at
values appropriate for China.
      Following Jorgenson and Fraumeni, an individual may assume one of the following
six statuses at any time: no school or work (age 0-5), school only (age 6-16), work and
school (age 16 to age), work only (age to retirement), and retirement (age 60+ for male
and 55+ for female). Each status implies a different pattern of age-income profile,
therefore the method of computing lifetime income shall be different.
      We first estimate a standard Mincer equation (i.e. with a regression of annual
income on schooling years, work experience, and work experience squared) with
microeconomic data sets (China Household Income Project, China Health and Nutrition
Survey, and Urban Household Survey). We use annual employment rates by age, sex, and
educational attainment (from China Population Statistical Yearbook and China
Population Census) to convert annual income into annual market income. Then the
lifetime income for each age/sex/education category can be calculated using the
methodology described in the earlier section.




12
   One obvious concern is how fast these rates will converge to the long-run steady-state
rates, and what are the long-run steady-state rates. Our future research will address these
issues.
                                                                                          29
      For the in-school population, we carefully derive the number of people in each
education level with data on new enrollment, mortality rate, and attrition rate. We
consider the following five categories of schooling: no schooling, primary school, junior
middle school, senior middle school, and college and above or for six categories of
schooling college and university and above. We compute lifetime income for every grade
at each education level, taking into account how likely the individual will continue into
the next grade and the next education level. For the five categories of schooling estimates
college and above is the highest education level. For the six categories of schooling
estimates college or university and above are the highest education levels. We do not
allow for the possibility that one can go to college then followed by university.
      As not all data is available by single year of age or by individual level of education,
some additional imputations and assumptions are needed. Enrollment and grade
advancement imputations and assumptions are described in this section.
      The imputation of two components of the J-F human capital estimates is described
in this section: 1) Number of years until an education category is completed, and 2) The
probability of advancing to the next higher education category. A decision was made to
assume that all students complete a grade level (if they continue) in the same number of
years: 6 for primary, 3 for junior middle, and 3 for senior middle school. It is also
assumed that no drop-outs return to school and that education continues without a break.
These assumptions are also made by J-F. The probability of advancing to the next higher
education level is estimated as the average ratio of the sum of all students of any age in a
year who are initially enrolled to the sum of all students of any age initially enrolled in
the next higher education level “X” years later. “X” depends upon the number of years it
takes to complete an education level. The imputations and assumptions allow for the
appropriate discounting of a future higher income level.
      In each case, advancing students are tracked from their age of initial enrollment,
through individual grade levels, until they advance to the next higher level. The number
of years discounted until they realize the higher level of lifetime income depends on the
number of years it takes to advance given the current grade of enrollment.
      Then, we treat the terminal education level as a probabilistic event, and therefore
the lifetime income is a forecast based on the contemporary information set, except that
the probability of advancing depends on initial enrollments at a higher education level in
subsequent years. For instance, the lifetime income of a student who is in the first year of
junior middle school, assuming she will live to finish junior middle school and goes onto
senior middle school depends upon an adjusted lifetime income of someone who is
currently three years older and whose educational attainment is senior middle school.

           We use the average labor productivity growth rate as the real income (wage)
growth rate. Moreover, we use the labor productivity growth rate in the primary sector as
the rural real wage growth rate, and labor productivity growth rate in the secondary and
tertiary sectors as the urban real wage growth rate. For our sample period of 1985-2007, it
is 6% for urban workers and 4.11% for rural workers. As of the subjective discount rate
as noted earlier, we use the long-term government bonds (average real) interest rate for
the sample period, and it is 3.14%.


IV Result discussions


IV.1 Total human capital stock, GDP, and physical capital stock


           Our main results are based on the J-F approach. The estimated total human capital
stock at the national level for 1985-2007 is reported in Table IV.1.1. Columns 1 and 2
contain the total human capital measured in nominal terms, and columns 3 and 4 present
the total human capital measured in real terms (in 1985 RMB). In this table, the real
values are calculated using CPI.13 Figure IV.1.1 shows the trend of human capital in both
real and nominal values.
           Before 2000, five education categories were reported by the National Bureau of
Statistics of China. They are: no school, elementary school, junior middle school, senior
middle school, and college and above. Starting from 2000, the college and above was
further divided into two categories: three-year college, and four-year college and above.14
To take advantage of this more detailed information on educational attainment, we create
a separate human capital series starting from 2000. As can be seen from Figure IV.1.2,
total human capital becomes larger with six education categories. This is because the



13
   Because the total human capital is the sum of rural and urban human capital, we use CPI
for rural and urban separately in the estimation.
14
   When we estimate Mincer equation to generate annual earnings, we assign 15 years of
schooling for the category of three-year college; and assign 16 years of schooling for the
category four-year college and above. Because we use the lower bound of schooling for
this education category, the amount of human capital is underestimated.
                                                                                         31
  lifetime incomes of graduates of four-year college and above are higher than those who
  graduated from three-year colleges.

                In order to get a sense of the magnitude of the estimated total human capital in
          China, we also reported nominal GDP in Table IV.1.1. The ratio of estimated (market)
          human capital to GDP generally declines over time until 2005-7, when it is between 18
          and 20.    Jorgenson and Fraumeni (1992a)’s estimates of the ratio of total market human
          capital to GDP in the U.S. from 1947 to 1986 is between 18 and 22. A summary of
          international comparison of human capital estimates is reported in Table IV.1.2. China’s
          total human capital is quite large, more than any country except the U.S. However,
          China’s per capita human capital is still very small. In China during the later period, the
          growth of population slowed but the economy continues to grow at a higher rate, which
          contributes to the declining ratio of human capital to GDP (Figure IV.1.3).

*. Use the deflator based on 1952 to convert to the deflator based on 1985 (See Table C.9).


           Moreover, we also compare our human capital estimates with the estimated total
physical capital stock in China. There are a few estimates of China’s capital stock. In
Table IV.1.3 the estimated capital stock is estimated by Zhang, Wu and Zhang (2004)
published in Economic Research, a leading academic journal in China. In Table IV.1.4,
we use the capital stock estimates reported in Holz (2006). In both tables, we use the
same deflators reported in the paper to calculate the human capital stock, respectively.

                                                                                                                                                                            35
      As can be seen in Figure IV.1.4 and Figure IV.1.5, in both cases, the total human
capital is much higher than total physical capital. More specifically, human capital is
about 10-20 times of the amount of physical capital. This is not surprising, given that in
most countries human capital accounts for over 60% of national wealth (which also
include natural resources). On the other hand, the ratio of human capital to physical
capital appears to be declining continuously, based on both estimates of physical capital.
It is unclear whether such a trend indicates that the Chinese government has overly
weighted toward physical capital investment relative to human capital investment.15

IV. 2 The trend of total human capital stock


                 In order to discuss the trend of the total human capital in China, we use CPI as
deflator to calculate the real values. One reason is that other published deflators are not
available for later years; and the other reason is that, as can be seen above, the results
based on CPI are smaller than that based on capital deflators reported in those two studies.
Thus, we give more conservative estimates of human capital in China.
                 From 1985 to 2007, the total human capital increased from RMB 26.98 trillion to
118.75 trillion, an increase of more than three-fold. The average annual growth for this
period is 6.74% per year, considerably lower than economic growth.16 Over the same
period, the Chinese economy grew at an annual rate of 9.33%.17 This helps explain the
declining ratio of human capital to GDP. However, such a growth rate is much higher
compared to that in other countries. For example, for 1970-2000, the annual average
growth of human capital in Canada was 1.7% per year (Gu and Wang 2009). Moreover,
the growth of human capital accelerated after 1994. The average annual growth for
1985-94 is 5.11%, and for 1995-07 is 7.86%.
                 The results based on six education categories give similar trend (Figure IV.2.1).
From 2000 to 2007, the total human capital increased from RMB 73.5 trillion to 122.38
trillion. The average annual growth rate for this period was 7.28%. The total human
capital for male is higher than that for female (Figure IV.2.2). One reason is the earlier
retirement age for women (age 55, vs. age 60 for men based on China labor law), and


16
   In calculating annual average growth rate in this report, we calculate annual growth rate
using the difference of logarithm for every year, and then take average across years.

   The data come from “China Statistical Yearbook 2008”, Table 2-4.

thus men have longer time to generate income in the market. The other reason is higher
educational attainment for men. Moreover, the male-female income gap has been on
rising. The results based on six education categories shows similar trends.

                 Figure IV.2.3 shows the total human capital for urban and rural China separately.
Before 1995, the amount of total human capital in both areas was very close. In fact, rural
human capital was even larger than that in the urban area until 1993. Since 1995,
however, the human capital in the urban area has been rising much more rapidly. The
total human capital for the rural area was 16.03 trillion in 1985 and 40.25 trillion in 2007;
and for the urban area it was 10.95 trillion and 78.50 trillion, respectively. In this period,
the annual growth rates of human capital were 4.19% (4.99% after 1995) and 8.95%
(9.90% after 1995) for rural and urban areas, respectively. The urban-rural gap in the
estimated human capital stock increased from 1.24 trillion in 1995 to 38.25 trillion in
2007, growing at an annual rate of 28.55%. Figure IV.2.4 shows the total human capital
estimates in urban and rural areas based on six education categories. The trends are
similar to those based on five education categories.18

  However, our estimates for the rural area are rather conservative because we assume the
same male retirement age of 60 and female retirement age of 55 as in the urban area. In fact,
many rural residents continue to work after these ages.

                There are several reasons for such a trend. First, in early years, the rural
population dominated, and thus had larger amount of human capital. For example, in
1985, there were 733 million people in rural areas, which were more than three times the
urban population of 229 million. By 2007, however, the population in rural China
reduced to 608 million, much closer to the urban population of 507 million. This change
was, to a large extent, a result of the rapid urbanization during the course of economic
transition as well as a large scale rural-urban migration.
               The second reason is the education gap between the urban and rural population. In
urban areas, the population with education at college or above accounted for 2.47% of the
total population in 1985. This proportion increased to 13.01% by 2007. While in rural
areas, the corresponding figures were 0.074% in 1985 and 0.93% in 2007.

                      Figures IV.2.5 and IV.2.6 show the trends of male and female human capital
estimates in urban and rural areas, respectively. Male and female human capital estimates
in the urban area exhibit similar trend. But the gender gap seems to be widening. The
gender-based human capital estimates for the rural population painted a somewhat
different picture. In the later part of the period, the growth of human capital of males
seems to have slowed down while that of females seems to have sped up, and therefore
the gender gap became narrower. This result is probably caused by two factors: i) a
disproportionate rural-to-urban migration in favor of men; and ii) an increase in education
for women in rural areas. The reduction of gender gap in the rural area is consistent with


42
the rising gender disparity in the urban area. Similar patterns emerge from the results
based on six education categories (Figures IV.2.7 and IV.2.8).

        Finally we calculate human capital index using 1985 as the base year and set its
value at 100. The results for each group are reported in Table IV.2.1. Figure IV.2.9 shows
the index of total human capital, and Figures IV.2.10 and IV.2.11 show the index by
gender for urban and rural areas, respectively.

IV.3 Per capita human capital


      The increase in the total human capital can be caused by population growth,
demographic changes (e.g., the size of retirement group), rural-urban migration or
urbanization (e.g., an individual can achieve higher value of human capital by moving
from rural to urban area), higher educational attainment, higher rates of return to
education, higher rates of return to on-the-job training, etc. In order to get further
information on the dynamics of human capital in China, we calculate per capita human
capital, i.e., the ratio of total human capital over non-retired population (Table IV.3.1).
      Figures IV.3.1 and IV.3.2 show per capita human capital based on 5- and
6-education categories, respectively. Based on 5-education category, the per capita
human capital was RMB 28,044 in 1985, RMB 41,500 in 1995, and RMB 106,462 in
2007. From 1985 to 2007, per capita human capital increased 2.80 times; while over the
same period, per capita real GDP increased 6.68 times, much faster than the growth of
per capita human capital. Per capita human capital has been increasing since 1985, and
the growth accelerated from 1995. The average annual growth rate was 3.9% from 1985
to 1994, and 7.5% from 1995 to 2007. The growth rate in the later period is almost twice
as high as that in the earlier period.

      These growth rates are very high compared to those for Canada and the United
States. Per capita human capital for Canada basically remained constant during

1980-2000 and even declined at an annual rate of -0.2% during 2000-2007 (Wu and
Ambrose 2009). Per capita human capital in the United States also basically remained
constant during 1994-2006 (Christian 2009). Such a huge difference is probably caused
by the dramatic economic growth since 1978, rapid expansion of education, transition
toward market-oriented system (so that human capital can realize much higher value),
and rural-urban migration.

            Per capita human capital shows a similar trend for males and females. Specifically,
the average annual growth rate for 1985-1994 was 4.8% for males and 2.6% for females;
the average annual growth rate for 1995-2007 was 7.2% for males and 8.1% for females.
Clearly, the percentage point increase in the growth rates between the two periods is
substantially greater for females than for males. In fact, from 1996 onward, the growth
rate was lower for males than for females.
       Figures IV.3.3 and IV.3.4 show per capita human capital for urban and rural areas
based on two alternative classifications of education. Based on 5-education category, in
1985, per capita human capital is 47,874 in the urban area and 21,856 in the rural area;
the corresponding numbers become 154,803 and 66,164, respectively, in 2007. The
absolute size of the urban-rural gap has been on the rise. The annual growth rate was
5.33% for the urban area (4.46% for 1985-1994 and 5.94% for 1995-2007), and 5.03%

48
for the rural area (2.55% for 1985-1994 and 6.75% for 1995-2007). Therefore, the
urban-rural gap was widening for 1985-1994, while it has narrowed thereafter. The wide
urban-rural gap raises concern for the increasing disparity between these two areas. Based
on Fleisher, Li and Zhao (2009), human capital is a significant contributing factor to
economic growth (total factor productivity). Therefore, such a trend in human capital can
worsen the urban-rural inequality in China.

        Figures IV.3.5 and IV.3.6 show the gender differences for urban and rural areas,
respectively. The patterns are similar to that of total human capital. In particular, per
capita human capital for males and females show similar trend in the urban area, but per
capita human capital grew faster for females than males in the rural area in recent years.
From 1985 to 2002, rural male per capita human capital grew at an annual rate of 4.90%
compared to 2.78% for females; from 2003 to 2007, however, the growth rates were

                                                                                       49
6.72% and 11.06%, respectively. Although both male and female growth rates have
increased, the female growth rate has increased much more than the male.

IV.4 Divisia indexes


      Two partial alternative indexes are constructed for real human capital. The first
aggregates by gender and the second over five education levels.                                                                                 These indexes are
partial Divisia indexes (Gu and Wong, 2009) as they do not separately identify all of the
components of human capital: gender, age, education, and location and they are first
order indexes. Nonetheless these indexes are of interest because they show the
differential trends in human capital by gender compared to education. These indexes are
shown in Table IV.4.1 and Figures IV.4.1~2.
      The education index is constructed as follows. The growth rate of aggregate human
capital stock is calculated as a weighted sum of the growth rates of the number of
individuals across different educational categories:

      d ln K e = ∑ ve d ln Le
                                e


where dlnKe denotes the growth rate of aggregate human capital and Le denotes the
number of individuals with education level e. Also,

      d ln Le = ln Le ( y ) − ln Le ( y − 1)

where y denotes the year. The weights are given by nominal human capital shares for
each educational level:

      ve =
             1
               [ve ( y ) + ve ( y − 1)]   ve =
             2                                   ∑ Mie
                                                 e


where Mie is the nominal human capital of individuals with education level e.

     The partial index for gender is estimated in a similar fashion, with the

subcomponents being male and female instead of education categories. The rate of

growth of the education index is substantially higher than that for the gender index. Given

the substantial increase in educational attainment over this time period, this is not

surprising. From 1986 to 1994, the gender index grew at a 1.15% rate compared to a

14.09% rate for the education index. From 1994 to 2007, the corresponding numbers are

0.33% and 5.5%, respectively.

IV.5 Human capital in China 2008-2020: a projection


         In order to understand future trend of human capital in China, we estimate human
capital for 2008-2020. In particular, we forecast population in different age, gender and
education groups using the perpetual inventory method, and then estimate human capital
using the Jorgenson-Fraumeni method. For simplicity, we keep all other related data and
parameters at their 2007 values.19
         If we only project population in different age, gender and education groups for
2008 to 2020 while keeping other variables at their 2007 values, the change in human

  Due to data limitation, we use the average values of year 1995 and 2000 for age, gender
and education based employment rates.

capital will mainly reflect the change in population composition. Figure IV.5.1 shows that
results based on 5- and 6-education categories.

             In both cases, the total human capital increases but at a much slower rate
compared to that before 2008. The average annual growth rate is 0.61%, based on
5-education-category. This is much lower than the average annual growth of 6.74% for
1985-2007.              There are several reasons for the slower growth. First, the return to
education is kept at 2007 level, but was rising before that period. Return to education has
a strong effect on lifetime earnings. Second, population growth will slow down in China
due to the one-child policy. Third, it is expected that the growth of human capital will
slow down when the economy gets closer to its steady state, including wage growth,
returns to schooling, etc.
       A similar pattern can be seen in male and female total human capital and per
capita human capital (Figures IV.5.2 and IV.5.3).               Interestingly the trends are quite
different for urban and rural areas. As Figure IV.5.4 shows, urban human capital
continues to increase throughout the entire period. However, the rural human capital
declines. This is probably caused by the continuing declining of rural population, as a
result of urbanization and rural-urban migration. However, the per capita human capital
(Figure IV.5.5) in the rural area is quite flat and does not show a downward trend.

V Conclusions

      In this report, we presented our estimates of China’s human capital for 1985-2007,
using J-F lifetime income approach. We calculated total human capital at the national
level, for urban and rural, and for male and female, as well as per capita human capital.
We also constructed various human capital indexes, including partial Divisia quantity
indexes. We projected the trend of human capital in one scenario for up to year 2020.
      Our main findings are summarized below：
      First, for the period of 1985-2007, China’s total human capital increased more than
three times, with an annual growth rate of 6.74%. This growth rate is much higher
compared to other countries. Moreover, the growth of human capital accelerated after
1994, and the average annual growth for 1995-07 is 7.86%.

                                                                                         57
      Second, the total human capital in urban area increased at a much higher rate than
in rural area over the period 1985-07. The annual average growth rates are 8.95% and
4.19% respectively for urban and rural areas. The total human capital in urban area
surpassed that in rural area in 1993. The urban-rural gap has been widening rapidly,
probably because of urbanization, large-scale rural-urban migration, and increase in
educational attainment.
      Third, per capita human capital also increased rapidly from 1985-2007, with a
higher growth rate since 1995. Interestingly, before 1995 total human capital increased
faster than per capita human capital on average, while since 1995, both have grown at a
similar average annual rate. This result indicates that in recent years, the growth of
human capital is mostly driven by factors such as increases in educational attainment, not
by population growth.
      Fourth, the gender gap in total human capital has been widening at the national
level. However, the gender difference in per capita human capital appears to be
narrowing down.
      Fifth, the partially education-based human capital index grew at a much higher rate
than the gender-based index. This indicates the greater impact of education on China’s
human capital accumulation.
      On the other hand, our results also show that, compared to GDP and physical
capital, human capital grew at a slower pace. More specifically, the ratio of human capital
to GDP decreased from approximately 30 in 1985 to 18 in 2007; and the ratio of human
capital to physical capital also declined from 16-19 in 1985 to 11~12 in 2003, these
findings indicates that the Chinese government should invest more in human capital,
especially compared to physical capital investment.
      The gap in total human capital and per capita human capital between urban and
rural areas has been increasing. Thus, in order to reduce urban-rural inequality, more
investment in human capital should be directed to the rural area.
      Finally, our projection to 2020 shows that, if we keep everything else at the 2007
level and only allow population to change, the growth of total human capital and per
capita human capital will slow down after 2007. The amount of total human capital will
even decline in rural China.       Therefore, more active policies on human capital
investment should be adopted in order to maintain the high speed growth.
      Our future work includes: i) finding more data to improve estimates of lifetime
earnings and other related variables; ii) refining the estimation of some related parameters
and data; and iii) refining our projections of future incomes and testing the effects of
various policy scenarios on human capital accumulation.

Acknowledgement


      This research project and international symposium have benefited tremendously
from supports inside and outside the Central University of Finance and Economics
(CUFE). President Guangqian Wang of CUFE supported the project from the very
beginning, and encouraged us to finish the preliminary study ahead of the schedule. Vice
President Junsheng Li, President Assistant Lifen Zhao, and Director of Research Office
Baowen Sun coordinated with various departments and facilitated the project and the
symposium. Many offices in the university, such as the President’s Office, Office of
Research, Assets Management Office, Finance Office, Human Resources Office, and
International Cooperation Office, cooperated to help the CHLR’s research endeavor.
Office spaces, conference facilities and computer labs were generously provided by the
university Virtual Experiment Lab, the School of International Exchange, the Academy
of Public Finance and Policy, and the School of Marxism Studies. The School of
Economics at Georgia Institute of Technology, especially the Chair, Professor Patrick
McCarthy, also generally supported the project. Last but not least, we greatly appreciate
the help from two academic journals -- Economic Research and Labor Economics and
Relations.
