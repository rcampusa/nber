                                         ABSTRACT

A policy debate centers around the question how news aggregators such as Google News affect
traffic to online news sites. Many publishers view aggregators as substitutes for traditional news
consumption while aggregators view themselves as complements because they make news
discovery easier. We use Spain as a natural experiment because Google News shut down
altogether in response to a copyright reform enacted in December 2014. We compare the news
consumption of a large number of Google News users with a synthetic control group of similar
non-Google News users. We find that the shutdown of Google News reduces overall news
consumption by about 20% for treatment users, and reduces page views on publishers other than
Google News by 10%. This decrease is concentrated around small publishers. We further find
that users are able to replace some but not all of the types of news they previously read. Post-
shutdown, they read less breaking news, hard news, and news that is not well covered on their
favorite news publishers. These news categories explain most of the overall reduction in news
consumption, and shed light on the mechanisms through which aggregators interact with
traditional publishers.

1       Introduction
A recent policy debate concerns the impact of the internet on the news media. Many
authors have noted a series of stylized facts about the industry that suggest the impact of
the internet has been quite negative: for example, the Newspaper Association of America
reports that from 2000 to 2009 newspaper advertising revenue declined by 57% in real terms,
and circulation fell by 18%. Digital has become quite important for news publishers: Pew
Research reports that by 2015, a quarter of newspaper advertising revenue comes from digital,
but digital revenue has not replaced lost revenue from traditional advertising. In addition to
many widely publicized bankruptcies, investment in journalism has been reported to decline;
for example, newsroom employment declined 40% between 1994 and 2014.1 The issues cut
across large and small publishers: a 2015 survey of U.S. digital publishers focusing on local
news found that fewer than half were profitable.2 At the same time, there has been popular
discussion about how publishers and individual journalists have responded to the incentives
created by the digital environment, for example, by optimizing the writing and headlines for
search engines, aggregators, and social media.3
One particularly contentious point in this debate is the role of news aggregators. Pure
aggregators such as Google News do not produce any original content but rather curate
content created by other outlets through a combination of human editorial judgement and
computer algorithms. The results are presented with a few sentences and perhaps photos
from the original article. To read the full article users can click through and go to the web
site of the original content creator. Thus, news aggregators act in dual roles: their front
pages look very similar to news outlets who produce original content, and thus may be a
substitute for them. Yet, they also aggregate a wide range of sources, and may be an effective
mechanism for search and discovery, which places them in the role of upstream complements
to the outlets who produce news. The magnitudes of these two effects, as well as the answer
to more detailed questions about how aggregators affect different types of outlets and the
readerships of different types of news, determine whether aggregators increase or decrease
the returns to investment in news reporting.
This debate has received particular attention in the European Union where two countries,
Germany and Spain, have enacted copyright reforms that allow newspapers to charge aggre-
gators for linking to news snippets. The German law came into effect on August 1, 2013 and
allowed newspapers to provide a free license to aggregators. Members of the main German
newspaper trade association VG Media provided Google News with a free license -- hence,
the introduction of the law had no impact on Google News in Germany. However, no other
aggregator received such a free license and since August 2014 smaller German aggregators
such as GMX, Web.de and T-Online have scaled down or discontinued their services. The
Spanish law came into effect in January 2015 and did not provide for a free license -- Google
News therefore decided to shut down its news aggregator on December 16, 2014 and other

     Numerous how-to guides and advice for reporters on how to modify articles and headlines appeared over
time. See Smith (April 4, 2008; accessed November 17, 2016) for an older example, while a more recent
discussion can be found at Jafri (January 27, 2014; accessed November 17, 2016).

aggregators such as Yahoo and Bing News have followed suit.
In this paper we use the shutdown of Google News in Spain as a natural experiment to
evaluate how news aggregators affect news consumption. Our dataset is a sample of all
browsing events for more than 100,000 users in Spain who use Microsoft products for browsing
the internet and have opted into allowing their data to be used for research purposes.4 We use
this dataset to construct quasi-experimental treatment and control groups. Our treatment
users are all Google News users. We match these users with a synthetic control group of
non-Google News users who have the same news consumption patterns as the corresponding
Google News users after the shutdown of Google News. Our matching procedure therefore
selects control users who make the same consumption decisions in the absence of Google
News (when both groups have access to the same news discovery technology) and therefore
have the same underlying preferences.
We then first compare the overall news consumption of treatment and control users pre-
shutdown across all news categories. This allows us to evaluate the impact on total traffic
to newspapers when Google News is shut down -- this quantity is of fundamental inter-
est to publishers and policy makers who want to know whether aggregators steal traffic
from news creators (substitutes view) or increase traffic (complements view). We find that
treatment users with similar news consumption patterns ex-post had 20% higher overall
news consumption before the removal of Google News (including consumption of the Google
News homepage) and visited news publisher 10% more often. This change is concentrated
around small publishers, while large publishers do not see significant changes in their overall
traffic (but see an increase in their own home page views, offset by a decrease in views of
articles).
These results highlight the potential impact of intermediaries on industry structure: they
make it easier for consumers to search and consume products from small firms, increasing
competition across publishers for consumer attention. We have seen similar effects with
other technology-enabled intermediaries, such as eBay, Uber, Airbnb, and travel and price
comparison sites, where the technology platform reduces search costs and enables smaller
firms that may lack name recognition or reputation to be discovered by consumers. Whether
this is good or bad for consumer welfare depends on details of how investment is spread
across these firms, as well as how investment impacts market share. In the case of news,
the welfare effects depend on whether the investments that increase visibility on aggregators
are welfare-enhancing (unique investigative journalism) or wasteful (misleading headlines),
as well as whether smaller firms add to the diversity of alternative perspectives rather than
reproducing news where the investments have been made by others.
We further find that when Google News shuts down, its users are able to replace some but
not all of the types of news they previously read. Post-shutdown, they read less breaking
news, hard news, and news that is not well covered by their favorite news publishers. These
news categories explain most of the overall reduction in news consumption. The result about

    The data is subject to stringent privacy restrictions and at all times resides only on secure servers, and
only aggregate statistics and the output of statistical models can be reported. However, we are able to
construct the variables for analysis using the fully disaggregated data.



                                                      3
breaking news highlights an advantage for aggregators: they can always be "first to market"
with the latest news, since they can link to articles as soon as they appear on publisher home
pages. They can also offer more breadth than any individual publisher, allowing readers to
access topics not covered by their favorite outlets, as well as allowing readers to read more
in-depth coverage on particular topics. Finally, the Google News homepage focuses more on
hard news than the typical publisher home page.
Despite the intrinsic policy importance of the news industry and the close attention this issue
has received from regulators, there is very little existing empirical evidence on the impact
of aggregators. The paper closest to ours is Calzada and Gil (2016), which independently
studies the same event using a different data source. Their paper finds an almost identical
magnitude (an 11% reduction in visits to news outlets due to the Google News shutdown).
Their paper uses aggregate data about site visits, while our paper relies on individual-level
browsing data. As such, we are able to explore how individual consumers substitute the
missing Google News consumption, and how the content of their consumption changes. The
difference in data sources also affects the identification strategy: we are able to use Spanish
users who were not previously Google News users as a control group, while Calzada and Gil
(2016) relies on France and Germany to control for time trends in news viewing. A limitation
of our study is that it only includes users of Microsoft products, who account for less than
half of PC news browsing; thus, Calzada and Gil (2016) provides confirmation that their
behavior is broadly representative.
Another closely related paper is Chiou and Tucker (2015). They study a "natural exper-
iment" where Google News had a dispute with the Associated Press, and as a result, did
not show Associated Press content for about seven weeks. The paper has aggregate data
on page views to Google News as well as the sites visited immediately after Google news.
They use views to Yahoo! News as a control. The paper finds that Google News is a com-
plement to news outlets: taking the Associated Press content away from Google News leads
to fewer visits to news outlets (where Associated Press articles are featured). Our paper is
complementary to theirs: our main finding (complementarity) is consistent with theirs --
however, our individual level data allows us to (a) dis-aggregate the effects by outlet size
and (b) analyze the types of news consumption that see the biggest drops, which allows us
a more nuanced analysis. Though less directly related to our work, a literature on the net-
work structure of information flows on the web finds that "hubs" may improve information
flows.5
The balance of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we introduce a simple empirical
model of news consumption and describe a matching algorithm that allows us to construct
synthetic control and treatment groups. We then use this framework in Section 3 to docu-
ment the drop in overall news consumption after the shutdown of Google News in Spain on
   5
    The prevailing vein of this work was pioneered by Kleinberg (1999), who developed the hub-authority
information flow model and the Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search (HITS) algorithm (see also Kleinberg and
Lawrence, 2001). Weber and Monge (2011) introduce a third category of nodes, sources, to Kleinberg's
model and use their expanded model to study news information flow. Using random graph models to study
hyperlink structure, they find that hubs very rarely exist in pure form. Rather, there is often a degree of
reciprocity such that hubs function to some degree as distribution nodes for information through the network.

December 16, 2014. We decompose this overall volume drop in Section 4 and show that it is
predominantly driven by a reduction in the consumption of scarce and breaking news.


2     Empirical Model and Data Description
2.1    Theory
In this section we present a stylized model of news consumption that helps motivate our
empirical strategy for estimating the effects of aggregators.
Preferences for News
A consumer i has one unit of time that she can allocate between reading news stories and
other activities. Every news story has a vector c of characteristics, referred to as its "type,"
with components indexed by d = 1, . . . , D. For example, a particular characteristic might
indicate whether a news story is breaking news or not, or whether the story is about a
popular topic. The characteristics space is a finite product set C = d=1,...,D Cd . We denote
                                                     t
user i's consumption of type c news at time t by Ni,c  , and the vector of overall consumption
is denoted Nit .
The total consumption of other leisure activities is denoted with Lt     i . The user's utility
from consuming the bundle (Nit , Lt
                                  i ) at time t is described by a nested  Cobb-Douglas utility
function:                                             t i
                                                      
                                             t i,c             t i
                               Uit =        Ni,c         L1-                                (1)
                                       cC

The key implications of this functional form are described as follows. First, a user's share
of time spent reading news can be decomposed into a date effect and a person effect:  t
captures weekday and seasonal effects in preferences for reading news, while i captures
the importance that individual i attaches to news reading. Second, a utility maximizing
individual will consume a constant share of news of a particular type, so long as the costs of
finding different types of news do not change. We will formally check the assumption that
preferences are stable over time below.
Discovery of News
Consumers do not directly know what articles are available to be read on a given day. In
order to discover articles, they must visit the home pages of news outlets, view social media,
use search, or use aggregators.
Home pages or "landing pages" of news outlets merit special discussion. These pages have
a list of article headlines and snippets from the stories, as well as links to the stories. Home
pages play a dual role for consumers: they are a mechanism to learn about articles that are
available, and users also consume news directly by reading the headline and the beginning
of a news story. For simplicity, we will assume that the utility derived from a single landing
page is equivalent to reading a fraction of each member of a set of articles (where in principle
the fraction could be greater than one).


                                               5
First consider a case without aggregators. For each news type c, the user can utilize direct
navigation to outlet home pages, search, and social, and translate 1 unit of time into con-
                                          D    Se         So
sumption of a set of articles, denoted c    , c   , and c    , respectively. As discussed above,
                                                                                           H
when the user visits outlet home pages, the visit results in consumption of news c           (in
                                      H
units equivalent to articles). Thus, c describes the quantity of news of each type consumed
                                    D
directly on the home pages, and c     describes the quantity of articles consumed by clicking
                                           D       Se   So       H
on links on the home pages. Let c = c         + c     + c    + c   denote the sum of these. So
far, we have not placed any restrictions on the discovery process; we have simply introduced
notation describing its output in terms of the objects that create utility for the consumer.
For example, if the consumer selects investments of time in visiting home pages, search en-
gines, and social media to maximize expected utility, our notation can be interpreted as
summarizing the number of articles consumed when the consumer follows an optimal time
investment policy.
Our next step is to introduce a key simplifying assumption, one that leads to a tractable
empirical model as well: we assume that the discovery process has constant returns to scale,
so that allocating more or less time results in a proportional increase or decrease in the
news discovered of each type from each source. In a more detailed microeconomic model of
search, the constant returns assumption would imply restrictions on the process by which
users engage in search and discovery, the availability of content and home pages, as well as
the technology available to search.
Now consider the case where aggregators are available. We will assume there is a single
aggregator, Google News, and that the availability of Google News changes the amount of
news a consumer can consume per unit of time, both by changing the number of articles of
each type that can be discovered, and by introducing a new home page that includes partial
news stories from a large variety of publishers. We denote the consumption of news through
direct navigation, search, social, and outlet home pages when Google News is also available
      D   Se   So   H
as (~
    c   ,~c  ,~c  ,~c ) with sum  ~c . We denote the news articles accessed through Google
            GN
News by    ~c , and the consumption of news through reading the Google News home page
    HGN
as ~c    . We assume that the aggregator-augmented technology is at least as productive as
                                                          GN     HGN
the general-purpose technology at finding articles: ~c + ~c  +  ~c    > c for all c.
The following definition formally captures the notion of aggregators complementing or sub-
stituting for traditional news-reading.
Definition 1 Aggregators are substitutes (complements) to traditional news-reading technol-
                                GN
ogy for news of type c if ~c + ~c  < ()c .
Note that even though aggregator-augmented technology always weakly increases total news
consumption it might decrease the number of news stories that are directly consumed on
the publishers' websites if aggregators are substitutes and consumers can effectively consume
news directly on aggregators' home pages (~   HGN ).
We can refine the definition further by saying that Google News is a substitute (complement)
                         D   Se    So    GN         D    Se   So
for reading articles if ~c +~c  + ~c  + ~c   < ()c    + c   + c  . Analogously, Google News
is a substitute for publisher home pages if the consumption of those publisher home pages
is lower in a regime with Google News. Note, we have not directly defined notation for the

number of page views of publisher home pages, because  H expresses consumption of home
pages in units of articles.
We can now derive consumer demand for news stories of type c with both technologies. Utility
maximization implies that when aggregators are not available, a user will consume
                                       t
                                      Ni,c =  t  i i,c c                                 (2)

while a user of the aggregator-augmented technology will consume:
                             t
                            Ni,c =  t  i i,c ~c +  GN
                                                  ~c  + HGN
                                                       ~c                                (3)

Since we will measure news consumption by the number of pages visited and the dwell time
spent on publisher's websites we denote the news consumed directly on publishers' websites
when using aggregator-augmented technology with N  ~i,c
                                                    t
                                                        :

                                  ~i,c
                                  N t
                                       =  t  i i,c ~c +  GN
                                                        ~c                               (4)

For a particular type of news on a given day, the ratio of news consumed on publisher
websites using the two technologies is directly proportional to the relative productivity of
the two different discovery processes:
                                      ~t
                                      N      ~c +  GN
                                                  ~c
                                       i,c
                                        t
                                           =                                             (5)

2.2    Empirical Implementation and User Matching
We next take this model to our data. We distinguish between three main periods shown
in Figure 1 -- the pre-shutdown period I (before December 16, 2014), a 3-week adjustment
period (until January 7, 2015), and a matching period (after January 7, 2015). We define a
set of "treatment users" as those who used Google News before the shutdown. For each such
treatment user i we find a control user ^
                                        i who does not use Google News in the pre-shutdown
period but consumes news in the same way as the treatment user during the matching period.
                                                                                          ^
We will then assume that treatment and control users have the same preferences (e.g.  i =  i


                                              7
and i,c = ^ i,c for all news types c) because they make the same consumption decisions when
having access to the same technology.
We will now describe the details of the matching algorithm.
Active users. Section A-1 of the supplementary appendix describes in detail how we construct
our user-level data set from the browser logs. Our dataset consists of a sample of desktop
users and we focus on users who are active in at least 90% of the weeks between October
1, 2014 and March 17, 2015 and who read news for at least a 10-week long sub-period. The
universe of active users in Spain comprises about 158,000 people.
Browsing events are linked through referrer URLs: if a page load has a referrer it indicates
that the user clicked on a link on the referring page to visit the present page. The browsing
stream can be partitioned into a set of trees where the root of each tree either has an empty
referrer or refers to a non-publisher page (such as a Google search page, a social media page
or a news aggregator). We refer to these trees as "news mini sessions". The root of each news
mini session defines the referral mode: we distinguish direct navigation (an empty referrer),
search (Google, Bing or Yahoo search referral), social (Facebook or Twitter referral) and
other referrals.
We identify a "treatment user" as any user who used Google News at least once during the
pre-shutdown period. All other users are potential control users.
Topics. Section A-2 of the supplementary appendix describes in detail how we construct
topics. We classify all URLs into landing pages and article pages based on the frequency
distributions of page loads across the observation period (articles tend to have most page
loads concentrated within a few days after publication while landing pages are visited at a
fairly constant rate throughout).
We then scrape all 110 million article pages and focus on the 61% of articles that contain
more than 100 words (the remainder are often slide shows or video pages). We compare the
content of each such article to all the Wikipedia articles published on the Spanish-language
Wikipedia. We exploit the fact that most major news events receive a Wikipedia entry
within days or weeks. Wikipedia provides us with a convenient and stable set of topics. We
construct a set of nested topics consisting of a "super-topic" (such as Health ) and a sub-topic
(such as Spain Ebola crisis which hit Spain in 2014/2015). We manage to classify 53% of all
articles into about 300 topics. The top 50 topics cover 75% of all page loads.
We hired 7 student evaluators to rate the quality of our super-topic and sub-topic assignment
for 500 articles and found that 95% of super-topic and 85% of sub-topic assignments were
deemed to be correct.
Matching algorithm. For each treatment user we rank all potential control users according
to a proximity score that is based on the components listed in Table 1: (1) total overall page
views, news page views (landing pages and articles) and news article page views, (2) news
page views accessed through search and (3) breaking news page views and page views on
hard news (excluding celebrity news and sports among top 50 topics).
Formally, we calculate the empirical distribution of each variable among all active users.

Notes: Pairs of lines compare statistics of the distribution of various dimensions for the two groups. In the
third to last columns, the measure is number of pageviews. "Total": total number of pages for all browsing
(not only news). "News": total news consumption. "Article": number of article pageviews (as opposed to
landing pages). "Search": number of pages read via search. "Breaking": number of breaking news
pageviews (read within 5 hours after publication). "Hard News": all news except for sports and celebrity
news (from top 50 topics).




                                                     9
Then for each user we calculate its percentile rank in the distribution. For each treatment
user we calculate the difference from each potential control user in these percentile scores
and weigh these scores equally to calculate a single proximity score. This procedure ranks
potential control users for each treatment user. We then use the random serial dictatorship
algorithm to assign a unique control user to each treatment user. The results of the matching
are displayed in Table 1.6 Overall, the treatment and control group differ by less than 5%
in mean along all matched dimensions (where means are compared using data only from the
matching period).
Empirical model. Our matched samples of treatment and control users allows us to estimate
the effect of the Google News shutdown by comparing the news consumption of treatment and
control users during the pre-shutdown period. Since we have constructed the control group
such that (by revealed preference, under the assumptions of our stylized model) both groups
of users have identical preferences, we can interpret the consumption behavior of matched
control user as the predicted (counterfactual) behavior for the corresponding treatment user
if Google News was not available.
Our approach of matching on behavior after the "treatment" (taking away Google News)
has been applied is somewhat non-standard at first glance. A superficially more natural
approach might be to match users based on their behavior in the pre-shutdown period.
However, on closer examination, it would be hard to justify an empirical strategy based
on such an approach. Since in the pre-shutdown period, Google News users access news
using a different search and discovery technology, there is no reason to believe that a Google
News user and a non-Google News user who have the same preferences would read the same
news -- in general we would not expect that. On the other hand, two users with the same
preferences should read the same amounts of different types of news in the post-shutdown
period.
Our analysis would be more straightforward if Google News had been introduced as an
option rather than taken away. Our approach needs to rely on a few additional assumptions,
namely that Google News does not have persistent effects on reader behavior even after it
disappears. As described above, to partially deal with the possibility of persistence, we leave
out an "adjustment period" after Google News shuts down. However, we do not see evidence
in the data that the treatment and control users have differences in behavior that change
over time, reducing the potential for concern.
As a robustness check, we also consider an empirical approach based on matching on pre-
shutdown news consumption and measuring differences in the post-shutdown period. This
approach yields qualitatively similar results, as we discuss further below.


3       Google News and Overall News Consumption
We now analyze the impact of Google News on overall news consumption across all news
categories. The magnitude of this combined effect is fundamental for publishers and policy
    6
    After applying the matching procedure we focus on treatment-control pairs with at least 100 news page
views in the matching period. However, all our qualitative results hold up even when using the full sample.

makers who have to decide whether aggregators steal traffic from news creators (substitutes
view) or increase traffic (complements view). In order to gain some intuition, we start with
a graphical analysis in Figure 2 which shows the average daily news reading (in terms of
number of page views) over time for both control and treatment users.
As a result of our matching procedure the two groups have very similar news consumption
levels after the shutdown (marked by the vertical line). In fact, the consumption levels
of both groups are nearly indistinguishable even during the adjustment period. Moreover,
control users have an overall stable consumption level before and after the shutdown (other
than the holiday period and a spike corresponding to the indictment of Spain's Princess
Cristina on corruption charges), which is to be expected since the Google News shutdown
did not affect them. The stability also implies that the details of how we model time trends
will not have a big impact on our results.
In contrast, Google News users have much higher news consumption compared to control
users before the shutdown. Consequently, there is a sharp and pronounced drop in the
volume of news reading once Google News becomes unavailable. We call this phenomenon
the "volume effect."
In order to gain some insight into how Google News affects news discovery we show the
referral modes for total news reading for both groups in Figure 3. The referral modes are
classified as direct navigation, search, Google News and other (which includes social media,
emails, forums, etc).
For control users, referral shares are constant over time, as expected. During the post-


                                                  11
shutdown period, treatment users have very similar referral shares as control users. This
is again expected since we are matching both on total news consumption and consumption
via search. Before the shutdown, reading through Google News makes up 24% of users'
consumption. Direct navigation and search take up this share after the shutdown, while the
referral share through other modes stays roughly constant.

of Google News.

3.1    Estimating the Volume Effect
We now estimate the effect of removing Google News by comparing the consumption of
treatment and control users pre-shutdown. Using our model, we can express the total news
                                                                     ~I:
consumption of all treatment users during the pre-shutdown period by N
                                 ~I = I             ^
                                 N                  i ^
                                                      i,c ~c +  GN
                                                               ~c                          (6)
                                            ^
                                            i,cC

The corresponding consumption of all control user is N I :

                                          NI = I           i i,c c                         (7)
                                                   i,cC

Therefore, the ratio of total news consumption of treatment and control users equals:
                                                    ^
                                 ~I

                                                      i,c ~c +  GN
                                                               ~c
                                    =                                                      (8)
                                 NI                ^
                                                   i,cC   ^
                                                          i 
                                                            ^
                                                            i,c c

Note that we are exploiting our matched sample here, which allows us to replace  i with
 ^
 i and i,c with ^  i,c . This ratio measures the overall impact of Google News on treatment
users, while factoring out seasonal and day effects.

Taking the logarithm of both sides of (8) suggests an empirical approach to estimating the
percentage change in news consumption when Google News is removed. Table 2 shows the
results of this calculation, where we average the logarithm of the left-hand side of (8) using
data from the pre-period, where we use the number of page views as our measure of news
consumption. The top row shows the volume effect across all referral modes for total news
as well as the sub-categories of only articles, landing pages and other content (slide shows
and videos).7 Column (5) explicitly excludes Google News landing pages and therefore only
captures publishers' landing pages. Rows 2 to 4 capture the change just for direct navigation,
search and other modes of accessing news. We calculate standard errors using the bootstrap,
sampling treated-control pairs as a unit.
Treatment users have 19.7% higher consumption in the pre-shutdown period compared to
control users, including their consumption of the Google News home page. As a result of
our matching procedure and the exogenous nature of the shutdown we interpret this as the
causal effect of the presence of Google News on news consumption volume. This volume
change comes from two sources: (1) Google News users consume 28.8% more articles but
8.5% fewer landing pages (omitting the Google News landing page). Hence, Google News is
a complement to overall news reading and articles but a substitute for landing pages. The
landing page result is intuitive since Google News directly links to publishers' articles and
bypasses the landing pages. However, this decline is more than compensated for by increased
traffic to articles. (It should be noted, however, that a large share of advertising revenue
comes from the publishers' landing pages.)
Google News has only a small effect on news accessed through search. It complements news
accessed through "other" referral modes (such as social media). However, as we saw before,
these make up only a small share of total news referrals.
A question that might arise is whether Google News referrals might be of lower quality than
others; perhaps when using Google News, readers will click on many articles, glance at them,
and then quickly return to the Google News home page. To assess this hypothesis, Table 3
shows the same calculations using dwelltime (time spent on the page) as a measure of news
consumption.8 The numbers corroborate our previous conclusions using page views.

3.2       Volume Effect by Outlet Size
We now break out the volume effect by outlet size. This is an important exercise because the
Spanish copyright reform was primarily advocated by bigger newspapers, and also because
theory suggests that the effect might be different, with the search and discovery function
playing a more important role for smaller outlets. For smaller outlets, the users may not
expect the benefit of accessing the landing pages to outweigh the time to access it, and
further, the users may not be aware of some smaller publishers. Using the whole sample
period and all active users, we order news outlets based on their size measured in terms of
total page views. Then we compare the top 20 publishers to the smaller ones. Results are
shown in Table 4.

      Slideshows and videos are not classified as articles if the word count is less than 100 words.

      Section A-1.2 of the Data Appendix explains how the dwelltime variable is logged in our data.

,    mean significance at the 10%, 5% and 1% levels respectively.


A striking pattern can be observed when we compare the total news consumption of treat-
ment and control users: while the effect of Google News on the top 20 publishers is not
statistically significantly different from zero (with estimates small in magnitude), smaller
outlets gain as much as 26.3% from the presence of Google News. When we dissect this
effect by page view type we see that the availability of Google News changes the page view
mix towards articles and away from landing pages for larger outlets, but that the two ef-
fects cancel in the aggregate. For smaller outlets, the landing page traffic is unaffected by
Google News but article page views increase by 44.6%. Consistent with the promotion of
smaller outlets, Google News also makes it easier for users to facilitate multiple news sources:
Table 5 compares the user-level Herfindahl indices for outlets for the top 20 topics by re-
ferral mode. For each topic, the Google News concentration index is lower than for direct
navigation.
Therefore, the evidence supports the hypothesis that Google News is neither complement
nor substitute for bigger publishers, but is a substitute for the high-revenue landing pages
of these outlets. We also see that Google News is a substitute for articles accessed through
direct navigation -- highlighting that large outlets lose some of their curation role. If part
of the long-term incentive for news outlets to maintain their brand comes from the way they
curate news, through the selection of articles they highlight prominently on their landing
pages, then the fact that Google News is in effect selecting what articles from each outlet
to highlight on the Google News home page may decrease the incentive of publishers to
invest in the quality of their curation and thus their brand. This is an example of a broader

concern publishers articulate surrounding aggregators and social media: they worry that
they are being "disintermediated" and "commoditized,"9 consistent with a decreased ability
to differentiate their products in the eyes of consumers, as their content is accessed instead
through an intermediary.
On the other hand, our evidence supports the hypothesis that Google News is a strong
complement to small outlets. This implies that bigger outlets gained compared to smaller
ones due to the shutdown of Google News and users visited a less diverse set of outlets.
The social welfare implications of this finding are unclear; there are potentially competing
effects. If small outlets produce unique content with alternative viewpoints or reporting,
then Google News supports "media diversity" and helps smaller publishers get viewership
and thus returns on their investments in journalism. On the other hand, if smaller outlets
mostly copy news from larger outlets, without investing in reporting, then Google News might
decrease the returns to investment for the primary sources of investigative journalism. This
paper does not provide evidence that speaks directly to these welfare tradeoffs. In principle,
the investments in journalism can be measured using data from newspaper employment and
expenditures, and diversity of viewpoints as well as the extent of original reporting can be
assessed from textual analysis. This represents an interesting avenue for future work.
Table 6 repeats the same exercise using dwelltime as the consumption measure. Overall, the
evidence supports the findings from our analysis of page views. The main difference is that
total dwelltime increases slightly even for bigger outlets in the presence of Google News: this
reflects the fact that users tend to spend more time on article pages compared to landing
pages. Dwell time on landing pages declines for large outlets, in line with the results for page
views. In the current advertising environment, advertising is typically sold on the basis of
page views, not dwell time, so the newspapers may not see revenue increases that correspond
to the dwell time increase.


4       Decomposing the Volume Effect
In Section 3 we analyze the overall drop in news consumption when Google News becomes
unavailable. In order to better understand why consumption decreases we examine how
reading changes as a function of news characteristics. Based on anecdotal evidence, we focus
on five characteristics: recency of news/breaking news, the extent to which different news
stories are widely covered by newspapers (global supply scarcity), the extent to which news
stories are well covered by readers' favorite news outlets (relative supply scarcity), popularity
of news stories, and whether a story is about "hard" or "soft" news. As motivated in the
introduction, understanding what kinds of news are particularly affected by Google News
helps explain how Google News competes with or complements existing outlets, and also
sheds light on how aggregators affect the incentives of news publishers to produce different
types of news.
Formally, we define each news category by whether the category does or does not have each of

the D "characteristics" (in our empirical work, the D = 5 characteristics just described), so
that c is a vector in {0, 1}D . For each of the d = 1, . . . , D conditions, there is a corresponding
component of c, denoted cd  {0, 1}, that indicates whether news type c satisfies condition
d. For example, d might represent the condition "the news is breaking news" or "the news
is hard news," and cd = 1 if category c satisfies the condition.

4.1     News Characteristics
We now define the characteristics we use in our empirical analysis.

4.1.1    Breaking News
Google News is an algorithmic service that is capable of collecting the most recent stories
from multiple news sources. In fact, as of 2016 there is a "See realtime coverage" button on
Google News that provides users with the latest relevant news for a particular event. One
might therefore suspect that aggregator-augmented browsing lowers the cost for consuming
breaking news compared to traditional news browsing. Most traditional readers rely only on
a handful of newspapers that (1) may happen to miss the latest events and (2) do not provide
links to other news sources covering the same events. As a result, we hypothesize that the
shutdown of Google News leads to a disproportionate drop in the consumption of breaking
news stories. We proxy breaking news by determining the hour of publication of each news
article and measuring the time elapsing between the publication and the consumption of the

                                                   18
news story.

4.1.2      Supply Scarcity
Some news topics are covered by a large number newspapers while others receive less atten-
tion. This mismatch can be caused by newspapers miscalculating readers' interest or by a
lack of reporters who can write such stories. For example, a terrorist attack in a neighboring
country might be of great interest to local readers but newspapers might lack correspondents
in that country. We distinguish between two types of scarcity: relative supply scarcity cap-
tures the idea that users read a limited number of publications and these publications might
poorly cover certain news topics compared to other newspapers. In contrast, global supply
scarcity captures poor coverage of a certain topic across all newspapers.
Google News can potentially mitigate both types of scarcity. First of all, personalization
allows aggregators to adapt to user preferences. For example, if a user's favorite newspapers
poorly cover financial news then Google News can adapt accordingly and prioritize financial
news. Moreover, Google News provides typically multiple references for each news topic
which makes it easier for users to find related coverage for globally scarce news topics.
We next formally define both types of scarcity.
Relative Supply Scarcity. Let us index users by i, topics by d, newspapers by n and
days by t. The daily share of articles in newspaper n on topic d on day t is denoted with
sndt .10 The total page views consumed by user i for newspaper n during the matching period
is denoted with yin -- it measures the intensity with which user i reads newspaper n. We
define yi = n yin as the total number of page views of user i across all newspapers during
the matching period and yn = i yin as the total page views for newspaper n across all users
during the matching period.11
We then define aggregate supply for topic d on day t:

                                                        n   yn sndt
                                              xdt =                                       (9)
                                                            n yn

Intuitively, aggregate supply measures the average coverage for news topic d across all news-
papers weighted by their popularity.
We then define the user-level supply of news faced by user i for topic d on day t:

                                                        n   yin sndt
                                             xidt =                                      (10)
                                                            n yin

Intuitively, take a random page view for the user -- with probability yin /yi the user selects
newspaper n and then reads a random article which is going to be on topic d with probability
sndt . This is the reader's individual-level supply of articles on topic d on day t.
 10
      Note, that d sndt = 1.
 11
      Note: we focus on direct page-views, all pages (both landing and article pages).




                                                      19
This allows us to define relative supply ridt as follows:

                                                        ridt = xidt - xdt                                                  (11)

Relative supply has two important aggregation properties. First of all, for any specific user,
relative supply across topics sum up to 0:

                                                                    ridt = 0                                               (12)
                                                           d

Second, for any specific topic, relative supply across users sum up to 0:12
                                                                                             yi
                                                wi ridt = 0 where wi =                                                     (14)
                                                                                              i yi
                                            i

Therefore, topics are neither scarce nor abundant on average but they are only so within
users.
For example, a user who mainly reads a newspaper that specializes on business news will
be supplied with a lower share of sports-related news articles compared to the average user
(xi,sports,t < xsports,t ) and hence her relative supply ri,sports,t of sports news is negative. On the
other hand, she is relatively abundantly supplied with business news such that ri,business,t >
0.
Global Supply Scarcity. We identify globally scarce topics by comparing aggregate de-
mand to aggregate supply xdt . Formally, we define aggregate demand qdt as the page view
share across all topics:

                                               d ydt
Relatively globally scarce topics are defined as those topics d for which

                                                         qdt - xdt > 0

Intuitively, these topics have excessively high readership compared to the number of articles
(information) that are available through traditional news browsing (direct navigation).

4.1.3       Popularity and Hard News
Google News might also promote popular news topics. We say that a topic is popular if it
among the top 5 topics measured by page views during the pre-shutdown period.

       First of all, we know that    i   wi = 1. Therefore, we have                i   wi xdt = xdt . Moreover, we have:

                                                          yi          n   yin sndt                   n   yin sndt
                                  wi xidt       =                                  =
                              i                     i      i   yi         n yin          i                i yi

                                                           i yin sndt              yn sndt
                                                =                     =                    = xdt                           (13)

                                                                    20
Google News might be particularly effective at lowering the cost of finding hard news and
niche topics which are insufficiently covered by most news outlets. Therefore, we might
expect a larger volume effect for hard news topic when Google News is no longer available.
Formally, we say that a topic covers hard news if it is neither a celebrity or sports topic.

4.2    Differences Between Treatment and Control Users
Our matching algorithm does not explicitly match treatment and control users' consumption
along all characteristics; the only two incorporated in the matching are breaking news and
hard news. Thus, testing whether news consumption differs in other characteristics helps
evaluate whether there are important residual sources of heterogeneity between the two
groups. However, Table 7 demonstrates that treatment and control users look very similar
along the five basic characteristics in the matching period; in the Appendix, we test equality
for all 25 = 32 categories defined by the vector of characteristics c. To account for multiple
testing, we report whether the differences are significant using the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH)
procedure (where we apply the procedure to the set of 5 characteristics, and then separately
to the set of 32 categories, in each case reporting whether we can reject equality of the two
groups at the 10% level).
Results for the 5 characteristics are reported in Table 7 while results for the 32 categories
are in Appendix Table 10. Among the largest differences we find, we see that globally
scarce news consumption is 6.6% higher for control users, and the difference is statistically
significant (when the hypothesis test is considered in isolation) at the 5% level. We also see
differences in two of the 32 categories, namely categories 0 : 1 : 0 : 0 : 1 and 0 : 0 : 0 : 0 : 1
(globally scarce and breaking, and only breaking, respectively), where we reject equality of
the news browsing volumes even after applying the (BH) correction. Although breaking news
was included as a feature for matching, other characteristics were also considered and so we
did not attain perfect matching in practice. The category that only has the globally scarce
characteristic also shows fairly large discrepancies between treated and control, although the
test for equality is not significant after applying the BH correction. The other categories are
similar in magnitude and differences are not significant.

4.3    Referrals from Google News versus other Referral Modes, by
       Characteristic
Next, we show how news consumption obtained through Google News differs from other
referrals modes along our five characteristics.
First, Figure 4 shows the number of page views and the shares of news consumed through
the four main referral modes for treatment and control users. As expected, control users'
news consumption patterns are similar before and after the shutdown. For control users (as
well as post-shutdown, for treatment users), most news articles are browsed within 3 hours
of publication. Treatment users, however, access news faster after their publication when
Google News is available (pre-shutdown): the peak in news consumption occurs at 0 and 1
hours after publication. The Figure also illustrates that Google News is the main referral
source for very recently breaking news in the pre-shutdown period. After the shutdown,

                Popularity             15.387        16.255       0.129       not   rejected
               Hard news               24.275        24.897       0.482       not   rejected
              Breaking news            12.294        13.119       0.062       not   rejected


Notes: For the five news types numbers show the mean number of pageviews in the treatment and control
groups in the matching period. The p-value pertains to an individual t-test for the difference between
means being zero. To deal with issues of multiple testing, the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was used to
control for the false discovery rate at the 10% level and the final column shows the conclusion for the null
hypothesis of the equality of the means based on this.


 Figure 4: Referral shares and news reading volume as a function of time after publication




Notes: The four panels show news reading behavior of control and treatment users before and after the
shutdown. The horizontal axis shows time after publication of a news article (in hours). The upper panels
show the share of different referral modes while lower panels show news reading volumes in terms of
number of pageviews.

Notes: We display the cumulative pageview share of top topics (top "n " on the horizontal axis) for referral
modes direct (solid line) and Google News (dashed line) for treatment users, pre-shutdown period.


the peak is very close to that of control users, and it is occurring later than before the
shutdown, illustrating the Google News users do not find an alternative source for late-
breaking news.
Next, Table 8 presents evidence that Google News is an important source of user-scarce
news: its share is much higher for scarce than for non-scarce topics (44% versus 32%). We
also verified that this result holds for both light and heavy Google News users, using various
cutoffs to define light and heavy.
Treatment users also read more popular topics through Google News compared to direct
navigation. Figure 5 shows the cumulative reading shares for top topics by referral mode
(see Tables 11a and 11b in the Appendix for a detailed breakdown).




                                                    23
4.4    Volume Effect By News Characteristics
We now compare treatment and control users in the pre-shutdown period. Recall that we
matched each Google News user with a corresponding control user with the same news
consumption preferences (through matching in the matching period when both groups have
access to the same news browsing technology). Using the control users as counterfactual,
we can simply compare the consumption of treatment and control users in the pre-shutdown
period to simulate the effect of a removal of Google News.
In Figure 6 we depict the change in news consumption between treatment and control users by
hour of publication (capturing the breaking news effect) and by scarce and non-scarce topics
(red versus blue). The lightly shaded bars (light red and light blue) indicate the decrease in
news consumption that would occur if treatment users simply stopped using Google News
and did not substitute to other publishers. This is calculated by simply removing all news
viewing that is referred by Google News from the treatment users' aggregate viewing. We
refer to this as the "no-substitution" counterfactual. The darkly shaded decreases (dark red
and dark blue) indicate the actual decreases.
First, we observe that the overall (actual) decrease in news consumption that we observed in
Section 3 is reflected in every single combination of hour of publication and scarcity. However,
the decrease is particularly stark for breaking news and scarce news: scarce breaking news
falls by almost 70% while non-scarce, non-breaking news falls by only less than 20%.
Second, comparing the actual decrease to the no-substitution counterfactual, we find that
there is very little user substitution for user-scarce news in the first 2 hours after publication:
the overall decrease in news consumptions closely tracks the Google News predicted decrease.
This finding highlights an important source of differentiation for Google News, as we see that
the users are not able to find a good substitute for this news after the shutdown. In general,
the figure illustrates that substitution is stronger for non-scarce news. This is consistent with
users switching from Google News to direct navigation, since it is easier to find non-scarce
than scarce news in a direct way.
Similarly, Figure 7 compares the change in news consumption for popular and hard news.
The contrast between popular and unpopular topics for the actual volume drop is not large
in magnitude, while the decreases for hard news are larger than those for celebrity and
sports news. Except for popular, celebrity and sports news, where there appears to be little
substitution, there is moderate substitution for Google News in the other categories (but by
no means full substitution, which would lead to decreases of zero).
All of the differences between counterfactual and actual news decreases in the two figures
are statistically significant at the 5% level (even after applying a BH correction for multiple
testing), except for the differences corresponding to non-scarce news read in 4­10 hours after
publication.

4.5    Decomposition
In this section we decompose the volume drop of news types (recalling that a category is a
vector of binary indicators for news characteristics) into the impact of each of the underlying

Notes: The horizontal axis means hours after publication, the vertical axis shows percentage change in news
consumption. We compare actual and counterfactual and volume drops for scarce and non-scarce topics
where the counterfactual concerns the case of no substitution happening after Google News is shut down.

Notes: The horizontal axis shows news categories celebrity/sports and everyting else and the vertical axis

for popular and unpopular topics where the counterfactual concerns the case of no substitution happening
after Google News is shut down.

characteristics. Our empirical strategy is based on comparing the relative consumption of
treatment and control users within a news category:
                                           ~c
                                           N I
                                                 ~c +  GN
                                                      ~c
                                             I
                                               =                                           (15)
                                           Nc        c

The right-hand side of this equation measures the relative productivity of traditional and
aggregator-augmented news browsing when reading news of type c.
In order to decompose the right-hand side of (15), we assume the following functional
form:
                               GN
                         ~c + ~c
                                  = exp(0 +      d · cd + c )                    (16)
                             c                 d

Hence, d captures the efficiency loss from losing aggregator access for news dimension d.
The constant 0 captures the efficiency loss that is not captured by any of the other charac-
teristics.
We estimate the relative contribution of each news characteristic based on the structural
model given in (16):

                                       I
                                     Nc
                               log           = 0 +        d · cd +   c                     (17)
                                     ~c
                                     N I
                                                      d

Since we have defined D = 5 binary news characteristics, there are 25 = 32 news types. We
can use the volume drops for those 32 news types to estimate these 6 coefficients.
The estimation procedure we use is a minimum distance procedure. For each news type, we
use the sample analogue of equation 17 as a moment condition; details of the method are
described in Cameron and Trivedi (2005, p. 202).
We report the results in Table 9. As observed in the previous Section, breaking news and user
scarcity are the most important factors in explaining the volume drop -- they decrease page
consumption by 22.2% and 30.2%, respectively. Hard news and popularity also contribute
(13.8% and 5.7%), while global scarcity has a small coefficient which is not significantly
different from zero. Interestingly, the constant term is small and not statistically significant
which implies that the five characteristics that we have included in our simple additive
structural model can fully account for the volume drop.


5    Conclusion
A general theme of innovation since the advent of the internet, starting with eBay and
extending to firms like Airbnb and Uber, is that digital intermediaries can reduce search
costs and increase the ability of small, flexible sellers to access consumers. The consumer
benefits enabled by these intermediaries are clearly very large in magnitude: consumers can
access a much larger diversity of products, potentially at lower prices, and small sellers can
be found by consumers, potentially creating large welfare gains when consumers find the

                                                 27
perfect match for them. These benefits have been the subject of a literature on the welfare
benefits of giving consumers access to the "long tail" of products.
Incumbents and regulators have noted a number of challenges when considering regulation
of digital intermediaries. The new entrants often have different business models than incum-
bents, and may appear in some respects to be in the same product market as incumbents
(substitutes), while in other ways they appear to be upstream (complements). For example,
eBay can compete with traditional retailers, but it can also help small retailers acquire addi-
tional customers or sell unsold inventory; Uber competes directly with taxis and limosines,
but can also refer customers to existing limosine businesses who have spare capacity; and
Airbnb competes with hotels but can help small lodging providers find consumers. In many
cases, the new entrants require less fixed cost investment and expenditures in developing the
end consumer product, instead investing research and development to provide sophisticated
search and discovery technology. Of course, the value of search and discovery is capped at
the value of the products to be discovered, and so the ultimate welfare evaluation of in-
termediaries must take into account the long-term quality, assortment, and pricing of final
products for consumers. However, economists have long understood that changes in short-
term competitive conditions have ambiguous effects on long-term investments in research
and development, product quality, and industry structure. Thus, every industry requires its
own evaluation.
In the case of News Aggregators, the news industry has called for regulation, resulting in a
number of policy interventions across a variety of countries, including the regulatory action
in Spain that was the focus of this paper. Most recently, in April 2019, the European
Union passed a significant copyright reform, the Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single
Market. Article 15 of that directive provides an ancillary copyright to publishers but leaves
it to member states to implement the copyright specifics. The empirical evidence we have
presented in this paper speaks to some, but not all, of the issues at stake when member
decide whether to choose an implementation close to the Spanish one.
Our analysis documents a large, positive effect of Google News on small outlets, as well as on
the ability of consumers to access certain types of news, such as breaking news or news that
is not well covered on their favorite outlets. These findings highlight the large potential for
welfare benefits from improved search and discovery, the "upstream" or complementary role
for an intermediary. At the same time, our findings also highlight that while large publishers
may not see an effect in overall page views as a result of aggregators, they may lose traffic to
their home pages, as well as their role in curating news, as readers read articles referred by
Google News at the expense of articles referred by their own home pages (where newspapers
monetize the home pages much better than articles). If readers do not pay attention to the
identity of the publisher when they read articles on Google News, then the large publishers
may lose their incentives to maintain a reputation for quality, and consumers may be less
willing to subscribe to the publisher or use the publisher's mobile application.
Further research is required to assess the ultimate welfare costs and benefits. More broadly,
our analysis covers only a few weeks before and after the change; ideally, we would want
to understand the long-term response of both readers and publishers to changes in policy
surrounding aggregators.

Longer tables referred in the main text
Tables 10, 11.

Publishers covered in the analysis
We provide a high-level overview of the top 20 publishers in our data in Table 12.

Overall reading trends
In Figure 8 we display the average daily number of pageviews in our data for three sets of
users: (a) all users in the data (more than 7 million users) (b) active users (about 158,000
users) (for a definition see 2.2) and finally (c) the control group of our main sample (2317
users). While the level of news reading is different, it is visible that the overall trends are
very similar.

Robustness checks
Definition of treatment users
For a distribution of the number of Google News reading sessions per treatment user, see
Figure 9.
We reproduced the main tables with requiring at least 5 Google News minisessions for a user
to be labelled as a "treatment" user. As expected, results in this case are more extreme:
11.9% overall effect, 39% for articles, -18% for landing pages. For top 20 there is no overall
effect, 28% for articles and -26% for landing pages. For below top 20: 33% overall, 56% for
articles and 0 for landing pages. See Tables 13 and 14.

Definition of the matching period
As a robustness check, we have used the period January 21st - March 17th, 2015 as the
matching period, pushing the start to two weeks later compared to the default. We have
lowered the threshold for inclusion to the sample to require 80 pageviews instead of 100 for
the control users in line with that the matching period's length is also decreased to 80%.
Results are essentially identical to the defaults. See Tables 15 and 16.

Definition of "top" outlets
We repeat the main comparison tables using the alternative cut of top 10 versus below top
10 publications, not the default top 20 versus below top 20. Results are shown in Tables 17
and18. The qualitative conclusions with this alternative definition are the same as with the
default one.

Notes: The table shows mean number of pageviews for the treatment and control groups in the matching
period. The types are 1 if a property applies to it and 0 if not, in the order of: relative scarcity, global
scarcity, popularity, hard news, breaking news. The p-value pertains to an individual t-test for the
difference between means being zero. To deal with issues of multiple testing, the Benjamini-Hochberg
procedure was used to control for the false discovery rate at the 10% level and the final column shows the
conclusion for the null hypothesis of the equality of the means based on this.

A-1        Browsing Data Processing
In this Section, we describe how we construct a clean dataset from the raw browser log.

A-1.1       Active Users
We only observe desktop users. We restrict attention to users whom we consistently observe
over our observation period. User attrition occurs for various reasons such as change in
default browser or a browser update that deletes the anonymous machine ID that links all
browsing events for the same user across time. We label a user as active if both of the
following criteria are met: (a) the user has some browsing activity in at least 90 percent of
all weeks between October 1, 2014 and March 17, 2015; and (b) there is news reading activity
in any 10-week long sub-period (for any of the top 177 Spanish publications).1 There are
158,575 users who satisfy this definition of activity and they constitute the user base that
we use for analysis.

A-1.2       Browsing Stream
For each active user, we observe a set of browsing sessions which have a discrete beginning
and end time (such as logging into and out of the computer). When there is a gap of more
than one hour between browsing events, we define a new session starting after the gap ends.
Within a session, we observe a time-stamped sequence of page loads which are linked through
a referrer URL. For example, if a user navigates first to the NYT homepage and then clicks
   1
    We constructed this list by looking at all the unique domains that receive referrals from Google News
Spain up to December 16, 2014. We then manually double-checked that this list contains the major Spanish
newspapers by circulation, top weekly magazines and top radio stations and news portals.


                                                   1
on an article on the home page, the browsing stream will show two page loads and the referral
source for the second load will be the index page.
An absent referrer field indicates that the user either used a bookmark or typed the URL
directly into the browser. An important special case are search queries that result in a visit
to a landing page (such as http://www.nytimes.com). Often, the user first searches for a
phrase such as "NYT" and then clicks on the link that appears on the search page. Even
though the referrer field in this case indicates that the page load originated from a search
we treat the referrer field as empty (as if the user had clicked a bookmark).
The browsing stream also provides us with a measure of how long the user spent on a certain
page ("dwell time"). This data is capped at 300 seconds since larger values typically indicate
inactivity (the user has walked away from the computer but left the browser open).

A-1.3        Canonical URLs
URLs are often not unique even if they load the same article because publishers frequently
include session and navigational parameters into the URL.2 We therefore "stem" all URLs
into a canonical format that removes most query parameters except for certain cases such
as ?id= which are sometimes used to index pages.

A-1.4        Landing and Article Pages
It is important for us to distinguish between article pages and landing pages (such as
http://www.nytimes.com or http://www.nytimes.com/business). For each canonical
URL, we count the number of page loads on every single day across all users and order
days in reverse order according to page count. We then analyze how many days it takes to
generate 80% of all page loads -- if it takes more than 15 days then we regard a URL as
landing page and otherwise an article. Intuitively, we exploit the fact that articles tend to
appear only a small number of days and therefore generate the bulk of page views within
that time frame. The NYT homepage, on the other hand, is loaded at a fairly constant rate
on every single day.
We used 6 undergraduates to evaluate our algorithm: each of them classified a random set of
100 canonical URLs by loading the page in a browser and the classifying it as a landing page
or an article. Their evaluation agreed with our simple algorithm for 95% of all canonical
URLs.

A-1.5        News Minisessions and Referral Modes
Most users spend only a fraction of time browsing news during a browsing session -- the
remainder is spent on Facebook, email etc. Thanks to the referrer URLs, we can think of
news browsing within a browsing session as a set of "trees": each tree has a single root (a
URL without a news referrer) and a number of branches that each have a (news) referrer
URL that indirectly links to the root.
  2
      Such as https://www.nytimes.com?origin=google, for example.

We call such a tree a "news mini session". We assign a referral mode to each news mini
sesssion depending on whether the root page load was the result of direct navigation (such
as a bookmark), a search on Google, Bing or Yahoo, navigation from Twitter or Facebook
(such as clicking a news article on these platforms), a referral from Google News or some
other origin (such as clicking on an email).


A-2       Topic Classification
We create topics for news articles by mapping unique news article URLs (excluding landing
pages) to Spanish language Wikipedia articles. We exploit the fact that Wikipedia covers
most major news events within a short period of time. This provides us with a stable
taxonomy for classifying a corpus of news articles. After automatically generating the clusters
of articles, we manually name topics by their "super-topics" (high-level topics) and the "sub-
topics" that in general correspond to the specific subject of matched Wikipedia articles.

A-2.1      Data
Scraping. We scrape all unique URLs and extract the text using Boilerpipe which is an open-
source program that can detect text within an html page (optimized for newspaper articles).
Within each publisher we run a cleaning algorithm which compares the article text of all
articles and identifies repeated sentences across articles. This algorithm removes boilerplate
text such as privacy statements which otherwise pollute the article text. Sentences that
occur in distinct URLs on more than 3 days a week over a one month period are removed
using this heuristic.
Wikipedia. Wikimedia holds an up-to-date online repository of all Wikipedia articles for
several languages. We extract all Wikipedia articles with more than 100 words. We also
extract outlinks (connections between Wikipedia articles).

A-2.2      Pre-processing
We build a dictionary of stemmed words using a standard Spanish language stemmer from
all Wikipedia concepts (a concept is really an article on Wikipedia - we refer to Wikipedia
articles as "concepts" in order to avoid confusion). We ignore rare words (words that appear
in fewer than 3 wikipedia articles) and Spanish stop words (such as articles and frequent
words such as the Spanish equivalents of "and" and "or"). We calculate the IDF (inverse
document frequency) score for each dictionary word defined as:

                                       # all words)
               log
                     # Wikipedia concepts in which specific word appears

We do the same for each bigram on Wikipedia.
For each newspaper article we find all words and bigrams. We count within each newspaper
article (including title) the number of occurrences of each word and bigram and calculate the


                                              3
TFIDF score as the number of occurrences times IDF score.3 We then order all words and
bigrams within the article according to this score in reverse order and take the top 30 words
and top 30 bigrams. For each article, we call those top 30 keywords and top 30 bigrams the
article fingerprint.

A-2.3      Newspaper Article to Wikipedia Concept matching
In this step we match Wikipedia concepts to each newspaper article.
We calculate a word-based newspaper article/Wikipedia concept similarity score by taking
the top 25 keywords of the article (out of 30). We then iterate through all Wikipedia
concepts. For each Wikipedia concept we (i) check which of these 25 words appear in the
Wikipedia concept; (ii) construct the sum of TFIDF scores for those words; (iii) divide this
sum by the sum of all 25 TFIDF scores. This provides us a score between 0 and 1 that
captures the similarity between the newspaper article and the Wikipedia concept based on
words. We calculate an analogous bigram-based similarity score.
Each of these two scores lies between 0 and 1. We calculate the weighted average for each
news article/Wikipedia article pair by placing weight 0.6 on the word score. We create a list
of the top 10 Wikipedia concepts according to this weighted similarity score.4

A-2.4      Pure Macro Topics
Many Wikipedia concepts refer to very similar ideas. For example, the English language
Wikipedia has several articles related to the passage of the Affordable Care Act. In order to
define clean topics it is necessary to cluster closely related concepts into what we call a "pure
topic." In order to accomplish this clustering we construct a graph that connects Wikipedia
concepts. This graph is based on two subgraphs -- the co-occurence graph and the common
outlink graph.
The co-occurence graph is constructed by assigning an edge weight to each pair of Wikipedia
concepts i and j as follows: we find the number of newspaper articles that (i) list both
these concepts among the top 3 matches and (ii) assign scores to both concepts of at least
0.5. Intuitively, the co-occurrence graph assigns a large weight to pairs of substitutable
concepts.
For the outlink graph the weight between two concepts i and j is defined as follows: we
count the number of concepts that both i and j either link to or are linked from (common
neighbors). We then normalize this score by dividing by the size of the union of all articles
that link to or are linked from i or j .
Finally, we merge both graphs by multiplying the edge weights (where some weights might
go to zero as a result of this multiplication). Intuitively, Wikipedia concepts that are close in
  3
    TFIDF scores are a standard scoring rule that is commonly used for information retrieval systems.
  4
    We determined this weight as well as the number of keywords and bigrams on which the weight is
based by hiring student raters who evaluated the resulting Wikipedia article assignment for a sample of
newspaper articles. We then determined the three parameters through a grid search that maximized the
overall evaluation score.


                                                  4
this merged graph tend to both have a high co-occurrence count and a high share of common
outlinks. We use the fast Louvain algorithm (which maximizes modularity) to detect clusters
(Blondel et al., 2008). We call these resulting clusters the "pure topics."
Going back to the articles, every newspaper article whose top-scoring Wikipedia concept has
at least weighted score 0.5 and is part of such a pure topic is then assigned to this pure topic.
Articles whose top-scoring concept has a score of less than 0.5 or that do not connect to any
concept in a pure topic are left unassigned at this stage.

A-2.5      Topic Augmentation
In this step, we assign some of the so far unassigned newspaper articles to pure topics.
We again use a clustering algorithm which we first overview before providing details. The
basic idea is to construct a super-network of all articles (both assigned and unassigned).
We create strong links between assigned articles in this super-network that belong to the
same pure macro topic. This ensures that these articles will be assigned to the same clusters
when finding communities in the super-network. We also add links between unassigned and
assigned articles based on semantic and word similarity.
In an ideal world, we would construct the super-network using all articles. The problem is
that with N million articles, calculating edge weights between all pairs of articles requires
N 2 calculations which is infeasible given the number of unique articles. To reduce the
computation time, we use a short-cut that iteratively adds nodes to the network and groups
them into communities.
We take the set of pure topics such that the page view count makes up 90% of assigned
articles. For each pure topic we take 20 articles which have a top weighted Wikipedia
concept score above 0.9, and we sample by page view weight (these tend to be representative
articles that clearly belong to the respective pure macro topic). We construct a base network
of "islands" where each island is a complete graph that connects all 20 base article belonging
to a particular macro topic (weight 1 on each edge). Hence, there are as many islands as
pure topics. The total number of base articles M is equal to 20 times the number of pure
topics.
We then take batches of M/2 unassigned articles and embed them in this base network. We
connect them to each of the M base articles by using a weighted average of the following
two sub-weight.
  1. The first sub-weight wij between an unassigned article i and base article j is determined
     by semantic similarity (distance between the associated Wikipedia concepts). We take
     the top 5 associated Wikipedia concepts for both i and j , and then take the intersection
     of both concepts sets. Then we sum i's scores for these overlapping concepts and
     divide by the sum of i's top 5 scores to get a number between 0 and 1. Analogously,
     we calculate the corresponding score for j . The average of these two numbers defines
     our first sub-weight wij . Intuitively, this weight is large if both newspaper articles
     are associated with similar Wikipedia concepts and more important concepts receive
     higher weight. We then calculate the top 1 percentile cutoff over all these sub-weights


                                               5
     and set all the weights below this cutoff to 0. This "pruning" reduces noise.
  2. The second sub-weight w    ~ij measures word and bigram similarity between the two
     articles. We consider word similarity first. We take the top 8 keywords for articles
     i and j and the associated TFIDF scores from both fingerprints. We then use the
     same procedure as for semantic similarity. We then repeat the procedure again for
     the top 5 bigrams. We average the resulting scores by putting weight 0.6 on the word
     score. This provides us with the second sub-weight w~ij . Intuitively, this weight is large
     if both articles are associated with similar keywords and bigrams. We use the same 1
     percentile pruning as applied to the semantic network.
We add both sub-weights and divide by half. This gives us a [0, 1] weight that defines the
graph links between the base network and the unassigned batch articles. We again run
the Louvain community detection on each resulting super-network, such that we always
preserve the original pure macro topics but "augment" them with the previously unassigned
articles.
The algorithm scales linearly with the dataset.

A-2.6     Supervised cleaning
The last step is the only supervised step that requires manual intervention. Recall, that
each macro topic is defined by the set of associated Wikipedia concepts. We have student
evaluators define English-language nested labels for these 320 labels such as Health: Spain
Ebola crisis for the macro topic that describes the 2015 Ebola crisis in Spain. Our nesting
has two levels: super-topic (Health ) and sub-topic (Spain Ebola crisis ). This makes it easy
to evaluate the final topic assignment by separately rating the super-topic and sub-topic
assignments.
