University Patenting: Estimating the Diminishing Breadth of Knowledge Diffusion and Consumption

JEL No. I23,O33,O34

                                               ABSTRACT

The rate of university patenting increased dramatically during the 1980s. To what extent did the knowledge
flow patterns associated with public sector inventions change as university administrators and faculty
seemingly became more commercially oriented? Using a Herfindahl-type measure of patent assignee
concentration and employing a difference-in-differences estimation to compare university to firm patents
across two time periods, we find that the university diffusion premium (the degree to which knowledge
flows from patented university inventions are more widely distributed across assignees than those
of firms) declined by over half during the 1980s. In addition, we find that the university diversity premium
(the degree to which knowledge inflows used to develop patented university inventions are drawn
from a less concentrated set of prior art holders than those used by firms) also declined by over half.
Moreover, in both cases the estimated increase in knowledge flow concentration is largely driven by
universities experienced in patenting, suggesting these phenomena are not likely to dissipate with experience.

1         Introduction

Amongst the most striking developments on American university campuses over the past
quarter century has been the rapid rise of patenting to lay claim to and protect intellectual
property associated with novel and practical inventions developed by university researchers.
Indeed, in just 13 years, from 1980 to 1993, the number of patents issued annually to US
universities increased by 315%, from 390 to 1620.1 This dramatic shift in academic behavior
has been attributed to many factors. Principal among these are developments in the fields
of microbiology and computer science, an expansion in the range of patentable matter (e.g.,
genetically modified life forms, software), the creation of the Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit, and, most commonly, the passage of the Bayh-Dole Act (1980), which granted
universities extensive rights to patent and retain ownership of innovations produced with
federal government funding.
        Although many observers have characterized the dramatic rise of university patenting
as a windfall for the American economy - indeed, The Economist went as far as describing
the Bayh-Dole Act in particular as “possibly the most inspired piece of legislation to be
enacted in America over the past half century” and citing university-based innovation as
a key factor that facilitated America’s industrial renaissance in the 1980s2 - others have
expressed a variety of concerns, most of which can be grouped into one of three categories:
1) a shift in focus from “basic” to “applied” university research,3 2) a decline in quality of
university inventions, and 3) a decline in the dissemination of knowledge associated with
university inventions.
        Surprisingly, given the increasing level of concern over university patenting expressed in
both policy circles and the popular press,4 the evidence to date offers little support for the
    1
     By comparison, the number of patents issued to other US non-government organizations increased by
only 48% over the same time period.

first two of these concerns. The first concern, that an increased focus on commercialization
may induce university researchers to divert their energies away from basic research (Cohen
et al. (1998); Henderson et al. (1998)), is predicated on the notion that it is more important
for universities to provide basic than applied research. This is because the market is more
likely to under-provide basic than applied research due to greater appropriability problems.
Basic research is important though, since it often provides knowledge for subsequent applied
research and product development, which in turn is the basis for long run productivity and
economic growth.
    However, empirical studies that examine whether professors substitute patenting for pub-
lishing, a rough proxy for changes in research focus, do not provide evidence of such substi-
tution. Agrawal and Henderson (2002) examine the publishing and patenting output of elec-
trical engineering, computer science, and mechanical engineering faculty at a major research
institution (MIT) and present evidence suggesting that these two activities are complements
rather than substitutes. Furthermore, Markiewicz and DiMinin (2005) and Goldfarb et al.
(2006) examine the complement-substitute question more directly with data from a much
broader sample of university researchers and find similar results. Moreover, these findings
are not specific to US universities; several studies that examine the patenting-publishing re-
lationship at various European institutions yield similar conclusions (VanLooy et al. (2005)
- K.U Leuven in Belgium; Buenstorf (2005) - Max Planck Institute in Germany; Carayol
(2005) - University Louis Pasteur in France; Breschi et al. (2005) and Calerini and Franzoni
(2004) - various institutions in Italy).
    The second concern is predicated on the notion that an increased focus on commercial-
ization may induce researchers to shift resources towards the disclosure and patenting of
lower quality inventions (Henderson et al. (1998)).5 However, evidence presented by Mowery
et al. (2004) shows that although the quality of inventions did decline after 1980, this was
“Bayhing for blood or Doling out cash?” The Economist, December 24, 2005, p. 115; Lieberwitz (2005);
“Lilly Loses Patent Case to Ariad,” New York Times, May 5, 2006, p. C1.
   5
     The quality of inventions is measured by “importance,” reflected by a count of subsequent citations, and
“generality,” reflected by the dispersion of citations received from patents in different technology fields.


                                                     3
due to the entry of universities with little patenting experience; it was not due to a general
decline in quality of inventions patented by all universities. The implication of this finding
is that the estimated decline is likely to be only temporary, while inexperienced universities
learn the patenting process and how to most effectively manage their intellectual property
portfolio.
   Thus, it is only the third concern, relating to how the anti-commons limits the flow of
knowledge, that has found traction in empirical evidence. In a study employing a difference-
in-differences identification based on patent-paper pairs, Murray and Stern (2005) report
findings that although publications linked to patents are associated with a higher overall
citation rate, after the patent is actually issued, the rate declines substantially (by 9-17%).
The authors note that the decline is particularly salient for articles authored by researchers
with public sector affiliations, such as university professors. They interpret their findings as
evidence of an anti-commons effect that results from moving intellectual property from the
public into the private domain.
   Our paper further addresses the third concern: restricting the widespread flow of knowl-
edge associated with university inventions. However, where Murray and Stern focus on the
decline in the level of knowledge flows, we focus on the narrowing of knowledge flows to a
smaller set of recipients. Specifically, we examine whether, over time and conditional on be-
ing patented, university inventions are more likely to be cited by a more concentrated set of
subsequent patent owners. Such a finding could reflect the outcome of a change in the man-
agement objectives of university intellectual property from broad knowledge dissemination
towards limiting access, perhaps to maximize private returns to licensors.
   Using a Herfindahl-type measure of patent assignee concentration associated with for-
ward citations as a dependent variable and employing a difference-in-differences estimation
(taking the difference of the change in concentrations over time between university versus
firm patents), we estimate that the university diffusion premium (the degree to which knowl-
edge flows from patented university inventions are more widely distributed across assignees


                                               4
than those of firms) declined by over half between the early and late 1980s. Furthermore,
unlike the decline in invention quality that occurred during the 1980s that Mowery et al
found to be due to the entry of inexperienced universities, the increase in knowledge flow
concentration we discover is largely driven by experienced universities; this finding suggests
that the phenomenon we identify is unlikely to disappear with time but may actually increase
as inexperienced universities become more like their experienced counterparts with respect
to the manner in which they manage their intellectual property.
       In addition to examining the pattern of knowledge flowing out from university inventions,
we also study the pattern of flows into these inventions. Although the approach we employ
to examine inflows is similar to the one we use to examine outflows, the phenomenon itself is
distinct. Relative to firms, we expect universities draw from a wider set of prior art holders
since academia is largely shielded from the anti-commons problem. This problem occurs
when prior art is strongly enforced and widely distributed (Heller and Eisenberg (1998);
Argyres and Liebskind (1998); David (2001); David (2003); Lessig (2002); Etzkowitz (1998);
Krimsky (2003)).
       Under these conditions, Cournot’s “complements problem” can arise (Shapiro (2001)).
Each upstream patent owner prices royalties without coordinating with owners of comple-
mentary patents. Without coordination, the marginal cost of utilizing complementary tech-
nologies is higher than if all patents were owned by a single agent. Moreover, a larger number
of prior art holders may simply increase transactions costs incurred negotiating the rights to
use the complementary technologies required to practice the invention (Ziedonis (2004)).
       While firms may consciously conduct R&D with this in mind to minimize exposure to the
anti-commons,6 university researchers are largely insulated for two reasons. First, universities
have traditionally been shielded from patent infringement liability due to the “experimental
   6
    For example, from the outset of Kodak’s efforts to develop its instant photography technology, the firm
employed its legal counsel to work along with its R&D engineers to minimize the likelihood that any new
technology would infringe on existing Polaroid patents (Warshofsky (1994); Rivette and Kline (2000); Jaffe
and Lerner (2004)). In addition, Hall and Ziedonis (2001) and Ziedonis (2004) present evidence suggesting
that firms building on prior art that is more fragmented patent more aggressively in order to facilitate
cross-licensing and mitigate against potential infringement costs.


                                                    5
use exemption” (Eisenberg (2003)). Under this doctrine, otherwise infringing activity is
permitted if it occurs “for amusement, to satisfy idle curiosity, or for strictly philosophical
inquiry.”7 Second, to the extent that university researchers choose their research projects to
advance knowledge and only concern themselves with patenting ex post – after something
they have discovered is shown to work and offer commercial potential – their project selection
and prior art decisions will not be influenced by concerns about potential hold-up during the
subsequent product development phase.
       However, as university patenting rises during the 1980s, we find that university researchers
tend to draw from a more concentrated set of prior art holders. Specifically, our results
suggest that the university diversity premium (the degree to which knowledge inflows used
to develop patented university inventions are drawn from a less concentrated set of prior
art holders than those used by firms) declined by over half between the early 1980s and
early 1990s. Furthermore, similar to the case of knowledge outflows described above, the
estimated increase in knowledge inflow concentration is driven by experienced universities,
again suggesting that this phenomenon is not likely to dissipate with experience but may
actually increase over time.
       This finding may reflect a change over time in the manner in which university researchers
conduct research. Rather than merely worrying about the patentability of an invention ex
post, researchers may increasingly plan research projects with an eye towards commercial-
ization. If motivated by pecuniary gains, as evidence reported by Lach and Schankerman
(2005) suggests, academic researchers will look forward, anticipating the burden of future li-
censees, and reason backwards that the value of their intellectual property could be increased
if they are able to plan their research approach so as to narrow the scope of prior art holders
associated with complementary technologies.
       Like Murray and Stern, our findings suggest caution with respect to the increasing ten-
   7
    Walsh et al. (2005) present evidence suggesting that university researchers pay little attention to patents
protecting research tools and are unlikely to modify their research due to impediments posed by existing
patents. These findings are particularly interesting since they are based on data reflecting attitudes after
the Madey v. Duke verdict of 2003.


                                                      6
dency to patent university research. However, our findings are quite distinct. Their paper
shows the impact of patenting on knowledge dissemination: an overall reduction in the level
of knowledge outflows. Our results suggest that, conditional on patenting and controlling
for a reduction in overall flow levels, the management of knowledge flows both to and from
universities has resulted in an increasing concentration of flows over time.
       This behavior seems counter to the stated mandate of most US universities, which is often
some permutation of maximizing the dissemination of new knowledge that results from their
research. While the welfare implications of our findings are non-obvious - limiting access
to new knowledge can be welfare enhancing if the welfare lost to those denied access is less
than the welfare gained by those who are granted exclusivity to invest in commercialization
(Colyvas et al. (2002); Mazzoleni (2005); Agrawal and Garlappi (2007)) - our results are con-
sistent with the view that universities are increasingly managing their intellectual property
like profit maximizing firms rather than as welfare maximizing public institutions.
       These trends in university knowledge flows are important to identify and understand
because they have real implications for science policy and economic growth. Precisely because
of their non-commercial focus and their welfare enhancing objectives, universities play a
unique and important role in the national innovation system (Nelson (1993); Nelson (1996)).
They receive extensive government funding to produce basic knowledge that is intended to
be widely disseminated.8 It is in this context that universities have historically contributed
to economic growth and welfare (Henderson et al. (1998)). To the extent that knowledge
spillovers are indeed central to economic growth (Romer (1986); Romer (1990)), the finding
that university flows, at least those associated with patented inventions, are narrowing throws
into question the traditionally conceived arrangement between academia and society.9
   8
     From 1980 to 1993, universities received approximately $103 billion (constant 1996 dollars) from all levels
of government to fund basic R&D. This represents approximately 45% of all basic research undertaken in
the US (National Science Board (2004)).
   9
     As a current example of a public response to this trend, the National Institute of Health (NIH), a major
US government funding agency, recently issued new guidelines urging universities to increase the frequency
with which they license genomic, NIH-funded, patented inventions on a non-exclusive, rather than exclusive,
basis (National Institute of Health (2005)).



                                                       7
       The remainder of our paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2 we describe our empirical
methodology, particularly the construction of our dependent variable, the “fragmentation
index.” In Section 3 we describe the patent citation data that we use to construct our
measures. In Section 4 we present our empirical results for both knowledge outflows and
inflows as well as provide examples to better understand the meaning of the estimated
coefficients. Finally, in Section 5, we conclude by offering some possible explanations for our
findings and directions for future research.



2        Methodology

Our empirical objective is to test whether knowledge flows associated with patented uni-
versity inventions become more concentrated over time. Thus, most importantly, we need
to employ an estimation technique that facilitates the clean identification of a change in
the concentration of knowledge flows over time that is university-specific. Furthermore, we
require an appropriate measure of knowledge flow concentration. We describe each of these
in turn.


2.1       Estimation

In order to estimate university specific changes in concentration of knowledge flows over
time, we analyze data from two distinct periods.10 We define these as Period 1 (1980-1983)
and Period 2 (1986-1989).11 In order to identify changes in concentration that are university
specific as opposed to general changes in flow patterns, we employ a difference-in-differences
estimation (taking the difference of the change in concentrations over time between university
versus firm patents). In addition, we include control variables to address specific dimensions
  10
     As described in the introduction, we are interested in university-specific changes in the concentration of
both knowledge outflows and inflows. Since the estimation procedure is almost identical, we describe the
outflows case only and comment in footnotes where the methodology differs for inflows.
  11
     In the case of knowledge inflows, we define Period 2 as 1990-1993 since we use backward citations and
thus are not restricted by the data set ending in 1999.



                                                      8
along which it is plausible that universities systematically patent differently than firms (e.g.,
inventions that are more important, more basic, or more likely from a particular technology
field).
       Thus, we estimate the following relationship:


           F ragp = F (αo + α1 Dp + α2 ERAp + α3 Dp ERAp + Xp α4 + Xp ERAp α5 ) + εp                       (1)


where F ragp measures the fragmentation of ownership dispersion of patents building upon
patent p (“forward fragmentation” of knowledge outflows).12 Dp is a university dummy
variable that takes a value of one if p is assigned to a university and zero otherwise. ERAp
identifies patents that were issued in Period 2 (i.e., ERAp = 1 if patent p was issued in 1986-
1989 and zero otherwise).13 Xp is a vector of variables that control for non-institutional
factors that may also affect fragmentation. Finally, εp is a mean zero random error.
       We use Equation 1 to test whether the university dummy explains some of the fragmen-
tation of knowledge flows, F ragp . The sign and significance of α̂1 offers insight into the
relationship between institution type and the patterns of related knowledge flows. If α̂1 is
such that the marginal effect of the university dummy is positive,


                              F (α̂o + α̂1 + Xp α̂4 ) − F (α̂o + Xp α̂4 ) > 0,


and statistically significant we will interpret this as suggestive evidence that university knowl-
edge flows are less concentrated than those of firms, at least in Period 1.14 This finding would
be consistent with our prior beliefs about the differences between university and firm knowl-
edge flows.
       To identify how any initial difference in knowledge flows between universities and firms
  12
     Similarly, for the case of knowledge inflows, F ragp measures the fragmentation of prior art holders upon
which patent p builds (backward fragmentation).
  13
     For the case of knowledge inflows, the dummy variable ERAp distinguishes patents that were applied for
in Period 2 (i.e., ERAp = 1 if patent p was submitted to the patent office in 1990-1993 and is zero otherwise).
  14
     In this case, ERAp = 0 because we are analyzing patents in Period 1.



                                                      9
have changed over time, we focus on α̂3 , the coefficient on the interaction between the
university dummy variable, Dp , and ERAp . If α̂3 is such that,

                                                                                            
              F (α̂o + α̂1 + α̂2 + α̂3 + Xp α̂4 + Xp α̂5 ) − F (α̂o + α̂2 + Xp α̂4 + Xp α̂5 )

                                                                        
                            − F (α̂o + α̂1 + Xp α̂4 ) − F (α̂o + Xp α̂4 ) < 0,

we will interpret this as indicating that the change in the difference between university
and firm knowledge dispersion over time is negative; in other words, knowledge flows from
university patents have become disproportionately more concentrated.


2.2     Variables

We construct each of our variables using information found on the front page of the patents
in our data. When a patent is issued, a substantial amount of information regarding the
innovation embodied by the patent is disclosed, including the technology field,15 the assignee
name (i.e., the patent’s owner), and all prior patents on which the given innovation builds
(i.e., prior art citations). These citations are important for our study because they trace the
knowledge flows between patents;16 they may also indicate complementary technologies that
  15
      Technology fields are determined by the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and are analogous
to industry classes in an industry classification system such as the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC).
Technology classes, however, do not map readily to any one industry because a given innovation can be
applied in a wide range of industries. See Kortum and Putnam (1997) for details regarding technology
field-industry concordances.
   16
      We use patent citations as a proxy for knowledge flows. However, citations are not straightforward to
interpret in terms of direct knowledge flows, and the signal-to-noise ratio for this measure is therefore likely
to be rather low. Patents cite other patents as “prior art,” with citations serving to delineate the property
rights conferred. Some citations are supplied by the applicant, others by the patent examiner, and some
patents may be cited more frequently than others because they are more salient in terms of satisfying legal
definitions of prior art rather than because they have greater technological significance. Cockburn et al.
(2002) report, for example, that some examiners have “favorite” patents that they cite preferentially because
they “teach the art” particularly well. Nonetheless, Jaffe et al. (2002) surveyed cited and citing inventors to
explore the “meaning of patent citations” and found that approximately one-quarter of the survey responses
corresponded to a “fairly clear spillover,” approximately one-half indicated no spillover, and the remaining
quarter indicate some possibility of a spillover. Based on their survey data, the authors conclude: “We
believe that these results are consistent with the notion that citations are a noisy signal of the presence of
spillovers. This implies that aggregate citation flows can be used as proxies for knowledge-spillover intensity,
for example, between categories of organizations or between geographic regions” (p. 400).


                                                      10
may need to be used to practice the invention.17 As such, while a patent grants the assignee
the right to exclude others from practicing the invention described in the patent, it does not
necessarily grant the owner the right to practice the invention without the permission of cited
assignees. Consequently, citing assignees can be used as a proxy for potential licensees. As
indicated by Ziedonis (2004) and Rivette and Kline (2000), this is how some IP consulting
firms have come to use citations.18


2.2.1      Dependent Variable

Our dependant variable, a measure of the concentration of knowledge flows, is constructed
in the spirit of the “fragmentation index” developed in Ziedonis (2004). Again, we describe
only the knowledge outflows measure, or forward fragmentation, F orF ragi,p , given that the
backward measure, BackF ragi,p is defined analogously using the citations a patent makes
rather than receives.
       Forward fragmentation measures the ownership dispersion of subsequent patents that
cite a focal patent. Specifically, for a focal patent p issued to assignee i, the fragmentation
measure F orF ragi,p is given by:

                                               X  Cj,i,p 2  Ci,p
                            F orF ragi,p   = 1−                         ,                              (2)
                                                    C i,p      Ci,p − 1
                                                j∈J



where J is the set of assignees whose patents cite the focal patent, i ∈
                                                                       / J, and Cj,i,p are all
citations made to p by patents belonging to assignee j ∈ J. In Equation 2, Ci,p is the total

    These firms use citations to assess potential licensees and to determine what patents are best to renew
or to allow to lapse.

two randomly selected citations made to a given patent refer to citing patents issued to
two different assignees.19,20 Consequently, the measure’s range of possible values is the unit
interval. For patents that have more widely distributed knowledge outflows (i.e., higher
fragmentation), the probability that any two sampled citations belong to different assignees
will be closer to one. Conversely, the probability of this event will be closer to zero the more
concentrated the citing intellectual property is.
       To gain a better intuition for interpreting this dispersion index, which is related to the
familiar Herfindahl concentration measure, consider the following three examples of focal
patents that are each cited by 10 patents (i.e., Ci,p = 10). First, suppose the focal patent
is cited by 10 patents that are all issued to IBM, J = {IBM }. In this case, citing patents
are perfectly concentrated and thus make it impossible for any two citations to refer to
different assignees, F orF ragi,p = 0. Next, suppose the focal patent receives five citations
each from two different assignees. This yields an intermediate measure of fragmentation; the
probability that any two of the 10 citations are made by different assignees is approximately
half, F orF ragi,p ' 0.556.21 Finally, suppose the focal patent is cited once each by 10 different
  19
     This is a traditional interpretation for dispersion measures of the type defined by Equation 2. See
Easterly and Levine (1997) for an example of this interpretation in the context of measuring ethnic diversity.
  20
     With this interpretation, one can easily understand the fragmentation measure defined by Equation 2.
Due to the count nature of citations (i.e., too few citations are typically made to make sampling with re-
placement an appropriate assumption), the conditional probability that two citing patents belong to different
assignees, given that one of these two citations is known to belong to assignee j, is:
                                                                               Cj,i,p − 1
                      1 − P r(Second citation belongs to assignee j) = 1 −                .
                                                                               Ci,p − 1

Consequently, the expected probability that two randomly chosen citing patents belong to different assignees
is:
                           X Cj,i,p      Cj,i,p − 1      X Cj,i,p Cj,i,p − 1
                                      1−               =1−                     .
                               Ci,p        Ci,p − 1            Ci,p Ci,p − 1

It can then be shown that
                               X Cj,i,p Cj,i,p − 1          X  Cj,i,p 2  Ci,p

             C
The term Ci,pi,p−1 in Equation 2 corrects the empirical probability had we assumed that we could sample with
replacement. Without this adjustment, our dispersion measure would be biased toward zero. This is the
same adjustment recommended by Hall et al. (2002).

F orF ragi,p = 1.


2.2.2      Control variables

Our identification of university specific fragmentation is based on a difference-in-differences
estimation that compares differences in fragmentation over time between universities and
firms. This approach is used to “difference out” overall changes in knowledge flow fragmen-
tation that are not university specific. However, it may be the case that identified changes in
university knowledge flow fragmentation are the result of certain characteristics of university
patents rather than institutional characteristics of universities themselves. For example, it
may be the case that the probability of generating a “general purpose” patent increased less
over time for universities than for firms and that general purpose patents are more likely
to generate diffused knowledge outflows due to their wide applicability. This could appear
as a university specific increase in knowledge flow concentration over time, but is actually a
“generality” effect rather than an institutional effect caused by a change in the management
practices of university intellectual property. Similarly, it may be the case that the probabil-
ity of generating a biotechnology patent increased more over time for universities than firms
and that biotechnology patents are more likely to generate concentrated knowledge outflows.
Again, this could appear as a university specific increase in knowledge flow concentration
over time but is actually a biotechnology effect.22
       We control for these and several other possible confounding effects. Specifically, we control
for four invention specific characteristics: 1) generality, 2) technology field, 3) importance,
and 4) university science.23 First, “generality” is constructed using the same citations used to
  22
      We acknowledge that universities might manage their entire patent portfolio in a manner that influences
knowledge flow concentration. However, our analysis focuses on how universities manage patents individually.
For example, over time a university might allocate technology transfer resources more heavily towards a
particular field, such as biotechnology. If biotechnology patents generate more concentrated knowledge
flows, this would affect our dependent variable but the variance would be captured by the technology field
coefficient rather than the coefficient of interest, the coefficient on the university dummy. Thus, we may
underestimate the university management effect.
   23
      In the case of inflows, we control for “originality” rather than generality and “citations made” rather


                                                     13
calculate the dependant variable. However, rather than measuring the dispersion of citations
received from different assignees, this control measures dispersion of citations received from
different technology fields defined by the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) three-
digit technology classification system.24
    Second, we include technology field fixed effects using dummy variables coinciding with
the NBER two-digit technology field classification.25 Third, we control for invention im-
portance using a simple count of total citations received by the focal patent.26 Finally, we
control for the degree to which a patent is cited by universities as a factor influencing frag-
mentation. We control for this with a variable representing the share of citations received
from university patents. This variable controls for any systematic “university science” effect
that might induce innovators to be cited by a smaller (or larger) group of assignees (i.e.,
universities).



3     Data

We collect our data primarily from the NBER patent database described by Hall et al.
(2002). This source provides all the raw citation data needed to construct the variables in
our samples. In addition, we use the report “US Colleges and Universities-Utility Patent
Grants, Calendar Years 1969-2000”27 to identify all US university patents granted from 1969
to 1999.28
than importance. These measures are similar in spirit.
   24
      “Generality” reflects the extent to which the knowledge embedded in a focal patent is applicable across
other technology fields (Trajtenberg et al. (1997)).
   25
      Our conclusions are robust to using more disaggregated technology field fixed effects; dummy variables
based on the USPTO three-digit technology classification codes do not change our conclusions.
   26
      The generality and importance measures, as described in Hall et al. (2002), have been widely used in
the patent-based economics of innovation literature.
   27
      This source is produced by the Information Products Division, Technology Assessment and Forecast
Branch (2002).
   28
      When referring to universities, we refer to universities, colleges, polytechnics, other post-secondary in-
stitutions, and university consortia.

3.1     Sample Construction

Since we ask two different but related questions concerning changes in the concentration
of university knowledge outflows and university knowledge inflows, we require two distinct
samples. Although the sample construction process used for each is similar, there are a few
key differences. Thus, we describe each separately below.


3.1.1    Knowledge Outflows Sample

This sample is composed of a subset of all utility patents issued to US non-government
organizations by the USPTO.29 Specifically, we collect patents issued during the periods
1980-1983 and 1986-1989. This results in 241,929 patents. Furthermore, of this set of patents,
we only keep those that receive at least two citations since our forward fragmentation and
generality measures are undefined otherwise.30,31
    Next, we define the specific citations we consider. We ignore self-citations because we are
interested in how knowledge flows between agents in the economy.32 Furthermore, we do not
consider citations received from patents applied for before the focal patent was issued. We do
this because we assume that citations from such patents are unlikely to represent knowledge
flows due to the secrecy usually maintained during the patenting process. Finally, due to
truncation issues, we remove citations that come from patents issued more than 10 years after
the focal patent issue date.33 Consequently, by only keeping patents that receive at least two
“allowable” citations, we are left with a final sample containing 173,499 focal patents that
  29
     A utility patent is a patent protecting a process, machine, composition of matter, or an improvement of
any one of these things.
  30
     This is obvious from the definition of our forward fragmentation measure defined in Equation 2.
  31
     It is difficult to deduce what bias these exclusions introduce into our results. Other studies that use
these measures confront similar problems (e.g., Mowery et al. (2004)). Thus, it is important to note that our
results may only apply to patents that receive at least two citations and, in the case of inflows, to patents
that make at least two citations.
  32
     A self-citation is a citation received from a patent issued to the same assignee as the focal patent.
  33
     We choose 10 years since the NBER patent database contains citation data up to 1999. Since our focal
patents can be issued as early as 1980 and as late as 1989, the earlier patents would have nine more years to
accumulate citations if we did not truncate our citation window to 10 years. Since we focus on the difference-
in-differences estimation, this issue is likely less of a problem, but we truncate the data in case university
patents differ systematically from firm patents along this dimension.


                                                     15
are, on average, referenced by 7.88 citing patents.


3.1.2      Knowledge Inflows Sample

This sample is also composed of a subset of all USPTO utility patents issued to US non-
government organizations. In this case we collect patents applied for during 1980-1983 and
1990-1993. This results in 289,894 focal patents. Next, similar to the outflows sample
construction, we remove patents that do not make at least two citations since our dependant
variable, BackF rag, as well as our measure of originality are undefined for these patents.
       Thus, by construction, each focal patent in our sample cites at least two patents. More-
over, as in the earlier case, we only consider citations with particular characteristics. Since we
are concerned about potential anti-commons effects on knowledge inflows, we only consider
cited patents that can potentially hold-up the utilization of follow-on inventions. Therefore,
we focus on cited patents not owned by the focal assignee and that were issued before (but no
more than 10 years before) the application of the focal patent. We consider these citations
because they are particularly salient in terms of potential for impeding the utilization of the
new invention.34 Removing focal patents that make less than two “allowable” citations, we
generate a final sample that includes 201,433 focal patents that, on average, cite 5.79 prior
patents.


3.2       Data limitations

Though rich, our data has limitations. Most notably, some of the patents in the data
do not include assignee information. This is important since our dependent variable, the
fragmentation index, is constructed using this information.35 As described in Hall et al.
  34
      For example, an IBM patent applied for in 1980 might cite a Texas Instrument patent issued in 1969,
an Intel patent issued in 1973, an IBM patent issued in 1978, and an AMD patent issued in 1981. Of these
cited patents, we remove all but the Intel patent because it is less than 10 years old and so is likely to remain
enforced by the time the focal invention is practiced and because it is not owned by IBM. Furthermore,
unlike the AMD patent, the Intel patent was issued early enough that it could be observed by IBM and thus
could have influenced IBM’s decision to develop and ultimately patent the focal invention.
   35
      For example, when calculating the forward fragmentation measure, we need to know ownership informa-
tion for the focal patent and for each of the citing patents.

                                                       16
(2002), 18.4% of all patents in the NBER database have unidentified owners.
       However, we take a number of steps to minimize this problem. First, by construction, we
only use focal patents for which we have assignee information. Recall that our initial set of
patents is drawn from patents issued to US non-government organizations. Thus, only our
citing patents may be missing assignee information.36 Next, since we apply a 10-year window
for constructing our backward fragmentation index and older patents are more likely to be
missing assignee information, we further limit our exposure to this problem.
       In addition, we utilize inventor name data that is also provided by the NBER database.37
We use this information to obtain a better measure of fragmentation for patents that are
cited by more than one unassigned patent. In these cases, we group the unassigned citations
by the first inventor of the unassigned patents. For example, if a sampled patent cites
two unassigned patents, both with the same first inventor, we treat these two citations as
belonging to the same assignee.
       Thus, as a result of these measures, only 13.3% of the citations made by our sampled
patents are to unassigned patents and only 12.0% of citations received are from unassigned
patents. Alternatively, each sampled patent, on average, cites 0.80 unassigned patents and
receive 0.85 citations from unassigned patents. Finally, when calculating our fragmentation
measure, we assume unassigned patents are not self-citations and that each belongs to a
different assignee. However, as a robustness check, we also estimate our key models using
fragmentation measures constructed by instead assuming that all unassigned patents belong
to a single assignee; our results do not change. In addition, we further check robustness by
limiting our sample to only those focal patents that are cited by patents with full assignee
information; our results persist.38
       A second limitation of the data is the absence of ownership transfer information. Our
fragmentation measure is calculated based on the assignee identified at the time each patent is
  36
     Similarly, for the knowledge inflows case, only our cited patents may be missing assignee information.
  37
     The NBER patent database provides the inventor name(s) for all patents issued after 1974.
  38
     We similarly check robustness for the knowledge inflows case by limiting our sample to only those focal
patents that cite patents with full assignee information, and again our results persist.

issued. However, Serrano (2005) finds that the sale and purchase of patents is not uncommon.
This would only pose a problem if the likelihood of ownership transfer (specifically the type
that would cause a change in fragmentation) changed at a different rate for universities than
firms. The literature on this topic is limited and does not indicate whether this is the case.
Moreover we do not have access to ownership transfer data to check; thus, we note this as a
caveat for interpreting our results and an issue warranting further research.



4     Results

4.1    Summary Statistics

We present summary statistics on Table 1 confirming the findings of Henderson et al. (1998)
that university patents are more important, general, and original than firm patents. Be-
ginning with Panel A, which presents data for the knowledge outflows sample, we see that
university patents are more important (they receive more citations) in both Periods 1 and
2. For example, the average university patent receives 35% more citations than the average
firm patent in Period 1 and 32% more citations in Period 2. Similarly, university patents are
more general in both periods. Turning to Panel B, we see that university patents are also
more original, and this difference seems to increase over time.
    Next, we consider our variable of interest - the fragmentation index. Beginning with Panel
A, we see that knowledge outflows from university patents are more fragmented than their
private sector counterparts in Period 1. (We explain how to interpret the difference in index
values in Section 4.4.) However, this difference seems to disappear by Period 2. Similarly, in
Panel B, we see that knowledge inflows to university patents are more fragmented than those
to firm patents in Period 1. Again, however, this difference seems to disappear by Period 2.
    Although these statistics are suggestive of a change in university behavior concerning the
management of knowledge flows associated with patented inventions, changes in institution-
related fragmentation measures could be confounded with changes in non-institutional factors


                                              18
(such as technology field portfolio) as we note in the methodology section above. Thus, we
turn next to regression analysis, which allows us to control for key invention characteristics.


4.2       Regression Analysis: Dispersion of Knowledge Outflows

We report the estimated OLS coefficients of Equation 1 for the knowledge outflows sample in
Table 2. Recall that the dependent variable in this case is F orF ragi,p . Referencing the fully
specified model reported in Column IV, we see from the estimated coefficient on the university
dummy that university patents in Period 1 are more fragmented than their private sector
counterparts, even after controlling for the importance, generality, and technology field of the
invention. We refer to this difference – the degree to which knowledge flows from patented
university inventions are more widely distributed across assignees than those of firms – as
the university diffusion premium.
       Turning to the coefficient on the interaction between the university dummy and the Period
2 dummy (ERA), we see that the university diffusion premium is significantly diminished by
the second period. In fact, by comparing the magnitudes of this coefficient with the coefficient
on the university dummy (with no interaction), we see that the university diffusion premium
measured in Period 1 is reduced by approximately 74% by Period 2. By comparison, other
characteristics of university patents, such as their tendency to be more general than firm
patents, remain virtually unchanged over this period.
       This is our main result with respect to the increasing concentration of knowledge outflows
from university patents. We check for robustness in a number of ways. First, we show that
the result holds in various specifications of Equation 1, which are also reported in Panel A
of Table 2. We also confirm that the result holds using different procedures for handling
unassigned patents.39 Furthermore, the result holds when we use finer technology class fixed
effects based on the USPTO three-digit classification system. Finally, due to the nature of
the dependent variable, we estimate Equation 1 using Fractional Logit rather than OLS.
  39
    Specifically, we treat all unassigned patents as if they are from the same assignee and, separately, we
drop all observations for which one or more of the citing patents is unassigned. The result is robust.

                                                    19
Again, the result holds. We discuss the details of this next.


4.2.1      Fractional Logit

Although coefficients estimated using OLS are straightforward to interpret, this regression
method may not be suitable since our dependent variable is an index that only takes values
between zero and one. However, due to its linear nature, OLS estimation can yield predictions
that are negative or greater than one. Thus, fractional logit regression, as described by Papke
and Wooldridge (1996), may be more suitable.
       To implement this estimation technique, we assume a logistic functional form for the
conditional mean of our fragmentation measure. More explicitly, we assume:

                                       exp{αo + α1 Dp + α2 ERAp + α3 Dp ERAp + Xp α4 + Xp ERAp α5 }
E[F orF ragp |Dp , ERAp , Xp ] =                                                                      .
                                     1 + exp{αo + α1 Dp + α2 ERAp + α3 Dp ERAp + Xp α4 + Xp ERAp α5 }

Given this assumption, the parameters are estimated by quasi-maximum likelihood estima-
tion, where the quasi-log likelihood, lp , for a given observation p is:

                    (                                                                                    )
                          exp{αo + α1 Dp + α2 ERAp + α3 Dp ERAp + Xp α4 + Xp ERAp α5 }
  lp = F ragp log
                        1 + exp{αo + α1 Dp + α2 ERAp + α3 Dp ERAp + Xp α4 + Xp ERAp α5 }

                    (                                                                                        )
                            exp{αo + α1 Dp + α2 ERAp + α3 Dp ERAp + Xp α4 + Xp ERAp α5 }
+(1−F ragp ) log 1−                                                                        .
                          1 + exp{αo + α1 Dp + α2 ERAp + α3 Dp ERAp + Xp α4 + Xp ERAp α5 }

Using this procedure yields estimates that must take values within the unit interval.
       Panel B in Table 2 provides the marginal effects of each variable specified in Equation 1
based on coefficients estimated with fractional logit regressions.40 Evaluated at the sample
mean, the marginal effect of each variable is very close in magnitude and significance to the
  40
    It is important to note that the marginal effects are not simply given by the coefficients estimated in our
fractional logit regressions. Since we assume a non-linear functional form for the conditional mean of the
dependant variable, we calculate the marginal effects as suggested by Ai and Norton (2003). Furthermore,
to remain consistent with the exposition of the OLS estimates, the estimated marginal effects of variables
not interacted with the ERAp variable show the marginal effects these variables had on fragmentation in
Period 1. The marginal effect of interacted variables show the change in the marginal effect from Period 1
to Period 2.

4.2.2      Experience and Dispersion of Knowledge Outflows

The rapid rise in university patenting that occurred during the 1980s reflects significant
change in the overall landscape with respect to academia’s approach to the management
of intellectual property. During this period, many universities that did not have a formal
technology transfer office established one and created standardized procedures for managing
the disclosure, patenting, and licensing process (Mowery et al. (2004)). In addition, much of
the increase in patent activity came from “inexperienced” institutions that had been issued
few patents prior to 1980.
       The increasing role of these inexperienced institutions in university patenting influenced
the overall character of the “average” university patent. Indeed, the decrease in importance
and generality of university patents over time identified by Henderson et al. (1998) was shown
by Mowery et al. (2004) to be due to the entry of inexperienced schools. The implication of
the Mowery et al. finding is very important; since the measured decrease in importance and
generality was due to the entry of inexperienced universities, the effect was likely temporary
while these schools learned to manage their intellectual property to become more like their
experienced counterparts.
       Since our study is similar in spirit to these papers, it is incumbent upon us to also check
whether our effect is a result of entry by inexperienced universities. To accomplish this we
categorize our university patents in a similar way to Mowery et al. We divide universities
into two categories based on their patenting experience prior to 1981. We define: (1) High
Experience Universities as those universities obtaining at least 10 patents that were applied
for after 1970 but before 1981, and (2) Low Experience Universities as those universities that
obtained less than 10 patents that were applied for during the same period.42 Based on this
  41
    Similar results follow when we use double-sided tobit regressions.
  42
    Though our categorization of universities is similar to Mowery et al. (2004), it is not identical. Specifically,
we do not distinguish between the less experienced institutions. Whereas Mowery et al. delineates between
universities with moderate experience (universities that obtained between one to nine patents that were


                                                        21
categorization, experienced universities account for 87% (984) and 72% (1948) of the focal
university patents in Periods 1 and 2, respectively.
    To examine the effects of experience on knowledge outflows, we run essentially the same
regressions as in Table 2. The only difference is that we now break apart the university effect
according to the level of university experience. We do this by using two university dummy
variables that differentiate between universities according to the categories of experience
described above.
    The regression results in Table 3 show that the reduction in the breadth of knowledge
from university patents estimated in the prior section is not driven only by the entry of
inexperienced universities. In fact, the coefficient on the interaction dummy (High experience
university * ERA) is highly significant. This result suggests that the issue of interest, an
increase in the concentration of knowledge flows associated with university patents, is at least
partly driven by experienced universities implying that, unlike the decline in importance and
generality, this is not likely a temporary phenomenon.


4.3     Regression Analysis: Diversity of Knowledge Inflows

We turn next to examine the concentration of knowledge inflows. Although the economic
forces affecting the concentration of inflows are different from those affecting that of outflows,
as we described in the introduction, the econometric approach to identifying changes in
concentration is much the same.
    We report the estimated coefficients of Equation 1 for the knowledge inflows sample in
Table 4. Recall that the dependent variable in this case is BackF ragi,p . Referencing the
fully specified model reported in Column IV, we see from the estimated coefficient on the
university dummy that university patents in Period 1 are more fragmented than their private
applied for after 1970 but before 1981) and universities without experience (universities with zero patents
applied for during this time), we group these two categories into one. Also, our categorization differs slightly
for two measurement reasons: (1) we only consider those patents that made at least two citations while
Mowery et al. considers all university patents; and (2) we include patents applied for by the University of
California, Stanford University and Columbia University while Mowery et al. excludes these universities.



                                                      22
sector counterparts, even after controlling for the originality, technology field, and overall
number of citations made. We refer to this difference – the degree to which knowledge inflows
used to develop patented university inventions are drawn from a less concentrated set of prior
art holders than those used by firms – as the university diversity premium.
      Turning to the coefficient on the interaction between the university dummy and the Period
2 dummy (ERA), we see that the university diversity premium is significantly diminished by
the second period. In fact, by comparing the magnitudes of this coefficient with the coefficient
on the university dummy (with no interaction), we see that the university diversity premium
measured in Period 1 is reduced by approximately 67% by Period 2. By comparison, another
characteristic of university patents, their tendency to be more original than firm patents,
does not diminish but rather is further amplified over this period.
      This is our main result with respect to the increasing concentration of knowledge inflows.
As before, we check for robustness in a number of ways. First, we show that the result
holds in various specifications of Equation 1, which are also reported in Panel A of Table
4. In addition, we estimate Equation 1 using Fractional Logit rather than OLS. The results
presented in Panel B are very similar to those generated by OLS.43 We also confirm that
the finding holds using the different procedures for handling unassigned patents described
above. Furthermore, the result holds when we use finer technology class fixed effects based
on the USPTO three-digit classification system.


4.3.1      Experience and the Dispersion of Knowledge Inflows

For the reasons outlined in Section 4.2.2 above, we must check whether the decline in the
university diversity premium measured here is the result of entry by institutions that were less
experienced at managing intellectual property. Recall that this issue is important since if the
decline is due to the entry of inexperienced universities, the effect is likely temporary while
these schools learn to manage their intellectual property like their experienced counterparts.
 43
      Similar results follow when we use double-sided tobit regressions.



                                                      23
   As before, we define the universities in our data as either high or low experience. Based
on this categorization, experienced universities account for 81% (982) and 61% (2694) of the
focal university patents in Periods 1 and 2, respectively.
   To examine the effects of experience on knowledge inflows, we run essentially the same
regressions as in Table 4. The only difference is that we again break apart the university
effect according to the level of university experience. We do this by using two university
dummy variables that differentiate between high and low experienced universities.
   The regression results in Table 5 show that the reduction in diversity of knowledge sources
used in developing patented university inventions estimated in Section 4.3 is not driven only
by the entry of inexperienced universities. In fact, the coefficient on the interaction dummy
(High Experience university * ERA) is highly significant. While the negative value of the
interaction coefficient is slightly greater for inexperienced universities in terms of magnitude,
it is not significant at the 10% level, whereas the coefficient on the interaction term for
experienced universities is significant at the 5% level. Most importantly though, this result
suggests that the issue of interest, an increase in the concentration of knowledge flows into
university patents, is at least partly driven by experienced universities, suggesting that this
is not likely a temporary phenomenon.


4.4    Interpretation of Fragmentation Index Values

The meaning of the fragmentation index, the basis of our dependent variables, can be difficult
to comprehend. Similar to the Herfindahl index, which, although often used in market
concentration studies is usually accompanied by more intuitive “four firm concentration
ratios,” the fragmentation index is complex. This is because many states of the world (e.g.,
combinations of citation frequencies and assignee distributions) can generate similar values.
Although the index is complicated, however, it is important to understand. Throughout most
of the discussion so far, we have described changes in university knowledge flow concentration
in relative terms. In other words, we have discussed the change in the university premium


                                               24
rather than the absolute change in the concentration of university knowledge flows. While the
relative change in concentration between periods seems large (> 50%), the absolute change
seems small (< 3%). Ultimately, we are interested in whether the change is economically
important. To this end, we offer three distinct ways of interpreting the fragmentation index
to help the reader develop intuition for comprehending the economic significance of the
estimated changes in knowledge flow concentrations.


4.4.1   Distribution of Assignees across a Single Patent

Consider a patent that receives eight citations, roughly the mean number of citations re-
ceived by focal patents in our sample. Further, suppose these citations are from five different
assignees. If three different assignees each cite the patent twice while the remaining two as-
signees only cite the patent once, then the fragmentation measure equals 0.89.44 To increase
the fragmentation measure by 0.04 (approximately the value of the coefficient on the univer-
sity dummy) while holding constant the total number of citations, one additional assignee
would have to cite the patent (now six unique assignees, rather than five). In this case, two
assignees would each cite the patent twice while four would each cite the patent once. With
this distribution, the fragmentation would increase to about 0.93.45


4.4.2   Distribution of Average versus Perfectly Concentrated Patents

Suppose there are two periods in which university patents are issued: Period 1 and Period
2. Further suppose that all Period 1 patents are average in terms of concentration (i.e., they
have the average fragmentation value). However, in Period 2, patents are either average or
perfectly concentrated (i.e., f ragmentation = 0). To develop intuition for interpreting the
meaning of our estimated coefficients, we calculate what fraction of patents must be perfectly
concentrated in order to obtain the observed drop in the average fragmentation value from
Period 1 to Period 2.
                                  2
                         2

    F orF ragp = {1 −   64   − 3 282 } 8−1

                                           ' 0.89

 45                      4       2      8
    F orF ragp = {1 −   64   − 2 82 } 8−1 ' 0.93


                                                    25
     Specifically, we use the fractional logit procedure to estimate the relationship between a
patent’s fragmentation, f ragp , and the same patent’s characteristics, (ERAp , Xp ):


                            f ragp = F (αo + α1 ERAp + Xp β) + εp .


Note that, for simplicity, no variable is interacted with the period effect, ERAp , as was done
in the specifications reported earlier. Here we assume the relationship between all control
variables and f ragp does not change over time.
     To estimate the absolute decrease in fragmentation, ∆, we find the estimated marginal
effect of ERAp . Since ERAp is a dummy variable that equals one for any patent, p, in Period
2 and zero otherwise, the marginal effect is given by:


                             ∆ = F (α̂o + α̂1 + X β̂) − F (α̂o + X β̂).


∆ is calculated at the sample mean, X, to remain consistent with the estimated marginal
effects found in the main tables above.
     Finally, since patents in Period 2 can only have a fragmentation value equal to F (α̂+ β̂X)
(the “average” level of fragmentation in the Period 1) and zero (perfectly concentrated flows),
we need to determine the number of patents, Y , out of a total of T patents in Period
2 that must have perfectly concentrated knowledge flows to cause the change in average
fragmentation, ∆. That is, we solve:

                       (T − Y )F (α̂o + X β̂) + (Y )0
                                                      − F (α̂o + X β̂) = ∆,
                                     T

or
                                      Y          ∆
                                        =−                .
                                      T    F (α̂o + X β̂)

Recalling that in Period 1 all university patents have fragmentation equal to F (α̂o + X β̂)
implies that the propensity of patents with perfectly concentrated knowledge flows increased

                                                26
            Y
from 0 to   T
                .
     Thus, from Table 6 we see that our estimated changes imply the following. For the
knowledge outflows case, if there are 100 patents in Period 1 that all have the average level of
fragmentation, in Period 2 approximately 96 will still have the average level of fragmentation,
while four will be perfectly concentrated (i.e., all citations come from a single assignee).
For the knowledge inflows case, only one patent will be perfectly concentrated. Clearly,
the estimated changes in concentration are likely not the result of perfect concentration
(i.e., rather than 4% of the focal patents being perfectly concentrated, a larger percentage
might be moderately more concentrated than average) but this simple dichotomy allows for
developing intuition regarding the economic implications of our findings.


4.4.3     Distribution of Average Firm versus Perfectly Fragmented Patents

In our final illustrative example, we compare university patents to those of firms. Suppose
all firm patents have the same level of fragmentation, F rag f . Suppose also that university
patents can take two values of fragmentation, either F rag f or one (the latter case implies
perfect fragmentation such that all citations come from unique assignees). Our data indicate
that the average fragmentation of university patents, F rag u , is greater than that of firm
patents such that f rag u = f rag f + ∆ where ∆ > 0.
     In this example, we ask, given the assumptions described above, what must the distribu-
tion of university fragmentation be (i.e., proportion where fragmentation is F rag f versus 1)
to generate an average level of fragmentation that is ∆ greater than that of firm patents?
We address this with a simple exercise.
     Randomly draw T university patents. Let Y be the number of these T patents with
fragmentation equal to 1 and consequently T-Y is the number of patents with fragmentation
equal to F rag f . Thus, we want to know: What fraction of the university patent sample (i.e.,
Y
T
    ) must have a fragmentation equal to one such that the average university fragmentation
                                                                             Y
is greater than the average firm fragmentation by ∆. That is, what does      T
                                                                                 have to be such


                                              27
that
                                       Y + (T − Y )F rag f
                           F rag u =                       = F rag f + ∆?
                                               T

The solution is:
                                           Y       ∆
                                             =             .
                                           T   1 − F rag f

       Given our estimates of the coefficients on the university dummy variables and the sample
fragmentation means for firm patents, we find the following for knowledge outflows (i.e.,
forward fragmentation). Initially, in Period 1, university fragmentation is greater by about
0.027 (the estimated value of the university dummy variable in Table 2 Column (VIII)) and
the sample mean of firm fragmentation is 0.879 (i.e., the sample mean of firm patents in
Period 1, shown in Table 1). This implies that 22 out of 100 university patents are perfectly
fragmented in Period 1 compared to only six in Period 2.46
       For knowledge inflows, we use the estimated initial fragmentation difference between firm
and university patents, which is 0.02 (the estimated value of the university dummy variable
in Table 4 Column (VIII)) and the sample mean of firm fragmentation of 0.903 (the sample
mean of firm patents in Period 1 shown in Table 1). Using these values, we calculate that
approximately 21 out of 100 university patents are perfectly fragmented in Period 1 compared
to only seven in Period 2.47



5        Conclusion

The dramatic rise in the level of university patenting that occurred during the 1980s has
been examined along a variety of dimensions. Ours is the first study to our knowledge that
has sought to determine whether the increasing trend towards formal intellectual property
protection has restricted the breadth of knowledge flows. Our findings suggest that it has.
  46
    In Period 2, the difference in university-firm fragmentation is 0.027-0.019=0.008 and the firm sample
mean is 0.867.
 47
    In Period 2, the difference in university-firm fragmentation is 0.020-0.014=0.006 and the firm sample
mean is 0.908.



                                                   28
However, although the magnitude of the increase in concentration of university knowledge
flows is large relative to firms, the absolute changes are modest. Also important is that
the changes are at least partly driven by universities that were experienced at patenting,
suggesting that the identified effect is likely not temporary.
   What are the broader implications of these findings? There could be many explanations
and we are cautious about pushing too hard on any one interpretation of our results. How-
ever, we close by drawing on the literature to speculate about some potential causes to offer
context for our findings.
   In terms of knowledge outflows, our results suggest that not only might behaviors associ-
ated with patenting limit the level of dissemination of knowledge flows as shown by Murray
and Stern (2005), these behaviors might also limit the breadth of dissemination. In the
university setting, this could occur at either or both of two levels: the technology licensing
office and/or the inventor.
   To the extent technology licensing offices shift their objective function from dissemination-
maximization (leading to predominantly non-exclusive, widely licensed patents) to profit-
maximization (leading to predominantly narrowly licensed patents), we would observe a
decrease in forward fragmentation, consistent with our findings. It seems plausible that such
a shift could occur given that performance metrics for the latter are much easier to measure.
   One could also imagine how plausible changes in inventor behavior could result in the
findings reported here. Due to the early stage nature of most university inventions, the trans-
fer of tacit knowledge is particularly important for commercial development (likely leading
to the creation of follow-on inventions that also will be patented and may cite the original
patent). Such tacit knowledge is often most efficiently transferred through direct interaction
with the inventor (Jensen and Thursby (2001); Agrawal (2006)). To the extent that inventors
become more commercially oriented regarding the management of their intellectual property,
and the findings of Lach and Schankerman (2005) suggest this is not unlikely, their tendency
to share tacit knowledge with others who are not licensees may diminish.


                                              29
   Alternatively, a shift in inventor research behavior, rather than dissemination behavior,
could also generate our findings. To the extent that faculty change the nature of their
research such that the resultant inventions are only applicable to a more narrow range of
subsequent users, this could explain our findings. However, it is important to recall that we
employ technology field fixed effects such that our results are not driven by changes from,
say, chemistry to biotechnology where the set of potential knowledge users might be more
concentrated. Furthermore, we control for generality such that our results are not driven by
a change in research projects towards less general inventions that are therefore applicable
to a smaller set of firms. Thus, only a particular type of change in research behavior, that
results in inventions that are within the same field and equally general but for other reasons
are only applicable to a more concentrated set of users, would cause the phenomenon we
identify.
   In terms of knowledge inflows, our results suggest that the breadth of assignees that
inventors draw upon in developing their own inventions diminished over time. Although it
is difficult to imagine how this could be a direct result of changes in behavior by technology
licensing offices, an explanation based on changes in inventor behavior is reasonably straight-
forward. If inventors become more commercially oriented and savvy over time, they may
increasingly look forward and anticipate that, to the extent that future licensees are exposed
to anti-commons problems associated with access to complementary inventions, the value of
their inventions will be diminished. As such, inventors reason back and plan their research
program in a manner that minimizes anti-commons exposure by reducing the breadth of
prior art citations. This seems reasonable given that university researchers have been shown
to respond to economic incentives (Lach and Schankerman (2005)).
   It is important to note that although it is tempting to assume that higher concentrations
of knowledge inflows and particularly outflows are welfare reducing, this is not necessarily
true. Knowing that knowledge spillovers contribute to economic growth (Romer (1986);
Romer (1990)) but also recognizing the importance of exclusivity for creating incentives to


                                              30
develop and commercialize, it is unclear how increased concentration of university knowledge
flows affects welfare. What is clear, however, is that what we learn from further study of
this topic will offer important insight for science policy and economic growth.
