                                          ABSTRACT

How much of China's recent economic performance can be attributed to market-oriented reforms

introduced in the last two decades? A long-run perspective may be important for understanding the

process of economic development occurring today. This paper compares the integration of rice

markets in China today and 270 years ago. In the 18th century, transport technology was non-

mechanized, but markets were close to being free markets. We distinguish local harvest and weather

from aggregate sources of price variation in a historical sample and in a similarly constructed

contemporary sample. Findings indicate the degree of market integration in the 1720s is a very good

predictor of per capita income in the 1990s. Moreover, the current pattern of interregional income

in China is strongly linked to persistent geographic factors that were already apparent several

centuries ago, well before the enactment of modern reform programs.

1. Introduction

    Studies of economic growth in China generally begin their discussion with 1978, the

year when contemporary reforms began, and circumscribe the analysis to the years since

the mid-1980s, when data are more available. A longer-term perspective, however, may

be important for understanding the process of economic development. In the case of

Europe, there is now suggestive evidence that market integration and trade led to growth

effects that took decades if not centuries to materialize (O’Rourke and Williamson 2004,

Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson 2002). This paper fills the gap by taking a longer

view on China. We examine market integration and trade in a sample of twelve Chinese

provinces, home to about 17% of the world population, over almost three centuries (the

years 1723 to 1993).4 Our point of departure is that assessments of China’s reforms need

to take into account differences across provinces that were already present before reforms

began. Failure to do so would tend to lead to overestimates of the impact of reform.

    This paper asks how market integration and trade for these economies have changed

by distinguishing local from aggregate sources of price variation, an approach that has

been widely adopted in economic history, development, as well as international

economics (Clark 2002, Crucini 1999). Our findings indicate that in the late 20th century,

although the law of one price does not hold, local and national prices essentially move

one to one. Compared to historical levels of market integration, contemporary markets

are more integrated. But we also find a significant degree of market integration for

distances up to about 700 kilometers in China in the early 18th century. Moreover, the

degree of market integration in the 1720s is a very good predictor of per capita income in

4
 In 1993, these 12 provinces had a population of about 0.7 billion, which, given a world population of 5.4
billion, gives a share of 13%. In the mid 18th century, these provinces had a population of about 200
million, which according to the best estimates we have amounted to about 20% of the world population.


                                                    2
the 1990s. This suggests that income differences across provinces today can to some

extent traced back for at least three centuries.

    This paper contributes to recent research in a number of areas. First of all, our

analysis is related to the large literature on the impact of international trade on growth

(Coe and Helpman 1995, Dinopoulos and Segerstrom 2003, Frankel and Romer 1999,

Keller 1998, Xu and Wang 2001). Our analysis differs in that instead of international

trade we focus on trade within China’s borders.5 We also provide some important

historical background to research of economic reform and regional growth in China (see

Young 2000 for a good introduction). In addition, this paper contributes to what is known

on pre-industrial China, important because it may give clues on why China grew so much

slower than Western Europe and North America from about 1750 to 1950 (Pomeranz

2000, Shiue 2002, Shiue and Keller 2003). What is different here is that our analysis

spans from the pre-industrialization to the modern era. Finally, if markets themselves are

viewed as economic institutions—a view that we are inclined to take—our analysis

mirrors the new emphasis on the importance of institutions for growth (Acemoglu,

Johnson, and Robinson 2001, Banerjee and Iyer 2002).

    The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces our empirical approach. We

highlight major characteristics of the data in the following section. All empirical results

are contained in section 4, while section 5 provides a concluding discussion.

  Such trade can be quite important. In fact, Irwin argues that for the period of 1500-2000, intra-continental
trade--such as trade within Europe or similar-sized China--was quantitatively more important than inter-
continental trade, which economists have studied more intensively so far (Irwin 2003, 63).


                                                      3
2.        Approach

      We want to distinguish local from global shocks that influence local prices.

Conditional on demand, if markets are fully integrated only global supply shocks

determine how prices move in all regions. This is because even if there are region-

specific supply shocks, the regions can achieve full risk sharing through trade (high-

output regions export, low-output regions import). By contrast, the existence of trade

barriers will give rise to a partial segmentation of markets. In this case local supply

shocks will play a role in determining local price movements. Thus, in a regression

framework, the local price Pit may be determined by both local (L) and national (N)

factors

(1)       Pit = α + β L Lit + β N N t + ε it

where i indexes province, i = 1,…,I, and t indicates time t = 1,…,T. 6

          We do not have data on the provinces’ supplies for our entire sample period.

Instead, we use the aggregate price as our measure of global supply, defined as

                         I
(2)       Pit =         ∑s
                  i ≠ j , j =1
                                   ij   Pjt , ∀ i, t,


where sij denotes the size of province j in the computation of the aggregate price for


                  ∑s
                    I

province i (                  ij
                                   = 1, ∀i ).7
               i ≠ j , j =1




          We have two types of measures of the local conditions: the first is local weather


6
  Our analysis abstracts from international trade, because it was largely prohibited and hardly existed in the
case of China in the early 18th century. In the late 20th century, China’s international trade plays a greater
role; see, e.g., Dinopoulos and Segerstrom (2003) who study the effects of China’s accession to the World
Trade Organization.
7
  We exclude the price in province i in the computation of the aggregate price in order to avoid a built-in
correlation between the dependent and an independent variable in equation (1). This definition of Pit
implies that the “national” conditions vary by province.


                                                        4
(denoted w). Weather, and more generally, climatic conditions, have an important effect

on agricultural production. The second local variable is a measure of the harvest quality

relative to what is normal in that province (denoted by h); this captures a number of

unobserved factors that influence rice output in addition to weather, including technology

shocks. All else equal, favorable local weather and a high local harvest quality will lower

the local relative to the national price as long as there is no perfect arbitrage across

provinces.

         The definition of the aggregate price in equation (2) implicitly assumes that

conditional on size differences, all provinces are equally important in determining the

aggregate price. This may be plausible if indeed trade barriers are close to zero, but not if

they are still significant. Even in the United States today, for example, prices in New

York matter often more for Connecticut prices than those prevailing in California, and

based on direct evidence from historical sources on grain trade in early 18th century

China, we know that trade barriers limited trading possibilities over long distances.

         The bilateral unit trade costs between provinces i and j can be expected to rise

with geographic distance between i and j (denoted d ij).8 Thus, the national market

condition from the point of view of province i might be determined by only a subset of

other provinces, especially those for which the price difference ( Pi − Pj ) is less than the

unit transports from i to j. If we denote this as the effective aggregate price, it may for

province i be written as




8
  In 18th century China, the size of the per diem ration of rice determined the distance over which grain
trade through porters was feasible. In today’s economies, distance often determines shipping times and
hence transport costs; see e.g. Hummels (1999). In addition, there are distance-invariant trade costs, such as
those related to loading and unloading.


                                                      5

         Pit =     ∑ s ψ (d               ) Pjt , ∀ i, t,

                 i ≠ j , j =1



where the function ψ (d ij ) captures this dependence on distance. A particularly simple

version of this function that we will employ below is an indicator function, returning the

value 1 if dij is less than some threshold level, and 0 otherwise.

         To summarize, we will employ regressions of the following form:

         pit = β 0 + β zit + β1 pit + β 2 wit + β 3 hit + ε it ,
                                               e
(4)

where the z’s are control variables, pit = ln Pit , analogously, pit e = ln Pit e , and ε it is

assumed to be a mean-zero error term.



      3. Data

         The sample consists of twelve Chinese provinces. These are Anhwei, Fujian,

Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Yunnan, and

Zhejiang; they are contiguous and are located in the central and southern part of China,

see Figure 1. 9 The maximum distance between the capitals of any two provinces is almost

1,800 kilometers (km). We focus on rice, the most important agricultural crop in China.

Therefore this study does not cover the Northern provinces and the metropolitan area

around the capital of Beijing (Zhili province), because the climate of the North was not

suited to rice farming as the South’s was, and rice prices were thus less frequently

recorded.




9
  Figure 1 shows a late 20th century map of China. The provincial boundaries in the early 18th were similar
to the 20th century boundaries, with small exceptions such as Shanghai, which was a part of Jiangsu and is
now independent. Our analysis takes this into account.


                                                            6
       Our sample period consists of two sets of years, one in the 18th and one in the 20th

century. The 18th century period covers the years 1723 to 1735. The price data we

employ is on the prevailing market price in the provincial capital. The original source of

these data is the Yongcheng zhupi yuzhi (Vermillion endorsements and palace memorials

of the Yongzheng period). Yongzheng (1723-35) succeeded to the throne upon the death

of his father Kangxi (reign 1662-1722), and was the third of ten emperors who ruled

during the Qing dynasty (1644-1911). Important procedures, originating with Kangxi, of

what was to become a routine reporting system that transmitted data on prices, harvests,

and weather reports from locations throughout the empire to the capital in Beijing were

developed and expanded upon during Yongzheng’s rule.

       The creation of the price reports began at the county level, where details on crops,

harvest predictions, weather, and prevailing prices from the local county market were

compiled every ten to 30 days. County officials sent their reports to the next higher

authorities, the prefectural level, where the price reports were summarized and sent to the

provincial governors. A detailed summary of all these reports was used by the provincial

governor to prepare his report (memorial) to the emperor on the conditions in the

province.

       The Qing emperors’ interest in price and harvest conditions across the empire can

in part be explained with general concerns about the legitimacy of governance from a

political and economic point of view, since a severe weather shock could result in food

crises and instability. Thus, the grain price report system served as an early warning

system for potential problem areas. More importantly, the system of audits and checks

on the regular reports, the standardization of the form and content in the reports, and the




                                             7
very practical functions of price information for official purchases of grain, also suggest

that the information contained in the reports are useful and valid.10 Chuan and Kraus

(1975) report prices at a monthly frequency, albeit not for all provinces and all years. We

have aggregated the data to an annual level, which is the same frequency as the data we

have for these provinces in the late 20th century (see below).

         Table 1 provides an overview of the data. The average of all prices is about 1.2

the period 1723-35 (on the left), with the by-province mean varying from about 1 in

Guizhou to about 1.5 in Zhejiang. 11 Prices are reported in units of taels (silver ounces)

per shi of rice, where one shi equals about 103.8 liters. The local prices are used to

compute aggregate prices. We obtain the relative size of the provinces in this sample

using fiscal land acreage (Wang 1973), shown in Table 1, at the bottom. 12 Summary

statistics on the aggregate price variable are shown in column two of Table 1.

         Historical records on harvest for a large geographical area are often scarce or non-

existent. 13 In the case of China, however, some records on harvest quality exist and are

available to us.14 Often the only information available is an overall assessment of harvest

quality for the province as a whole, and there is one value for each harvest cycle. 15

Harvests are not reported in terms of absolute levels of output, but as a percentage of


10
   Chinese records on grain prices date to as early as the Tang Dynasty (618-906). For more details on the
origin, functions, purposes, and reliability of the grain price reporting system in the Qing Dynasty, see
Wilkinson (1969), Wang (1987), Wang (1989), Chuan and Kraus (1975).
11
   The number of observations varies across provinces, with a total of 112 observations.
12
   These 12 values s i give rise to 132 s ij when we drop the own weight (sii=0, for all i), and rescale so that
the sum over all j is equal to 1, for all i.
13
   For most European nations, for example, price fluctuations are the only evidence for harvest quality that
we have; Persson, (1999). An exception is Clark (2002), who uses harvest records from medieval England.
14
   See Chuan and Kraus (1975), and also Gong and Zhang (1983).
15
   Typically, there is one harvest cycle per year. In five of the twelve provinces, however, it was possible to
harvest twice per year (Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang). If information on both
harvests is available, our annual harvest measure is the average of the two for these provinces. All dates
have been converted from the original lunar system of dating to the solar calendar. See Chuan and Kraus
(1975) for details on the timing of harvests, especially p. 99, and pp. 119-166.


                                                       8
maximal output (100 percent) that could be expected in that province. It is plausible to

view these percentages as an indicator of harvest quality. Harvest quality ranges from

50% (‘poor harvest’) to 100% (‘excellent harvest’) in the data, and are typically reported

by ten-percentage point gradations. 16 Table 1 shows summary statistics on harvest quality

in column 3.

         Our source for historical weather data are the weather maps in the State

Meteorological Administration (1981). This gives weather data throughout China for

each year for 120 ''stations'', where about five such stations are located in each province.

We use the data for the station in the provincial capital. This is a discrete indicator of the

degree of ''wetness and aridity'', from floods, droughts, monsoons, or rainfall, relative to

what is considered normal for that region (denoted by R it). Bad weather ranks are 1 and 5

(severe drought and flood), fair weather ranks are 2 and 4 (limited drought and floods),

and good weather is rank 3 (favorable conditions). Our weather variable is defined as

wit = Rit − 3 , so that higher values of w it indicate worse weather (wit takes on the values

0, 1, and 2). Summary statistics on this variable are shown in Table 1, column 4.

         We can be comparatively brief in describing the data for our 20th century period,

as this data is better known and also has been carefully analyzed recently in a paper by

Alwyn Young (Young 2000). 17 Our sample period is 1986-93, for which we have annual

data on the price of rice purchased by commercial establishments in the 12 provinces.18


16
   A 70% harvest is typically recorded as ‘fair’, while 80% and 90% harvest are ‘fair/good’ and ‘good’,
respectively.
17
   We thank A. Young for posting this data at his website; all the data described in the following comes
from this source. The original sources of Young’s data are public, including Province Statistical Yearbooks,
China Statistical Yearbooks, and China Price Statistics Yearbooks. For more details on the nature and
original sources of the data, we direct the reader to Young’s (2000) paper.
18
   We prefer this series to the also available (and sometimes longer) retail price series, because in the case
of rice the retail prices appear to be influenced more strongly by subsidies that vary across provinces and
over time. The exact product description is long-grained nonglutinous rice (Indica rice).


                                                      9
Summary statistics on this variable are given in Table 1, column 5; the prices are quoted

in yuan per 100 kilogram. As our measure of province size, we use the total grain sown

areas in each province, averaged in the years 1980 and 1985. From that we compute

shares for the 12 provinces in our sample, shown in Table 1, at the bottom. Summary

statistics of the aggregate prices based on that are presented in column 6.

         We have constructed our measure of harvest quality as the residual from a

regression of output on labor and capital in agriculture. This is not only a measure of

harvest quality, but as long as other shocks (demand, productivity) are not perfectly

correlated with weather shocks, the residual should be correlated with differences in

harvest quality. 19 Summary statistics for this are shown in column 7 of Table 1. The

weather data is monthly average rainfall in a year, measured in centimeters, and the

weather variability measure is the coefficient of variation of rainfall across months in a

given province. Summary statistics on these variables are shown in Table 1, columns 8

and 9, respectively.

         To incorporate the geographic dimension in this sample of Chinese provinces, we

use the bilateral distances between provinces (measured as the distance between

provincial capitals). These figures are reported in Table 2. Finally, the GDP and

population figures we employ below to compute income per capita are taken from

provincial statistical yearbooks (source: Young 2000).

         The next section discusses the empirical results.




19
  The regression of log agricultural output on log labor (employment in primary sector), log capital (power
of agricultural machinery, in kilowatt), and provincial fixed effects results in an R2 of about 0.98; we
include the fixed effects t o obtain a harvest measure relative to what is normal in the province, the measure
we have for the 18th century period.


                                                     10
     4. Empirical results

     4.1 Market integration in the late 20th century and early 18th century

     The results for the period 1986 to 1993 are presented in Table 3. These are variants of

equation (4) in which the function ψ (d ij ) is set to one for now. In specification (1), the

aggregate price effect enters with a coefficient of 0.966 and accounts for about three

quarters of the variation in local prices ( R 2 of 0.756). This suggests that aggregate rice

price movements are quite important. 20

     The weather variable does not enter significantly (see (2)). It may be that this

relationship is non-linear; including additional higher order terms in the regression

though does not change the finding. However, according to (3) if both rainfall and its

variability are considered simultaneously, this is associated with higher prices, all else

equal. In contrast, the quality of the local harvest has no impact on the local price

(specification (4)). Including any of these additional variables has almost no impact on

the coefficient of the aggregate price, which remains around 0.97.

     In the remaining three specifications, we include fixed effects for the 12 provinces.

This serves as a control for time-invariant province-specific unobserved heterogeneity

that might affect price, such as differences in taste. It comes at the cost of giving up any

between-province price variation. The main consequence is that there is no significant

relation between weather variability and local price anymore. The harvest variable enters

with the expected sign (negative) but remains insignificant.



20
   A common trend might explain part of this finding. We do not have long enough time series to study this
formally, but we have experimented with including a trend. It is typically not significant and does not
change our qualitative findings. For example, in (1) the coefficient on the trend is 0.010 (s.e. 0.011), while
the coefficient for the aggregate price term is 0.877 (s.e. 0.106). For a more extensive treatment of common
trends and cointegration in price series, see Shiue and Keller (2003).


                                                     11
   What about economic magnitudes? In specification (3), a 10% increase in local

rainfall and rainfall variability is associated with about a 0.8% and 0.9%, respectively,

higher local price, and most of this effect appears to be province-specific (the weather

variable turns insignificant when province fixed effects are included). The coefficient of

0.972 on aggregate price means that a 10% increase in the aggregate price of rice

(excluding province i) is associated with a price increase of 9.72% in province i, on

average. Given the standard error, one cannot reject the null hypothesis that, on average,

local and aggregate prices move one for one. For the modern sample period then, the

source of local price movements seems to be mainly aggregate shocks.

   Overall, this is evidence for a well-integrated grain market. At the same time, this

does not mean that there is perfect integration, or that there could not be a reversal of

integration. In specification (7), we allow the aggregate price effect to vary between

1986-89 and 1990-93. Although the estimates do not differ significantly, a somewhat

higher effect is estimated for the earlier compared to the later period. The result confirms

Young’s (2000) finding that there has not been an unambiguously positive trend towards

better market integration in China over the late 1980s and 1990s. As more data becomes

available, it will be possible to see whether the early 1990s were a temporary blip or a

major turning point. Here, we want to go into the other direction, time-wise, and examine

rice markets in the same provinces about 270 years earlier.



   The results for the years 1723 to 1735 are shown in Table 4. In specification (1), the

aggregate price coefficient is positive, as before. However, first, the point estimate now is

0.530, as opposed to 0.966 in the 1980/90s. Even though the estimate of 0.530 is not very




                                             12
precise, one can reject the null hypothesis that it is equal to one at standard levels (the

95% confidence interval is [0.192, 0.868]). Second, the aggregate price accounts for only

about six percent of the variation in local prices, whereas before, it accounted for

seventy-five percent. In addition to greater measurement error in the earlier period, which

almost surely plays a role, this suggests that aggregate market conditions do not matter

nearly as much in the early 18th century as they do in the late 20th century.

       Consistent with this idea, we find the local weather variable entering significantly in

specification (2). The estimate suggests that price in a moderate draught or flood are on

average 5.8% higher than under normal weather conditions, with an additional 5.8% price

increase when a severe flood or draught occurs. Next, we consider the harvest quality

variable.21 The results suggest that the quality of the local harvest has a strong effect on

local prices: for a harvest improvement from the first to the third sample quartile, the

local price is predicted to fall by about 8%. 22 In addition, the aggregate price is not

significantly correlated anymore with local prices.

       The following two specifications introduce fixed effects for the provinces. Given the

lower R 2 of these regressions relative to those for the 20th century, there may be

important unobserved heterogeneity that these fixed effects can control for. The

coefficient on aggregate price in (4) is estimated to be not very different from the value of

in the comparable specification (2), without fixed effects (0.474 vs. 0.488). At the same

time, the R 2 change indicates that unobserved heterogeneity across provinces plays a

major role. When the local harvest variable is added, it is significant while aggregate

market conditions are not anymore (see (5)).

21
     This reduces the size of our sample, see Table 4.
22
     The first quartile is 78% of the harvest, the third quartile is 90%, and ( 0.90 − 0 .78) × −0.686 = −0 .082 .


                                                          13
       Overall, these findings suggest that in the late 20th century, aggregate effects are far

more important than local factors, whereas in the early 18th century the reverse is true:

local factors dominate, and aggregate conditions do not affect local prices significantly.

This indicates that a national market did not yet exist in the 18th century, 23 but something

closer to being considered a nationally integrated market exists today. For the 1720s, this

raises the question of what was the scope of China’s rice markets at the sub-national

level—over what distances do we find evidence for market integration and trade?

       To bring this sharper into focus, we introduce geographic features in the next section.



       4.2 The scope of markets in geographic space

              Table 2 shows that bilateral distances between provincial capitals in our sample

lie between 234 and 1797 km, with a median value of 760 km. In the following, we

construct aggregate price measures separately for relatively near and relatively far

provinces, based on some threshold distance, d . To this effect, we define the indicator

function I (d ij , d ) which equals one if d ij < d , and zero otherwise. Analogously, we

                                   ~
define another indicator function, I ( dij , d ) , which equals one if d ij ≥ d , and zero

otherwise; the corresponding aggregate prices are pit e , n (superscript “n” for near) and

      e, f
pit          (superscript “f” for far).24

              We then consider the following regression:

23
  The fact that long-distance, inter-provincial trade took place in the 18th and 19th centuries (see Perkins
1969, Wang 1989) is not inconsistent with there being a lack of national markets according to the measure
of integration used here.

                                                              14
(5)     pit = β 0 + β n pit e ,n + β f pit e , f + ε it ,

where β n estimates the impact of aggregate market conditions in near-by provinces,

while β f is for aggregate market conditions in provinces that are above the threshold

distance d away. A simple grid search over threshold distances gives 700 km as the

value that maximizes the fit of equation (5) for the 1723-35 period; we take d = 700 as

our threshold value. Conditional on this distance threshold, Table 5 shows estimation

results for both the 1723/35 and 1986/93 samples.

       In the early sample period, β n and β f are estimated to be 0.578 and about zero,

respectively, whereas in the later period the corresponding values are 0.618 and 0.344

(columns 1a and 1b). The changes in the degree of market integration over these 270

years can be gauged in a number of ways. First, if price in all other provinces go up by

10%, the predicted local price increase in the earlier period is 5-6%, while it is close to

the full 10% in the later period; these results confirm the earlier regressions. This move

from a correlation of local with aggregate prices from about 0.5 to close to 1 points to a

substantial increase in the degree of market integration.

       Second, for the early 18th century prices in provinces that are more than 700 km

away do not influence the effective aggregate price at all, or, to put this differently, 100%

of the aggregate price effect comes from provinces that lie within 700 km of distance. By

contrast, for the late 20th century sample provinces beyond the 700 km distance range

contribute about 1/3 of the total effect (0.344/(0.344+0.618)). Changes in market

integration seem to be in part the result of establishing market linkages over longer

distances. Third, the distinction of near versus far provinces is much more important in

the 18th than in the 20th century. This is another indication of the fact that geographic


                                                            15
distance matters much less in the later period: comparing the regression fit in Tables 3, 4,

and 5, we see that the R 2 more than doubles upon the separation of near versus far

provinces in the early period, whereas the R 2 for the later period actually falls slightly.

         The additional regression results presented in Table 5 largely confirm these

results. An exception is specification (4a): when near and far aggregate prices are

distinguished, we estimate a positive and significant aggregate price effect in the earlier

period even conditional on harvest quality. Without the near/far distinction, there was no

significant aggregate price effect (see Table 3, specification (5)). The results suggest that

local and aggregate shocks (with distance of less than 700 km) have effects of roughly

the same order of magnitude: a 10% increase in this aggregate price is associated with a

5-6% local price increase, while a 10% better harvest is associated with a 6% lower local

price, on average.25

         This modifies our earlier conclusion for the 18th century period that all variation

in local prices has local sources. We continue to find that price shocks in provinces that

are relatively far away do not matter, but price movements in markets at intermediate

distances (up to 700km) account for about half of the variation in local prices, with local

harvest shocks accounting for the other half. For the late 20th century, the findings are on

the whole unchanged, with aggregate effects playing the dominant role.

         In the following section, we examine the relationship between our measures of

market integration and income.



25
   The introduction of provincial fixed effects also reverses the relative importance of near versus far
sources of aggregate price effects (see (column 4b)). Primarily, this seems to be an artifact of prices being
positively spatially correlated; the introduction of province fixed effects tends to eliminate variation that
would otherwise suggest co-movements of prices within a relatively close distance (<700km). We thus
think it is less important. See Keller and Shiue (2003) for more on spatial correlation in this context.


                                                      16
           4.3 Market integration, trade, and income

           We now turn to the question of whether differences in market access and trade are

related to income differences across provinces. The evidence presented above suggests

that market integration and trade have increased substantially between the early 18th and

late 20th century. At the same time, we know that per capita income in these provinces

has risen as well, even if we do not have exact figures for the 18th century period. Thus,

we observe more trade at the same time when we observe higher incomes. But can we

say more than that?

           To this end, we examine whether there are differences across provinces in terms

of market access and trade at a given point in time. In our framework, this amounts to

asking whether the aggregate price is more important in explaining local price variation

in some versus in other provinces. While there is not enough data for a regression

analysis (roughly 8 observations per province in 1986/93), we can aggregate the

provinces into groups and then examine how market integration varies with income

across groups.

           For each of the 12 provinces, we compute their median GDP per capita from the

years 1986 to 1993. These values range from a high of 2,640 yuan in Jiangsu (including

Shanghai) to 770 yuan in Guizhou. We classify the 12 provinces into 3 groups with 4

provinces each, called Low-, Mid-, and High GDP per capita group, and compute for

these 3 groups our measure of market integration (median of correlation of local with

aggregate price).26

           Figure 2, on the left, shows the results. There is no major difference in terms of

market integration and trade between the ‘Mid’ and ‘High’ provinces, while there is some
26
     This is the aggregate price for distances of less than 700 km in both sample periods.


                                                       17
between the relatively poor and the other provinces (0.91 for ‘Low’, and 0.96 for ‘High’

incomes). This is consistent with relatively good market integration and trade being a

cause of relatively high income. At the same time, the differences across the regions are,

with about five percentage points, not large, at least relative to the uncertainty associated

with these estimates.

        How about the earlier period? As noted above, we do not have good measures of

provincial incomes at that time. But we can compare our measures of market integration

and trade of the period 1723-35 with the GDP per capita figures for 1986-93. This is

shown in Figure 2 on the right. The ‘Low’ income provinces of the late 20th century had

market integration values around 0.35, whereas the ‘High’ income provinces had values

around 0.68, with the ‘Mid’ group in between. The analysis above already indicated that

all early 18th century levels of market integration would lie considerably below the 20th

century values. Thus, what is new here is that market integration and trade in 1720s/30s

is a good predictor of GDP per capita in the late 20th century.

        One implication of this finding is that relying on only a relatively short time

horizon to assess the impact of market reform in China is misleading. Since the inception

of the reforms of the 1980s, it may well be that it was in the most market-oriented

provinces where per-capita income grew fasted—particularly those provinces along the

coast, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Jiangsu including Shanghai27—but it does not

follow that all the growth effects since reform can be attributed to market reform and

trade liberalization. Our analysis shows that today, richer provinces seem to enjoy higher

levels of integration and trade than poorer provinces (Figure 2, left). However, the same

27
  Indeed, our sample exhibits income divergence during the years 1986-93, in the sense that per-capita
GDP in the four ‘High’ income provinces grew faster than GDP per capita in the four ‘Low’ income
provinces.


                                                   18
provinces that are rich today had relatively high levels of market integration and trade

already about 270 years ago (Figure 2, right).

       This is not to say that market reform has no growth effects, but in the 19th and

early 20th century, China was strongly affected by war, political instability and foreign

incursion. From the end of World War II until 1978, China was a socialist planning

economy. Thus, it may well be that the 18th century is the most recent time before the

1980s during which the market played the major role as China’s allocation mechanism.

Seen along these lines, the regional income dynamics in China since 1978 could just

mean a return to the cross-province income differences that had existed in China a couple

of centuries earlier. If this is the case, it would support the idea that regional economic

disparities associated with market integration, trade, and geography are highly persistent.

It would also suggest that the impact of reform is overstated.

       The following section summarizes our results and contains additional discussion.



   5. Discussion

   This paper studies market integration and trade in China over almost three centuries.

Our findings indicate that in the late 20th century, although the law of one price does not

hold, local and national prices essentially move one to one. Compared to historical levels

of market integration, contemporary markets are more integrated. But we also find a

significant degree of market integration for distances up to about 700 kilometers in China

in the early 18th century. Moreover, when we compare past differences in market

integration and trade with today’s differences in per-capita income, we find that the

degree of market integration in the 1720s is a very good predictor of per capita income in




                                              19
the 1990s. This paper does not analyze non-agricultural commodities directly, but

considering the extent of structural change that has taken place over 270 years, it is quite

stunning to see how well agricultural market integration in the past alone can predict

today’s income per capita.

       In provinces where there is more trade and better market integration, we observe

higher per-capita income. This appears to be the case both contemporaneously and over

time. These systematic differences in trade and income however do not necessarily mean

that trade causes growth—an equally plausible explanation is that trade and income are

jointly determined. If the landlocked province of Guizhou were to trade in all goods and

services to the same extent as Guangdong province, would Guizhou attain the per-capita

income of Guangdong? The answer may be affirmative, but given the persistence of

provincial differences over the centuries in the case of China, it is a scenario that seems

unlikely.
