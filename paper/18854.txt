Can patent protection and product market competition complement each other in enhancing incentives
to innovate? In this paper, we address this question by investigating how innovation responses to a
substantial policy initiative increasing product market competition interact with the strength of patent
rights. We provide empirical evidence of innovation responding positively to the product market reform
in industries of countries where patent rights are strong, not where these are weak. The positive response
to the reform is more pronounced in industries in which innovators rely more on patenting than in
other industries, and in which the scope for deterring entry through patenting is not too large. Our
empirical findings are in line with step-by-step innovation models predicting that product market competition
enhances innovation and, more importantly, that patent protection can complement competition in
inducing innovation.

1     Introduction

Over the past three decades, numerous changes to patent systems have strengthened patent

protection worldwide.1 While this is in line with the common view that patent protection
should enhance innovation incentives, empirical studies investigating the e§ects of such reg-

ulatory changes on the level of innovation have hardly found evidence of positive average
e§ects (Sakakibara and Branstetter, 2001, Lerner, 2002 and 2009, and Qian, 2007, among
others). As Josh Lerner (2009, p. 347) put it: ìThe lack of a positive impact of strengthen-

ing of patent protection on innovation is a puzzling result. It runs (...) against our intuition

as economists that incentives a§ect behavior (...).î

    In this paper we set out to study whether patent protection can foster innovation when

being complemented by product market competition. More speciÖcally, we investigate how

innovation responses to a competition-increasing product market reform depend upon the

strength of patent rights. The product market reform that we consider was part of the Eu-
ropean Single Market Program (SMP). The European Commission designed this large scale

policy initiative to enhance competition, innovation and economic growth and implemented

it in 1992, a time with signiÖcant variation in patent protection across European Countries.
The product market reform created exogenous variation in product market conditions not
only across time, but also across industries and countries. Positive average e§ects on product

market competition have been documented (Badinger, 2007, Bottasso and Sembenelli 2001,
and Gri¢th, Harrison and Simpson 2010, among others).
    In our empirical analysis, we Örst compare the innovation responses to the product mar-

ket reform across two country groups. The Örst group covers the countries with strong patent

rights in our main sample of 13 manufacturing industries in 17 European countries between
1987 and 2003. These countries have had strong intellectual property rights (IPR) regimes
   1
     These changes involve, among others, improvements to patent enforcement, the lengthening of the patent
term or the broadening of patent scope. In addition, patent protection now also covers innovation types
that were previously largely non-patentable, and it is reaching out to public research communities in many
countries and to developing countries.



                                                    1
since the pre-sample period, 1980 until 1986, and are among the founder states of the Eu-

ropean Patent Organisation (EPOrg). The second group covers the countries with weaker

patent rights before and during our observation period. The estimation results indicate
that innovation responds positively to the competition-enhancing product market reform in

industries that are located in countries with strong patent rights, but not so in industries
of countries with weaker patent rights.2 A concern with these reform e§ects which di§er
between country groups could be potential interactions between the product market reform

and factors other than the country-speciÖc strength of patent protection. We address this

concern by investigating the variation of the reform e§ects across industries. The reform

e§ect in countries with strong patent rights should be more pronounced in industries where

innovators are generally more prone to rely on patenting and are likely to value strong patent

protection more than in other industries.3 We Önd empirical evidence in line with this predic-
tion. In addition, we Önd that the more pronounced innovation responses in industries with

higher patent relevance arise only as long as the scope for deterring entry through patenting

is not too large. In this paper, we argue that all these empirical Öndings are consistent
with Schumpeterian growth models with step-by-step innovation where patent protection

and product market competition can become complementary forces.
       The view that patent protection and product market competition should act as comple-

mentary inputs to innovation and growth, is at odds with what early endogeneous growth

models would predict (e.g., Romer, 1990, and Aghion and Howitt, 1992). In these models

patent protection fosters innovation and growth as it enhances the rents from innovation,
whereas product market competition deters innovation and growth by reducing these rents.

Thus, patent protection is good for innovation for exactly the same reason that renders

competition bad for innovation. More recently, Boldrin and Levine (2008) have argued that

patent protection is detrimental to innovation because it blocks product market competition
   2
     We Önd consistent results when measuring innovation by research and development (R&D) intensity,
real R&D expenditures, or the number of patents.
   3
     To identify these industries in which patent relevance is high in general and for exogenous technological
reasons we use the pre-sample patent intensity in the corresponding US industries.


                                                      2
whereas competition is good for innovation because it allows the greatest scope to those who

can develop new ideas. Even though Boldrin and Levine (2008) depart here from the en-

dogenous growth literature, they share the view that patent protection and competition are
counteracting (or mutually exclusive) forces: namely, whenever one is good for innovation

the other is detrimental to innovation.4
      However, patent protection and product market competition can become complementary
forces in a Schumpeterian growth model with step-by-step innovation. Why? Because in

such a model a positive fraction of sectors involve neck-and-neck Örms, that is, Örms that

compete on an equal technological footing. Each Örmís incentive to innovate depends on the

di§erence between its post-innovation rent and its pre-innovation rent, and this di§erence

- the net innovation rent - is in turn a§ected by both, product market competition and

patent protection. More speciÖcally, in a neck-and-neck sector where Örms make positive
proÖts even if they do not innovate, tougher product market competition will reduce this

pre-innovation rent. It may also lower the post-innovation rents but to a lower extent. Thus,

overall, product market competition will increase the net innovation rents in a neck-and-
neck sector: this we refer to as the escape competition e§ect in Aghion, Harris, Howitt and

Vickers (2001) and Aghion, Bloom, Blundell, Gri¢th and Howitt (2005). On the other hand,
stronger patent protection will enhance post-innovation rents to a larger extent than pre-

innovation rents, especially when the latter are bogged down by competition. Hence, there

is complementarity between product market competition and patent protection in inducing

innovation. This contrasts with the model of Romer (1990) in which innovations are made
by outsiders who create a new variety, and with the model of Aghion and Howitt (1992) in

which innovators leap-frog incumbent Örms. In both these models, the pre-innovation rent

is zero and product market competition deters innovation by reducing the post-innovation

rent which represents the net innovation rent.
      Our paper contributes to several strands of literature. First, it contributes to the lit-

                                                     3
erature on competition and growth.5 Aghion et al. (2005) report empirical evidence of an

inverted-U relationship between product market competition and innovation in the United

Kingdom (U.K.). Aghion, Blundell, Gri¢th, Howitt and Prantl (2009) study how escape-
entry e§ects on the productivity growth and patenting of incumbent establishments and

Örms in the U.K. vary with their level of technological development. Aghion, Burgess, Red-
ding and Zilibotti (2008) show that the e§ect of an Indian product market deregulation on
industry output varies with the institutional characterstics of Indian states. Focussing on

the SMP, like we do,6 Bottasso and Sembenelli (2001) and Badinger (2007) show that this

product market intervention reduced mark-ups in manufacturing industries. Gri¢th et al.

(2010) report that the SMP enhanced product market competition which, in turn, led to an

increase in R&D expenditures, using panel data for manufacturing industries in OECD coun-

tries.7 None of these papers, however, examines how the impact of a competition-increasing
product market reform on innovation may interact with the strength of patent protection.

    Our work also contributes to the empirical literature on the e§ects of intellectual property

rights (IPR), as well as IPR reforms, on the level of innovation.8 Sakakibara and Branstet-
ter (2001) investigate consequences of the Japanese patent law reform in 1988. The reform

introduced the option of multiple, (in)dependent claims per patent and, thus, broadened the
scope of Japanese patents. They Önd no evidence of positive average reform e§ects on R&D

spendings of Japanese Örms. What they do not consider is a potential interaction between

the patent reform and product market competition. Branstetter, Fisman and Foley (2006)

focus on a di§erent research question, investigating how the extent of technology transfers
    5
      See Aghion et al. (2001) and Acemoglu, Aghion and Zilibotti (2006), in particular, but also Acemoglu
(2009), Aghion and Howitt (2009) and Acemoglu and Akcigit (2012). With regard to the related theoretical
literature in industrial organization, we refer the reader, among others, to Tirole (1988), Scotchmer (2004),
Gilbert (2006), Vives (2008), and Schmutzler (2010, 2012).
    6
      In Aghion et al. (2005, 2009), the SMP provides the excluded instruments that are used in instrumental
variable and control function models explaining innovation or productivity growth.
    7
      To capture product market competition, Gri¢th et al. (2010) use the following inversely related measure:
average proÖtability at the countryñindustryñyear level, deÖned as value-added divided by labour plus capital
costs.
    8
      Moser (2005) addresses an important, but di§erent question. She provides empirical evidence suggesting
that the existence of patent laws ináuences the direction of technological progress, as well as the pattern of
comparative advantages across countries.

within United States (U.S.) multinational Örms responds to IPR reforms in their a¢liatesí

host countries. Both these papers inspired our empirical approach in one respect. We al-

low for di§erences in innovation responses across industries that di§er in the propensity of
patenting, and therefore the relevance of patent protection, as this contributes to our identi-

Öcation of the interaction e§ects between patent rights and the product market reform. Qian
(2007) uses country-level panel data for the pharmaceutical industry in OECD countries to
show that introducing national patent protection does, on average, not stimulate pharma-

ceutical innovation. Interestingly, she Önds positive, often statistically signiÖcant coe¢cients

on interactions between patent protection and the country-level Fraser Institute index of eco-

nomic freedom.9 To the extent that this index can reáect country-level freedom to compete

and trade the latter Önding for the pharamceutical industry provides a Örst hint towards

the interaction e§ects we are interested in. Against this background, we focus on identifying
the interactions between product market competition and patent protection, exploiting the

fact that the SMP product market reform created exogenous variation in product market

conditions across industries, countries and time.
       The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we explain the

theoretical argument in greater detail. Section 3 presents the empirical model and, in section
4, we brieáy explain the data and show descriptive statistics. The empirical results and their

discussion follow in section 5. In section 6, we summarize and conclude.

    This index is a composite measure which aggregates country-level proxies of the size of government,
access to money, regulation of credit, labor and business, legal structure and property rights, and freedom
to trade.

2       Theoretical argument

In this section, we sketch a simple model to think about the relationship between the strength

of patent rights, reforms increasing product market competition, and innovation.10

2.1       Basic setup

Time is discrete and the economy is populated by a continuum of people who all live for one

period. In each period t a Önal good Y; henceforth the numÈraire, is produced under perfect
competition from a continuum of intermediate inputs, according to the technology
                                                 Z    1

                                                  0


where xit is the quantity of the intermediate input produced in industry i in period t and
 2 (0; 1). With Ait we denote the productivity parameter associated with the latest version

of intermediate good i. The Önal good in turn is used for consumption, as an input to the

innovation process, and as an input to the production of intermediate goods.
      In each intermediate industry i, only a monopolist produces in each period, using a one-

to-one technology. Thus, the variable i refers both, to an intermediate industry, and to
the intermediate Örm which is active in that industry. As any other agent in the economy,
intermediate producers live for one period only and technological capabilities are transmitted

within dynasties. Each intermediate Örm chooses how much to produce in order to maximize
proÖts, taking into account that the price at which it can sell its intermediate good to the
Önal good production is equal to the value of the marginal product of that good in Önal good

production.
      ProÖt maximization yields an equilibrium proÖt for each intermediate Örm i in period t
which is equal to

and q is the probability that innovation proÖts are not expropriated (Acemoglu et al. 2006).
This variable reáects the strength of patent rights.

       Before a Örm decides on production in period t, it can invest in R&D to increase its

productivity. A Örmís productivity at the beginning of period t is At1 and each innovation
increases the productivity by factor , assuming At = At1 with  > 1. For innovation to
be successful with probability z an intermediate Örm in period t must invest



                                     ct = cz 2 At1 =2 where c < 1:                                      (2)

       Intermediate Örms are subject to an entry threat from new producers. Let p denote the
probability that an entrant shows up. We take p to be exogenous and new entrants in period

t are assumed to operate with productivity At1 in t.

       Entry is deterred with probability one if the incumbent in industry i innovates. If the

incumbent does not innovate and, therefore, the incumbent and the entrant have the same

productivity At1 , entry is deterred with probability q, where  indicates the marginal

deterrence e§ect of patent protection on entry. The idea is that the stronger the patent

system, the more likely will entry be deterred. This negative e§ect of patent protection on

entry is emphasized by Boldrin and Levine (2008).11 Therefore, the probability of actual
entry in an intermediate industry i; is equal to zero if the incumbent i has innovated, and

it is equal to p(1  q) otherwise. We assume that if entry occurs, the incumbentís proÖt

falls to zero through Bertrand competition. An increase in p, reáecting an increase in entry
threat, corresponds to an increase in product market competition.
  11
     We implicitly assume that potential entrants observe the post-innovation technology of the incumbent
Örm before deciding whether or not to enter. Then, the potential entrant will Önd it proÖtable to enter only
if the incumbent has not innovated. However, she will never enter in period t if the incumbent has innovated:

2.2      The interplay between patent protection and competition

Using equation (1) for the equilibrium proÖt, together with the innovation technology in
equation (2), we can analyze incumbent Örmsí R&D investment decisions. If an incumbent

Örm successfully innovates, then its proÖt will be At1 with probability q. If the incumbent
fails to innovate, then its proÖt will be At1 with probability q[1  p(1  q)] . This is the
probability that the incumbent is not expropriated times the probability that entry does not

occur or is not successful. Therefore, the incumbentís expected proÖt, including the cost of
innovation, is equal to



                   zqAt1 + (1  z) q[1  p(1  q)]At1  cz 2 At1 =2:

   The incumbent Örm will choose the probability z that maximizes this expression. The

Örst-order condition of this maximization problem yields the probability

                                      q
                                 z=      [  1 + p(1  q)]:                              (3)
                                       c

   Di§erentiation of the equilibrium innovation probability with respect to q yields


                                 @z  
                                    = f  1 + p  2pqg:                                  (4)

   Accordingly, the strength of patent rights, as measured by q; has a priori an ambiguous
e§ect on innovation incentives, even though the e§ect is positive for  su¢ciently small

( < (  1 + p)=2pq).

   Di§erentiation with respect to p yields:

       Equation (5) shows that product market competition, measured by p, has a positive e§ect

on innovation incentives: this is the "escape competition" or "escape entry" e§ect pointed

out, for example, in Aghion et al. (2005) and Aghion et al. (2009). According to equation
(6), patent protection, measured by q, a§ects the magnitude of the escape competition e§ect

in two counteracting ways: (a) for given e§ective entry threat p(1  q), it increases the gain
from escaping competition through innovation; and (b) it reduces the e§ective entry threat
and therefore the incumbent Örmsí incentives to innovate in order to escape competition.

The former e§ect dominates for low values of q, and for all values of q if  is small enough

to fulÖll  < 1=2q.

       Overall, the model predicts that product market competition, and, thus, policy reforms

that increase product market competition, have a positive e§ect on innovation incentives,

and all the more so when patent protection is stronger. The latter holds, in particular, if the
marginal e§ect of patent protection on the probability of entry () is su¢ciently small.12


3        Empirical model

Our empirical model is designed to identify heterogeneity in the e§ect of a competition-

increasing product market reform on innovation, depending on the strength of patent rights.

The product market reform that we focus on consists of the substantial policy prescriptions
that were part of the European Single Market Program in 1992. The reform was designed by

the European Commission, a supranational institution, to enhance competition, innovation

and economic growth. The e§ects of the reform were ex ante expected to vary across indus-
tries, as well as across countries, and the reform was repeatedly reported to reduce mark-ups

and to increase product market competition (see Section 4 and Appendix B for details).

       We proceed in two steps, using panel data for 13 industries in 17 European countries
between 1987 and 2003. In the Örst step, we compare the e§ect of the product market
  12
     We do not study the e§ects on consumer welfare, which are a§ected by both p and q, not only because
they change the pace of innovation but also because they a§ect markups, since every time a patent is broken
or entry is successful the markup falls in that industry from 1

the pre-sample period, 1980 to 1986, and throughout the sample period; 2) countries with

weaker patent rights (see Section 4 and Appendix B for details). We estimate the following
equation:

      yict =  1 Rict  G(Pc;strong                               weak
                               presample (ps) ) +  2 Rict  G(Pc; ps ) + Xict + ct +  it + uict ;   (7)

where the explained variable yict measures innovation. Our main measure of innovation is

R&D intensity, deÖned as R&D expenditures over value added. In addition, we use real
R&D expenditures and a patent count. Countries are indexed by c, industries by i and

time by t. The main explanatory variable Rict is our measure of the product market reform.

It is set to zero in all years before the implementation of the SMP. From 1992 onwards
it takes values between zero and one, with a higher value indicating that ex ante experts

were expecting the respective county-industry unit to be a§ected more by the SMP than

other country-industries. We interact the reform measure with G(Pc;strong
                                                                     presample (ps) ), a time-

invariant indicator for the country group where patent rights P are strong since the pre-
sample period, and also with G(Pc;weak
                                   ps ), the corresponding indicator for the country group

with weaker patent rights. These indicators are constructed from information on patent law
reforms and related regulation.

   Country-year Öxed e§ects, ct , are included to capture unobserved factors which may

trigger country-speciÖc changes of innovation over time. Industry-year Öxed e§ects,  it , are

used to pick up factors inducing industry-speciÖc trends over time. The vector Xict captures
further covariates, most importantly the pre-sample knowledge stock of country-industries

to capture their initial innovative potential. The error term is denoted by uict . We cluster

standard errors at the country-industry level to allow for unrestricted correlation between
annual observations within the same country-industry.

   Our main focus in equation (7) is on the coe¢cients of the two product market reform

terms,  1 and  2 . If stronger patent rights are to reinforce the positive e§ect of a competition-
increasing product market reform on innovation, then the estimate of  1 should be positive

                                                    10
and larger than that of  2 . In our preferred model variant, the coe¢cients  1 and  2 are

identiÖed from data variation across time within country-industries and across country-

industries.13
       In the second step of our empirical analysis, we address the concern that the estimates of

 1 and  2 , and the extent to which these di§er across the country groups, might be ináuenced
by interactions of the product market reform with other factors, besides the country-speciÖc
patent protection regime. Similar as Sakakibara and Branstetter (2001) and Branstetter

et al. (2006), we investigate whether the response of innovation to the product market

reform varies across industries. We distinguish between industries where, in general and for

exogenous technological reasons, innovators tend to rely strongly on patenting and, thus,

should value strong patent protection highly, and other industries. In line with our main

theoretical prediction, innovation in the former group of industries in countries with strong
patent rights should respond more positively to a competition-increasing reform than in

the other group of industries. We refer to these industries as industries with higher patent

relevance. To identify them, we use the proxy Ii; ps which indicates for each industry i the
level of the patent intensity in the corresponding US industry in the pre-sample period 1980

to 1986.
       We consider the following estimation equation:

                                                                                       median

    Our empirical Öndings are robust to identifying the e§ects from several alternative sources of data

results when using alternative measures of the product market reform and of patent rights, and when using
an instrumental variable approach.

e§ects we include the vector of the group indicators, Gic .14

       The coe¢cients of main interest in equation (8) are  11 and  12 . If stronger patent rights

are to enhance the positive e§ect of a competition-increasing product market reform on in-

novation, and the more so in industries where patent protection is more relevant, then the

estimate of  11 should be positive and larger than that of  12 . In addition, the coe¢cient

estimates for countries with strong patent rights,  11 and  12 , should be larger than the cor-
responding estimates for countries with weaker patent rights,  21 and  22 , and the di§erence

 11   12 should be larger than  21   22 .

       In the Önal part of our empirical analysis, we extend our model speciÖcation to allow
for interactions of the product market reform with country- and industry-speciÖc Önancial

factors, as well as with the initial knowledge stock of country-industries.


4         Data

For our main sample we use panel data for 13 industries in 17 European countries between

1987 and 2003.15 The majority of countries, 11 out of the 17 countries for which we have
the relevant data, were EU member states in 1992 and participated in the European Single

Market Program, as shown in Table 1.16 The other six European countries include Finland

and Sweden that joined the EU in 1995. Among the 13 industries are nine two-digit industries
  14
     The results for the model speciÖcation in equation (8) are provided in Section 5.2, along with the results
for a speciÖcation where we allow the reform e§ect to vary more áexibly along the distribution of Ii; ps .
  15
     In this section, we brieáy introduce our data sources and main variables. Descriptive statistics are
provided in Appendix Table A-1.
  16
     For the twelfth EU member state in 1992, Luxembourg, data on R&D expenditures are missing.



                                                      12
and four more aggregate industries, all in manufacturing (see Table 2).17 In section 5.3, we

also use alternative samples which include the United States (US) or service industries.

       Innovation
       Our main measure of innovation is R&D intensity, deÖned as nominal R&D expenditures

over nominal value added. To construct this variable, we use country-industry-year level data
on research and development expenditures for the business enterprise sector from the 2011-
version of the OECD ANBERD database and data on value added from the 2008-version

of the EU KLEMS database (see also Appendix B.1). The second measure of innovation

is real R&D expenditures, that is R&D expenditures at year 2000 prices converted to US

dollars using purchasing power parity rates. The third measure is a count of patents taken

out per country-industry-year in the US Patent and Trademark O¢ce. The patent count

data that we use are part of the EU KLEMS 2008 database and these are constructed from
the NBER patent database with patents granted by the US Patent and Trademark O¢ce

(see also Appendix B.2 and Hall, Ja§e and Trajtenberg, 2001). Using data on US patents is

advantageous in our context as low-value inventions are less likely to be patented abroad.
       To capture the initial innovation potential of country-industries, we use a continuous

measure of a patent-based knowledge stock built up until 1986, the end of the pre-sample
period.

       Patent rights

       To capture the strength of patent rights we separate between countries with strong patent

rights and those with weaker patent rights, based on information on patent law reforms and
related regulation (see also Appendix B.3). One group of countries in our dataset had strong

patent protection regimes already during the pre-sample period until 1986 and maintained

strong regimes throughout the whole sample period, 1987 to 2003. The group covers seven

out of the 11 countries in our sample that implemented the SMP, namely Belgium, Denmark,
France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, and outside the area of the
  17
    We grouped up to four two-digit industries together if the underlying raw data required us to do so.
Industries are classiÖed according to the European NACE classiÖcation (version 1993, revision 1).


                                                  13
SMP it covers Sweden (plus the United States). All other sampled countries form the group

of countries with weaker patent protection regimes. This group includes four SMP countries,

namely Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain, as well as Öve non-SMP countries, namely the
Czech and Slovak Republics, Finland, Hungary, and Poland.

       All European countries in our group with strong patent rights, except for Denmark,
were among those states that set up the European Patent Organisation (EPOrg) in October
1977.18 The countries in our group with weaker patent rights joined the EPOrg between

October 1986 and March 2004 (EPOrg, 2012) and none of these countries completed the

required reforms for a strong patent protection regime before 1992 (Branstetter et al. 2006,

Qian 2007, and World Intellectual Property Organization 2012, among others). Our clas-

siÖcation is consistent with those used in Branstetter et al. (2006), Maskus and Penubarti

(1995) and Qian (2007). In addition, we compare our patent protection measure to the index
of patent protection that was developed by Ginarte and Park (1997) and updated by Park

(2008). The index is updated every Öve years between 1960 and 2005, it takes country-

speciÖc values between zero and Öve, with higher values indicating patent laws with stronger
IPR. In 1985, the countries in our group with strong patent rights have an index value of

about 3.5 or more, the average index value being 3.9.19 In 2000, their index values are at
least 4.5. All countries in the group with weaker patent rights have a much lower index value

(below 2.8) in 1985, except for Finland or countries with missing index data for that year.

The average index value for 1985 is 2.5. In 2000 only two countries in that group, Ireland

and Finland, scored above 4.5.
       In the second part of our empirical analysis, when estimating the innovation response

to the product market reform separately for four country-industry groups, we use the fol-

     The EPOrg is the intergovernmental organization that was created for granting patents in Europe under
the European Patent Convention of 1973; the European Patent O¢ce (EPO) acts as the executive body for
the EPOrg and the Örst patent applications were Öled in 1978. A European patent is a set of essentially
independent patents with national enforcement, national revocation, and central revocation or narrowing as
a group via two alternative uniÖed, post-grant procedures.

lowing industry grouping. First, we single out the industries with high patent relevance

where, in general, innovators tend to rely more on patenting, and where therefore patent

protection should be more relevant, compared to an industry with median patent relevance.
Our preferred proxy for patent relevance, Ii; ps , ranks each industry i according to the patent

intensity in the corresponding US industry in the pre-sample period, 1980 to 1986.20 Second,
we form the complementing industry group with low patent relevance. In a more áexible
model speciÖcation, we consider three industry groups, respectively with low, medium and

high patent relevance. Column 3 of Table 2 provides for each sampled industry information

on the patent intensity in the corresponding US industry in 1983, and column 4 summarizes

the ranking with three industry groups based on the US patent intensity data for the whole

pre-sample period.

       Product market reform
       The product market reform that we focus on was part of the SMP implemented in 1992,

a time with signiÖcant variation in patent protection across European Countries. Designed

by the European Commission and therefore at a supra-national level, the SMP aimed at
bringing down barriers to the free movement of products and production factors within the

EU in order to foster competition, innovation and economic growth. Main components of the
SMP include changes to national legislation meant to harmonize technical product standards

within the EU; to simplify the physical movements of goods, labor, and other production

factors across borders; and to reduce public sector discrimination in favor of national Örms,

for example due to mandatory international tendering for high-value procurement. Several
empirical studies support the view that product market competition has increased in response

to the SMP reform (Badinger 2007, Bottasso and Sembenelli 2001 and Gri¢th et al. 2010,

among others).

       The SMP was o¢cially implemented in all sampled countries that had joined the EU
before 1992. For these SMP countries, the European Commission report by Buigues, Ilzkovitz
  20
    Using data on U.S. industries is advantageous here as the U.S. is the technology leader in most industries
and it is not included in our main sample. See Appendix B.3 for details.


                                                     15
and Lebrun (1990) provides a common list of 40 three-digit manufacturing industries that

were ex ante expected to be a§ected by the product market reform. Additions to and

removals from the common list are also reported for each sampled country. These additions
and removals reáect recommendations of experts, who were asked whether they expected

the reform to change the product market conditions in an individual industry in a speciÖc
country di§erently than in the corresponding average industry in SMP countries. The reform
measures that can be derived from the information in Buigues et al. (1990) vary across SMP

countries, industries and time; a fact which we exploit to identify the reform impact from

confounding ináuences. Further data variation is available as our main data set covers also

non-SMP countries, not only SMP countries.

       To construct our main measure of the product market reform we aggregate the informa-

tion in Buigues et al. (1990) into a measure which is set equal to zero in all years before the
implementation of the SMP. From 1992 onwards it is equal to the share of the three-digit

classes in a two-digit industry of a SMP country that were ex ante expected to be a§ected

by the SMP.21
       In column 4 of Table 2, we show the product market reform intensity in 1992 for all 13

industries in our data set, averaged across the 11 sampled SMP countries. The industries
that were expected to be a§ected least are ëcoke, reÖned petroleum, and nuclear fuelí, ëbasic

metalsí, and ëfood, beverages, and tobaccoí. Those that were expected to be a§ected most

are ëmotor vehicles, trailers, and semi-trailersí, ëelectrical and optical equipmentí, ëchemi-

cals including pharmaceuticalsí, and ëgeneral and special purpose machinery n.e.c., engines,
turbines & domestic appliances n.e.c., machine tools, weaponsí.

       Financial variables

       The Önancial variables which we use in section 5.3 are explained in that section and in

Appendix B.5.
  21
    Note that the industry ranking based on our main SMP measure corresponds to the ranking based on
the SMP measure of Gri¢th et al. (2010) for all industries in our data set, up to two deviations. Gri¢th
et al. (2010) constructed their SMP measure di§erently than we do due to di§erent data availability. See
Appendix B.4 for details.

5        Empirical results
5.1       Baseline results

We start by separately estimating the average e§ect of the competition-increasing product
market reform which is part of the European Single Market Program and the average e§ect

of patent protection on innovation. This prepares the ground for analyzing e§ects of the

interaction between the two factors on innovation. We report OLS estimation results in Ta-
ble 3 for the main sample, an unbalanced panel of 2,761 observations for 13 manufacturing
industries in 17 European countries between 1987 and 2003. All model speciÖcations include

country, industry and year indicators to capture country, industry and year e§ects. Stan-

dard errors are robust and clustered on the country-industry level to allow for unrestricted
correlation between annual observations within the same country-industry.

       Our Örst Önding is that of a positive average e§ect of the product market reform intensity

on R&D intensity in column 1 of Table 3.22 The coe¢cient estimate indicates that enhancing
the reform intensity by one standard deviation (0.3076) increases R&D intensity by 0.0108

(=0.0352*0.3076).23 This represents about 23 percent of the mean value of R&D intensity

(0.0464), a reasonable e§ect size. Such an average e§ect estimate is consistent with the
theoretical prediction of an escape competition e§ect, as discussed in Section 2. In addition,

it Öts with the empirical results of Gri¢th et al. (2010).24
       Our second Önding is that there does not seem to be any positive (or negative) signiÖcant

average e§ect of patent protection on R&D intensity. In column 2, we show the coe¢cient

estimate on a time-varying indicator which equals one in case of strong patent rights, and zero
otherwise. The estimate is small, positive and not signiÖcantly di§erent from zero.25 This
is consistent with previous empirical evidence, in particular by Sakakibara and Branstetter
  22
     See Section 4 for the deÖnitions of the variables.
  23
     See Appendix Table A-1 for descriptive statistics on the reform intensity.
  24
     Gri¢th et al. (2010) use data on a similar set of industries in a di§erent set of countries (Belgium,
Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Netherlands, United Kingdom and the United States) and a di§erent,
although related, measure of the SMP product market reform.
  25
     Using the time-varying patent protection index provided by Ginarte and Park (1997) and Park (2008)
yields a very similar coe¢cient estimate. The result is available upon request.

(2001) for the manufacturing sector in Japan or by Qian (2007) for the pharmaceutical

industry in OECD countries.

       These two Öndings are robust to including both terms on the right hand side of the
estimation equation, the linear term for the competition-increasing product market reform

and the linear term for patent protection (see column 3).

5.2       Main results

Our main interest in this paper is the response of innovation to the interplay between the
strength of patent rights and the competition-enhancing product market reform. As shown

in Figure 1, our raw data directly hints at heterogeneity in the response to the reform,
depending on patent protection. The left-hand graph refers to countries with strong patent

rights since the pre-sample period, the right-hand graph refers to countries with weaker

patent rights. The vertical axes indicate R&D intensity, the horizontal axes indicate the

SMP reform intensity. Circles represent the country-industry-year data points between the
Öfth and the ninety-Öfth percentile of the R&D intensity distribution in the sample. The

regression line for countries with strong patent rights has a more positive slope than the
corresponding line for countries with weaker patent rights.26 Overall, the raw data pattern

is consistent with the view that innovation responds more strongly to the competition-

enhancing reform if patent rights are stronger.
       Next, we estimate equation (7) of Section 3. The estimation results in Table 4 indicate
a positive e§ect of the product market reform intensity on R&D intensity for countries with

strong patent rights. For countries with weaker patent rights we Önd no such e§ect. These
Öndings are stable across the following four variants of the empirical model: a) the model
variant in column 1 of Table 4, where we control for country, industry, and year Öxed e§ects;

b) the one with the interaction term Product market reforms (Rcit ) G(Protection (P )strong
                                                                                      c      )
and the level term Rcit in which the coe¢cient on the former indicates how the reform e§ect
  26
    Each of these regression lines indicates the linear predictions from a country group-speciÖc linear regres-
sion of R&D intensity on the product market reform intensity as the sole explanatory variable.

for the country group with strong patent rights deviates from the reform e§ect for the group

with weaker patent rights (column 2); c) the one with time-varying country e§ects and time-

varying industry e§ects (column 3); d) and, Önally, the model variant with the knowledge
stock in country-industries in 1986 as explanatory variable (column 4).

       Our Öndings are also robust to several changes in the way we measure our main explana-
tory variables. We can, for example, replace our pre-sample measure of patent protection
by the Ginarte-Park index (Protection GP
                                      ct ). Column 5 of Table 4 provides the respective

OLS estimates and column 6 the second stage estimates of a 2SLS regression. We imple-

ment an instrumental variable approach as the contemporaneous Ginarte-Park index may

reáect regulatory changes that are endogenous to innovation during our sample period. As

excluded instrument, we use the interaction of the country-speciÖc pre-sample indicator of

strong patent rights and the product market reform intensity.27 The second stage estimates
on the two product market reform terms indicate that the reform e§ect on R&D intensity

increases with the strength of patent rights and is positive for index values above 3.7. About

65% of all sample observations in 1992 have higher index values than 3.7 and in later years
the percentage is even higher.28

       All our estimation results in Table 4 suggest a complementarity between the competition-
enhancing product market reform and the strength of patent rights, in line with our theo-

retical prediction in Section 2. A potential concern with these results is that the coe¢cient

estimates on the product market reform terms for countries with strong patent rights, and

their deviation from those for countries with weaker patent rights, could be driven by reform
interactions with factors other than the country-speciÖc patent protection regime.

       To address this concern, we investigate how the positive e§ect of the product market

reform on R&D intensity which is speciÖc to countries with strong patent rights varies
  27
     The coe¢cient estimate (s.e.) on the excluded instrument in the Örst stage equation is 0.7336***
(0.1254). The test statistic for the F-test on the irrelevance of the excluded instrument takes a value of
34.24 and we reject the null hypothesis.
  28
     The weak identiÖcation test result at the bottom of column 6 indicates that the null hypothesis of the
2SLS bias exceeding 10 percent of the OLS bias can be rejected (see also Stock and Yogo, 2005).



                                                    19
across industries. As argued in Section 3, we expect the interaction between the reform

intensity and the strength of patent rights to be stronger in industries where innovators

rely more on patenting and where, therefore, patent protection should be valued more than
in other industries. We refer to these industries as industries with higher patent relevance

and proxy patent relevance in industry i with the patent intensity in the corresponding US
industry during the pre-sample period 1980 to 1986.29
       Column 1 of Table 5 provides the estimation results for the model speciÖcation of equation

reform in four country-industry groups. The Örst group covers the industries with above me-

and the second group covers the industries with lower patent relevance in these countries, in-
                         median
dicated by G(Pc;strong
                  ps ; Ii; ps    ). For countries with weaker patent rights, two corresponding
groups are considered. We Önd positive e§ects of the competition-increasing product market

reform on R&D intensity in both industry groups for countries with strong patent rights.

More importantly, we Önd a higher reform e§ect for industries with above median patent
relevance than in the complementing group of industries.30 For countries with weaker patent

rights, we Önd small and non-signiÖcant reform e§ect estimates that do not di§er between
the two industry groups.31 Replacing these two terms with the level term of the product

market reform measure Rcit in column 2, we Önd consistent evidence.32

       In column 3, we consider a model speciÖcation which allows for di§erential reform ef-

fects on R&D intensity across three industry groups in countries with strong patent rights,
respectively with high, medium and low patent relevance. For countries with weaker patent

     The F-test statistic for the test of the null hypothesis "N0 :  11   12 = 0" is 4.02 (p-value: 0.0462). In
addition, we Önd that the e§ect estimates for countries with strong patent rights di§ered signiÖcantly more
than those for countries with weaker patent rights. The corresponding F-test statistic for the test of the null
hypothesis "N0 : ( 11   12 )  ( 21   22 ) = 0" is 3.10 (p-value: 0.0796).

     The F-test statistic for the null hypothesis "N0 :  21   22 = 0" is 0.22 (p-value: 0.6402).
  32
     The reform e§ect estimates for both industry groups in countries with strong patent rights are sig-
niÖcantly higher than the estimate of the coe¢cient on the Rcit -term which reáects the reform e§ect for
countries with weaker patent rights. The latter estimate deviates most from the estimate for the industry
group with patent relevance above the median in countries with strong patent rights.

rights, we estimate the average e§ect of the product market reform.33 We Önd further sup-

port for complementarity between the competition-increasing product market reform and

the strength of patent rights: R&D intensity responds more strongly to the product market
reform in country-industries where patent rights are strong and where patent relevance takes

medium or high values, rather than low values.
    More precisely, we observe for countries with strong patent rights that the response is
stronger in industries with an intermediate level of patent relevance than in those with high or

low levels.34 That the complementarity between the competition-increasing product market

reform and the strength of patent rights weakens in our group of industries with highest

patent relevance values is in line with our theoretical argument if this group covers industries

where the scope for entry deterrence through patenting is large enough. In such industries

the marginal deterrence parameter  in Section 2 takes high values, indicating that entry
can be (partly) deterred through patent thickets, dense webs of overlapping patent rights

caused by strategic patenting and technological conditions.35 Support for the view that our

industries with high patent relevance are industries where patent thickets are most likely to
be prevalent and that, therefore, -values are likely to be high follows, for example, from

the work of von Graevenitz, Wagner and Harho§ (2011a, 2011b). All the technologies for
which their measure of patent thicket density takes high values can be linked to our group of

industries with highest patent relevance values: audiovisual technology, telecommunications,

semiconductors, information technology, optics, electrical machinery and electrical energy,
  33
     The average e§ect estimate in column 3 turns out to be small and insigniÖcant. In column 4, allowing for
e§ect variation across three industry groups in countries with weaker patent rights leads to small, insigniÖcant
e§ect estimates for all three groups, and these are not signiÖcantly di§erent from each other.
  34
     F-test results indicate that the reform e§ect estimates for the industry groups with intermediate and
low patent relevance di§er signiÖcantly (p-value: 0.0102), but those for the groups with high and low patent
relevance fail to di§er at the 10%-signiÖcance level (p-value: 0.1272). Further support for the non-linear
pattern follows from the extensions to the main empirical analysis in section 5.3 (see column 3 in Table 6,
columns 2 and 4 in Table 7, and panel B in Table A-2).
  35
     Empirical evidence on the e§ect of patent thickets on Örm entry is scarce. Hall, Helmers, von Graevenitz
and Rosazza-Bondibene (2012), however, show that the density of a patent thicket in a technology area is
associated with reduced entry into patenting in that technology area, using data on patenting Örm entities
with at least one patent application at the IPO in the UK or at the EPO during the years 2001to 2009.

engines, pumps and turbines.36

       Overall, the above results provide compelling evidence of a complementarity between the

strength of patent rights and the competition-enhancing product market reform. First, we
Önd a positive average reform e§ect on R&D intensity in industries of countries with strong

patent rights, not in industries of countries with weak patent rights. Second, we observe
that the complementarity is more pronounced in industries where innovators rely more on
patenting than in other industries, and where the scope for deterring entry through patenting

is not too large.

5.3       Extensions

In addition to R&D intensity, we also explain alternative measures of innovation. First, we

consider real R&D expenditures in order to show that our previous Öndings do not simply

reáect value added responding to product market reforms (Table 6, columns 1, 2 and 3).37

Second, we use a patent count (Table 6, columns 4, 5 and 6).38 We Önd a positive e§ect of
the competition-increasing product market reform on real R&D expenditures, as well as on

the number of patents, in countries with strong patent rights since the pre-sample period
(Table 6, columns 1 and 4). These results are in line with the Öndings for the R&D intensity

models in Table 4. In addition, the positive innovation response to the product market

reform in countries with strong patent rights is more pronounced in industries with medium
or high rather than low patent relevance (Table 6, columns 2, 3, 5 and 6). In the model with
real R&D expenditures in column 3 of Table 5 we Önd a similarly non-monotonic pattern of
  36
      Von Graevenitz et al. (2011a, 2011b) measure the density of a patent thicket with a count of blocking
relationships identiÖed from patent citations, speciÖcally X and Y references in search reports of the European
Patent O¢ce. Type X or Y references refer to prior art documents, which call the novelty or the inventive
step of a patent claim into question. A blocking relationship is deÖned as a set of patent links where three
Örms mutually block each other according to X or Y references, called a triple. The technologies that we
list in the main text represent all those with high mean triple values, i.e. values between 18.53 and 93.68 in
Table 1 of von Graevenitz et al. (2011a). See also Hall (2005).
   37
      The results for the real R&D expenditures model are robust to including a control for real value added,
that is, value added at constant prices in 2000 in US dollar purchasing power parities.
   38
      The patent count model is estimated on a smaller sample with a shorter time horizon, namely the period
for which patent data are available to us (1987 to 1999). We estimate a linear probability model where
including country-year Öxed e§ects and industry-year Öxed e§ects is straightforward (Wooldridge, 2010).

reform e§ect estimates as for the R&D intensity models of columns 3 and 4 of Table 4.

       A lingering concern with our estimation results so far, is that these might be driven by

a di§erent mechanism causing similar heterogeneity in reform e§ects across countries, as
well as across industries. In particular, if Örms need to borrow to Önance their innovative

investments, a competition-enhancing product market reform may increase innovation more
in countries with more developed Önancial sectors than in other countries. And the impact
of Önancial sector development should be disproportionately larger in industries where Örms

typically rely more on external Önance than in other industries.

       To address this concern, we add further covariates to our set of explanatory variables,

namely interaction terms of the product market reform intensity with the relevant Önancial

variables. To measure Önancial sector development at the country-level, we use a private

credit ratio from the November 2010 version of the Financial Development and Structure
Database by Beck, Demirg¸c-Kunt and Levine (2000, 2010b). The ratio is deÖned as the

claims of deposit money banks and other Önancial institutions on the private sector, relative

to gross domestic product (GDP).39 It is available for all sampled countries, excluding the
Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, for at least four pre-sample years between 1980 and

1986. To construct the required pre-sample indicator of high Önancial sector development
we proceed as follows: we average all pre-sample ratio values per country and classify the

countries with averages at or above the 75 percentile of the sample distribution as having

a highly developed Önancial sector. These countries are France, Germany, the Netherlands

and Sweden.40 To distinguish between industries according to their reliance on external
Önance, we follow Rajan and Zingales (1998) and use industry-level data on the share of

capital expenditures Örms cannot Önance internally: the ratio of Örmsí capital expenditures

minus cash áow from operations, divided by capital expenditures. Rajan and Zingales (1998)

provide those data for US industries during the 1980s. We link the industries in our sample
  39
    See Appendix B for further details.
  40
    We also construct an alternative measure involving the median as a cut-o§ point and a measure based
on stock market capitalization relative to GDP. Reestimating the model of column 1 in Table 7 with these
alternative measures, we Önd support for the main results reported below.


                                                  23
to the corresponding US industries and distinguish three industry groups: the group with low

reliance on external Önance covers the industries with ratios below the 25th percentile of the

sample distribution, the group with high reliance on external Önance covers the industries
with ratios above the 75th percentile, and the remaining industries form the intermediate

group.
       Column 1 of Table 7 provides the estimates for a model speciÖcation which adds the fol-
lowing interaction term to the speciÖcation of column 4 in Table 4: the interaction between

the product market reform intensity and the indicator for countries with highly developed

Önancial sectors, Rcit  G(F inancial development (F D)high
                                                       c; ps ). In line with our previous Önd-

ings, the response of R&D intensity to the competition-increasing product market reform is

stronger in countries with strong patent rights than in countries with weaker patent rights.

Moreover, the coe¢cient estimate on the reform term speciÖc to countries with high Önancial
sector development is positive and statistically signiÖcant.

       Column 2 of Table 7 provides the estimates for the model speciÖcation which adds three

interaction terms to the speciÖcation of column 4 in Table 5: the interaction between the
product market reform intensity and the indicator for industries with high reliance on exter-

nal Önance in countries with highly developed Önancial sectors, Rcit  G(F Di;high
                                                                                ps ; External

f inance (E)high                                                               high     medium
            i; ps ); and the two complementing interactions, namely Rcit G(F Di; ps ; Ei; ps  )

and Rcit G(F Di;high    low
                   ps ; Ei; ps ). Again, our main Öndings hold up: in countries with strong patent

rights, R&D intensity responds more strongly to the competition-enhancing product market

reform in industries with medium or high patent relevance than in industries with low patent
relevance and the response is most pronounced in industries with medium patent relevance.41

In addition, we Önd that high Önancial sector development enhances the innovation response

to the product market reform more the stronger an industryís Örms rely on external Önance.

       The innovation response to the competition-enhancing product market reform may also

    The coe¢cient estimate on the reform term for industries with intermediate patent relevance is largest
and statistically signiÖcant. Second comes the one for industries with high patent relevance and third the
one for industries with low patent relevance, but both these estimates fails to pass the 10%-signiÖcance level.

depend upon initial conditions of country-industries. To capture this, we proceed as fol-

lows. We interact the product market reform intensity with an indicator for those country-

industries that are at or above the median of the sample distribution of our knowledge
stock measure.42 We then add the new interaction term, denoted by Rcit  G(Knowledge
     high
stockci; 1986 ), to the model speciÖcation of column 4 in Table 4. The respective coe¢cient

estimate turns out to be positive, but remains insigniÖcant with a p-value of 0.1717 (Table
7, column 3). Most importantly, allowing for the additional interaction does not challenge

our main Önding of R&D intensity responding more strongly to the reform in countries with

strong patent rights. In column 4 of Table 7 we augment the model speciÖcation of col-
                                                                         high
umn 4 in Table 5 with the same interaction term, Rcit  G(Knowledge stockci; 1986 ). The

empirical results then conÖrm that the innovation response to the competition-increasing

product market reform is strongest in the country-industry group with strong patent rights
and intermediate patent relevance.

      Finally, we modify the data variation that we use for identifying the product market

reform e§ects on innovation. Our main identiÖcation strategy involves using data variation
within 11 countries that fell under the SMP product market reform, as well as variation

between these SMP countries and six other countries. If we reduce the variation by using
data for the 11 SMP countries only, our main results turn out to be stable (see Table A-2 in

the Appendix, column 1, panels A and B). When extending the sample by adding the US, a

large non-European country with high innovative potential, we also Önd support for our main

results (Table A-2, column 2). Our empirical Öndings remain robust as well if we reestimate

on a much larger sample with 8 service industries, in addition to the 13 manufacturing
industries in our main sample (Table A-2, column 3).43 Finally, the main Öndings are also

stable when reestimating on the 47 samples that result if we exclude individual industries,

countries or years one by one.
 42
      Note that the estimation results are similar if we use the 75th percentile as cut-o§ point.
 43
      Note that our product market reform measure is always equal to zero in service industries.

6     Conclusions

In this paper, we contributed empirical evidence suggesting that strong patent rights can

complement competition-increasing product market reforms in inducing innovation. Our
main Öndings are as follows. First, the product market reform that was part of the European

Single Market Program in 1992 enhances innovation in industries that are located in countries
where patent rights are strong, but not in industries of countries where patent rights are weak.
Second, the positive innovation response to the product market reform is more pronounced

in industries in which innovators rely more on patenting than in other industries, and in

which the scope for deterring entry through patenting is not too large.

    These empirical Öndings are in line with the predictions of growth models with step-by-

step innovation in which product market competition encourages Örms to innovate in order

to escape competition. In such a model, patent protection and product market competition

can act as complementary engines of innovation, rather than as counteracting forces. The
complementarity arises as product market competition typically lowers the pre-innovation

rent, possibly also the post-innovation rent, but may enlarge the net innovation rent, and

the more so the stronger patent rights protect the post-innovation rent.
    Our analysis has implications for the long-standing policy debate on the need for and
the design of patent systems. Complementarity of patent protection with competition in

product markets, as well as with competition-enhancing product market interventions, need
to be taken into account when assessing the e§ects of patent policies. More generally, our
work provides support for the importance of interaction e§ects between di§erent types of

institutions and policies in the growth process.

Notes: In this figure we show the relation between product market reforms and innovation in countries with strong
patent protection during the pre-sample period (left graph) and in countries with weaker patent protection (right
graph). The horizontal axes refer to our measure of product market reform intensity, the vertical axes to R&D
intensity and the circles indicate all country-industry-year data points between the fifth and the ninety-fifth
percentile of the R&D intensity distribution in our raw data for the sample period 1987 to 2003. The lines
represent linear predictions of R&D intensity from country group-specific linear regressions of R&D intensity on
product market reform intensity as the sole explanatory variable.

Notes: In column 2 we indicate whether a sampled country adopted strong patent protection early
or late in time, distinguishing between countries that fell under the product market reforms of the
EU Single Market Program (SMP) and those that didn’t. Countries with strong patent rights in
the pre-sample period and throughout the sample period are classified as early adopters. Countries
with weaker patent rights are late adopters, completing their reforms relevant to a strong patent
protection regime in 1992, or even later. For comparison, columns 3 to 6 provide information on
the patent protection index by Park (2008) and Ginarte and Park (1997); it takes values between
zero and five and higher values indicate stronger patent protection. The term ‘n.a.’ indicates a
missing index value.

Notes: In column 3 of this table we provide the industry-specific US patent intensity in 1983, and in column 4 the
industry-specific patent relevance ranking based on the US patent intensity data for the pre-sample period, 1980
to 1986. In column 5 we show the product market reform intensity in 1992 in the sampled 13 two-digit industries,
averaged across the 11 countries that fell under the product market reform of the SMP (see Table 1). The measure
is defined as the share of three-digit classes per two-digit industries of SMP-countries that were ex ante expected to
be a↵ected by the reform. The measure is set to zero in all years before the implementation of the reform, from 1992
onwards it takes a positive value in country-industries that were ex ante expected to be a↵ected, otherwise zero.
Country-industries with higher values were expected to be a↵ected more than others.

Notes: In this table we provide OLS estimates of basic models explaining R&D intensity
in our main sample, an unbalanced panel of 2,761 observations on 13 manufacturing
industries in 17 European countries between 1987 and 2003.
R&D intensitycit is defined as R&D expenditures over value added. The product market
reform intensity, Product market reformscit , equals zero in all years before the implemen-
tation of the SMP, from 1992 onwards it takes positive values up to 1 with higher values
for country-industries that were ex ante expected to be a↵ected more by the SMP than
others. The measure Patent protectionct is coded one as soon as a country completed its
reforms preparing the ground for a strong patent protection regime, and zero otherwise.
Standard errors in parentheses are robust and clustered to allow for unrestricted corre-
lation between annual observations within country-industries. Statistical significance at
the 1% level is indicated by ***.

Notes: In this table we provide OLS and IV estimates of R&D intensity models for our main sample, an unbal-
anced panel of 2,761 observations on 13 manufacturing industries in 17 European countries between 1987 and
2003.
R&D intensitycit is defined as R&D expenditures over value added. The product market reform measure Rcit
equals zero in all years before the implementation of the SMP, from 1992 onwards it takes positive values up to 1
with higher values for country-industries that were ex ante expected to be a↵ected more by the SMP than others.
Country groups are indicated by G(·). The group G(Pc,strong pre sample (ps) ) covers the countries where patent pro-
tection P is strong in the pre-sample period and throughout the sample period. The group G(Pc,weak   pre sample (ps) )
covers the countries with weaker patent protection.
The measure ProtectionGP ct is the patent protection index of Ginarte and Park (1997) and Park (2008). In column
5, we exclude the instrument Rcit *G(Pstrong
                                         c, ps ). The number of first stage equations is given in brackets at the
bottom of column 5.
The variable Knowledge stockci,1986 is the patent-based knowledge stock per country-industry in 1986.
Standard errors in parentheses are robust and clustered to allow for unrestricted correlation between annual
observations within country-industries. Statistical significance at the 1% and 5% level is indicated by *** and **.

Notes: In this table we provide OLS estimates of R&D intensity models for our main sample, also used
in Table 4.
Country-industry groups are indicated by G(·). We divide the country-group with strong pre-sample
patent protection, as well as the one with weaker protection, into industry-specific sub-groups based on
the patent relevance in industry i, Patent relevance (I)i,ps . Measure Ii,ps reflects for each industry i the
level of the patent intensity in the corresponding US industry in the pre-sample period, 1980 to 1986.
The group with above median patent relevance covers the six industries that constitute in all pre-sample
years the industries with the six highest patent intensities, and the other group complements. The group
with high patent relevance covers the three sampled industries that constitute in all pre-sample years
the industries with the three highest patent intensities. The group with low patent relevance covers the
three industries that score lowest, and the remaining seven industries form the intermediate group.
All other variables are defined as in Table 4. Standard errors in parentheses are robust and clustered
to allow for unrestricted correlation between annual observations within country-industries. Statistical
significance at the 1%, 5% and 10% level is indicated by ***, ** and *.

Notes: In this table we provide OLS estimates of models explaining real R&D expenditures for our main sample,
also used in Table 4. The OLS estimates of models explaining patent counts are for the sub-sample with all
2,031 observations for the years 1987 to 1999.
The variable Real R&D expenditurescit is defined as R&D expenditures at constant prices in 2000 converted to
US dollars using purchasing power parity rates (in billion). The measure Patent countcit is a fractional count
of patents taken out per country-industry-year in the US Patent Office.

Note: In columns 1 and 2 we provide OLS estimates of R&D intensity models with financial
interaction terms for the sub-sample where all observations with missing values of the private credit
measure are eliminated from the main sample, as used in Table 4. Country-industry groups are
indicated by G(·). The variable Financial Development(FD)high  c, ps is coded one for countries where
the private credit measure takes values at or above the 75 percentile of the sample distribution,
otherwise zero. We divide the country-group with high financial development into industry-specific
sub-groups according to our measure of reliance on external finance, External finance (E)highi, ps : the
group with low (high) reliance covers the industries below the 25th percentile (at or above the 75th
percentile) of the sample distribution of the reliance measure, and the group with medium reliance
covers the remaining industries. Reliance on external finance in industry i is defined as reliance
in the corresponding US industry during the 1980s, provided by Rajan and Zingales (1998).
In columns 3 and 4 we provide OLS estimates of R&D intensity models with knowledge stock
interaction terms for the main sample. The country-industry group G(Knowledge stockhigh         ci,1986 )
consists of the country-industries where the knowledge stock control, defined as in Table 4, takes
values at or above the median of the sample distribution, otherwise zero.
All other variables are defined as in Tables 4 and 5. Standard errors in parentheses are robust
and clustered to allow for unrestricted correlation between annual observations within country-
industries. Statistical significance at the 1%, 5% and 10% level is indicated by ***, ** and *.

Notes: The R&D-intensity model estimates in column 1 is for the sub-sample, resulting after eliminating
all non-SMP countries from the main sample, as used in Table 4. The estimates in column 2 are for
the extended sample covering the main sample plus the data for the US. For the estimates in column
3 we add data for all 8 available service industries to the main sample; note that patent data is not
available for service industries and, thus, we estimate models without the patent-based controls for the
initial innovative potential of country-industries.
All variables are defined as in Tables 4 and 5. Standard errors in parentheses are robust and clustered
to allow for unrestricted correlation between annual observations within country-industries. Statistical
significance at the 1% and 5% level is indicated by *** and **.

Appendix B: Data sources and variables

B.1 Research and development expenditures
Our main measure of innovation is R&D intensity, that is nominal R&D expenditures as a
percentage of nominal value added. For calculating that measure we use country-industry-
year level data on research and development expenditures from the OECD ANBERD
database (edition 2011, www.oecd.org/sti/anberd)1 and data on value added from the
EU KLEMS database (2008 version, http://www.euklems.net/index.html).2 We also
consider real R&D at constant prices of the year 2000 converted to United States (US)
dollars using purchasing power parity rates.3

B.2 Patenting
The country-industry-year-specific patent counts which we use were constructed by the
EU KLEMS consortium. They aggregated the NBER patent data (2002 version, http:
//elsa.berkeley.edu/~bhhall/patents.html) on patents granted by the US Patent
and Trademark Office per year at the country-industry level, including data for patents
applied for up to the year 1999 (O’Mahony, Castaldi, Los, Bartelsmann, Mainaiti and
Peng, 2008; Hall et al., 2001). Patents are assigned to years according to the application
date recorded in the patent document and to countries according to the country of the
first inventor. For our main empirical analysis we use the fractional patent count where
each patent is counted in all n OTAF classes it is assigned to with a weight of 1/n. The
patents are assigned to up to 7 OTAF classes and all classes (41 OTAF classes, plus one
“other industries” class) are mapped into EU KLEMS industry classes (see O’Mahony et
al., 2008, for further details).4
To construct the knowledge stock built up during the pre-sample period in each country-
industry we use pre-sample patent information, the perpetual inventory method, and an
annual knowledge depreciation rate of 20 percent. The knowledge stock is defined as the
sum of the fractional patent counts, refer to the pre-sample period, are depreciated to the
last year of the pre-sample period and divided by 1000.5

     For Denmark and Sweden we add in the data from ANBERD 2009. These countries have been
missing in ANBERD 2011 until we completed the empirical analysis that we provide here.

     The EU KLEMS Growth and Productivity Accounts provide country-industry level panel data based
on data from national statistical offices and designed to ensure international comparability. The EU
KLEMS project was a joint initiative of several academic institutions and national economic policy
research institutes, supported from various statistical offices and the OECD, and funded by the European
Commission (O’Mahony and Timmer, 2009).
   3
     To calculate the required series of value added at year 2000 prices converted to US dollars, we draw
nominal value added and the related price index, re-based from 1995 to 2000, from EU KLEMS 2008
and convert to US dollars using the economy-wide purchasing power parity rates as provided along with
ANBERD 2011.
   4
     Our main empirical findings are robust to using total patent counts where each patent is counted
with full weight in each class it is assigned to.
   5
     Our main empirical findings are robust to using alternative depreciation rates; we also tested 10
percent and 30 percent.

B.3 Patent Rights
To measure the strength of patent rights, that is intellectual property rights (IPR) as laid
down in patent laws,6 we prefer to distinguish between countries with strong and weak
patent rights using information on patent law reforms and related regulation.7 The fol-
lowing countries had strong patent protection regimes before 1987 and maintained strong
regimes throughout the whole sample period: Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy,
Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom (plus the United States). The countries
with weaker patent protection regimes completed the major patent law reform preparing
the ground for a strong patent protection regime in 1992, or even later: Czech Republic,
Finland, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Poland, Portugal, Spain, and the Slovak Republic.
All European countries that we classified as having strong patent rights, except for Den-
mark, have been among the initital contracting states of the European Patent Organi-
sation (EPOrg) since October 1977. The EPOrg is the intergovernmental organization
that was created in 1977 by its contracting states to grant patents in Europe under the
European Patent Convention of 1973; the European Patent Office (EPO) acts as the ex-
ecutive body for the Organization. All the countries classified as having weaker patent
rights joined the EPOrg between October 1986 and March 2004 (EPOrg, 2012) and none of
these countries completed the reforms preparing the ground for a strong patent protection
regime before 1992 (Branstetter et al., 2006, Qian, 2007, WIPO, 2012). Our classification
is fully consistent with the groupings in Branstetter et al., 2006 or Qian, 2007. It also
fits with the patent right index constructed by Maskus and Penubarti (1995): The patent
laws of all the countries that we classify as countries with strong patent rights were fully
conforming with the minimum standards of the US Chamber of Commerce Intellectual
Property Task Force in 1984 (Maskus and Penubarti, 1995); the patent laws of all other
countries did not fulfill it in 1984 or were planned economies not covered by Maskus and
Penubarti (1995).
For robustness checks, we also use the index of patent protection that was developed by
Ginarte and Park (1997) and updated by Park (2008). Park (2008) provides the index
data for 110 countries, updating it quinquennially between 1960 and 2005. The index
takes values between zero and five and higher values indicate patent laws with stronger
IPR. The index coding scheme aggregates information on 1) membership in international
patent agreements (Paris Convention 1883, International Convention for the Protection
of New Varieties of Plants 1961, Patent Cooperation Treaty 1970, Budapest Treaty 1977,
Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) 1994), 2)
provisions for loss of protection (working requirements, compulsory licensing, revocation of
patents), 3) enforcement mechanisms (preliminary injunctions, contributory infringement
pleadings, burden of proof reversal), 4) duration of protection and 5) extent of cover-
age (pharmaceuticals, chemicals, food, surgical products, microorganisms, utility models,
software, plant and animal varieties). Relevant in the context of our study is the updated
   6
     The strength of patent rights and the strength of other forms of IPR, in particular copyrights and
trademarks, tend to be strongly correlated.

     See, in particular, Branstetter, Fisman and Foley, 2006, Lerner, 2000, Maskus, 2000, Maskus and
Penubarti, 1995, Qian, 2007, and World Intellectual Property Organization, 2012.

coding scheme described in Appendix A of Park (2008); Ginarte and Park (1997) give
details on the original coding scheme.
We classify industries according to the extent to which innovators rely on patenting and,
thus, should respond to the strength of patent rights, forming industry groups with di↵er-
ent levels of patent relevance. To do so, we first calculate the nominal patent intensity for
US industries in all pre-sample years 1980 to 1986, dividing the fractional patent counts
by nominal value added in million US dollars.8 Then, we form industry groups, exploiting
the fact that the ranking of US industries based on the calculated patent intensity is very
persistent across the pre-sample years: the group with high patent relevance covers the
three sampled industries that constitute in all years the industries with the three highest
patent intensities; the group with low patent relevance covers the three industries that
score lowest, and the remaining seven industries form the intermediate group. Alterna-
tively, we form two groups. One group consists of the six industries that constitute in
all years the industries with the six highest patent intensities and are, thus, above the
median, and the other group complements.

B.4 Product market reform
The product market reform that we focus on constitutes a substantial part of the large-
scale European Single Market Program. With the SMP, as designed by the European
Commission and, thus, at a supra-national level, the EU aimed at bringing down barriers
to the free movement of products and production factors within the EU in order to foster
competition, innovation and economic growth. Recent empirical evidence supports the
view that product market competition increased in response to the SMP product market
reform.9 The SMP was officially implemented in 1992 in all sampled countries that had
joined the EU before 1992: Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy,
Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, United Kingdom.
For these SMP countries, the European Commission report by Buigues et al. (1990) pro-
vides a common list of 40 three-digit manufacturing industries that were ex ante expected
to be a↵ected di↵erently by the SMP. Additions to and removals from the common list
are also reported for each sampled country. These additions and removals reflect recom-
mendations of experts, who were asked whether they expected the reform to change the
product market conditions in an individual industry in a specific country di↵erently than
in the corresponding average industry in SMP countries. The reform measures that can
be derived from the information in Buigues et al. (1990) vary across countries, industries
and time; a fact which we exploit to identify the reform impact from confounding influ-
ences. As our main data set covers non-SMP countries as well, we can also use further
data variation across countries.10
To construct our main measure of the product market reform we aggregate the information
  8
    Using data on US industries is advantageous here as the US is the worldwide leading innovator in
most industries and it is not included in our main sample.
  9
    See, for example, Bottasso and Sembenelli (2001), Badinger (2007), or Griffith et al. (2010).
 10
    In section 5.3, we show the estimation results for the sample of SMP countries only.



                                                     43
in Buigues et al. (1990) as follows:
                               (        P
                                   1
                                   ni       j2i   Ajct if t 1992
                      Rict =                                        P
                                                    0 if t < 1992 or j2i Ajct = 0

The measure is set to zero in all years before the implementation of the SMP, from 1992
onwards it is equal to the share of three-digit classes j per two-digit industry i of SMP-
country c that were ex ante expected to be a↵ected by the SMP. The dummy variable
A is coded one from 1992 onwards if a three-digit industry j in a country c was ex ante
expected to be a↵ected. The number of three-digit industries per two-digit industry is
denoted by ni .
Using our measure of the SMP product market reform, we can rank all industries in our
data set. The resulting rank order corresponds to the rank order of Griffith et al. (2010),
except for two deviations. Griffith et al. (2010) constructed a related, but di↵erent
product market reform measure. In their data set the industry ‘furniture, jewelery, games
& toys, environmental technology, recycling’ is missing; in ours the industry ‘pulp, paper,
printing & publishing’ is missing. They used the information in Buigues et al. (1990) for
the common list of a↵ected industries, the removals from that list, the industry groups
as used by the report, and the data on employment shares for weighting purposes. We,
instead, also use the information on additions to the common list, but neither the industry
grouping nor the employment shares for the following reasons: Greece and Portugal, for
example, had many additions and these countries are included in our data set; Buigues
et al. (1990) provide neither the industry grouping nor the employment shares for the
industries that are added to the common list.
To address concerns regarding our main product market reform measure, we also consider
alternative measures. First, we replace the reform intensity measure with an indicator
which equals one for all values of the product market reform intensity above the median
of the sample distribution in SMP-a↵ected country-industries, and else zero. Then, the
estimation results turn out to be consistent with those in columns 4 of Tables 4 and 5.
Second, while we prefer to use the main SMP implementation year (1992) as switching
point from zero to positive reform intensity values,11 we also construct an indicator that
takes values above zero already from 1988 onwards. This adds as SMP years the years
where first information on expected SMP e↵ects became available and where some ini-
tial implementation steps were undertaken.12 When using that alternative measure, the
estimation results are again in line with those in columns 4 of Tables 4 and 5.




  11
     The empirical findings of Badinger (2007), among others, provide support for this decision and Griffith
et al. (2010) also chose that approach.
  12
     Bottasso and Sembenelli (2001) and Aghion et al. (2009) took that approach.


                                                             44
B.5 Financial variables
For the financial variables which we use in section 5.3 of the paper we use data from the
November 2010 version of the Financial Development and Structure Database by Beck et
al. (2000, 2010b) and from Rajan and Zingales (1998).13
First, we classify countries according to the level of their financial sector development
using data on the channeling of savings to investors by financial intermediaries relative
to the size of the economy. Our preferred measure from the Financial Development and
Structure Database is the following private credit ratio: claims of deposit money banks
and other financial institutions on the private sector, relative to gross domestic product
(GDP). The ratio is available for all sampled countries, except the Czech Republic and the
Slovak Republic, for at least four pre-sample years between 1980 and 1986. We average
all pre-sample entries per country and classify the countries with averages at or above
the 75 percentile of the sample distribution as having a highly developed financial sector.
These countries are France, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden.
Our alternative measure of high financial sector development is based on stock market
capitalization, that is the value of listed shares, relative to GDP. As data on this stock
market measure is hardly available before 1989, we average across the years 1989 and
1990.14 The countries with averages at or above the 75 percentile of the sample distri-
bution are classified as those with high financial sector development, namely Belgium,
Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom.
Second, we separate between industries that di↵er in their reliance on external finance.
To that aim we use industry-level data on the share of capital expenditures that firms
cannot finance internally: the ratio of firms’ capital expenditures minus cash flow from
operations, divided by capital expenditures. Rajan and Zingales (1998) provide that
data for US industries during the 1980s. We link the industries in our sample to the
corresponding US industries and then distinguish three industry groups. The group with
low reliance on external finance covers the industries with ratios below the 25th percentile
of the sample distribution, the group with high reliance on external finance covers the
industries with ratios at or above the 75th percentile, and the remaining industries form
the medium group.


Appendix C: Construction of main estimation sample
Our main estimation sample is an unbalanced panel of 13 industries in 17 countries be-
tween 1987 and 2003. We apply the following standard data cleaning routines. We drop
country-industry-year observations with missing values of variables that are relevant to
our regression analysis. In addition, we eliminate a few observations with negative R&D
expenditures or unreasonably small, positive R&D expenditures (below 1500 Euro) and all
  13
     See       http://econ.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTDEC/EXTRESEARCH/0,,contentMDK:
20696167~pagePK:64214825~piPK:64214943~theSitePK:469382,00.html.
  14
     Even for these years, missing data prevents us from calculating the measure of stock market capital-
ization for the Czech Republic, Hungary, Ireland, Poland, and the Slovak Republic.


                                                        45
observations with absolute R&D expenditure growth of more than 200 percent. Finally,
we eliminate all country-industries where we observe less than five consecutive years.15
Due to restrictions regarding patent data availability, our patent sample is limited to
the observation period between 1987 and 1999. When setting up the patent sample, we
eliminate all country-industries of the 13 industries in the 17 countries where we observe
less than five consecutive years within this time period.16




  15
     In case of country-industries with two separate series with at least five observations, we select the
earlier one.
  16
     Cases with two separate series of sufficient length do not arise.
