       Spending on health care is the largest and fastest growing element of government

budgets in the United States. Despite our ostensibly private health system, almost half of

medical spending is done by the government, primarily through the $400 billion

Medicare program and the $300 billion Medicaid program. Yet the third largest

government expenditure on health care is not included in this calculation: the exclusion

of employer-sponsored insurance (ESI) expenditures from taxable income. In $2009 the

U.S. state & federal governments will lose roughly $260 billion from the fact that

expenditures by employers (and more than 80% of expenditures by employees) on ESI

are not taxed as compensation. This is by far the largest of the tax expenditures by the

federal government.

       There are a number of coherent rationales for the ESI exclusion. In particular, in

the absence of viable pooling mechanisms outside the employment setting in the U.S., the

exclusion can be rationalized as the “glue” that holds employer pools together. At the

same time, there are a number of problems associated with the exclusion. In particular, a

number of studies document that the ESI exclusion leads to (likely inefficient) increases

in insurance plan generosity. This exclusion is also highly regressive as both tax rates

and ESI expenditures rise with income. As a result, economists have for years advocated

reform of this tax expenditure.

       Recently, policy makers have taken up this charge as well. Most notably,

President Bush’s 2008 budget proposed to replace the ESI exclusion with an individual

deduction of $7500 for individuals holding health insurance. The Senate Finance

Committee initially proposed to finance part of its expansion of health insurance in 2009

through a cap on the exclusion of high cost insurance plans. The Senate then moved to a
“Cadillac tax,” an excise on high-cost insurance plans (with premiums of more than

$8500 for singles and $23,000 for families) levied on insurers. Given that this excise tax

would be likely to be passed on through higher insurance prices, this approximates the

impact of capping the tax exclusion at those levels.

       In this paper, I discuss the ESI exclusion and options for reform. I begin by

providing background on the ESI system and its place in the larger insurance context in

the United States. In Part II, I discuss the pros and cons of the ESI exclusion, and review

evidence on the impacts of the exclusion on individual and firm behavior. Part III

discusses the issues in modeling reform to the ESI exclusion. Part IV presents estimates

of the extent of the ESI exclusion, and presents a variety of reform options for the

exclusion. Part VI concludes.



           Part I: Background on ESI and Insurance Coverage in the U.S.

       The goal of insurance providers is to create large pools of individuals with

predictable distributions of risk. These pools can be created in many different ways; in

the limit, national health insurance such as in Canada provides one national pool. The

United States has long relied on the employer as the main pooling device for insurance.

The growth in ESI dates back to the wage and price controls of WWII, which could be

evaded through more generous provision of (untaxed) employee benefits, although the

exclusion itself was not codified until several years later; these issues are reviewed in

Thomasson (2000) and in Helms (2008).
         Table 1 shows the distribution of insurance coverage in the U.S. in 2008 (EBRI,

2009). Over 61% of the non-elderly population receives ESI, which is 70% of all

privately or publicly insured and 91% of the privately insured. Those over 65 are

universally covered by the Medicare program, although a major expenditure of the ESI

system is retiree coverage. The major non-ESI source of coverage for those under age 65

is the Medicaid program, which provides insurance to low income families, disabled and

elderly.

         Only 10% of private insurance is provided outside of the employment setting in

the non-group market. While there are variations in the strength and regulation of this

market across states, by and large it is a market where prices are high and variable, and

where (in most states) individuals can be excluded entirely from coverage based on their

health status. At a basic level, most argue, there is a fundamental failure of insurance

pooling in this market. 1 Attempts to remedy this in states such as NY through

community rating laws have led to excessively high premiums on average and an exit of

healthy individuals from the market (AHIP, 2007).

         The ESI exclusion initially applied only to expenditures by employers. But over

time there has been a sizeable growth in Section 125 cafeteria plans, which allow

employees (since 1978) to shelter their contributions to ESI from taxation as well.

Currently, roughly 80% of those with ESI have access to a Section 125 account, although

coverage is still very incomplete among small firms.



1
  There are some dissenting voices on this issue. Pauly and Herring (1999), for example, argue that prices
in the nongroup market do not vary much more by health status than do group premiums. An important
problem with that analysis, however, is that they are only able to examine the premiums paid by those who
are allowed into the nongroup market; if individuals are excluded based on health, as seems to be the case,
then this is a truncated distribution and would understate the true underlying variation on health.
                    Part II: Benefits and Costs of the ESI Exclusion

Why Have an ESI Exclusion?

       In this section I review the arguments for and against an ESI exclusion. As

discussed earlier, the ESI exclusion grew out of a compensation anomaly around World

War II, not any coherent rationale. Nevertheless, as we consider reforming the ESI

exclusion, it is important to contemplate its benefits and costs.

       The main argument for continuing the ESI exclusion is that it is the glue that

holds together our existing system of employer-provided insurance. Repealing the

exclusion by taxing health insurance benefits, some argue, will lead employers to stop

offering health insurance to their employees. This will leave employees without access to

actuarially fair pooling mechanisms and at the whim of the non-group market. But the

non-group market may exclude those who are sick, leading to a large welfare cost from

the reduction in insurance to those who value it most.

       The extent to which this concern is valid depends on two factors. The first is how

large an effect removing the ESI exclusion would have on employer offering of

insurance. Employees value employers as an insurance purchasing mechanism for

several reasons, of which the exclusion is only one; there are also the benefits of group

purchase, negotiating power from group size, and ease of plan choice and administration.

These will still be present even if the ESI exclusion is ended. Indeed, virtually all

medium size and large firms in the U.S. have offered health insurance continuously over

the past thirty years, despite enormous swings in the effective tax price of health

insurance.
       Gruber and Lettau (2004) examine the impact of tax price variation on employer-

provided insurance; the larger literature on this topic is reviewed in Gruber (2004). They

find that medium-sized firms are only very modestly sensitive, and large firms not at all

sensitive, to the tax price of ESI. They do find that small firms are price sensitive, with

an elasticity of small firm offering with respect to the tax price of -0.69. Therefore, while

predicting the impacts of removing the exclusion go out of sample, there is no reason to

think that there will be a wholescale exit of medium and large firms from ESI. I

incorporate these estimates into the modeling below.

       The second unknown factor is how a major influx of individuals into the non-

group market will affect pricing in that market. The non-group market may function

much better when its scale is dramatically increased by individuals leaving employer-

sponsored insurance. While this may lower overall costs, however, there is little reason

to think that it would reduce the enormous disparities in price and access by health status.

Therefore, absent other reforms to make insurance available to all outside the employer

setting, there is a reasonable second-best argument for maintaining the ESI exclusion.



Costs of an ESI Exclusion

       Offsetting these benefits are the major costs of the ESI exclusion. First is the

revenue cost of the exclusion, estimated below. Second, this tax expenditure is highly

regressive, as documented below, as both tax rates and ESI expenditures rise with

income. The ESI exclusion also biases individuals towards purchasing excessively

generous insurance because they are paying with after-tax dollars on the margin.
       There is a sizeable literature which tries to estimate the elasticity of health

spending with respect to the tax exclusion, as reviewed in Gruber (2005). Gruber and

Lettau (2004) estimate a sizeable elasticity of employer-spending among those firms

offering insurance with respect to tax price of -0.7. This reflects both reductions in

insurance generosity, however, and reductions in employer contributions that are shifted

to employee contributions. Direct evidence on plan generosity comes from Gentry and

Perress (1994), who used city-level variation in tax rates to show that more “elective”

elements of benefits packages, such as dental and vision coverage, were very price

sensitive.

       Of course, elasticity of spending with respect to the tax price doesn’t necessarily

imply distortion, if there is a pre-existing bias to too little health insurance spending. But

this does not appear to be the case. Existing evidence, particularly from the RAND

Health Insurance Experiment, is clear that the optimal health insurance plan features high

initial cost-sharing with protection against extreme out of pocket risk (Gruber, 2007).

Yet, even in today’s high health cost environment, the vast majority of employer-insured

individuals have very modest cost sharing, with a relative paucity of high deductible

plans in the ESI setting. While there are several competing explanation for this “over-

insurance”, a leading contender is the tax subsidy to ESI.

       Finally, the promotion of the employer-sponsored insurance system is not

necessarily a benefit to society. A large literature documents the distortions to the labor

market associated with such a system, as reviewed in Gruber and Madrian (2004),

including limited job to job mobility and distorted retirement decisions.
                          Part III: Modeling the ESI Exclusion

       To model the cost of the existing ESI exclusion, and to consider the impacts of

options to reform the exclusion, I turn to a microsimulation model that I have developed

over the past decade to model health insurance reform. This model is described in great

detail in Gruber (2009), so I just summarize the key elements here, focusing in particular

on the newly updated matching of employer premium costs that are central to the revenue

estimate for the ESI exclusion.

       The model takes as its base data from the February and March, 2005 Current

Population Survey, recalibrated to 2008 populations. To these data are matched to

information on health insurance premiums and health costs. Data on the premiums for

employer insurance, and the distribution of premiums between employers and employees,

comes from the 2004 MEPS. For non-group insurance, I use data from the MEPS to

compute the underlying distribution of health spending by age and health status, and then

add a load factor such that the distribution of premiums by age matches available data.

All figures in the analysis are in $2009, and I use tax law as of 2009. I assume that the

reaction to reform is immediate; in reality there could be a transition to the new

equilibrium shown in the model.

       These data are used to develop a micro-simulation model that computes the

effects of health insurance policies on the distribution of health care spending and private

and public sector health care costs. This model takes as inputs both the data sources

described above and the detailed parameterization of reform options. The model first

turns these policy rules into a set of insurance price changes; for example, if the policy

intervention is a tax credit for non-group insurance, then the model computes the implied
percentage change in the price of nongroup insurance for each individual in the model.

These prices changes are then run through a detailed set of behavioral assumptions about

how changes in the absolute and relative price of various types of insurance affect

individuals, families, and businesses.

         The key concept behind this modeling is that the impact of tax reforms on the

price of insurance continuously determines behaviors such as insurance take-up by the

uninsured and insurance offering by employers. The model assiduously avoids “knife-

edge” type behavior, where some critical level is necessary before individuals respond,

and beyond which responses are very large. Instead, behavior is modeled as a continuous

function of how policy changes (net of tax) insurance prices.

         An important element of the modeling is therefore properly measuring the impact

of the tax exclusion on the price of employer-sponsored insurance. The impact of the

exclusion is to alter the tax price of employer sponsored insurance to:

       TP = (1 - f - s - ss - mc)
                    1+ ss + mc
where τf is the federal income tax marginal rate; τs is the state income tax marginal rate;

τss is the marginal payroll tax rate for the OASDI program (the 6.2% tax rate that is

levied equally on employees and employers); and τMC is the marginal payroll tax rate for

the Medicare HI program. 2 I differentiate the latter two programs because, beginning in

the early 1990s, the taxable maximum for the HI program was increased above that for

the OASDI program (and was eventually removed altogether); the marginal rate is zero

above the taxable maximum for payroll taxation. For a typical worker in the 15% tax


2
  The reason that the payroll tax rate is additive in the denominator is that the employer is indifferent
between purchasing one dollar of benefits or paying wages of 1/(1+ τss + τmc), since each dollar of wages
requires a payroll tax payment as well.
bracket, facing a 5% state tax rate and a 15.3% combined payroll tax rate, this tax price is

roughly 0.65; a dollar of health insurance costs 35 cents less than a dollar of other goods

purchased with after-tax wages.

          In doing this type of analysis, a number of assumptions must be made about how

individuals will respond to tax subsidies, through their effect on the price of insurance.

These assumptions have been developed based on the available empirical evidence

reviewed above, although there are many holes in this literature that must be filled in

order to fully simulate policy effects. These assumptions are reviewed in detail in Gruber

(2009).

          A key aspect of modeling health insurance policy is appropriately reflecting the

decisions of firms. Economists tend to model firm decision-making as reflecting the

aggregation of worker preferences within the firm. The exact aggregation function is

unclear, as reviewed in Gruber (2002); in my model I assume that the mean incentives for

the firm (e.g. the average subsidy rate for non-group insurance) is what matters for firm

decision-making.

          The fundamental problem faced by individual-based micro-simulation models is

that data on individuals does not reflect the nature of their co-workers, so that it is

impossible to exactly compute concepts such as the average non-group subsidy in a

worker’s firm. I address this problem by building “synthetic firms” in the CPS, assigning

each CPS worker a set of co-workers selected to represent the likely true set of co-

workers in that firm. The core of this computation is data from the Bureau of Labor

Statistics that show, for workers of any given earnings level, the earnings distribution of

their co-workers, separately by firm size, region of the country, and health insurance
offering status. Using these data, I randomly select 99 individuals in the same firm

size/region/health insurance offering cell as a given CPS worker in order to statistically

replicate the earnings distribution for that worker’s earnings level. These 99 workers

then become the co-workers in a worker’s synthetic firm.

       These synthetic firms then face three decisions about insurance: offering (whether

to offer if now not offering, or whether to drop if now offering); the division of costs

between employer and employees; and the level of insurance spending. Each of these is

influenced by the tax treatment of ESI expenditures. For example, if both employer and

employee ESI expenditures are subjected to taxation, this will lower offering; will lead to

some shifting of premiums to individuals, since there was much less than full Section 125

coverage so the existing exclusion led to a bias in aggregate to employer spending; and

will lead to a reduction in the generosity of ESI. Taxing just employer spending on ESI

(while leaving employee contributions untaxed if through a Section 125 plan), however,

will lead to a small reduction in offering and plan generosity, but a much larger shift from

employer to employee financing of the premiums. Likewise, removing the Section 125

tax shield but retaining the exclusion for employer spending will lead to a smaller

reduction in offering and plan generosity, but a shift from employee to employer

financing of premiums.

       While there are a large number of assumptions underlying the model, I focus here

on the key assumptions about firm behavior. Firm decisions to offer insurance if the tax

price falls (or to drop insurance if the tax price rises) are based on the size-specific

elasticities of insurance offering estimated in Gruber and Lettau (2004). In particular,

that paper finds that small firms (with fewer than 100 employees) are fairly price elastic
in their insurance decisions, with an elasticity of insurance offering with respect to its

price of -0.69. On the other hand, they estimate only a small and insignificant impact on

medium firms, and even smaller for large firms (more than 1000 employees). In the

model,

         A key assumption for this type of modeling is the assumption on the wage

incidence of changes in employer-insurance spending. Gruber (2001) reviews the

literature on incidence, and concludes that there is strong evidence for full shifting to

wages of firm-wide changes in insurance costs, with some evidence of shifting to sub-

groups within the workplace as well. I make a mixed incidence assumption for this

model. Any firm-wide reaction, such as dropping insurance or lowering employee

contributions, is directly reflected in wages. Yet any individual’s decision, such as

switching from group to non-group insurance, is not reflected in that individual’s wages;

rather, the savings to the firm (or the cost to the firm) is passed along on average to all

workers in the firm.

         This analysis is subject to three major limitations. First, I approximate the tax

expenditure associated with retirees that receive tax favored employer spending. It is

difficult to estimate the cost of this element of the tax expenditure, but based on

comparison with estimates from the Joint Tax Committee I estimate that firms spend 10%

of their ex-ante spending on retirees. Therefore, I calculate the effects of tax policy in the

ex-ante world, and adjust overall tax changes upward by 10% of that ex-ante amount.

         Second, I do not consider any feedback effects through changing composition of

insurance pools. In current employer-sponsored insurance pools, healthy and young

workers cross-subsidize their sick and older co-workers by paying community rated
insurance premiums that don’t vary by age or health. Part of the reason that they are

willing to undertake this cross-subsidization is that it is the only tax subsidized route to

health insurance. If that tax subsidy is removed (or mitigated), then healthy workers may

find better prices in a more closely experience-rated non-group market, and to some

extent abandon the cross-subsidized employer pools. This will raise the price of ESI,

which could exert further pressure on healthy workers to exit. This potentially important

spiral of rising premiums is not included in the analysis. This effect could be reinforced

through the reduced influence of non-discrimination rules that are enforced indirectly

through the tax exclusion.

         Third, and most importantly, there is an enormous amount of uncertainty

associated with such a modeling exercise. A number of the key parameters on which

these results depend, such as the tax-price elasticity estimates in Gruber and Lettau

(2004), are estimated based on within sample variation in tax rates which is very modest

relative to the complete elimination of the tax exclusion. As a result, the farther out of

sample is the projected policy, the larger is the uncertainty attached to the estimates

below.



                 Part IV: The ESI Exclusion: Costs and Reform Options

Base Case

         The base results for the cost and distributional impacts of the ESI exclusion are

presented in Table 2. The first row provides the total federal revenue cost of the ESI

exclusion, which is $263 billion. The next two rows divides that into federal income tax
and federal payroll tax components; roughly 60% of the revenue cost of the exclusion is

through federal income taxes.

       The next row shows as a note that there is a major state income tax revenue loss

from the exclusion as well of over $30 billion in $2009. The analysis in the remainder of

the paper will focus on federal revenue effects only, but this is an important consideration

for states if the reforming the exclusion is used to finance coverage expansions for which

states bear some cost.

       The second panel of the table displays the distribution of the benefits of the ESI

exclusion. About one-sixth of the benefits of the exclusion go to those in the lower half

of the income distribution, and five-sixth to the upper half. The share of the benefits to

the top income decile are more than thirty times as large as those to the bottom income

decile. As noted earlier, this skewed distribution reflects both rising tax rates and rising

ESI expenditures with income. This is illustrated in the third panel, which shows that

both aggregate ESI expenditures and tax rates rise with income.



Options for Repeal

       Table 3 extends the analysis to consider various forms of repeal of the ESI

exclusion. The second column of Table 3 shows the results of repeal of the ESI

exclusion. The financial results are identical to Table 2, but I also show impacts on

insurance spending and coverage; the first column provides the ex-ante means of these

variables. Recall that these findings must be interpreted with considerable caution, as

they are using the price elasticity estimated from existing variations in the tax price to

estimate the impact of a much more radical change in policy.
       I find that this policy leads to a reduction in employer insurance spending of

almost $183 billion, or about one-third of ex-ante employer spending. I also find that

employee insurance spending falls by $17 billion, or about 10% of ex-ante employee

spending. The last row of the second set of figures show the average employer annual

premiums and employee annual contributions for a single plan. At baseline, on average

in our sample, employers contribute $6850 and workers contribute $2030. When the

exclusion is removed, the employer contribution falls dramatically, while the worker

contribution rises slightly; overall worker spending falls, however, due to the reduction in

the ESI covered population.

       I estimate that the removal of the ESI exclusion leads to a reduction in the number

of individuals with ESI of 15 million, which is roughly 10% of the number of ex-ante

employer insured. This is a large number relative to the ex-ante stock of uninsured, 49

million, but is modest relative to the ex-ante stock of employer insured. I also estimate

that a number of those losing employer insurance will gain insurance through other

channels; roughly 30% of those losing ESI will choose to purchase non-group insurance

or move to public coverage. So only about 70% of those losing ESI become uninsured

according to these estimates.

       Given the results in the Gruber and Lettau (2004) paper that drive the estimated

employer responses, most of the reaction by employers happens in the small employer

sector; large employers have offered insurance fairly consistently over time as the tax

price has varied. There is relatively little change in employee take-up – most of the

reaction is in employer offering. Once again, as with other estimates, it is important to

remember that this is a largely out of sample prediction. In particular, if there is
significant health unraveling in the ESI pool of the type described above, the reduction in

ESI could be larger.

       Nevertheless, the policy leads to an increase in uninsurance of roughly 22% of the

ex-ante number of uninsured. Table 4 shows the age and health characteristics of those

ex-ante uninsured and group insured, and then for each run in Table 3 shows the

comparable characteristics of those become uninsured and who move to non-employer

insurance (non-group or public). Ex-ante, the uninsured are somewhat younger than the

employer-insured, but in significantly worse health: 75% of those on ESI are in excellent

or very good health, while only 60% of the uninsured are; and only 5% of those with ESI

are in fair or poor health, while over 10% of the uninsured are.

       When the exclusion is repealed, those becoming uninsured look very much like

those who are ex-ante employer-insured. They are slightly older, but of comparable

health. Relative to the ex-ante uninsured, this is a much healthier population, so the

overall health of the uninsured improves. Those becoming non-group or publicly insured

are much healthier than the average person in ESI; as noted earlier, it is the young and

healthy who will find it most attractive to “peel off” from ESI to other sources of

coverage when the tax subsidy is eroded. But this is a small share of those who were on

ESI. Overall, there does not appear to be much of a change in the health mix of those

remaining on ESI. This mitigates against any concern that we are missing dynamic

impacts on ESI premiums from an eroding ESI health pool.

       The third column of Table 3 (and the third set of columns of Table 4) considers

the impact of removing the subsidy to employer spending only, maintaining the

deductibility of section 125 accounts. Such a policy raises only $184 billion in new
revenues, or about 70% of the total from removing the exclusion on both employer and

employee spending. This is lower than the ex-ante proportion of insurance spending that

is done by employers, 75%, because of a shift of spending from newly taxed employer

spending to tax-sheltered employee spending. Indeed, employer insurance spending falls

by almost as much as in the previous column, while employee insurance spending rises

by $66 billion. This highlights the leakages in revenue raising that can arise from partial

reform. Moreover, this is likely an underestimate of such leakage, since my model does

not endogenize adoption of Section 125 accounts. Such a policy would likely lead to an

expansion of use of Section 125 accounts, and thereby even further shifting to employee

contributions (and out of taxable employer contributions).

       Column (4) shows the impact of the complementary policy: retaining the

exclusion for employer spending but removing the tax deductibility of employee

contributions through Section 125 account. This policy change raises $42 billion in

revenues, or only 16% as much as the full removal of the subsidy despite employee

contributions being 25% of employer spending ex ante. Once again, the reason is an

endogenous shift from employee to employer spending under this policy; employer

spending actually rises while employee spending falls by $42 billion, more than twice the

amount than in the case where the exclusion is fully repealed.

       The distribution of impacts is fairly similar in these two runs to the base case run

in column (2). The section 125 only repeal is slightly more progressive than the other

runs, reflecting the fact that tax favored employee payments are even more concentrated

with income than is employer spending
       The bottom of the table repeats the analysis, considering only the removal of the

tax exclusion for income tax purposes, but retaining the exclusion for payroll tax

purposes. If employer and/or employee spending on insurance was included in the wage

base and taxed for payroll tax purposes, there may be pressure for least some offsetting

increase in the social insurance benefits financed by those taxes. We may therefore

overstate the net revenue gain by considering the revenues raised by inclusion of ESI

spending in both the income and payroll tax bases.

       Including ESI expenditures in the income tax base only leads to an increase in

Federal revenues of almost $172 billion, which is roughly 65% of the revenues from

including payroll taxes as well. The impacts on insurance coverage, employer spending,

and employee spending are likewise proportionately smaller. Including ESI spending in

the income tax base only leads to an erosion of ESI of almost 10 million persons, and a

rise in the uninsured of almost 8 million. Employer insurance spending falls by $118

billion, and employee insurance spending falls by $14 billion.

       The distributional impacts of this policy differ significantly, however, from

including ESI in both the payroll and income tax bases. This policy is much more

progressive because income tax rates are much more progressive than those of the flat

(and capped) payroll tax. If only the income tax exclusion is removed, then the top half

of the income distribution bears 85% of the revenue burden.

       The remaining columns of the second panel show the effects of including only

employer spending in the tax base, and of including tax-sheltered employee spending

(e.g. repealing section 125 for these purposes). Once again, each of these partial reforms

is somewhat blunted by the shift across types of insurance spending. The sum of the
revenues raised by these partial reforms, $152 billion, is about 10% less than the revenue

raised from full repeal, or $172 billion.



Options for Capping the Exclusion

       Full repeal of the ESI exclusion is perceived as a radical policy prescription and

faces enormous political opposition. A natural alternative is to cap the ESI exclusion at

some level, perhaps high at first, and then gradually tightening. This was the approach

endorsed by the President’s Panel on Tax Reform, which proposed that ESI spending

above the typical cost of a Federal Employee Plan (at the time, $11,500 for a family) be

included in the base of taxable income. And 2008 Presidential candidate Hilary Clinton

included a cap on the exclusion of ESI premiums from taxation at the average premium

level for families making more than $200,000 per year.

       In Table 5, I examine the impact of proposals to cap the exclusion rather than

remove it all together. I assume initially that there is a total cap on employer plus

employee spending, and vary this below. There are many possible levels at which the

exclusion could be capped, and for this exercise I choose the median national level of

premiums; using the mean instead of the median yields similar results but about 17% less

revenues. In this table I show paired results for (a) capping for both income and payroll

tax purposes and (b) capping just for income tax purposes. The cap is at $5176 for single

plans and $13675 for family plans.

       I estimate that capping the ESI exclusion at the median level would raise about

$47 billion if the cap were applied to both income and payroll taxes, and about $32

billion if the cap were applied just to income taxes. This is about 18% of the amount
raised from full repeal. On the other hand, capping the exclusion is much more

progressive than removing it: for example, while about 17% of the revenues from repeal

for both income and payroll tax purposes are raised from the lower half of the income

distribution, only 6% of revenues from capping are raised from the lower half of the

income distribution. Capping does lead to a large reduction in employer and employee

spending, but it is only a fraction of the earlier amounts.

       Capping also has the virtue of being much less disruptive to existing insurance

arrangements. Modeling the impact of the cap on insurance coverage is challenging, of

course, because in principle capping at the median should not cause any firm to not offer

insurance, but in practice some firms will be uninterested in offering insurance unless it is

very generous – and some firms won’t be able to find an insurance policy that will be

taken up by their employees unless it is very generous. In those cases capping the

exclusion could lead firms to drop insurance coverage. I model the impact of a cap as

proportional to the impact of full repeal; that is, I compute the impact of the cap on the

effective tax subsidy facing firms and have firms react to the effective reduction in their

tax subsidy. Doing so, I find a fairly modest impact of capping on insurance

arrangements: only about 2 million individuals lose ESI, and the rolls of the uninsured

increase by only about 1 million.

       In the next set of columns in the Table I show the impact of capping the exclusion

solely for employer spending at its median level, $4378 for singles and $10,177 for

families. Capping only employer spending raises only three-quarters as much as capping

total spending, due to a large evasion of the cap through shifting to employee
contributions. As noted above, this estimate likely understates the shifting since I do not

endogenize the Section 125 decision.

       A major controversy with such tax caps, however, would arise around the issue of

who is hit by the caps. Taxing the highest levels of insurance spending will reduce the

incentives for excessively generous insurance – but it will also lead to the largest burdens

in high cost states and for firms with high cost workers. One response to this point is to

note that these groups are exactly the ones who have benefitted for years from this tax

exclusion, and all this policy does is remove a tax bias in their favor. This argument

faces political difficulties, however, as individuals will compare the policy change to the

baseline with the exclusion in place

       Some of this disparity could be readily addressed through adjustments to the cap

level itself. For example, the cap could be set on a state-specific basis, with the levels

above being adjusted up or down based on the relation of premiums in that state to the

national average to keep revenues constant. The cap could also be readily adjusted for

the average age mix of employees in a health plan. These adjustments are not perfect as

they would not capture variation in worker health beyond age. But if the tax exclusion is

removed in the context of a larger reform which moves the insurance system towards

community rating, these concerns would be minimized.



                                   Part VI: Conclusions

       While public policy debates around the structure of the two largest government

expenditure programs for health care, Medicare and Medicaid, there has traditionally

been little discussion of the third largest government (tax) expenditure, the exclusion of
ESI premiums from income and payroll taxation. Yet discussion about reform of the ESI

exclusion has heated up in recent years. In this paper I discuss the implications of the

existing exclusion and the impacts of reform.

       I conclude that the existing ESI exclusion is both very expensive and highly

regressive, with five-sixth of the benefits flowing to the top half of the income

distribution. Repealing or capping the exclusion could result in significant increases in

government revenues and an improvement in revenue raising progressivity. Yet it would

also lead to a significant reduction in insurance coverage. Thus, when considering

changes to the tax treatment of ESI, policy-makers may simultaneously wish to examine

other policies that affect the availability of non-ESI coverage.

Notes: Results from micro-simulation model described in the text. Top panel shows changes to both the income and payroll tax
treatment of ESI spending; bottom panel reforms the income tax treatment only. First two column shows ex ante characteristics of the
uninsured and employer-insured before reform, in terms of population size, average age, and distribution of health status. The next
pair of columns shows the number and characteristics of the population (a) moving into uninsured status and (b) moving onto non-
group or public insurance, as a result of repealing the exclusion. The next sets of columns show the same facts for repeal of the
employer subsidy only, then employee subsidy only.

Notes: Results from micro-simulation model described in the text. All dollar figures are in $2009. First set of columns shows changes
to both the income and payroll tax treatment of ESI spending; second set reforms the income tax treatment only. First column within
each set shows the impact of capping the sum of the employer and employee exclusion at the median employer plus employee
contribution to ESI; second shows the impact of capping the employer exclusion at the median employer contribution to ESI. Top
rows in each panel show the ex ante levels and changes in tax revenues, in total and by course, in millions of dollars. Next rows show
ex ante levels and changes in insurance coverage, by source, in millions of persons. Next rows show ex ante levels and changes in
insurance spending by employers and employees overall, and in terms of average premiums. The remaining rows show the
distribution of the increased revenue across deciles of the income distribution; deciles are defined separately for singles and marrieds.
