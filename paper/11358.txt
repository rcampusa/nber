                                              ABSTRACT

We propose a method of quantifying non-fatal health on a 0-1 QALY scale that details the impact
of specific symptoms and impairments and is not based on ratings of counterfactual scenarios. Measures
of general health status are regressed on health impairments and symptoms in different domains, using
ordered probit and ordinary least squares regression. This yields estimates of their effects analogous
to disutility weights, and accounts for complex non-additive relationships. Health measures used include
self-rated health status on a 5-point scale, EuroQol 5D (EQ-5D) scores, and ratings of current health
using a 0-100 rating scale and a time-tradeoff. Data are from the nationally representative Medical
Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) year 2002 (N=34,615), with validation in an independent sample
from MEPS 2000 (N=21,067) and among 1420 adults age 45-89 in the Beaver Dam Health Outcomes
Study. Decrement weights for symptoms and impairments are used to derive estimates of overall health-related
quality of life, laying the groundwork for a detailed national summary measure of health.

       Population health measurement is of interest for many purposes, from the evaluation of

changes in health benefit structures to the valuation of medical treatments. To accurately

measure population health, it is necessary to measure health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in

addition to mortality. This paper proposes a method of health measurement that utilizes the

broad range of reported symptoms and impairments available in national data. The method

produces a summary health score on a 0-1 scale that can be combined with mortality to yield a

more comprehensive picture of what is happening to the nation’s health, while retaining the rich

detail on symptoms and impairments needed to allow tracking of the impact of these over time. It

accounts for co-relationships between impairments and uses regression methods that do not

require individuals to rate specific health problems.

       A number of instruments have been developed to measure general health status and

HRQOL. However, no gold standard has been agreed upon (Gold, Siegel et al. 1996). Existing

measures vary along a number of dimensions, three of which we examine via the method

proposed in this paper: the breadth of domains covered, the method used to weight multiple

problems within the domains, and the approach used to aggregate item/domain scores into an

overall summary measure.

        In terms of the breadth of coverage, current measures span the continuum from single-

question ratings of general health to detailed questionnaires covering multiple domains with

multiple items. Within the category of single question ratings of general health, utility-based

ratings of overall current health status such as standard gamble (SG) and time-tradeoff (TTO)

have been recommended as summary measures that incorporate morbidity and mortality on a

single 0-1 scale. Another popular brief measure is an overall self-rated health status question

(SRHS), which asks respondents to describe their health in one of 4 or 5 categories ranging from



                                                                                                   1
‘poor’ to ‘excellent’. While not derived from expected utility theory, SRHS has been shown to

be an accurate predictor of subsequent changes in functional status and of mortality and is

related to a number of specific aspects of health (Idler and Kasl 1995; Wilcox, Kasl et al. 1996;

Cutler and Richardson 1997; Idler and Benyamini 1997; Idler, Russell et al. 2000; DeSalvo,

Bloser et al. 2006). However, both preference-based and psychometric ratings of general health

lack detail regarding specific symptoms and impairments that may contribute to overall health.

An understanding of the impact on quality of life of these symptoms and impairments (many of

which are measured on an ongoing basis by our national health surveillance surveys) is quite

useful for assessing changes in health over time. Our first goal is to examine the impact of

symptoms and impairments from different domains on overall health assessment.

       Detailed existing health questionnaires measure an individual’s functioning in specific

health domains, with one or more questions used to measure each domain, and a scoring

algorithm developed to form domain scores and possibly an overall summary score. There is

substantial variation across general health instruments in the domains assessed and in the items

that are implicitly or explicitly covered by these domains, as illustrated in Table 1. Psychometric

‘profile measures’ yield a set of domain scores that are not necessarily designed to be combined

to form a single score. The most popular of these measures is the SF-36 (Ware, Kosinski et al.

2000) (and the shorter SF-12 and SF-8 versions). In contrast, ‘preference-based’ measures assign

utility weights to items or health states, and the weights associated with an individual’s reported

problems are combined to yield an overall summary measure of health on a 0-1 scale (by

convention, 0 denotes death and 1 denotes perfect health). Such measures include the Health

Utilities Index (HUI Mark I, II and III, developed in Canada, (Horsman, Furlong et al. 2003), the

Quality of Well-Being Scale (QWB, interviewer and self-administered versions, developed in



                                                                                                      2
Southern California, (Kaplan, Bush et al. 1976; McDowell and Newell 1996), the EQ-5D

(“EuroQol”, developed in Europe, (Brooks, Rabin et al. 2003), the 15-D (Finland, (Sintonen

2001), the ‘Assessment of Quality of Life’ (AQOL, Australia, (Hawthorne, Richardson et al.

1999) and the SF-6D (Brazier, Roberts et al. 2002), an econometric transformation of SF-36 data

that yields a score on a 0-1 scale based on SG valuations of a sub-set of 11 SF-36 questions.

       Most instruments include items measuring physical and social function, and do not

include symptoms unless they are severe enough to affect function. Examples of items typically

excluded are headache, rash, sleep problems, weight problems, cognitive problems, sexual

problems, and specific physical limitations such as lifting or use of fingers. Exclusion of such

items can result in ceiling effects (Fryback, Dasbach et al. 1993; Essink-Bot, Krabbe et al. 1997;

Jenkinson, Gray et al. 1997; Andresen, Rothenberg et al. 1998; Kaplan, Ganiats et al. 1998;

Johnson and Pickard 2000); a large portion of the general population is sufficiently healthy that

it does not report decrements in function. However, these people do experience a range of health

problems that can reduce HRQOL. Failure to identify and value the sources of such HRQOL

reductions precludes tracking improvements in health if these problems are alleviated.

       Determining the weights to assign to different impairments is a second longstanding

issue. Disutility weights for preference-based measures are typically derived from studies in

which samples of community members are asked to rate a number of hypothetical health

scenarios using a valuation method: SG, TTO, or a rating scale (RS) such as a thermometer from

0 to 100. The health states are presented as ‘counterfactual scenarios’, in which a respondent is

asked to imagine having a particular health state, but may or may not have actually experienced

the health problem. Typically those who have experienced a condition rate it less severely than

do those who have not (Sackett and Torrance 1978; Epstein, Hall et al. 1989; Slevin, Stubbs et



                                                                                                    3
al. 1990; Ubel, Loewenstein et al. 2003). A number of explanations have been put forth to

explain this phenomenon. People with the condition may adapt to it over time, they may make a

mental shift and rate themselves in comparison to other sick people (or to how healthy they

could expect to be with their health problem), and/or those without the condition may focus too

narrowly on the potential negative life impact of the problem (a focusing illusion)(Kahneman

and Tversky 2000; Ubel, Loewenstein et al. 2003). In this circumstance, there is controversy

regarding whose values more accurately reflect the true health of a person in a given state, with

the standard recommendation being to use individual weights for personal treatment decisions,

and “community preferences” for cost-effectiveness and policy analysis (Gold, Siegel et al.

1996).

         However, there is an extensive literature in psychology suggesting that ratings of

counterfactual health states may not be accurate—that people overestimate the negative impact

of a future hypothetical event on their happiness (Gilbert, Pinel et al. 1998; Wilson, Wheatley et

al. 2000). People have been found to overpredict the extent and duration of their negative

emotional reactions to a range of events, from the loss of one’s favored sports team or political

candidate, to the failure to achieve tenure in a professorial position, the end of a close romantic

relationship, losing a child in a car accident, being diagnosed with cancer, becoming paralysed,

or being sent to a concentration camp (Gilbert, Pinel et al. 1998), (Wilson, Wheatley et al. 2000)

. This ‘durability bias’ calls into question the ability of individuals to make accurate judgments

about the impact of hypothetical health problems. Indeed, in one study, UK residents valuing 42

of the EQ-5D health states rated 38% of the states as worse than death (Dolan 1997). These




                                                                                                      4
findings are clearly inconsistent with the reality that most people experiencing these health states

do not commit suicide or profess a wish to be dead (Dolan and Kahneman working paper).1

        We propose an alternate method of deriving weights for health states that does not

require the direct rating of counterfactual health situations by either people with a condition or

people without it, but rather asks people to rate only their current general health and to report

their current symptoms and impairments. The effect of the specific symptoms and impairments is

then estimated based on their relationship to this general health rating. If there is consistency in

underlying response scales across people with similar health problems, this method will yield an

accurate estimate of the effect of the problem.

        Finally, existing instruments incorporate different approaches to forming a summary

health score. Questionnaires in which all items contribute equally to the final score implicitly

assign equal weight to all problems. Some scales such as the SF-36 use factor analysis to assign

different weights to items based on their relative frequency and correlations with other items

(Ware, Kosinski et al. 2000). However factor analysis can inappropriately substitute variation in

the prevalence of health problems for variation in the impact of these health problems on health,

and can thus exclude items with important effects on health if they have a low correlation with

others or occur infrequently (Kaplan, Bush et al. 1976). Among preference-based scales, some

use an additive model (i.e. 15-D, SF-6D), assuming scores on one item or domain are unaffected

by scores on others. Others use a multiplicative model (HUI, AQOL), or a combination of both

(QWB, EQ5D). We allow for a flexible functional form that can accommodate additive or non-

additive relationships between pairs of symptoms and impairments within and across domains.

1
  Population valuations of EQ5D health states using TTO have yielded worse weights in the U.K. than in the U.S.,
particularly for states characterized by extreme problems (Johnson et al., 2005), which may also serve as evidence
that such ratings are problematic.



                                                                                                                     5
       The paper is structured as follows. The first section describes the methodology that we

use for measuring health. The second section discusses the data. The third section presents

results, and the fourth section offers discussion and conclusion.



       I.      Methodology for Measuring Health

       Our analysis proceeds in two parts: the development of weights for symptoms and

impairments in different domains, and the calculation of summary measures. The first part of

our analysis is to estimate the HRQOL decrement of specific health problems, by relating ratings

of general overall health to the presence of specific impairments and symptoms. We estimate

item weights using regression analysis. To illustrate the methodology, we consider two

symptoms or impairments, SI1 and SI2, with responses for each individual of SI1i and SI2i. Our

equations are of the form:



                             Healthi = b1 · SI1i + b2 · SI2i + ei                                (1)



where Healthi is a general rating of current health, SIi are specific symptoms and impairments

and b’s are the estimates of the effects of these symptoms or impairments on health. As we

discuss below, we performed these analyses using several different measures of general health as

dependent variables. We use three data sources, all of which include a 5-point rating of general

health worded: “In general, would you say your health is: excellent, very good, good, fair, or

poor?” (self-rated health status, SRHS). For comparison we also replicated analyses using

utility-based measures available in each sample. Despite our concerns about measures based on

people’s ratings of counterfactuals, this comparison is important in light of the policy



                                                                                                   6
recommendation favouring preference-based measures for cost-effectiveness and policy analysis

(Gold, Siegel et al. 1996), and the widespread use of these measures. The Medical Expenditure

Panel Survey (MEPS) administered two utility-based metrics: an EQ5D and a rating of current

health on a scale from 0 (worst possible) to 100 (best possible). The Beaver Dam Health

Outcome Study (BDHOS) includes a time tradeoff (TTO) rating of current health.

           An ordered probit model was used to predict SRHS, due to the ordinal nature of the

question. To predict EQ5D, RS, and TTO ratings, OLS regression was used, since each is a

linear outcome measure. Some researchers have used a two-part model for the TTO and EQ5D

truncated distribution (i.e. Sullivan et al., 2005), but its use has been found to make little

difference with the Beaver Dam data.2

           There are often two or more questions about different aspects of health within a particular

domain. For example, our pain domain in Beaver Dam includes three questions regarding

pain/discomfort (described in appendix 2). Past summary measures have varied in their treatment

of these multiple symptoms, for example assigning the weight associated with the worst

symptom (0.349 for sexual organ pain in the QWB (Kaplan and Anderson 1996)), or weighting

overall health states that include one of 3 levels on a general pain question (EQ5D, -0.17 for

moderate pain/discomfort as the only symptom (Shaw, Johnson et al. 2005)) or one of 5

categories based on combined levels of pain and activity limitation (HUI II, -0.25 for frequent

pain with occasional disruption of normal activities (Torrance, Feeny et al. 1996)). To test for the

appropriate relationships between items, we include interaction terms between all pairs of items

in the MEPS samples.3 Due to the smaller sample size in Beaver Dam, we include interactions

    We do not consider higher order interactions because of sample size issues.




                                                                                                    7
between only some pairs of items within domains (20 interactions out of a possible 266).

Algebraically, suppose we are considering one domain that includes two items (SI1 and SI2). We

relate overall health ratings to each of the items and to the interaction between the items:



                                      Healthi = b · SI1i + b2 · SI2i + b12 · SI1i · SI2i + ei           (2)



            Several common assumptions are special cases of this framework. In the case of a worst

symptom indicator, we would find (assuming SI1 is worst) b1 < b2 = -b12 : the first symptom has

an adverse effect on health, and the second symptom has an adverse effect only when the person

does not have the first symptom. Alternative special cases are independent effects (b12 = 0),

more-than-additive effects (b12 < 0), and decreasing marginal impairment (b12 > 0).

            Our regression equation (1) includes all symptoms and impairments, but no

sociodemographic variables. We chose not to control for such factors as age, gender, race, and

socioeconomic status with the belief that these affect health primarily via specific symptoms and

impairments caused by acute and chronic conditions. If we had controlled for sociodemographic

variables, their coefficients would also reflect the effects of symptom and impairment variables

that were related to these factors but were not adequately accounted for by our models.4

            Because of the large number of possible interactions, there is a possibility of overfitting

the data. To address this, we tested out-of-sample predictions. Predicted SRHS scores were

calculated in MEPS 2000, based on results of regressions in MEPS 2002. Two models were fit: a

more complete model including all possible two-way interactions between symptoms and

impairments and a smaller model including terms for only those interactions with an N of 500 or

4
    Still, alternative analyses controlling for age, sex and their interactions yielded similar results.



                                                                                                            8
more (38 of the 66 possible interactions). A likelihood ratio test showed that the explanatory

power was significantly greater with the 28 additional interactions (difference in log likelihood =

27.2, p < 0.01). Further, the mean-squared error in out-of-sample predictions was slightly lower

for the more complete model (2.00 vs. 2.01). As a result, we use the model with more

interactions. That said, the correlation between predicted health ratings for the two models was

very high: 0.998. Thus in practical terms, the issue of overfitting is not particularly important.

       In the case of preference-based measures, the health metric is on a 0 to 1 scale, so that the

coefficients are directly interpretable as the utility reduction from the relevant symptom. This is

advantageous. However the disadvantages of the TTO (and the EQ5D, whose scoring is based on

TTO ratings) were noted above, especially the possibility that people are poor at performing

counterfactuals about health states.

       The SRHS and RS analyses avoid this by asking people only about their current health

state. Because the SRHS scale is not 0 to 1, however, it needs to be transformed onto a 0 to 1

scale in order to estimate a quality measure that can be combined with mortality in population

health assessment. To do this, we consider the best and worst cases. Mean predicted scores from

the regressions were calculated first assuming that everyone reported the item (the worst case)

and then assuming that no one reported the item (the best case). The difference between these

mean predicted scores captures the broadest possible impact of having the symptom or

impairment in light of the other conditions that people have, and was used to normalize SRHS-

based weights.

       Because the SRHS scale does not the have the top and bottom anchors of a utility

measure (perfect health, and death or ‘worst possible health’), we did not assume that these best

and worst states were equal to 1 and zero on a utility scale. To estimate how far the best and



                                                                                                      9
worst states were from these end points, we examined the scores for the best and worst case

scenarios using weights derived from the rating scale and from TTO. SRHS-based item weights

were then normalized to fall within this range, as described in the results section below.

           The advantages of using the self-reported scale are that it is easily and frequently asked,

it has minimal floor or ceiling effects, and it does not require people to answer counterfactual

questions about their health. One limitation is that it assumes that all people consider their

responses on the same scale—e.g. that excellent and good health mean the same thing to all

people. If particular groups systematically report their health as better or worse than other

groups, and particular health problems are over or under-represented among these groups, then

the effects of these problems on HRQOL may be mis-estimated. Use of vignettes—descriptions

of people whose health the individual rates—has recently been explored as a way to control for

interpersonal differences in scale interpretation, and would be natural to examine if such

vignettes were part of the data set (Salomon, Tandon et al. 2004). None of our surveys ask

vignette questions, however.5

           In addition, there is a question about whether true health is captured in a linear manner by

the SRHS question. Equation (1) might be correct for true health, but it might be that people

report SRHS as SRHS = g(Health). For example, if people are hesitant to use the bottom end of

the scale, but make fine gradations at the top end, the impact of a given change in true health on

self-reported health will be greater at the top of the scale than the bottom. We test for this in our

empirical work by relating utility-based measures of health to predicted health using the self-

reported scale and non-linear transformations of that (effectively recovering g-1(.)). We generally

accept linearity or a very close approximation, as shown in the results section.

5
    However, the use of vignettes could also introduce the problem of bias in rating counterfactuals, discussed above.



                                                                                                                    10
         Once the item weights have been determined, we can form summary measures of health

for each person, by applying the item weights to the symptoms and impairments that s/he reports.

We compare the item weights derived from SRHS and from utility-based measures in each

survey, as well as mean scores on all summary measures.

         Although we focus in this paper on health decrements for specific symptoms and

impairments, our results can be used to form disease-based disutilities. To do this, one would

relate responses about specific symptoms and impairments to diseases the person has, and use

that to form disease-specific disutilities. For data and space reasons, we do not pursue that in this

paper.



II.      Data

         We use three sources of data in our analysis. The primary source is the 2002 wave of the

Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS; N=39,165), a nationally representative survey of the

U.S. civilian non-institutionalised population. In order to test the robustness of our findings and

test out-of-sample predictions, we also replicate our analyses in the 2000 wave of MEPS, which

contains an independent sample of 25,096 people. In both years, MEPS asked a variety of

summary health questions: a five point general rating of health (SRHS), a rating of current health

on a 0 to 100 scale, and the EQ5D, a summary measure based on questions about moderate and

severe impairment in five domains—mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain, and

anxiety/depression--which we score using U.S. community preferences measured with TTO

weights (Shaw, Johnson et al. 2005). The EQ5D questions and rating scale are shown in

Appendix 3. The SRHS was asked of all respondents, whereas the EQ5D and RS were part of a




                                                                                                   11
paper and pencil questionnaire administered only to those 18 and over. A proxy was asked to

answer health questions for those unable to respond. The sample of those with data on SRHS and

all impairments and symptoms was 34,274 in MEPS 2002 and 20,767 in 2000. Statistical

methods designed for survey data and sampling weights were used to account for the MEPS

sampling factors including stratification, clustering, oversampling of minorities, and

nonresponse.

        Our third data source is the Beaver Dam Health Outcomes Study (BDHOS; (Fryback,

Dasbach et al. 1993)), a community-based study of health status and quality of life. Though this

survey is smaller, it enabled us to consider the broadest array of symptoms and impairments, due

to its inclusion of the QWB, which was developed to cover the full array of health problems that

affect people’s daily lives (Kaplan, Bush et al. 1976; McDowell and Newell 1996).6 For the

BDHOS, a random sample of 1431 residents age 45 and up was drawn from a larger sample

developed for the Beaver Dam Eye Study. Interviews were performed face-to-face, lasted

approximately one hour, and included questions about current health status, chronic medical

conditions, sensory problems, current medications, past surgeries, and life stresses. Participants

were excluded if they were cognitively unable to answer interview questions or were

institutionalised in an acute or chronic care facility. We use data from 1422 respondents with

complete data on the QWB, interviewed between 1/1/1991 and 8/14/1992. The age range of the

sample was 45 to 89, with a mean age of 64 (SD =10.8), and the sample was almost entirely

Caucasian (Fryback, Dasbach et al. 1993). BDHOS includes a TTO rating of current health as

well as the five point summary rating of health.

6
  The QWB includes a symptom list in addition to questions in mobility, social, and physical function. For our
study, information on all of the symptoms from the symptom list reported by each respondent was added to the data
set from original paper interview sheets; original BDHOS data included only the item from the symptom list
reported by the respondent as most bothersome, as was required for QWB scoring.


                                                                                                               12
       In both MEPS and the BDHOS we examined all the health questions and grouped them

into relatively standard domains, based on our review of the health measurement literature

(Kaplan, Ganiats et al. 1998; Hawthorne, Richardson et al. 1999, Kaplan, 1998 #46; Ware,

Kosinski et al. 2000; Sintonen 2001; Brooks, Rabin et al. 2003; Horsman, Furlong et al. 2003,

2003 #31). These include social activity, physical activity, pain, mental health, vitality, sensory,

and others. Impairments and symptoms within each domain in each survey are listed in Table 3.

Levels of severity were available for some items in MEPS (primary activity limitation, walking,

pain, vitality), allowing the effects of these levels to be examined separately.



III.   Results

Responses to Summary Measures

       The distributions of the four summary measures of health used in our analyses are shown

in Figure 1 and summary statistics are shown in Table 2. The mean EQ5D score in both MEPS

surveys was 0.87. The mean rating scale was 0.81 in MEPS 2002 (0.79 in 2000). The correlation

between the EQ5D and RS is reasonably high (0.66). The somewhat lower mean health using the

rating scale could reflect several factors. The EQ5D is based on questions about 5 domains,

whereas the RS asks about ‘current overall health’, which would lead an individual to consider a

broader array of factors affecting health. Also, utilities obtained by RS are typically lower than

those obtained using methods that incorporate risk or uncertainty (Torrance, Feeny et al. 2001).

A much lower percentage had perfect RS scores than EQ5D scores (0.08 vs.0.48). There has

been some evidence of end-aversion towards the top end of the RS(Torrance, Feeny et al. 2001),

however it is natural to have fewer people end up in the top category when there are more

categories on which to make a finer gradation of one's health.



                                                                                                     13
       The mean TTO in Beaver Dam was 0.86. Beaver Dam is an older population (45+ versus

18+ in MEPS). For comparison, for people age 45 and over in MEPS 2002, the mean EQ5D

score was similar at .85, and the mean RS rating was lower, at .79.

       None of the summary measures were normally distributed; all were skewed toward good

health, as would be expected in a general community population. However, the EQ5D and TTO

distributions were truncated, with 48 and 59 percent of people reporting 1. This is typical in a

general population; for example, in MEPS 2002, 44% of the population age 18 and over reported

having none of the symptoms and impairments that we considered. However, the fact that

responses were not heaped at ‘excellent’ on the 5-point scale indicates that this measure is more

sensitive to factors that affect people’s health. On the EQ5D, scores of 1 represent those who do

not suffer from any problems in any of the 5 domains queried. This suggests that the EQ5D does

not ask about a sufficient number of domains for community-based health assessment. On the

TTO, the responses of 100 constitute a mix of respondents who felt they were in perfect health

and those who disliked their current health state but were unwilling to reduce their life

expectancy by even 0.5% to live in excellent health. While 0.5 percent seems small, it actually

encompasses a large range of response. If a year in good health is worth $100,000, a

conventional estimate, in dollar terms, a health change of 0.5 percent is worth perhaps $500.

People might not be willing to pay $500 annually to fix a number of significant health

complaints, however such problems can nevertheless have significant impacts on HRQOL and

be alleviated by medical care.

       Comparisons of the distributions of SRHS and EQ5D, RS, and TTO measures are shown

in Table 3. As the first panel shows, only 37 percent of those with perfect EQ5D scores rated

their health as excellent on the 5-point question, again reflecting health problems not captured by



                                                                                                   14
the EQ5D. EQ5D scores are rarely below 0.75 (12 percent of cases). But only half of those in

this bottom group report fair or poor health. A higher portion (63 percent) of those with perfect

RS ratings had excellent SHRS scores. Comparison of SRHS and TTO ratings indicates that only

20 percent of those with TTO ratings of 100 rated their health as excellent on the 5-point

question. On all three measures, a small percentage (4%) of those with low utility-based scores

(<0.75) rated their health as excellent. These contradictory scores may reflect the cognitive

challenges inherent in utility elicitation. Indeed, the validity of utilities may be subject to the

numeracy of those surveyed (Woloshin, Schwartz et al. 2001).


Regression Analyses

        Tables 1 and 2 of Appendix 1 show the proportion of the sample reporting each item and

combination of items within domains. These tables also report coefficients from ordered probit

models predicting SRHS and OLS regression models predicting EQ5D, RS, and TTO.7 All of

the main effect coefficients are negative (symptoms predict worse health), as expected, with a

few exceptions in Beaver Dam. Almost all of the symptoms and impairments are statistically

significantly related to the health measures in MEPS and, in Beaver Dam, 40 percent of them are

statistically significantly related to SRHS and 20 percent significantly predict TTO. However,

because many of the variables are correlated, the statistical significance of any single variable is

less important than the relative magnitude of their effects.

        Many of the interaction terms are positive, indicating that a combination of multiple

impairments is not as bad as a simple additive model would suggest, although instances of

7
  Regression results from MEPS 2000 were similar to those from MEPS 2002 and are not shown, but are available
upon request. Pain and self-care were excluded from regressions on EQ5D because they are included nearly directly
in the EQ-5D.




                                                                                                              15
negative coefficients for interaction terms are also found. In a few cases in MEPS and several

cases in Beaver Dam, positive interaction effects are larger than one or both of the associated

main effects, such that having two problems rather than one appeared to improve health ratings.

Although this is not likely the case—and most of these positive estimates include zero in the

confidence interval—we did not attempt to constrain large interaction terms or main effects,

reasoning that they were part of a complex set of results, and it was unclear which terms (if any)

were overly large or small. Overall, our results reject a theory of worst symptoms dominating or

of additivity across comorbid impairments.

        As noted above, self-reported health scores were normalized using the difference

between the hypothetical scenarios in which everyone had every symptom/impairment and in

which no one had any of the symptoms/impairments. We equated the best self-reported health

state to 0.90, the predicted score for those with none of the impairments using the Rating Scale

in MEPS 2002. The worst state was equated to 0.17, the worst score based on the decrement

weights for all impairments from the Rating Scale in MEPS 2002.



Predicted Summary Health

        The predicted measure of health based on self-reported general health status is shown in

Table 2. Mean predicted health was 0.79 in both the MEPS 2002 and 2000.8 close to the mean

rating scale rating (0.81) and broadly similar to the mean EQ5D score (0.87). Predicted SRHS-

based health from MEPS 2002 is plotted in Figure 2. There is a truncation at the highest possible

score, 0.90, that would be expected in a healthy population. As we discuss below, this suggests

8
 This is the mean summary score among those age 18+ in MEPS, for comparison with RS and EQ, which were
only asked of adults. The mean SRHS-based summary score for all ages was 0.81.




                                                                                                         16
that the set of symptoms and impairments in MEPS is not rich enough to capture some health

impairments.

        In BDHOS, mean predicted health based on SRHS was 0.75, well below the 0.86 TTO-

based mean (Table 2).9 For comparison to the age range in the BDHOS sample, the mean SRHS-

based score among those age 45 in MEPS 2002 and over is the same (0.73) and the mean rating

scale among those 45 and older is .79.

        In addition to mean health, we care about the correlation across measures. Table 2 shows

that the correlation between predicted health using the 5-point scale and the EQ5D is reasonably

high (0.82). The correlation is lower, but still high, for the rating scale (0.70). Health using the

TTO is very different from health derived using the self-assessment, however; the correlation

between predicted SRHS and TTO in Beaver Dam was only 0.41. The lower correlation with

TTO may reflect respondents’ difficulty in understanding the task, and/or their unwillingness to

trade off years of life for health problems below a certain threshold of seriousness.10

        A key issue for our analysis is whether the relation between predicted self-reported health

and the utility measures of health is linear. To test this, we regress the utility-based measures of

health on our predicted SRHS-based health score and on this score squared. The fitted values

from this regression along with the regression equations are shown in Figure 3. Linearity implies

that the squared term should be insignificant. That is the case for TTO in Beaver Dam and the

Rating Scale in MEPS 2002. The EQ5D in MEPS 2002 is positively related to the squared

prediction from the self-assessment model. This is not surprising given the large sample size in

9
  An alternate Beaver Dam model including only the items available in MEPS yielded a somewhat higher mean
score of 0.77, equivalent to the mean summary score in MEPS.
10
   Correlations between predicted SRHS and predicted summary scores derived from the regression models (not
reported in Table) are quite high (0.93 and above). This reflects the reasonably common impact of different
impairments on health using regression methods.




                                                                                                              17
MEPS. However, as Figure 3 shows, although statistically significant, this relationship does not

appear to be substantively divergent from linear. In light of these results, we use the linear

assumption in our analysis.


Weights for Impairments and Symptoms

        Decrement weights based on SRHS probit regressions are shown in Table 4. Domains

with the largest decrements in the MEPS 2002 and 2000 samples were social activity, pain, and

vitality, with the largest decrements for inability to perform major role activity (-0.12/-0.15),

severe pain (-0.19/-0.21), and having little or no energy (-0.15/-0.13). In the physical activity

domain, limitations in activities of daily living had a similarly negative effect (-0.10/-0.11),

whereas other impairments had a milder impact, on par with or less severe than sensory

impairments. While differences between weights across the two MEPS samples are apparent for

several impairments, very few symptoms and impairments had effects that differed significantly

across the two MEPS surveys; coefficients are statistically different when accounting for

everything else in the model only for depressive symptoms using SRHS (decrement greater by

0.03 in 2002, p=0.007) and moderate vitality loss using RS (decrement greater by 0.02 in 2002,

p=0.04).11

        Decrements were generally similar in self-reported health status regressions using Beaver

Dam data. Inability to perform major role activity had the worst impact (-0.12), with pain and

vitality yielding somewhat smaller disutilities (-0.06, -0.05). Anxiety and some physical

limitations yielded more severe weights in the Beaver Dam sample. This may be partially

explained by differences in item definitions and the non-representative BD population. The older

11
  A few interaction effects also differed significantly across waves in SRHS, EQ5D, and RS regressions (results not
shown).



                                                                                                                18
age range in Beaver Dam does not appear to explain differences from MEPS, since analyses in

MEPS that were restricted to those ages 45 and over yielded decrement weights similar to those

from the full MEPS samples.

        Table 4 shows that the sum of the weights for the worst case scenario (having the worst

level of all symptoms and impairments) is negative (worse than death). This was not impossible,

but rare; only 0.2% of the MEPS 2002 sample had scores worse than death based on the item

weights.12

        Decrement weights based on TTO, EQ5D, and RS are shown in Table 5, and domain-

specific scores derived from these measures and SRHS are shown in Figure 4. The pattern of

decrements is similar across methods, with weights derived from utility-based measures

somewhat less severe than those derived from the self-rated health measure. This is likely due to

the lumping of utility-based scores at higher values. The largest differences are for social activity

limitations, where the utility-based methods yielded smaller decrements.

        In the Beaver Dam data, where a larger array of health problems are examined, several

problems, such as sensory impairments, depressive symptoms, gastrointestinal illness, sexual

problems, and problems with weight or appearance, had little independent effect using either

rating method. A few problems had small positive weights using TTO in Beaver Dam, however

the confidence interval for each of these items includes zero, and all are negative predictors of

health ratings in the bivariate case. This highlights the fact that our weights for symptoms and

problems are to be considered as a group and not individually.




12
  Analytically, this occurs because of the non-linear process of forming weights from the ordered probit regression
coefficients.




                                                                                                                 19
       The baseline decrement among those with none of our symptoms and impairments (the

penultimate line of Table 5) ranges across models from –0.03 to –0.12, indicating that even the

lengthy set of symptoms and impairments we have fails to fully capture the problems that affect

people’s health ratings. The bottom end of the scale ranged from –0.74 to –0.95 using utility-

based measures.

       Figure 4 compares mean scores on the summary measures derived from the different

health rating methods among those with problems in each domain. Those with cognitive

problems had the worst summary scores in the MEPS 2002 sample, followed by those with

social and physical limitations. Those with pain or vitality problems had somewhat higher mean

summary health scores, similar to those with mental health symptoms or sensory impairments.

Given the relatively less severe decrement weights associated with mental health symptoms and

sensory problems, however, this similarity in scores likely reflects comorbidities among those

with pain or vitality problems. In the Beaver Dam sample, those with social activity limitations

had the lowest mean scores, and scores were less severe among those with pain. Cognitive

impairment did not affect scores as much as in MEPS, where a more severe definition of

impairment was used and proxy respondents were used for the cognitively impaired. The SRHS-

based measure was more sensitive to the impairments and symptoms we measured than the RS

and EQ5D-based measures.



IV.    Discussion

       This paper lays out a method for estimating the health-related decrements in quality of

life associated with different symptoms and impairments, and for estimating a summary measure

of health based on this information. Our method was developed to address three issues of



                                                                                                   20
concern in the measurement of general health: the limited range of impairments and symptoms

typically employed in summary health measures, the use of counterfactual scenarios to obtain

condition weights, and inconsistent accounting for co-relationships between health problems.

       Economists are naturally attracted to utility-based measures of health, and the time

tradeoff is commonly used. Time tradeoff questions are sometimes asked directly, and have been

used as a basis for scoring of other measures such as the EQ5D. Despite this theoretical benefit,

we encounter several difficulties with this measure. Most notably, there is substantial clustering

of responses at perfect health. In Beaver Dam, which included a time tradeoff rating of current

health, 59 percent of people were unwilling to trade off any length of life for higher quality of

life. On the EQ5D in MEPS 2002, 48 percent of people had scores equal to perfect health.

       But health is not perfect for those people. Only one fifth of those in Beaver Dam

expressing no willingness to trade off length for quality of life report their health to be excellent;

31% report only ‘good’ health and a few (4%) even report fair or poor health. Similarly, of those

reporting no impairments on the EQ5D, 20 percent report only ‘good’ health and 3 percent report

themselves in fair or poor health. In the case of the EQ5D, this likely reflects the fact that there

are only 5 domains in the survey, resulting in insufficient coverage of symptoms and

impairments. The most common problems among those who had perfect EQ5D scores but did

not have the top score on our SRSH measure in MEPS 2002 were vitality loss (45%), sensory

problems (15-16%), and depressive/anxiety symptoms (13-15%). In the case of the TTO we

suspect that the reason for the clustering at perfect health is that people are unwilling to trade off

years for quality of life when the question is posed directly. This is understandable, but it does

not mean that quality of life is unimportant to people. People are very willing to grade their

health less than perfect when asked about it directly using a SRHS question.



                                                                                                       21
           Utility-based measures that incorporate risk and uncertainty via standard gambles or time

tradeoffs are not designed to yield decrements for relatively minor health complaints. However,

particularly in a healthy population, it is important to try to consider the full range of problems

that can affect people—and that can potentially be alleviated through medical care. SRHS and

rating scale methods are inherently more disposed to reflect the effects of such problems.

           Time tradeoff and similar questions involving counterfactuals also suffer from possible

biases. People are asked to compare their current health state to a health state that they are not in

– perhaps a health state they have never been in.13 While descriptions of that health state can be

provided, other evidence suggests that experience matters: people with a health problem very

often think their health is better than people without that problem guess it would be. (Sackett and

Torrance 1978; Epstein, Hall et al. 1989; Slevin, Stubbs et al. 1990; Ubel, Loewenstein et al.

2003) Concerns about such biases underlie Dolan and Kahneman’s argument that economists

should develop measures focused more directly on experienced utility rather than decision utility

(Dolan and Kahneman working paper).

           For these reasons, our recommendation is for summary measures of health that ask

people only about their current health state, without the counterfactual of perfect health or the

use of weights based on ratings of counterfactual health states. There are two such measures that

we consider: a rating scale from 0 to 100 (worst to best possible health), and a 5-point self-

assessment of general health. The rating scale is naturally on a 0 to 1 scale (when simply divided

by 100). We present a method for transforming the self-assessed general health question onto

that scale. Empirically, these two scales yield relatively similar measures of health. The mean

rating scale score is 0.81, compared to 0.77 using the self-assessed method; the correlation

13
     In the case of a TTO rating of current overall health, the comparison state is perfect health.



                                                                                                      22
between health measured the two ways is 0.70. The domain-specific health impairments tend to

be larger with SRHS than with the RS. The SRHS-based measure was more sensitive to the

impairments and symptoms in MEPS than the RS-based measure, the latter being slightly more

affected by other unknown factors.

          The tradeoff in not asking about counterfactuals is that it must be assumed that different

people use the same response scale. If some people consider ‘very good’ health to be different

from others, and those groups differ in symptom propensity, our measure will be biased. This

could be tested using vignette questions that ask people to rate the health of others, although

such questions are not on our surveys (and are subject to the same counterfactual issues noted

above).

          As important as the summary measure of health is the attribution of health problems to

particular symptoms and impairments. There is frequently a desire to examine how health would

change if a particular impairment were eliminated, or if medical care improved to control the

symptoms of a particular disease. Many health metrics currently employed are very restrictive.

They ask about only a few domains (e.g., 5 domains in the EQ5D), they assume particular

relationships between different symptoms within a domain (e.g., the worst symptom in QWB),

and they add up across domains in ways that may not be optimal (e.g., use of factor analysis in

SF36).

          We develop a methodology to surmount these difficulties, relating the summary measure

of health flexibly to symptom responses and their interactions. Our results show the importance

of allowing for flexible functional forms. Having a combination of health problems is generally

not as bad as having each one individually, but is worse than having only one of the problems.

We also demonstrate the robustness of our findings in two independent, nationally representative



                                                                                                   23
samples. The similarity of weights across samples is encouraging and supports the stability of

our model.

       Considering the various symptoms and impairments, the ones with the greatest effect on

health in MEPS 2002 are severe pain (-0.20), having little or no energy (-0.16), inability to

perform major role activity (-0.12), and limitations in activities of daily living (-0.11). Additional

impairments that we found to have important impacts on health were physical activity limitations

(up to –0.09 in BD), respiratory symptoms (-0.05 in BD), moderate pain (–0.11 in MEPS 2002),

and anxiety (–0.08 in BD). Our findings are consistent with scattered evidence found in previous

studies of factors predicting SRHS, such as being on work-disability pay and perception of one’s

own physical performance (Fylkesnes and Forde 1991; Fylkesnes and Forde 1992; Leinonen,

Heikkinen et al. 1999), persistent pain disorder (Gureje, Simon et al. 2001), and cognitive

capacity (Leinonen, Heikkinen et al. 1999). The great importance of these factors suggests the

possibility that targeting interventions to alleviate some particular impairments in a few domains

(or modifying environments so that they are less problematic) could have a significant effect on

health across a wide range of the population.

       The decrement weights for some of our impairments may appear small relative to the

impact that one would expect the problem to have on HRQOL. However, it is important to keep

in mind that the impact of a particular condition such as depression will occur through many

impairments and symptoms. We include a broad array of interrelated symptoms and

impairments, which reduces the direct effect of each one individually, but provides a more

comprehensive picture of the overall impact of different problems on HRQOL.

       Even our rich set of symptoms and impairments is likely not enough. Only 44% of people

with no symptoms or impairments reported excellent health, and only 15% reported 100 on the



                                                                                                   24
rating scale. Beaver Dam asked about more symptoms and impairments, and some of these do

matter.

          Of the additional items in Beaver Dam that were not available in MEPS,14 difficulty with

driving/public transport had the largest decrement at -0.09. Overall, the inclusion of these

additional items did not dramatically lower mean summary scores; an alternate model in Beaver

Dam using only those items available in MEPS yielded a mean score that was only slightly

higher (0.03). However, a smaller portion (12%) had the highest possible score on the SRHS-

based measure in Beaver Dam. In comparison, 28% of those age 45+ in MEPS 2002 had the

highest possible score, and 28% had the highest possible score in Beaver Dam when only using

those items available in MEPS. This indicates that the consideration of additional symptoms and

impairments is important.

          We do not know, of course, the exact additional symptoms and impairments that matter

to people but were not asked of those in our samples. Possibilities include symptoms caused by

particular diseases or their treatments (such as shortness of breath in emphysema, coughing

blood/hair loss from chemotherapy, or broken bones in osteoporosis). In addition, mild anxiety

and the blues are important symptoms to ask about. A slightly lower portion of the MEPS 2002

sample had perfect EQ5D scores (49%) than had the top score on our SRHS-based summary

measure (55%), largely due to a subset of respondents who reported anxiety/depression on the

EQ5D but were not captured by the cutoffs on the anxiety and depressive SF-12 questions. This

is partly due to a difference in the time window specified by the different questions: the SF-12

asks about symptoms in the past 4 weeks, whereas the EQ5D asks only about ‘today’ (the day

the question is answered).

        Although we focus in this paper on health decrements for specific symptoms and

impairments, our results can be used to form disease-specific utilities. The strategy is to relate

the symptoms and impairments to the presence of specific diseases reported by the individual.

This will provide insight into the mechanisms by which specific diseases affect health and how

this might change over time.15




Limitations

        Our study has some limitations that are worth noting. We discussed above the issues

associated with possible response differences across individuals. In addition, there are some data

issues that are worth noting. While the MEPS data are nationally representative, the Beaver Dam

data are not, and its relatively small sample size may underlie the few small positive main effects

and the anomalous large positive interaction terms for some combinations of problems. The

possibility of omitted symptoms and impairments means that we cannot fully predict or explain

changes in health related quality of life due to these omitted variables. To overcome this

limitation, our national surveys may benefit from the addition of questions on a more complete

set of symptoms and impairments that affect quality of life.




15
   Previously, chronic condition-specific HRQOL has been estimated by calculating the mean or median score on a
preference-based instrument among people with the health condition (i.e. Gold et al., 2002) or by regressing scores
from a preference-based instrument on chronic conditions (Cutler and Richardson, 1997; Sullivan et al, 2005).
However, this approach does not illustrate the relative contributions of specific symptoms and impairments to the
overall HRQOL decrement for a specific chronic condition. Nor does it allow researchers to be able to tell how
alleviation of one symptom of a disease would affect health.




                                                                                                                  26
Conclusion

        Despite the large expenditure on medical care in the U.S. as a portion of our GDP, there

has not been a systematic effort to measure the overall impact of national health care spending

on U.S. population health. While existing instruments are used to monitor population health in

many countries, no single measure has been adopted for the U.S.16 Our goal in this project is to

lay the groundwork for a national health-related quality of life scale, as a main output in a set of

National Health Accounts (Abraham and Mackie 2005).

        Various national surveys ask about symptoms, impairments, and/or chronic diseases on

an ongoing basis. Our method or a variation of it can be used to estimate a detailed summary

measure of population health based on reported symptoms and impairments, or on chronic

conditions. We develop in this paper a set of weights for 2002, with comparison to 2000 and an

earlier community sample. While these weights did not significantly differ between 2000 and

2002, they could well change over longer time periods due to factors that affect what it is like to

live with specific symptoms. Thus, we would recommend that these weights be re-estimated in a

nationally representative sample every few years, perhaps once a decade. The use of vignettes to

identify and adjust for differences in the way people value health would also be valuable.

Finally, combining quality of life with projected length of life among those with different

conditions would enable a more comprehensive measure of population health.

16
  Measures used by agencies of the U.S. government include a 14-item measure
(http://www.cdc.gov/hrqol/hrqol14_measure.htm#1), and a ‘Health and Activity Limitation Index’ also called
‘Years of Healthy Life’ (HALex/YHL) (Erickson, 1998) based on age, ADLs and 5-point SRHS.

As shown below, the EQ-5D contains five questions asking about the extent of problems in

mobility, self-care, daily activities, pain, and anxiety/depression. Each question has three possible

responses: no problem, mild problem, or severe problem. The combination of responses to these

questions comprises a ‘health state’. Scores are assigned to each of the 243 possible states based on

previous research. The absence of problems--the most highly valued state—is equal to 1, death is

equal to zero, and other states are assigned a score based on community ratings of a portion of the

states (with extrapolation to other states), meant to represent the average preference of one state

over another (REF).



The rating scale is a sixth, separate question on the EQ5D, not included in EQ5D scoring, and

shown below.

To help people say how good or bad a health state is, we
have drawn a scale (rather like a thermometer) on which
the best state you can imagine is marked 100 and the
worst state you can imagine is marked 0.                       9       0


We would like you to indicate on this scale how good
or bad your own health is today, in your opinion.              8       0
Please do this by drawing a line from the box below to
whichever point on the scale indicates how good or bad
your health state is today.
