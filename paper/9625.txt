Evolving Discretionary Practices of U.S. Antidumping Activity

NBER Working Paper No. 9625
April 2003
JEL No. F13

                                          ABSTRACT


Previous literature has discussed the procedural biases that exist in U.S. Department of Commerce
(USDOC) dumping margin calculations. This paper examines the evolution of discretionary

practices and their role in the rapid increase in average USDOC dumping margins since 1980.
Statistical analysis finds that USDOC discretionary practices have played the major role in rising
dumping margins. Importantly, the evolving effect of discretionary practices is due not only to

increasing use of these practices over time, but apparent changes in implementation of these
practices that mean a higher increase in the dumping margin whenever they are applied. While legal
changes due to the Uruguay Round are estimated to have reduced the baseline U.S. dumping margin
by 20 percentage points, the increasingly punitive discretionary measures used by the USDOC

almost completely compensated for this decrease by 2000.

1. Introduction

        Antidumping (AD) protection is intended to remedy situations where foreign firms sell

their product in the host market at a price that is below “fair” or “normal” value; i.e., dump their

product in the host market. When dumping occurs and the host country’s domestic industry is

“materially” injured by this dumping behavior (or threatened with material injury), the host

country may apply an AD duty equal to the dumping margin on the foreign firm’s product

according to World Trade Organization (WTO) agreements.

        Even if one believes that such practices are harmful, a major problem with such policies

is implementation.1 How is “normal” value defined, much less calculated across a wide variety

of potential products? What constitutes “material” injury or the threat of such injury? Of course,

the WTO agreements provide a framework that outlines implementation of AD policies for

member countries. Countries with established AD laws, such as the U.S., have elaborate legal

statutes that go beyond these WTO agreements to address implementation in great detail. In

addition, country-level courts of appeal rulings and legislative amendments have further clarified

implementation procedures over time. However, as will be shown in this paper, there is also

much room for discretion by the government agencies charged with implementing AD protection

despite these detailed laws and ongoing legal rulings.

        While a number of studies have documented the incidence of AD cases across users of

AD laws, as well as the recent proliferation of AD use across a growing and large body of

countries (see Miranda et al., 1998, and Prusa, 2001), there has been little examination of how

AD policies and implementation evolve over time within countries. Even a cursory look at the

data reveals patterns that have not received much attention in the literature. Figure 1 displays a

 Most economists would only worry about such practices if the pricing behavior is predatory in nature, intended to
drive out domestic-market competitors. The definition of dumping is clearly much broader so that practices that



                                                                                                                     1
3-year moving average of the U.S. AD margins calculated by the U.S. Department of Commerce

(USDOC) over the period of 1980 through 2000.2,3 The upward movement in U.S. AD margin

magnitudes is pronounced and substantial. A simple regression on a constant and an annual

time trend indicates that the average AD margin rose approximately 2.5 percentage points a year,

from a starting point of 15.5% in the early 1980s to over 63% by 2000. However, it is clear that

the trend in the first decade of the sample is much steeper than the trend over the last 10 years of

the sample, though it continues to be significantly positive. Figure 2 shows a similar figure for a

3-year moving average in the percent of U.S. cases ruled affirmative for the injury determination

by the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC). Here too, the trend is for a greater

likelihood that the USITC will find injury, rising from about a 45% rate in the early 1980s to a

60% rate by 2000. Combined, these figures indicate a rise in the average expected AD duty (AD

margin times the probability of affirmative injury determination) from approximately 5% to over

30% for any foreign firm that finds itself investigated in a U.S. AD action!

         There are a number of possible explanations for such trends. First, legislative changes

may have substantially altered the legal mandate that the USDOC and USITC must follow in

making their decisions. Second, the composition of investigated firms and products may have

changed toward ones that would naturally receive higher AD margins and affirmative injury

decisions.4 A final alternative is that discretionary practices by the U.S. agencies have evolved

over time toward greater AD margins and affirmative injury determination probabilities.


economists think are not necessarily anti-competitive, such as price discrimination or pricing at a loss, are included
as “unfair” dumping behavior.
2
  The calculated dumping margin by the USDOC becomes the applied AD duty if, and when, the U.S. International
Trade Commission also finds that imports caused material injury to the domestic industry.
3
  Each yearly observation is the average of the current year and the previous two years. This presents a smoother
picture of AD activity than using yearly data. This seems appropriate as some years are based on a relatively small
(less than 40) number of AD margin calculations.
4
  In a related manner, there may be a learning story in the patterns, with potential domestic petitioners gaining
experience over which products and countries can be more successfully targeted for U.S. AD actions. Thus, self-
selection from learning drives composition of cases.


                                                                                                                     2
       This paper examines data on U.S. AD margins calculated by the USDOC to unravel the

relative contributions of legal changes, case composition, and discretionary practices in the

evolving pattern of USDOC-calculated AD margins. A new database of the almost 1600 firm-

specific AD dumping margin calculations by the USDOC since 1980 was gathered to enable

such an analysis. Regression analysis of the factors affecting the size of firm-specific dumping

margins yields coefficient estimates that can then be used to decompose the relative

contributions of these potential sources of rising dumping margins. The analysis finds that the

upward trend in U.S. dumping margins is primarily through evolving discretionary practices at

the USDOC, with little or no role for changing country composition of investigated cases or legal

changes. In particular, the USDOC’s use of “adverse facts available”, cost of production tests,

and cost data to construct normal value are estimated to be driving a lot of the increasingly

higher dumping margins. Importantly, this effect is due not only to increasing use of these

practices over time (the extensive use of these practices), but apparent changes in

implementation of these practices that mean a higher increase in the margin whenever these

discretionary practices are applied (the intensive use). While rule changes due to implementation

of 1995 Uruguay Round agreements is estimated to have reduced the U.S. baseline dumping

margin by 20 percentage points, greater extensive and intensive use of discretionary practices

had already compensated for these Uruguay Round effects by the end of the sample in year 2000.

       While previous studies have hypothesized and shown that discretionary practices by the

USDOC lead to larger dumping margins, these results suggest that these practices are evolving

rapidly into more distorted practices over time. This is despite the availability of appeals courts




                                                                                                      3
and dispute settlement procedures that are available to investigated parties.5 With such a large

role for discretion to distort dumping margins despite laws detailing implementation, the ability

of WTO AD agreements to establish a consistent framework that will limit member’s abilities to

distort the process to their own goals is highly questionable. If such a wide range of

discretionary actions can happen in a country with one of the most detailed AD laws and

transparent investigation procedures, such as the U.S., the problem is likely even greater in many

other member countries.6

        The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. The next section gives a brief overview of how

the USDOC calculates dumping margins, highlighting observable discretionary practices that are

often employed and which can be examined in the empirical analysis. The following two

sections discuss ways in which implementation of dumping margin calculations in the U.S. may

be changing over time from changes in discretionary practices and new laws and court decisions.

Section 5 then presents the empirical analysis and section 6 concludes.



2. Calculations of U.S. dumping margins

        The practice of determining whether foreign firms are selling their product in the U.S.

below normal value is fraught with a wide set of issues that must be addressed and procedures

necessarily varies by investigated products and firms. The basics of how the USDOC determines

dumping margins is the following. The USDOC first determines which firms are responsible for

the majority of the investigated imported product. These firms receive detailed questionnaires

about their pricing and costs that allow the USDOC to calculate a firm-specific dumping margin


5
  One ray of hope is that WTO dispute settlement decisions on antidumping decisions became more frequent in the
late 1990s, with judgments that often found problems with the way in which countries, including the U.S., were
applying their antidumping laws. See Tarullo (2002) for more details.
6
  Congressional Budget Office (2001) shows that average U.S. AD duties are about at the median across other
countries with active AD laws (Chapter 4, Figure 4), with many countries’ duties increasing during the 1990s.


                                                                                                                  4
for these firms with significant market share, with all other (small market share) firms facing a

trade-weighted average of the firm-specific margin calculations for the firms from their country.

        The “preferred” method of determining a dumping margin for each firm is to compare the

ex factory U.S. prices to the ex factory prices charged by the foreign firm in its own market for

the exact same (or “like”) product. Thus, normal value in this case is defined as this latter own-

market price charged by the foreign firm. Of course, ex factory prices (the implicit price of the

product immediately before it leaves the factory) are inherently unobserved. This leads to the

USDOC taking observed final consumer prices and backing out a myriad of “costs” that are

added to these prices before they reach the consumer. These include transportation and

associated costs, tariffs and other taxes, as well as markups by distributors. It is assumed

throughout these calculations that pass-through of such costs by the firm is perfect. Full pass-

through is also assumed for exchange rate adjustments used to convert prices in the same

currency for comparison.

        Once these adjustments have been made, the USDOC makes “price-to-price”

comparisons for sales transactions that occurred at a comparable point in time. However,

oftentimes the USDOC will calculate a weighted average of the foreign own-market prices to

define normal value. Then transaction-specific dumping margins are calculated by subtracting

individual U.S. ex factory prices from this measure of normal value. An overall firm-specific

dumping margin is then the weighted average of these transaction-specific margins, treating

transactions where the U.S. price is greater than normal value as “zero” dumping margins.7




7
  This method of averaging the foreign own-market prices, but not the U.S. prices, and then “zeroing” the
transactions where the U.S. price is above the average foreign own-market price, can easily be shown to lead to AD
margins when there is no dumping occurring. As Baldwin and Moore (1991) point out: “This obviously leads to the
absurd result that, as long as prices vary over the sample period, a positive dumping margin can be found even if
prices in the two countries are identical on every day.” (p. 271)


                                                                                                                5
           When the investigated foreign firm does not have “sufficient” sales of the like product in

its own market, other measures of normal value must be used. The first option is to use sales by

the firm to another export market (i.e., a third country) and then make “price-to-price”

comparisons, after adjustments. Absent “sufficient” sales to a third market, the USDOC will

turn to calculating a “constructed value” of the normal value. For this calculation, the USDOC

uses the foreign firm’s detailed cost data to construct a measure of the firm’s average cost (plus a

profit margin) over the period being investigated.8 Calculations of average costs entail

apportioning fixed costs to per-unit cost during the window of investigation. The USDOC then

compares ex factory U.S. prices from individual transactions to this constructed value.

           Even from this brief description of the general outline of procedures used by the USDOC,

it is clear that there is a wide room for discretion. Further, this discretion is often not connected

with economic principles that are typically used to identify anticompetitive or market-distorting

behavior. Profit maximizing firms in competitive environments may not fully pass-through costs

and exchange rates. Such firms may also price below average cost, since this is true any time a

firm makes a loss.

           Boltuck and Litan (1991) provides a more detailed description of the administration of

U.S. unfair trade laws. Various chapters in Boltuck and Litan (1991), Lindsay (1999), and

Lindsay and Ikenson (2002) also analyze a number of observable discretionary practices

employed by the USDOC in determining AD duties, pointing out the widespread possibility of

bias inherent in such practices. In addition, to the discretionary practices already mentioned,

there are three other major practices that are often highlighted.

           One of the most discussed USDOC practices is the use of “facts available,” known as

“best information available” before the Uruguay Round Agreements were implemented in 1995.

8
    This period of investigation is typically the six months prior to the petition.

                                                                                                        6
Given the detailed data requirements necessary to calculate dumping margins, the task becomes

very difficult when the foreign firm does not provide accurate usable data or does not respond

whatsoever to the USDOC’s requests.9 In these circumstances, the USDOC uses “facts

available,” which is invariably the information on dumping activity contained in the petition.

The USDOC may use “facts available” for small portions of a dumping margin calculation (such

as to ascertain freight charges in backing out ex factory prices) to using it as the sole information

for the dumping margin calculation. This wide variation has led to the USDOC to distinguish

between use of “facts available” for cooperating foreign firms versus non-cooperating or non-

responsive foreign firms. In the latter case, the USDOC employs “adverse facts available” which

is intended to use “facts available” in the most adverse manner as a punitive measure.

         Another practice often discussed is the procedures used by the USDOC when faced with

calculating a dumping margin for a firm from a non-market economy, such as China, the

USSR/Russia, and eastern European and former Soviet bloc countries. Cost and price data for

such firms is nonexistent or meaningless from an economic/accounting perspective. As a result,

the USDOC calculates normal value through a “factors of production” analysis using information

from a “surrogate” country. More specifically, it gathers data from the foreign firm on the

quantities of inputs used for production of the investigated good and then values these inputs

using price information from a chosen market economy that is deemed comparable in economic

development. Adding adjustments for packaging costs, transportation costs, and profits, the

USDOC can construct normal value. With normal value in hand, the USDOC can then calculate

dumping margins in the usual fashion.



9
 Moore (2001) provides a game theoretic analysis of foreign firms’ decisions to participate in an investigation,
showing that if the domestic authorities weight the domestic petitioners’ interests enough, it may be optimal for
foreign firms to not cooperate because of compliance costs.


                                                                                                                    7
       A final practice that receives somewhat less attention is the cost-of-production test. This

practice occurs when normal value will be calculated using the investigated foreign firm’s own-

market prices or third country prices. If alleged by petitioners, the USDOC will examine

whether the investigated foreign firm is selling below cost of production (or average cost) in its

own market or to third countries. If a significant number transactions in these markets (greater

than 10%) display prices below cost of production, the USDOC excludes these transactions for

determining normal value. As others have noted, this obviously leads to a higher normal value

and a greater dumping margin. If the USDOC finds the vast majority of these transactions

(greater than 90%) below cost of production, it will completely disregard such prices and base

normal value on the constructed value methodology.

       A couple studies have examined what factors determine the magnitude of U.S. dumping

margins and examined the role of USDOC discretionary practices on such margins. Baldwin and

Moore (1991) examine U.S. dumping margin determinations in the 1980s. Their econometric

results find that most observable economic factors, such as changes in imports and domestic

production, have little explanatory power for understanding final USDOC dumping margin

determinations. However, after controlling for other factors, the USDOC’s use of “facts

available” leads to dumping margins that are 38 percentage points higher than the average 29%

margin. This is the only discretionary practice they examine.

       Lindsay (1999) and Lindsay and Ikenson (2002) examine a wider variety of USDOC

discretionary practices than Baldwin and Moore. Lindsay’s (1999) descriptive analysis samples

all USDOC margin calculations from 1995 through 1998 and, similar to Baldwin and Moore,

finds that the average “facts available” dumping margin is much higher: 95.58% versus an

overall sample average of 44.68%. While it may not be surprising that these “facts available”

margins are higher, the magnitude in their difference from the average is astounding. Lindsay’s

                                                                                                     8
(1999) data also show that dumping margins that primarily used the foreign firm’s own market

prices or third-country prices to construct normal value are much lower than when constructed

value, non-market economy methods, or “facts available” are used.

       Lindsay and Ikenson (2002) extend Lindsay’s (1999) earlier work by analyzing

proprietary price and cost data used by the USDOC to calculate dumping margins for

investigated foreign firms in 18 U.S. AD cases.10 Such data allow them to directly examine the

effect of various discretionary practices on the dumping margins in these particular cases by

trying alternative dumping calculations. They find that many discretionary practices serve to

inflate dumping margins substantially in the cases they examine, including use of constructed

value, cost of production tests, zeroing, and even the way in which the USDOC determines

which products are comparable across the models sold in the U.S. and the foreign firm’s own

market.



3. The evolution of discretionary practices

       As discussed, theory and evidence suggest that discretionary practices likely have a

substantial impact on the size of dumping margins calculated by the USDOC, with a consistent

bias toward yielding a higher dumping margin. Not addressed previously is the extent to which

these practices’ effect on dumping margins may evolve over time. For example, do cost of

production tests in 1990 lead to the same increase in the dumping margin as cost of production

tests in 1980? The rapid increase in dumping margins over time displayed in figure 1 makes this

an important question, as this may be an important source of the changes we observe. The

evolution of the effect of these discretionary practices may stem from an increase (or decrease)

in the use of such practices over time and/or staff-induced changes in how these practices are




                                                                                                   9
implemented. I will call these potential effects the extensive and intensive use of these practices,

respectively.

           Table 1 provides information on the change in the extensive use of these practices by

showing the frequency of various discretionary practices by the USDOC over time from 1980

through 2000. The data for these tables were collected by the author from reading preliminary

and final USDOC determinations in the Federal Register, as described more below. It should be

noted that the listed practices are not necessarily mutually exclusive, as the USDOC may employ

more than one discretionary practice in a particular case. In addition, use of a practice for only

part of a case (e.g., a subset of the investigated products) are included in Table 1’s numbers and

treated identically to cases where the practice was fully used. This will also be true of the

statistical analysis below.

           For most practices, there is no discernible trend in the frequency of use over time. The

exception is that there has been a clear increase in all “facts available” cases over time (column 1

of table 1), with an ever larger share involving “adverse facts available” (column2). The average

percent of cases using “facts available in the first five years of the sample is 10.6%, whereas the

latter five years’ average is 39.6%, with the majority of these decisions using “adverse facts

available”. This means that by the early 1990s, about 40% of USDOC dumping margin

decisions were based on information supplied by the domestic petitioners!

           Examination of how discretionary practices have evolved over time on their intensive use

(i.e., changes in how the USDOC applies these practices) is more difficult to uncover. There is

almost no discussion of this in the literature. One exception is Stewart (1991), which presents a

defense of U.S. antidumping law and practices in Boltuck and Litan (1991). One of the issues

addressed by Stewart is Palmeter’s (1991) assertion that informational requirements required of

10
     These data were obviously obtained from the investigated foreign firms, not the USDOC!

                                                                                                      10
foreign firms by the USDOC have become increasingly complex. In response, Stewart says that

“the core elements of the dumping calculus have remained largely unchanged since 1974” and

that “the burdens of the questionnaires have not increased dramatically.” (p. 300). This suggests

that USDOC implementation procedures have been largely unchanged.

       However, this author’s reading of USDOC decision announcements found substantial

evidence of systematic changes in USDOC implementation of discretionary practices that were

not required by law. The most obvious changes involved use of “facts available”. The USDOC

seemed much more willing to work with foreign firms in cases in the early 1980s to assist them

in getting the USDOC information it required for the dumping calculations than in subsequent

years. In a representative 1979/80 case on countertop microwave ovens from Japan, the USDOC

was confronted with the situation where Toshiba did not supply all the necessary information and

stated the following as its response:

“Toshiba did not supply any information concerning the adjustments needed for differences in
domestic and export models. We have relied on descriptive literature and specification
information supplied by Toshiba … In making its final determination, the Department will
consider all information provided by Toshiba to the extent that such information can be verified
prior to that determination.” (Federal Register, Vol. 45, p. 47456, July 15, 1980)

Compare this to a representative passage for a 1987/88 case on digital readout systems from

Japan involving the Mitutoyo Corporation:

“…for those sales by Mitutoyo that involve further manufacturing in the United States, we used
best information available because Mitutoyo failed to respond to section D of our questionnaire
… it is our policy to assign the non-replying company … the highest margin indicated in the
petition …” (Federal Register, Vol. 53, p. 47844, November 28, 1988)

       The difference in treatment is quite distinct. In the earlier case, the USDOC was willing

to consider information from the foreign firm during the latter stages of the investigation and was

also willing to use information supplied by the foreign firm as “facts available.” In contrast, by

the late 1980s the USDOC was applying “adverse facts available” even when firms failed to



                                                                                                 11
respond to one portion of the questionnaire and was rejecting any information from the foreign

firms after the preliminary decision as untimely, and therefore did not use such information.

         A key change in the use of “facts available” was a policy put in place by the USDOC in

the 1987/88 antifriction bearings cases against multiple countries. Appendix B of the USDOC’s

decision in the case outlined a two-tier method whereby cooperating firms may be assigned

lower dumping rates than those that do not cooperate. These latter non-cooperating firms receive

“adverse facts available”, which is the higher of 1) the margin alleged in the petition, or 2) the

highest calculate rate assigned to any foreign firm in the investigation. Such discrimination

could have led to more firms receiving a lower “facts available” rate because they are deemed to

be cooperating. Instead, it seems to go the other way over time, with the USDOC often ruling

firms to be “non-cooperating” for seemingly minor omissions.11

         The USDOC decision announcements show evolution of behavior in the cost of

production test as well. In the late 1980s, decisions began to specify the “90-10 rule”, whereby

the USDOC disregards below-cost sales by the foreign firm in its own market (or to a third-

country) if such sales constitute more than 10% of all sales in those markets. If below-cost sales

are greater then 90% of sales in those markets, then the USDOC uses constructed value as a

measure of normal value. This rule is not mentioned in earlier cases, so it is not clear what

method is used, since such a rule is not specified in the U.S. AD law. In subsequent years, the

USDOC begins to extend this rule by applying it on a month-to-month basis for certain cases.12

Thus, some months of data during the period of investigation may get constructed value, whereas



11
   Substantial changes in implementation of procedures seem to have been precipitated by USDOC staff facing
large, complicated cases, such as the ball bearings cases. Creating criteria that lead staff to turn to “facts available”
more often not only increases dumping margins, but also reduces workload.
12
   Such a rule was first found in the final USDOC decision for the 1992/93 steel wire rope case against Korea. Such
rules were also apparently followed in 1994/95 furfuryl alcohol cases against Thailand and South Africa, and in the
1994/95 small diameter pipe case against Italy.


                                                                                                                      12
others may not. This obviously increases the probability that constructed value will be used for

at least part of the normal value calculation.13

        While this anecdotal evidence is consistent with evolving implementation of

discretionary practices on how such practices are implemented (their intensive use), it obviously

relies on what the USDOC self-reports in its Federal Register notices of its determinations.

There may be many adjustments that are not reported. In addition, it is not clear whether these

adjustments have a significant impact on dumping margins in the final analysis. Thus, it is not

clear how much weight one can give such observations. As we will show below, however,

econometric techniques can be used to estimate whether these discretionary practices are

evolving over time and what the impact of such evolution is on dumping margins. Much of the

econometric evidence will be consistent with these observations from reading the USDOC

decisions.



4. The Effect of Legal Changes and Court Decisions

        Before turning to a more formal empirical analysis, a discussion of the possible effects of

legal changes and court decisions on dumping margins is in order as well. There have been three

seemingly substantial U.S. legal changes regarding U.S. unfair trade laws since 1980. Baldwin

and Moore (1991) provide an assessment of the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984 and the Omnibus

Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988. The most significant change for dumping margin

calculations from the 1984 bill was to allow the USDOC to average U.S. prices, as well as the

foreign firm’s own market prices (or third-country prices) in determining a dumping margin. As

they note, “most dumping margins are still calculated in the old manner, despite statutory

13
  Readings of the USDOC decisions suggest there is some evidence of changes in how the USDOC calculates fair
value for non-market economies as well, but less evidence that the constructed value and third-country price



                                                                                                           13
change.” (p. 260).14 The 1988 bill made a number of substantial changes (e.g., allowing the

USDOC to apply AD duties to the parts of investigated products), but did not to lead to any

obvious changes affecting the USDOC calculation of dumping margins. Despite this general

assessment of these legal changes and their effect on USDOC margin calculations, I control for

the possibility of their effect in the empirical analysis below.

        Finally, the Uruguay Round of the GATT, enacted by the U.S. Congress in 1995, led to a

substantial list of changes to the U.S. AD and CVD laws. The Congressional Budget Office

(1994) provides a summary of changes expected to affect implementation of U.S. AD and CVD

laws and points out three specific areas that had the potential to affect dumping margin

determinations significantly (pp. 66-67). First the Uruguay Round agreements stipulated that

when comparing export prices to the foreign firm’s home-market prices, the agency must use

only weighted averages for both sets of prices or individual prices for both. As mentioned

above, the USDOC’s method had been to compare U.S. individual prices to a weighted average

of the foreign firm’s own market (or third country) prices, which likely helps inflate the dumping

margin. Thus, this change should lower dumping margins. Second, the Uruguay Round

agreements require dumping margin calculations to use actual data to estimate administrative

selling costs and profits when constructing dumping margins. U.S. practice had been to assume

a minimum 10% for administrative costs and 8% for profit, unless data showed even higher

figures. These administrative selling costs and profits are subtracted from observed U.S. prices

to derive ex factory prices. Thus, eliminating these high minima levels should lead to lower

dumping margins. Finally, the Uruguay Round agreements specifically recognized the U.S.

practice of examining costs of production and eliminating “sales below cost” in constructing


methods have changed over time.




                                                                                                14
normal value. However, a number of changes were prescribed for implementation of this

practice that Congressional Budget Office (1994) judged were more stringent that previous U.S.

policy. In summary, the main changes involving dumping margin calculations were expected to

reduce the resulting U.S. dumping margins, and this will be tested in the empirical analysis

below.

         Court rulings also have the potential to affect USDOC dumping margin calculations.

Parties involved in U.S. AD actions have the ability to appeal rulings with the U.S. Court of

International Trade (USCIT) and, ultimately, the U.S. Supreme Court. Many of these cases

involve issues connected with procedures used in dumping margin calculations by the USDOC.15

Importantly, the USCIT has allowed the USDOC broad discretion in how it administers the U.S.

AD law and only overturns decisions when a procedure is clearly not reasonable in its

consistency with the law. Most decisions involve very specific issues connected with the

dumping margin that are case-specific and do not have general applicability. It is rare to see the

USDOC announce general policy changes in procedure due to USCIT decisions and none seem

to be substantive in nature. I note that these are broad impressions from reading a number of

USCIT decisions, in addition to the USDOC decision announcements. Future work to more

consistently investigate effects of USCIT decisions would definitely be warranted, but will not

be the focus of this study.

         Finally, dispute settlement processes connected with free trade agreements have the

potential to affect USDOC margin calculations. The Canadian-U.S. Free Trade Agreement

(CUSFTA) and North American Free Trade Agreements (NAFTA) provide for such a dispute


14
   Hansen and Prusa (1996) show that changes in the law due to the 1984 Trade and Tariff Act did have a substantial
impact on USITC injury determinations, by allowing the USITC to cumulate import sources in their decision of
injury to the domestic industry.
15
   Recent years have seen over 150 U.S. Court of International trade rulings, many which involve appeals related to
AD cases.


                                                                                                                15
settlement process which has been used to some extent by member countries. Jones (2000)

highlights a handful of cases where such rulings led to significant changes in dumping margins

for particular cases and does a simple time-series analysis to show that U.S. AD activity against

Canada fell after the CUSFTA. However, Blonigen (2002) finds no such effects of declining AD

activity for member countries after either CUSFTA or NAFTA when controlling for other factors

in a panel data setting. Neither study formally examines the effect of these dispute settlement

activities on USDOC dumping margin calculations. Once again, reading of various NAFTA

dispute settlement panel decisions suggests that rulings are on issues that are quite case-specific

and do not have general implications for USDOC procedures. The GATT/WTO also has a

dispute settlement mechanism, but there have been relatively few rulings connected with U.S.

AD cases.



5. Empirical Analysis

5.1. Methodology and Data

       To examine the factors underlying the changes in USDOC dumping margins over time,

this section presents a more formal statistical analysis using data on all firm-specific USDOC

dumping margins calculated for cases filed from 1980 through 1995. Specifically, I regress firm-

specific dumping margins on controls for discretionary USDOC practices, legal changes, and

country composition. Using these estimates, I can then decompose the impact of each of these

channels on dumping margins over time to understand their relative contribution.

       As mentioned, data on firm-specific dumping margins (the dependent variable) come

from USDOC decisions, announced in the Federal Register notices. I include dumping margin

calculations for any foreign firm named in the Federal Register notices as being investigated,

even if that firm ultimately received an all-other or country-wide AD margin. Also, I include

                                                                                                  16
preliminary USDOC margin determinations when the case is withdrawn or terminated before a

final USDOC decision is made. Preliminary USDOC margins account for about 9% of the

sample, but the econometric results are qualitatively identical whether they are included in the

sample or not. The final sample comprises almost 1600 firm-specific dumping margins.

         To control for USDOC discretionary practices, I begin by including separate indicator

variables for each of the USDOC discretionary practices listed in Table 1. In addition, I include

an indicator variable that takes the value of “1” when the firm is from a non-market economy

and “factors of production” are used to calculate normal value.16 To control for legal changes

that occurred from the trade acts in 1984 and 1988 and the implementation of the Uruguay

Round agreements, I include separate indicator variables for each that take the value of “1” for

years subsequent to the year of enactment and “0” otherwise. Finally, to control for country

composition effects, I include the following country/region variables that correspond to the

primary regions subject to U.S. AD actions: 1) Canada, 2) Mexico, 3) Other Latin America, 4)

European Union, 5) Japan, 6) Korea, 7) Taiwan, 8) China, 9) Other Asia, and 10)

USSR/Russia.17 The excluded category is “Rest of the World” and includes such countries and

regions as Israel, Egypt, South Africa, East European countries, Scandinavian countries, and

former Soviet republics. Table 2 provides descriptive statistics for the variables just described.




16
   I did not include this discretionary practice in Table 1 because it is so closely tied to country composition. In the
econometric analysis, however, it will be possible to identify the USDOC practice used for non-market economies
from specific country effects to some extent.
17
   “Other Latin America” is comprised of countries from the region (besides Mexico) that have been subject to U.S.
AD actions. These are Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Peru, Trinidad &
Tobago and Venezuela. In like fashion, “Other Asia” includes Australia, Bangladesh, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia,
Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand.



                                                                                                                     17
5.2. Econometric Analysis

       Column 1 of table 3 presents econometric results from regressing USDOC dumping

margins on the indicator control variables discussed above. The overall fit of the equation is

good with an adjusted R2 of 0.35. The estimates suggest that “facts available”, “adverse facts

available”, and non-market economy procedures are the discretionary USDOC practices that

have a statistically significant impact on dumping margin calculations. The estimated effects of

these practices are large with “facts available” methods leading to a 30.7 percentage point

increase in the ad valorem dumping margin calculated by the USDOC, and the use of “adverse

facts available” leading to an additional 32.4 percentage point increase.18 In other words,

“adverse facts available” leads to a 63.1 percentage point increase in the dumping margin.

Foreign firms from non-market economies, where the USDOC uses third-country data to

estimate normal value leads to dumping margin that is 25.4% larger than average. The other

discretionary practices show no statistically significant effects on dumping margins.

       With respect to other controls, the 1984 Trade Act is estimated to have a moderate

increasing effect on dumping margins, whereas Uruguay implementation is estimated to have led

to a 7 percentage point decrease in the baseline U.S. dumping margin. The 1988 Trade Act

shows no statistically significant effect. The country indicator variables are jointly statistically

significant at the 1% level. Korea, Taiwan, and USSR/Russia generally receive lower average

margins, while China averages dumping margins 25 percentage points greater than the excluded

“rest of the world” category, everything else equal.

       Assuming these estimated effects are constant over the sample, I next use these

coefficient estimates to decompose the relative contribution of each channel (USDOC




                                                                                                       18
discretionary practices, legal changes and country composition) on the general increase in

USDOC dumping margins over time. For example, if China is more often the target of petitions

in later years of the sample, and Taiwan and Korea are targets less often, such changes in country

composition may explain a significant portion of the general rise in dumping margins. Figure 3

shows this decomposition, using the estimates from column 1 of table 3. While a small part of

the rise is can perhaps be attributed to changes in country composition, the vast majority is due to

changes in the composition of discretionary practices over time; i.e., in the extensive use of these

practices. Given the coefficient estimates, this increase is almost exclusively due to the

increased use of facts available, adverse facts available, and non-market economy procedures.

         The analysis to this point does not estimate the possibility of changes in the intensive use

of discretionary practices; i.e., changes in how these practices are implemented. The way in

which cost of production tests are conducted in 2000 may systematically differ from those

conducted in 1980. This may be an additional source of increasing USDOC dumping margins.

To explore this, I next interact the discretionary practices variables with a trend term.

Coefficients on these terms then indicate how changes in implementation of these practices may

affect dumping margins over time.

         Column 2 of table 3 present estimates when I include these trend-interaction terms.

The interaction terms are jointly significant at the 1% significance level. Three of the six trend-

interaction terms show statistically significant positive coefficients. This indicates that

implementation of these practices (adverse facts available, constructed value, and non-market

economy procedures) is changing in such a way that their application later in the sample leads to

a larger dumping margin than earlier in the sample. The use of facts available continues to have


18
  Note that this interpretation of the coefficient estimates is due to the fact that “adverse facts available” is a subset
of “facts available”.


                                                                                                                        19
a significant direct effect on the dumping margin, but its effect does not significantly increase

over time.

       The other control variables remain largely the same, with the exception of the Uruguay

Round implementation. This legal change is now estimated to have led to a 20 percentage point

lower baseline dumping margin for the latter half of the 1990s. However, given the overall

movement of dumping margins in figure 1, it is clear that other factors must have compensated

for this drop in the baseline. As we discuss next, changes in discretionary practices continued to

rise over the same time period to essentially compensate for the Uruguay Round effect in full by

the end of the sample.

       Figure 4 decomposes the various channels of dumping margin effects with the estimates

in column 2 of table 3, which account for both change in the extensive use of discretionary

practices and the intensive use (captured by the trend-interaction terms). Accounting for changes

in the intensive use of discretionary practices clearly is important. The effect of discretionary

practices is now seen as the main force in understanding average dumping margins changes over

time (compare to figure 1), with a slight role for country composition changes and no (or even a

mitigating role) of legal changes. While the Uruguay Round implementation led to a 20

percentage point drop in the baseline dumping margin after 1995, evolving discretionary

practices led to almost an 18 percentage point increase from 1995 to 2000.

       The results in table 3 are relatively insensitive to a number of alternative specifications.

Estimates with a general trend term included were hardly changed from those reported. The

trend term was positive and statistically significant in the column 1 estimates, but insignificant in

the column 2 estimates where the trend term is also interacted with the discretionary practices

variables. I also tried a specification where a trend is interacted with the country indicator

variables. This would pick up discretionary changes in how the USDOC treats firms from

                                                                                                      20
particular countries over time. This did not affect the discretionary practices variables

significantly either.

        One major concern with the above specifications is that there are no control variables for

case-specific factors that may affect calculation of firm-specific duties. A variety of market

structure features, from production technology to the types of distribution channels, may have

significant and systematic effects on the USDOC’s method of dumping margin calculations and

may even affect the implementation of discretionary practices. Omission of such variables may

bias the estimates in a number of ways. First, there are no controls for macroeconomic effects to

this point, such as exchange rates and general health of the U.S. economy, which may affect

dumping margin calculations. Second, as mentioned in the introduction, over time firms may

learn which products and industries are more likely to receive higher dumping margins and target

those more frequently in their petitions.

        A simple, but powerful, way to control for such concerns is inclusion of case-specific

dummies. Since cases are product-, time- and country-specific, this is the equivalent of

including country-product-time fixed effects. Coefficient estimates are then identified only by

the variation in firm-specific margins within each AD case. Inclusion of such fixed effects

means that one can no longer include the country/region indicator variables or the trade act

variables due to (perfect) multicollinearity concerns. The non-market economy variable likewise

is perfectly collinear with these case-specific variables, since all firms from such a country are

subject to such a discretionary practice; i.e., there is no variation across firms in these cases with

respect to this practice.

        Column 1 of table 4 provides results from regressing USDOC firm-specific margins on

the remaining control variables (the USDOC discretionary practices indicator variables) when




                                                                                                     21
also including case-specific fixed effects.19 The adjusted R2 almost doubles from that of column

1 estimates in table 3 (from 0.35 to 0.76) and an F-test indicates that the case-specific fixed

effects are jointly significant at the 1 percent level. Column 2 of table 4 includes interactions of

the discretionary practices with a trend term. Once again there is strong evidence that increasing

extensive and intensive use of some of the discretionary practices have contributed substantially

to rising USDOC dumping margins. Consistent with table 3 specifications, “adverse facts

available” and constructed value methods contribute substantially toward explaining

(increasingly) higher dumping margins. Also consistent with table 3 results, “facts available”

has a significant direct effect on the dumping margin, but its effect does not significantly

increase over time. Unlike table 3, the cost of production test is also estimated to be significant

in increasing dumping margins over time once controlling for case-specific effects. On the other

hand, the estimates suggest that there is a downward trend in the effect of the application of

third-country price methods. However, as shown in table 1, there are very few cases using this

method by the end of the sample.

        These case-specific fixed effects estimates are obviously preferred from an econometric

standpoint, but also are remarkably consistent with the anecdotal evidence of which practices

have evolved the most, as well as the results in table 3 when not controlling for such factors.

Because the country and legal change factors are subsumed into the case-specific effects,

however, we cannot provide a similar decomposition to figures 3 and 4 from these estimates.




19
   The number of observations decreases because there are some cases where only one firm-specific dumping margin
is calculated in a case, which is then subsumed in the case-specific fixed effects.


                                                                                                             22
6. Conclusion

       A little-noticed trend in U.S. AD protection has been the rapid increase in average

dumping margins calculated by the USDOC. As a result, average U.S. AD duties have risen

from around 15% in the early 1980s to over 60% by 2000. With the percent of cases ruled

affirmative by the USITC also rising over this same time period (from 45% to 60%) and the

number of annual cases remaining high, this rise in calculated AD duties has meant a dramatic

rise in U.S. AD protectiveness. This paper finds that this increase is primarily through changing

discretionary practices at the USDOC versus country composition of investigated cases or legal

changes. This is due not only to increasing use of these practices over time (the extensive use),

but apparent changes in implementation of these practices that mean a higher increase in the

margin whenever they are applied (the intensive use).

       Thus, while other studies have shown that agencies’ discretionary implementation of

legal AD statutes significantly affects the AD duties that foreign firms receive, this paper shows

that these discretionary practices can evolve substantially in a relatively short time period,

despite being subject to appeals court and settlement dispute decisions. Given the rapid increase

in U.S. AD duties shown in this paper, perhaps the term “devolution” is a better description than

“evolution.” As mentioned in the introduction, this calls into question the ability of WTO

agreements (or regional agreements) to truly provide a credible and transparent framework for

member countries’ administration of AD laws. The multitude of window-dressing legal changes

that have occurred to this point have had little effect. Indeed, the estimates show that USDOC

discretion compensated for a substantial Uruguay Round effect in just five years. Thus, the

evidence suggests more drastic actions are required if the WTO wants to seriously address AD

protection, which arguably is proliferating and increasing worldwide.




                                                                                                 23
        Many economists would argue that dumping concerns should be handled exactly as

national antitrust authorities approach any other market concern. For these authorities, the issue

is not about fairness, but about whether a certain practice makes markets anticompetitive and

decreases overall welfare, not just the welfare of a certain subset of firms in the industry. The

difficulty is taking these principles to an international stage, where countries will often have

competing interests. Devising an appropriate international body to handle these issues, within

the context of WTO or otherwise, is a major task with many political obstacles.

        An alternative intermediate step would be to simply eliminate antidumping (and perhaps

countervailing duty policies) in favor of safeguard actions. Dumping calculations (and like

subsidy calculations) have little credibility, so why expend resources for such a process?

Safeguards still rely on injury determinations and the problem of discretion, of course, is not

limited to dumping calculations, but also to such injury determinations (see, e.g., Durling and

McCullough, 2002, and Irwin, 2002). The limited evidence within the U.S., however, is that this

process has not so quickly evolved towards more protection due to discretion. In addition,

safeguards have additional benefits. First, they are clearly temporary measures, which is not true

with AD and CVD actions despite adoption of common “sunset” provisions by member

countries.20 Second, safeguard actions are handled in a much more public way than AD and

CVD actions, and thus subject to more political scrutiny from both sides of the issue. This

certainly was seen in the recent steel safeguard actions pursued by the Bush administration in the

early 2000s.




20
 The U.S. still has AD duties in place that began with investigations as early as the 1970s. Liebman (2001) and
Moore (2002) find that the vast majority of U.S. sunset cases led to continuation of AD and CVD duties.
