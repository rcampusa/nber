               Implicit Estimates of Natural, Trend,
                and Cyclical Components of Real GNP




                             ABSTRACT




Estimates of the natural or full employment level of real
GNP have usually been obtained by statistical detrending
procedures which assume independence between trend and
cycle.   This paper presents an alternative approach which
says that the natural level should be measured in the
context of a macro model.   If the quantity equation holds
with money exogenous and if the price level is sticky, then
observed real GNP will reflect both nominal shocks, which
are observed, and real shocks, which are unobserved shifts
in the natural level. The path of the natural level is then
implicit in the data given the model. Calculated paths of
the natural level of U.S. real GNP and the resulting
business cycle are presented.

1.   Introduction

     A series of recent papers has renewed interest in an
old problem in economic measurement: how should we decompose
aggregate output into its "natural" or "full employment"
level and the "business cycle" which is the deviation of
actual output from the natural level? One motivation for
asking the question is that we claim to have some theories
of the business cycle which may suggest policies that could
be taken to reduce them.     Another motivation is that we
would like to test these theories and we need to identify
the two components empirically in order to do so.        The

traditional solution to the problem has been to assume that
the natural level follows an exponential function with a
constant growth rate so the cyclical component is revealed
as the residuals in the regression of the log of output on
time. The idea, apparently, is that long term growth must
be due to growth in the natural level and since regression
on time removes growth from the data it corresponds to the
decomposition we seek.     While the first part is true by
assumption, the second need not follow.   The natural level

may be subject to transitory disturbances, for example
weather, which would then be included in the business cycle.
More fundamentally, the natural level may itself be a
stochastic process which grows because it is nonstationary
rather than because it depends deterministically on time.
In an earlier paper, Charles I. Plosser and I pointed out



                              3
that the presence of a deterministic time trend is a
testable hypothesis which enjoys little support from the
data.     If the deterministic trend hypothesis is wrong, then
regression detrending will confound business cycle movements
with stochastic variation in the natural level.

        Harvey (1985) has suggested that the decomposition
problem be cast in the state space framework with output
consisting of a stationary cycle plus a drifting random walk
which accounts for long term growth. The two components are
assumed to be statistically independent in order to identify
the state space model.        The Kalman filter is used to
calculate estimates of the random walk and cycle components.
Watson (1986) and Clark (1986) have applied the state space
model to post-war U.S. quarterly data.               An alternative
univariate (using only data on the variable itself)
detrending method is that suggested by Stephen Beveridge and
myself (1981) in which the trend is defined as the long
range forecast obtained from an ARIMA model.                      The

identifying     assumption   of       independence    between     the

components in the state space model would seem to be crucial
for the picture that emerges since both Watson and Clark
find that it implies far greater variation in the cycle
component and far less in the trend component than does the

Beveridge/Nelson     definition       which   does     not      impose

independence.
        One of the objectives of this paper is to suggest that
the assumption of statistical independence between the



                                  4
business cycle and the natural level may be an economically
inappropriate one to impose a priori.               If it    is

inappropriate, then resulting estimates of trend and cycle
will not correspond to the natural level and the deviations
from it that we would like to measure.          Sir John Hicks
(1965) made the point very clearly when he wrote:

          â€¢ .The distinction between trend and fluctuation
     is      a   statistical   distinction;   it   is   an
    unquestionably useful device for statistical
    summarizing.  Since economic theory is to be
    applied to statistics, which are arranged in this
    manner, a corresponding arrangement of theory will
     (no doubt) often be convenient. But this gives us
    no reason to suppose that there is anything
    corresponding to it on the economic side which is
    at all fundamental, We have no right to conclude,
    from the mere existence of the statistical device,
    that the economic forces making for trend and for
    fluctuation are any different, so that they have
    to be analyzed in different ways."

     The approa.ch to measurement of the natural and cyclical

components proposed in this paper departs from past efforts
in two fundamental respects.         First, it abandons the
assumption of independence between trend and cycle, allowing
instead for interaction between them.      Second, it is based
on a model of fluctuations in output where nominal and real
shocks both play a role.      As a starting point I take for
granted that actual output at time t, say Qt in logs, is a
function of the sequence of nominal shocks as well as the
path of the natural level of output.        The latter may be
thought of as indexing the production possibilities frontier
facing the economy and reflects the growth of the stocks of
capital, labor and technology as well as real shocks which


                                5
may be in part transitory (the weather) and in part
permanent. In general there is a relation of the form

(1)            t = Q(..Xt-i,      .,QNt_l,QNt)

where Y is a vector of nominal variables and QN denotes the
natural level of output.

           The general strategy proposed in this paper is to use
the relationship between observed Q and observed         to infer
the unobserved value of QN.           To make this operational of
course we need a particular model which specifies the
relevant variables.        The identifying restriction in this
approach is independence between observed variables (which
might potentially include some components of QN) and the
unobserved components of QN which we wish to infer.             A
simplifying assumption I make in this paper is that nominal
shocks are summarized by nominal GNP, denoted Y, as in the
empirical models used by Lucas (1973) and Gordon (1982) so
that equation (1) becomes


(2)            Qt =Q(..,Yt_i,Yt;..,QNt_i,QNt).


The role of equation (2) then is to divide a given exogenous
change in nominal spend'ing between changes in output and the
price level since the three are linked by the identity Y =      Q

+     P,    where P is the log of the price deflator.        This

recursive structure relating income to output and prices is
a characteristic of monetary models in which exogenous



                                  6
movements in monetary aggregates determine nominal income
through a money demand function.       Some evidence that
quarterly GNP data are not seriously at odds with the
recursive structure assumption is presented in an earlier
paper (Nelson, 1979), and Fama (1981) has demonstrated its
consistency with the aversion that the stock market shows to
inflation.   Lagged adjustment of output and prices to a
nominal shock is a property of both sticky price models and
models in which prices are flexible but information
available to individual agents is incomplete. Stickiness in
prices has been a mainstay of macroeconomic theory at least
since Hume (1752) and recently has gotten a more rigorous
foundation in the literature based on contracting theory.
Section 2 of the paper investigates a simple dynamic model

suggested by partial adjustment of prices, Section 3
presents the implied natural and trend components of real
GNP, Section 4 studies the resulting cyclical component,
Section 5 compares these results with alternative methods,
and Section 6 offers some conclusions and suggestions for
further research.

2.   An Empirical Price Adjustment Model

     To implement equation (2) empirically I investigate the
distributed lag function relating real GNP to nominal GNP
using post-war quarterly U.S. data (1947:1 -   1985:4).   The

history of the natural level of real GNP is implicit in the
residuals of this model. Since all of these variables are



                             7
nonstationary I work with first differences denoted by lower
case letters.         My expectation was that the long run
multiplier in this relationship would be close to zero since
an exogenous increase in the growth rate of nominal spending

should have little, if any, permanent impact on the growth
rate of real GNP or, equivalently, nominal shocks should be
ultimately absorbed in the price level.                     My prior work on
the dynamics of inflation for the 1954-1970 period (Nelson,
1979) suggests that the distributed lag will be a simple one
with geometric decay of the lag coefficients.                    I therefore
fitted the transfer function (distributed lag model)
                            L
(3)          qt =                      + C + et
                    1 -SL



which implies an impact multiplier of 0)0 and allows for
geometric decay at rate 3 after a second period effect of

(Ã¶O)oC01).    The long run multiplier effect of y on q (the
gain of the transfer function) is given by (0)0â€”0)1)1(1-3) so

I expected o and 0 to be approximately equal.                            Least

square parameter estimates using the PDQ program TRAN/EST
yielded
                    .74 â€”       .75L
             qt =                      Yt   + .01 +   et;   R-sq = .76
                      1 â€” . 92L


which implies a small negative point estimate for the gain
and a rather slow rate of decay, both of which are
consistent with the results for 1954-1970 period I reported
earlier.      What is apparent, though, in this longer time



                                        8
period is a persistence in residual autocorrelation which
starts at .44 at lag one and declines slowly, suggesting
that the residuals behave like an ARMA(1,l) in which case we
would have (1â€”L)et = (1â€”tL)ut where u denotes white noise.
Reestimating with that specification, I obtained
                   .75 â€”    .76L                          1 â€” 50L
(5)           =                     Yt     +   .009   +                Ut
                   lâ€”.94L                                 1â€”.83L

           R2 =    .82; F(5,147) = 133.6;                 =       .0048;
           Q(12)    = 16.98.


Remaining residual autocorrelation is not suggestive of a
more complex ARN scheme, nor do cross-correlations between
the residuals and the                 independent variable                   suggest
misspecification of the transfer function. While the point
estimate of the gain is negative (â€”0.04), it is not
significant (the difference between estimated Â°o and (O
being   a fraction of one standard error).
      The two denominator parameters 8 and $ are both within
one standard error of 0.9, indeed the difference between
them is not significant. If we take 8 and $ to be the same
parameter we can multiply through by a common factor (1-pL),
where p is about 0.9, thereby putting it in ARMAX form.
After   estimating the ARNAX model              using micro-TSP we have


(6)            =           qtâ€”i    + (.76 â€” .73L)yt           +    (1â€”.59L)ut
                 (.09)               (.03) (.07)                     (.12)
            R2 = .82; F      =    165.0;       a = .0049

                                         9
which effectively gives the same fit to the data as did the
unconstrained transfer function.

       It is readily shown that an equation of this form would

be implied by partial adjustment of the price level in
response to shifts in Y and QN.           If the price level were
completely flexible then actual Q would always be equal to
QN and the price level would be PNt t -             Qk   where PN may
be thought of as the natural level of the price index. If
the price level is not completely flexible but rather the
actual price level at time t depends also on past actual
price levels then the simplest specification is


(7)           =   stâ€”i +   (1â€”k) PNt; 0 <        < 1.

Replacing P by its equivalent (Y-Q) and PN by (Y-QN), taking
first differences, and solving for qt we have

                                  (lâ€”?)
(8)        qt =        â€¢ Yt   +           â€¢ qn
                                  1-XL


where qn denotes the first difference of the log of QN.
Equation (8) describes the lagged adjustment of output to
changes in nominal spending and the natural level of output.
In this heuristic model there is one parameter, 1, which
corresponds to parameters 8 and 0 of the empirical model
(5).     It also corresponds to the numerator parameters 0
which take on somewhat smaller values empirically than do
the denominator parameters. This difference, however, seems
to be related to sample period since if we drop the noisier
early years and estimate the model for 1954:1 - 1985:4 the


                                    10
numerator parameter values jump to .84 while 6 and 4 remain
near .9.    A value of around .9 for     is roughly consistent
with the overlapping contracts interpretation of price level
adjustment if the U.S. economy is characterized by three
year contracts, one twelfth of which adjust each calendar
quarter. But there is no need to put too fine a point on
it.        The objective here      is   to obtain   a   simple
characterization of the dynamics of nominal and real GNP in
order to see what such a model would imply about the
behavior of the natural level component of real GNP.




                              11
3.      The Implied Behavior of the Natural Rate of Output

        The next step is to infer the behavior of the natural
level of output, QN, from the empirical model given by (5)
and (6) by interpreting its parameters in the context of the

partial adjustment model given by (8).                                we associate the
error process of equations                               (5)    and    (6)   with the
corresponding term of equation (8) involving qn.                                   The

equivalence is
             (1â€”k)                    (1â€”eL)
()                      qn =                       ut    + c
             (lâ€”A.L)                  (1â€”L)

which implies the relation
                       (1-OL)
(10)        qn =                      ut   + C'
                       (1â€”?.,.)




or


             qn = Ut'             -
 (11)                                 Out_i'      + C'


               ut' =        ut/(1-X).
This representation of the natural rate is a first order
moving average process in first differences qn where the
innovations Ut' are the innovations in the transfer function
:scaled by the factor 11(1-A.)                          10.    The standard deviation

of qn (the quarterly growth in QN) is therefore about .05
compared with .01 for the sample standard deviation of
actual output growth q, where the scale of these numbers is
such that .10 would be 10% over a calendar quarter. But a



                                                  12
substantial portion of the variation in qn is transitory.
This is not the contradiction in terms that it may seem.
Note that the IMA(1,1) structure of QN is consistent with
its being composed of a random walk with drift, denoted QT,
with innovation v plus a transitory random part, denoted w
(for weather).          The first difference of QN then has the
representation qn = Vt + wt. The autocovariances of qn
give two equations in two unknowns:

(12)          var (qn) =      var   (v) + 2 var (w)


                coy (qn, qn_1) =            - var      (w).


Using values of the moments implied by the empirical model
the implied standard deviations of the various components of
the    growth rate q are then
(13)               = .01
              aqn = .05,
                   = .05
                   =   .03.

        The   model implies that the innovations v in the
stochastic trend underlying the natural level QN are noisier
than observed output growth itself, but this of course
reflects the smoothing that is implied by the transfer
function for q. Rewriting the second term of the model with

qn replaced by Cv + w) we have
                                              (1â€”a.)
(14)          q = nominal      effects +                 (Vt +
                                               1-L


                                       13
which says that only about 5 percent of the variance in v
shows up in the variance of q. Empirically, we can estimate
the history of QT from the history of QN by the usual
exponential smoothing formula

(15)          OTt = (1â€”e) QNt + S      QT_
where 8 is the moving average parameter in equation (11) and
the ON are understood to be the estimates given the model
and the data.           This corresponds to the Beveridge/Nelson
estimate of the trend component of QN because it is the long

range forecast.          Equivalently it is the one-sided Kalman
filter estimate of the trend component of QN.
       Calculation of the natural and trend components is
straightforward given the data on q and y, residuals u, and
parameter values ?., 8, and c.             Figure 1 shows the implied
histories of ON and QT along with actual Q using values ). =

.9,    8 =   .5,   and c =   .009.   The time period of the figure is
1970 - 1985 because this allows greater resolution over an

interval of particular current interest, but recursive
calculation of the components was started in 1947. We see
that the major movements in ON and QT correspond to the
major oil shocks of 1974, 1980 and (in reverse) 1983.
Slowdowns in the growth of the natural rate are apparent in
1970-71, 1973, and in a more prolonged way following 1977.
In each case, periods of slow GNP growth ensued.                 More

recently, since 1983, the growth of the natural rate has



                                      14
been rapid, corresponding to more. rapid GNP growth and
diminishing inflation.
     For the entire period 1947-1985 we have the picture
shown in Figure 2 where only the trend component is plotted
along with actual real GNP. The contrast between the stable
price era of the 1950's and the inflation era of the 1970's
and the transition in the late 1960's are clear.       Also
apparent from Figure 2 is that considerable variation in GNP
is not due to variation in the natural rate. In particular,
the prolonged gaps between the actual and natural levels of
GNP from 1951 to 1966 and from 1973 to 1983 stand out. Note
that the transfer function model is a way of dividing the
variance of GNP growth between the influence of QN and the
influence of nominal shocks as summarized by Y.   According
to equation (4), only about 25 percent of the variance of
growth in real GNP is due to variation in the natural rate.

4.   The Business Cycle

     The deviation of actual GNP from its natural level
represents the influence of nominal shocks to the economy as
well, in general, as the transitory influence of real
shocks.   For want of a better term we will join tradition
and call this difference between Q and QN the "business
cycle" and denote it QC, although there is nothing about the
framework of the paper that suggests predictably periodic
fluctuations. From the definition of QC and the heuristic
model of equation (8) we have



                                15
(16)         QCt     Qt - QNt

               =     (/1-L)   Yt +        (â€”I1-.L)    qn
which puts the same lag structure on both sources of
variation in Q, although with opposite signs. A positive
nominal shock raises GNP relative to the natural rate, while
a positive shock to the natural rate raises the natural rate
faster than it does output--thereby reducing the cyclical

component.      In this decomposition there is definitely

independence between the natural rate (or trend) process and
the cycle component. They are negatively related.
       The stochastic characteristics of the cycle may be
derived from equation (16).               We start by noting that after
multiplying through by the term (1-A.L) the QC process has
the form

(17)         QCt =   ? QC       +   ?Yt   -
                                               Aqn.
Thus QC is autoregressive with coefficient ., which suggests
strongly autocorrelated (persistent) behavior given values
of ? around .9.         The last two terms in y and qn can be
thought of as the moving average part of the QC process.
Recall that qn itself is MA(1) with a coefficient of about
0.5 (following the convention of negative signs in front of
MA coefficients). Univariate analysis of y (the quarterly
growth rate of nominal GNP) suggests that an AR(1) model is
more appropriate than an MA(1) model, but for exploratory
purposes let us approximate the former by the latter; noting


                                          16
the coefficient value is about - .4 and denoting its
innovations by e we have roughly

(18)       QCt =    .9 QC_j + .9 (Ct +

                     â€”    .9   (Ut' â€”.5ut_i')

              =    .01;         = .05

recalling that u' are the innovations of the QN process. We
see that the MA part of the QC process is the sum of two
MA(1)'s, one positively autocorrelated and the other
negatively.       The net result depends then on the relative
variances of e and u', and since that of u' is larger, the
MA part of QC will display negative autocorrelation.      The
univariate behavior of Q is then characterized as ARNA(1,l).
       To show what this looks like, Figure 3 displays QC over
the 1947-1985 period. The long waves in the series reflect
the persistence of the effects of y and qn through the AR
part of the process, while the chop in the series reflects
the negatively autocorrelated MA part of the process.
Recall that the MA behavior of qn can be interpreted as
being due to the presence of random noise, "the weather,"
and that is what causes the chop we see in QC. Note that
the cycle component of GNP was generally negative until the
late 1960's, then persistently positive until the early
1980's, corresponding to the eras of low inflation, rising
inflation, and waning inflation in the U.S. economy.




                                        17
     To eliminate some of the noise in QC we can
alternatively measure the deviation of actual GNP from the
smoothed trend component, that is (Q-QT), since it is QN
that is noisy rather than Q.        The resulting smoothed cycle
is shown in Figure 4. While the historical patterns are of
course the same, we get a clearer picture of them. Major
dips in the series correspond to some extent to traditional
NBER business cycles.
     In order to see how nominal and real shocks contributed
separately to this overall pattern, the two components of QC
from equation (16) are plotted in Figure 5.             Nominal
influence on the cycle was deflationary, except for the
Korean War period, until 1966.              It became strongly
inflationary in the early 1970's and continued so until
1982. The real influence on the cycle was positive in the
late 1940's and negative during the Korean War period,
presumably reflecting the ending and later resumption of
wartime controls.   Large real shocks show up of course in
1974 and to a lesser extent in 1980. Recall that negative
real shocks will increase the cycle component.              Most

interestingly, perhaps, the real contribution to the cycle
has been strongly negative since 1982 suggesting that it is
this rather than monetary restraint that is largely the
source of diminished inflation.         Perhaps this is why the
monetarists have been consistently wrong in forecasting the
return of inflation in recent years.        In effect they were




                               18
only looking at half of the picture and the other half was
strongly deflationary.
     The nominal and real components of QC make roughly
equivalent contributions to its total variation.          The
standard deviation of QC is .08 while that of the nominal
component is .05 and that of the real component is.06 over
the 1947-85 period. Since these components are in principle
(and by construction) uncorrelated, it follows that each by
itself explains, in a regression sense, about half of the
variation in QC, with a bit more explanatory power coming
from the real component.

5.   Comparison With Univariate Trend-Cycle Decomposition

     Traditional statistical methods are univariate in that
they attempt to infer the paths of trend and cycle
components just from the past history of the variable
itself.   In deterministic trend models the trend line is
chosen to minimize cyclical deviations.    In the unobserved
components model with a random walk stochastic trend
suggested by Harvey, the trend component has additional
flexibility to track the series and the resulting cyclical
deviations are smaller. Clark finds deviations from linear
â€¢trend in post-war U.S. real GNP of up to 8 percent while the
random walk specification for trend reduces this range to
about 5 percent. Not surprisingly, the duration of cyclical
episodes is also reduced, with the 1965-1974 period being




                             19
entirely above trend in the linear trend case but being
interrupted by the 1970 recession in the random walk case.

    Watson and Clark also present estimates of trend using
the Beveridge/Nelson method which defines the trend to be
the long range forecast of the series based on its
autocorrelation structure. It does not impose independence
between trend and cycle as does the unobserved components
model. For real GNP the Beveridge/Nelson cycle component is
small, with a range of only a couple of percent, and
variation in real GNP is dominated by variation in trend.
This result follows computationally from the fact that
quarterly log changes in real GNP are only weakly
autocorrelated during the 1947â€”1985 period with an AR(1)
coefficient of .37. Since resulting forecasted changes will
be small, the Beveridge/Nelson trend value will differ
relatively little from the actual value at any point in
time.      The unobserved components model produces more
variation in the cyclical component by insisting that it
move independently of trend.
        At the other end of the spectrum in variation and
persistence is the cycle implied by the transfer function
model. Recall from Figure 4 that the cycle ranges from -.16
to + .18 and makes only one major upswing during the entire
post-war period. How is it possible that the real GNP data
by itself could contain so little information about the
trend that the two become virtually indistinguishable in the
Beveridge/Nelson decomposition? The transfer function model



                               20
suggests why this is so.        Note that the model can be
rewritten as approximately


(19)      (1 â€”   .9L) qt = .75(1â€”L)y + (lâ€”.5L)ut

deleting the constant for clarity. This would seem to imply
strong autocorrelation       in growth rates q since the
coefficient on lagged q is .9.           The univariate ARMA
representation of q will also, however, involve the ARMPi
representation of y which is AR(1), as noted before, with
coefficient .45.      Substituting for y and denoting its
innovation again by e we have

(20)      (lâ€”.9L) (1â€”.45L)q =   .75(lâ€”L)et

             + (1â€”.95L + .225L2)ut.


The MA part of the process will be MA(2) but since the
variance of e is five times as large as the variance of u it
will be dominated by the first order MA in c which has a
unit root. Dividing (20) through by the operator (1-9L) we
have approximately

(21)      (lâ€”.45L)q     .75et + Ut.

The ? parameter that accumulates movements in y and qn into
the large and persistent variations we saw in QC has
effectively canceled out of the univariate representation.
We could hope to detect it only with a very long data
record.     Therefore q will display relatively weak
autocorrelation with a pattern typical of AR(l) behavior.


                               21
The additional information that the transfer function gets
from y is lost in the univariate model.

6.   Conclusions and Suggestions for Further Research


     The methodology for decomposition of aggregate output
into natural, trend, and cyclical components suggested in
this paper turns away from the statistically convenient
assumption of independence and proposes instead that the
decomposition be model-based.        In general, fluctuations in
output are attributable to nominal shocks and the path of
the natural level of output.        The idea is to solve for the.
implied path of the natural level given the model and data
on observable nominal and real variables.
     The model used here is a heuristic representation of
partial price level adjustment which assumes that the
natural rate process proceeds independently of nominal
shocks summarized by nominal GNP. Perhaps surprisingly, the
model is not strongly at variance with post-war data. The
point here though is not to test a theory but to try a
different approach to a fundamental problem in economic
measurement.   The implied natural level of GNP itself
separates conveniently into a random walk plus noise; the
former being a stochastic trend and the latter purely
transitory, perhaps the weather. Variation in the natural
level is not independent of the implied business cycle but
rather they are negatively correlated, the latter depending
directly on the former.     The cycle component of GNP is



                               22
highly autocorrelated and its historical pattern corresponds
with the      conventional   account    of the build-up     of

inflationary pressure in the 1960's and 1970's and the
disinflation of the 1980's. The relation of this series to
other cyclical indicators, such as the unemployment rate,
bears further investigation.        The cycle component can be
separated into the part due to nominal shocks and the part
due to movements in the natural rate.         These show quite
different patterns although they contribute about equally to
total variation. It would appear that the natural rate has
played a primary role, for example, in the disinflation of
the 1980's.
