1. Introduction

        Hookworm, roundworm, whipworm, and schistosomiasis infect more than one in four people

worldwide and are particularly prevalent among school-age children in developing countries. We

examine the impact of an inexpensive school-based deworming program in rural Kenya. The order in

which the seventy-five primary schools in the sample were phased into the deworming project was

randomized, which allows us to plausibly identify the impact of the health program.

        While an older retrospective literature suggests that worms may have a negative impact on

education, more recent experimental studies present inconclusive evidence regarding the impact of

deworming treatment on education (Dickson et al. 2000). These studies typically randomize treatment

among children within the same school and then compare cognitive ability among those treatment and

comparison pupils who attend a later testing session. However, these studies suffer from several

important methodological problems. To the extent that deworming reduces the transmission of disease to

the comparison pupils, these studies both underestimate the effects of treatment on the treated and fail to

account for the externalities that many economists would argue provide a key rationale for government

deworming subsidies. Moreover, existing studies typically do not consider school participation as an

outcome, and they fail to correct for the sample attrition bias that results if deworming affects school

participation.

        We examine a program that randomized deworming treatment at the school level. We find that

deworming led to significantly higher primary school participation after two years of medical treatment.

Among the treatment group, the absenteeism rate fell by approximately one-quarter, or seven percentage

points. This effect is larger than would be suggested by retrospective estimates of the effect of worms on

school participation. School participation gains were especially large among the youngest children.

        We also find that deworming creates large externality benefits – significant reductions in worm

burdens and higher school participation – by reducing the local transmission of helminth larvae. These

externality benefits were enjoyed by both untreated children in treatment schools and children in

neighboring primary schools. Failure to take these externalities into account leads to substantially



                                                                                                              1
underestimating the cost effectiveness of treatment. Including the externality benefits of treatment, the

cost per additional year of school participation is $3, considerably less than the cost of alternative

methods of increasing school participation. Moreover, internalizing these externalities would likely

require not only fully subsidizing deworming, but actually paying people to receive treatment.

        We do not find any evidence that deworming increased test scores. However, the school

participation gains we observe are not large enough to generate statistically significant test score gains

given the observed cross-sectional relationship between school attendance and test scores.

        The current study contributes to the broader debate on the role of health in education and

economic development. Many observers of economic development have asserted that poor health and

nutrition play a central role in underdevelopment (Das Gupta 1993, Fogel 1994), and Bloom and Sachs

(1998) use cross-country data to argue that this is particularly true for Africa, the region with the most

severe tropical disease burden.1 One potential channel is the impact of poor health on education, yet

given the limited experimental evidence and the difficulty of inferring causality from correlations in non-

experimental data, some remain sceptical (see Behrman’s 1996 literature review).2 The results of the

current study raise the possibility that the cross-country relationship between tropical disease and income

could in part be caused by the negative impact of poor child health on educational attainment in less

developed countries, which later translates into lower adult income. The results also have potential

implications for public health policy in countries with substantial tropical disease burdens. The World

Health Organization (WHO) (1999) reports that nearly half of the total disease burden in Africa is due to

1
  Helminth infections in particular have long been seen as impeding economic development. The British Colonial
Kenya Native Affairs Department Annual Report 1927 writes, “The most prevalent diseases in the Kavirondo
districts (which include present-day Busia district) are respiratory complaints, worms, malaria, and ulcers,” and
regarding central Kenya, the report states, “a very high rate of helminth infection, estimated to be as high as 78
percent, exists … and a great deal of the idleness and lethargy among the natives may be attributable to this cause”
(Colony and Protectorate of Kenya 1928). Helminth infections also once constituted a major public health problem
in the U.S. South, where a random sample of residents tested by the Rockefeller Sanitary Commission between 1909
and 1914 revealed that over 40 percent were infected with hookworm (Brinkley 1994). Garland Brinkley argues
that approximately one-half of the increase in agricultural productivity in the U.S. South between 1910 and 1920 can
be attributed to reductions in hookworm prevalence associated with the Rockefeller Foundation’s campaign against
the disease.

  One exception is anemia; several prospective studies suggest iron supplementation improves academic outcomes
(Nokes et al. 1998). For an alternative view of the links between health, nutrition, and economic development, see
Strauss and Thomas (1998).

infectious and parasitic diseases, including helminth infections. To the extent that these infectious

diseases are characterized by treatment externalities similar to those estimated for deworming in this

study, extensive government subsidies for the treatment of infectious diseases would be optimal.

        The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the existing literature on helminths and

education. Section 3 describes the project we evaluate in rural Kenya and presents the baseline

educational and medical characteristics. Section 4 describes the estimation strategy. Sections 5, 6, and 7

discuss the program’s effect on health, school participation, and test scores, respectively. Section 8

examines the cost-effectiveness of deworming relative to other ways of improving health and boosting

school participation and then considers what subsidies for deworming would be optimal given the

externalities involved. The final section summarizes and discusses implications of the results.



2. Intestinal Helminth (Worm) Infections

2.1 Background on Intestinal Helminth Infections

        Recent studies estimate that 1.3 billion people worldwide are infected with roundworm (Ascaris

lumbricoides), 1.3 billion with hookworm (Necator americanus, Ancylostoma duodenale), 900 million

with whipworm (Trichuris trichura), and 200 million with schistosomiasis. Infection rates are

particularly high among school-age children and in Sub-Saharan Africa (Bundy, et al. 1998; WHO 1993).

        The geohelminths (hookworm, roundworm, and whipworm) are transmitted through contact with

or ingestion of infected fecal matter. This can occur, for example, if children do not have access to a

latrine and instead defecate in the fields near their home or school, areas where they also play.

Schistosomiasis is acquired through contact with infected freshwater streams and lakes. For example,

people in the area of Kenya where the project took place often walk to nearby Lake Victoria to bathe,

fish, or swim. School-age children often exhibit greater prevalence of geohelminth infection and higher

infection intensity than adults, as well as the highest disease burden (since morbidity is related to

infection intensity), due to a combination of high exposure and immunological factors (Bundy 1988).




                                                                                                          3
Since helminths do not reproduce within the human host, high worm burdens are the result of frequent

infection and re-infection.

        The distribution of worm burden is typically highly skewed: the majority of infected individuals

have light infections, while a minority are heavily infected. While children with light helminth infections

may be asymptomatic, more severe worm infections can lead to iron deficiency anemia, protein energy

malnutrition, stunting (a measure of chronic undernutrition), wasting (a measure of acute undernutrition),

listlessness and abdominal pain.3 Schistosomiasis often has more severe clinical consequences than the

geohelminth infections, including hepatosplenomegaly (enlargement of the liver and spleen), and may be

fatal in a small fraction of cases.

        Intestinal helminths are treated using low-cost single-dose oral therapies (Bundy and Guyatt

1996). The World Bank, World Health Organization, UNESCO, and UNICEF have endorsed mass

school-based deworming programs in areas with helminth infection prevalence over fifty percent, since

mass treatment eliminates the need for costly individual parasitological screening (Warren et al. 1993;

World Bank 1993; WHO 1987). Albendazole is used to treat the geohelminths, and praziquantel is used

to treat schistosomiasis. Since reinfection is common, albendazole is taken twice per year and

praziquantel is taken once per year. Medical treatment with albendazole and praziquantel delivered

through a large-scale mass treatment program may cost as little as 49 cents per person per year

(Partnership for Child Development 1999). These drugs have been endorsed as highly effective by

scientific committees of the World Health Organization, although single-dose albendazole treatments are

often only moderately effective against severe whipworm infections (Bennett and Guyatt 2000). The

drugs sometimes have minor side effects, including stomach ache, diarrhea, dizziness, and vomiting in

some cases (WHO 1992). However, there is concern about the possibility that albendazole could cause

  Refer to Adams et al. (1994), Corbett et al. (1992), Hotez and Pritchard (1995), and Pollitt (1990). If left
untreated, geohelminth infections may have more serious medical consequences in a minority of cases: roundworm
infections sometimes lead to fatal intestinal obstruction, hookworm infection can cause severe anemia, and
whipworm is associated with chronic dysentery.



                                                                                                                 4
birth defects (WHO 1992, Cowden and Hotez 2000), and for this reason standard practice is not to treat

girls of reproductive age in mass deworming programs (Bundy and Guyatt 1996).

        Epidemiologists have hypothesized that medical treatment for helminth infections creates

externality benefits for other community members by reducing worm deposition in the community and

thus limiting re-infection among other community members (Anderson and May 1991). The limited

existing empirical evidence suggests that these externalities may in fact be substantial. For example,

adult worm burden fell by nearly fifty percent in communities where school children were mass treated

for worms on the island of Montserrat (Bundy et al. 1990). In the absence of frequent re-infection, worm

burdens fall rapidly given the relatively short average life spans of intestinal worms: twelve months for

roundworm and whipworm, two years for hookworm, and three years for schistosomiasis mansoni

(Bundy and Cooper 1989; Anderson and May 1991).4



2.2 Evidence on Worms and Education

        The educational impact of deworming is often taken as a key issue in assessing the priority the

poorest countries should accord to deworming (Dickson et al. 2000). Moreover, wide adoption of school-

based helminth control programs will likely require the active participation of education ministries in

developing countries, and this may require evidence on the impact of deworming on education.

         It has been hypothesized that intense worm infections may reduce educational achievement

(Bundy 1994; Drake et al. 1999; Stoltzfus et al. 1997). This seems plausible, since worms can cause

anemia and a number of prospective studies suggest that iron supplementation improves the educational

outcomes of anemic schoolchildren (Nokes et al. 1998). Other channels through which worms might

affect learning have also been proposed, including protein-energy malnutrition. However, the evidence

from recent experimental studies examining the impact of deworming on cognition and education is

inconclusive (Drake et al. 1999; Watkins and Pollitt 1997). In a review of these studies published in the


4
 Maximum lifespans are considerably longer, but average lifespan is the key factor in epidemiological modelling
(Anderson and May 1991).



                                                                                                                  5
prestigious British Medical Journal, Dickson et al. (2000) claim that “the evidence of benefit for mass

[deworming] treatment of children related to positive effects on [physical] growth and cognitive

performance is not convincing. In light of these data, we would be unwilling to recommend that countries

or regions invest in programmes that routinely treat children with anthelmintic drugs.”

        The existing randomized evaluations on worms and education, on which Dickson et al. (2000)

base their conclusions, suffer from several important shortcomings. First, existing studies randomize the

provision of deworming treatment within schools to treatment and placebo groups, and then examine the

impact of deworming on cognitive outcomes. However, the difference in educational outcomes between

the treatment and placebo groups understates the actual impact of deworming if placebo group pupils also

experience health gains due to positive local deworming externalities. The within-school randomization

design of existing studies is also unable to estimate the externality benefits to treatment.

        Second, the existing randomized studies focus principally on cognitive performance (such as tests

of recall) rather than outcomes of more direct interest to economists and policymakers – school

attendance, enrollment, promotion, test scores, and ultimately, labor market outcomes. Of the existing

randomized studies, two find that deworming is associated with improved test performance among either

heavily infected pupils or wasted pupils (Nokes et al. 1992; Simeon, Grantham-McGregor, Callender, and

Wong 1995), two others find insignificant test score treatment effects (Simeon, Grantham-McGregor, and

Wong 1995; Watkins et al. 1996a, 1996b), and one finds significant negative deworming treatment effects

(Pollitt et al. 1991). Due to their limited durations – the longest existing randomized study tracks

outcomes for less than one school year – none of these studies estimate effects on grade promotion rates.

        Only two of the existing randomized studies examine deworming treatment effects on school

attendance, and both were based on attendance registers, which are notoriously inaccurate in many

developing countries. Simeon, Grantham-McGregor, Callender, and Wong (1995) examine growth-

stunted Jamaican children with heavy whipworm infections who received albendazole. These children

had 9.9 percentage points higher school attendance in the six months following deworming treatment (as

recorded in school registers) than comparable children who did not receive treatment. As average



                                                                                                          6
attendance was 68 percent, this constituted a reduction of over one-third in total pupil absenteeism.

However, this result should perhaps be interpreted with caution since thirty-five percent of the pupils in

the sample were missing attendance register data.

         On the other hand, a study of Guatemalan children with roundworm and whipworm infections

found no gain in primary school attendance (as recorded in teachers’ attendance books) in the six months

following treatment with albendazole (Watkins et al. 1996a, 1996b). However, the authors only consider

months in which pupils were “actively enrolled” in school; periods in which pupils were temporarily not

in school were dropped from the sample. This is a form of attrition bias which may explain the high rates

of measured attendance in Guatemala, 90 percent. To the extent that treated pupils were healthier and had

fewer inactive periods, these estimates understate the true impact of deworming on school attendance.5

         Finally, since most existing studies fail to measure school participation, and none does so

adequately, they are unable to address sample attrition bias. This is likely to be an important estimation

issue to the extent that deworming leads to large improvements in school participation, as suggested by

our results and those in Jamaica. For example, in Nokes et al. (1992), there are test score data for 41 of

the 70 pupils initially assigned to the placebo group and for 62 of the 70 pupils assigned to the treatment

group; however, no attempt is made to explain the causes of differential attrition, nor to correct or place

bounds on the resulting treatment effect estimates. To the extent that initially poor academic performers

were more likely to remain in the sample in treatment schools due to health gains, the test score estimates

in Nokes et al. understate actual treatment effects. Despite this possible bias, Nokes et al. estimate a

positive impact of deworming on test performance. The possibility of attrition bias is not addressed in

Simeon, Grantham-McGregor, Callender, and Wong (1995), Simeon, Grantham-McGregor, and Wong

(1995), or Pollitt et al. (1991).

  Medical anthropological evidence from a nearby region of western Kenya suggests that helminth infections reduce
school attendance (Geissler et al. 2000). Geissler et al. conducted weekly interviews over the course of seven
months with a random sample of 57 school children aged eleven to seventeen years, and found that on 12 percent of
all days children complained of abdominal pains which, he argues, are overwhelmingly due to intestinal helminth
infections. In 44 percent of these abdominal pain episodes – or five percent of all interviews – the child claimed that
she did not attend school due to these abdominal problems, accounting for one quarter of total school absenteeism in




                                                                                                                      7
3. The Primary School Deworming Project in Busia, Kenya

         We evaluate the Primary School Deworming Project (PSDP), which was carried out by a Dutch

non-profit organization, Internationaal Christelijk Steunfonds Africa (ICS), in cooperation with the Busia

District Ministry of Health office. The project took place in Budalangi and Funyula divisions of southern

Busia district, a poor and densely-settled farming region in western Kenya adjacent to Lake Victoria.

Parasitological surveys conducted by the Kenyan Ministry of Health and ICS indicate that these two

divisions have the highest infection rates in Busia district. The 75 project schools consist of nearly all

rural primary schools in this area, and in total, over 30,000 pupils between the ages of six and eighteen are

enrolled in these schools.

         Table 1 presents the project timeline. In January 1998, the seventy-five PSDP schools were

randomly divided into three groups (Group 1, Group 2, and Group 3) of twenty-five schools each: the

schools were first stratified by administrative sub-unit (zone) and by their involvement in other non-

governmental assistance programs,6 were then listed alphabetically, and every third school was then

assigned to a given project group. Due to ICS’s administrative and financial constraints, the health

intervention was phased in over several years. Group 1 schools received free deworming treatment in

both 1998 and 1999, Group 2 schools in 1999, and Group 3 began receiving medical treatment in 2001.

This project design implies that in 1998, Group 1 schools were treatment schools, while Group 2 and

Group 3 schools were the comparison schools; in 1999, Group 1 and Group 2 schools were the treatment

schools and Group 3 schools were comparison schools. Figure 1 shows the approximate location of the

three groups of schools based on global positioning system (GPS) data.7




the sample. Geissler et al. did not record whether children with more intense worm infections were more likely to
drop out. Refer to Geissler (1998a, 1998b) for further anthropological research on worms in western Kenya.
6
  Twenty-seven of the seventy-five project schools were also involved in other NGO projects, which consisted of
financial assistance for textbook purchase and classroom construction, as well as teacher performance incentives.
7
  The GPS data used throughout the paper were collected before May 2000 (when the U.S. stopped intentionally
downgrading GPS accuracy), and so may only be accurate to within several hundred meters, thus one school in
Figure 1 appears to be in Uganda. The school that appears to be in Lake Victoria is actually on a small island.


                                                                                                                    8
3.1 Baseline Characteristics

         The ICS field staff administered questionnaires in early 1998 and again in early 1999 to collect

information on school and pupil characteristics. Table 2 indicates that prior to treatment, the groups were

similar on most demographic, nutritional, and socioeconomic characteristics, but that despite randomized

assignment – which produces groups with similar characteristics in expectation – Group 1 pupils appear

to be somewhat worse off than Group 2 and 3 pupils along some dimensions, potentially creating a bias

against finding significant program effects. There are no statistically significant differences across the

Group 1, Group 2, and Group 3 schools in enrollment, distance to Lake Victoria, school sanitation

facilities, the local density of other primary schools, or pupils’ weight-for-age, self-reported health

problems, or asset ownership. Pupils’ rates of helminth infections in the surrounding geographic zone are

also nearly identical across the three groups. However, Group 1 pupils had statistically significantly more

(self-reported) blood in stool, a symptom of schistosomiasis infection, and were not as clean as Group 2

and Group 3 pupils (as observed by NGO field workers). Group 1 schools also had substantially lower

average scores on 1996 Kenya government primary school academic examinations than both Group 2 and

Group 3 schools, although the difference is not significant at traditional confidence levels. Pre-treatment

school average test scores are included as explanatory variables in most empirical specifications to control

for pre-program variation in average school academic quality.

         In January and February 1998, a random sample of ninety grade three to eight pupils (fifteen per

grade) in each of the 25 Group 1 schools were selected to participate in a parasitological survey

conducted by the Kenya Ministry of Health, Division of Vector Borne Diseases.8 Individual worm

burden is proxied with the density of worm larvae in stool, although this is thought to be an imperfect

measure of the actual number of helminth infections (Medley and Anderson 1985).




8
  Each child in the parasitological sample was given a plastic container and asked to provide a stool sample; samples
were examined in duplicate within twenty-four hours using the Kato-Katz method to determine helminth infection
prevalence and intensity. Group 2 and Group 3 schools were not included in the 1998 parasitological survey, since
it was not considered ethical to collect detailed health information from pupils who were not scheduled to receive
medical treatment in that year.


                                                                                                                    9
        Table 3 presents the parasitological survey results, which indicate that 92 percent of pupils had at

least one helminth infection and nearly 37 percent had at least one moderate-to-heavy helminth infection

using modified WHO infection intensity standards described in Brooker et al. (2000b).9 The figures in

Table 3 are likely to understate actual infection prevalence and intensity if the most heavily infected

children were more likely to be absent from school on the day of the survey. Moderate-to-heavy worm

infections are more likely among younger pupils, boys, and pupils with few assets at home – especially

latrines (results not shown). The importance of latrine ownership is consistent with the fact that intestinal

helminths are transmitted through fecal matter. As expected, pupils who attend schools near Lake

Victoria have substantially higher rates of schistosomiasis infection. Although helminth prevalence in

western Kenya is reasonably high by international standards, there are many other African settings with

similar infection profiles (Brooker et al. 2000a).



3.2 The Intervention

        Following the recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO 1992), all schools with

geohelminth (hookworm, roundworm, and whipworm) prevalence over 50 percent were mass treated with

albendazole every six months. All schools with schistosomiasis prevalence over 30 percent were mass

treated with praziquantel once per year.10 All treatment schools met the geohelminth cut-off in both 1998

and 1999 and were mass treated with albendazole. Six of 25 treatment schools met the schistosomiasis

cut-off in 1998 and sixteen of fifty treatment schools met the cut-off in 1999, and these schools received




9
  The moderate infection thresholds are: 250 epg for S. mansoni, and 5,000 epg for Roundworm, both the WHO
standard, and 750 epg for Hookworm and 400 epg for Whipworm, both somewhat lower than the WHO standard.
10
   The medical protocol was designed in collaboration with the Partnership for Child Development, and was
approved by the Ethics Committee of the Kenya Ministry of Health and the Busia District Medical Officer of
Health. The 30 percent threshold for mass praziquantel treatment is less than the WHO standard of 50 percent,
although in practice only a handful of schools had schistosomiasis prevalence between 30 to 50 percent. Pupils in
the parasitological sub-sample who were found to be infected, but who attended schools that did not qualify for mass
treatment with praziquantel, were individually treated for schistosomiasis.


                                                                                                                  10
mass treatment with praziquantel.11 Medical treatment was delivered to the schools by Kenya Ministry of

Health public health nurses, as well as ICS public health officers.

          Following standard practice (Bundy and Guyatt 1996), under the medical protocol for this study,

girls thirteen years of age and older were not to be treated due to concerns about the potential

teratogenicity of the drugs (WHO 1992). Pregnancy test reagent strips require trained staff to administer

and are not practical during mass treatment (Bundy and Guyatt 1996). Personal interviews (i.e., asking

girls when they had their most recent menstrual period) may not be effective in determining pregnancy

status in this setting because pregnant girls might conceal such information from the interviewer, fearing

that the information might not be held in confidence. Pregnant girls are often expelled from Kenyan

primary schools (although this is not official government policy).

          In addition to medical treatment with albendazole and praziquantel, the treatment schools

received education on worm prevention behaviors – including washing hands before meals, wearing

shoes, and not swimming in the lake – through regular public health lectures, the training of one teacher

in each treatment school on worm prevention education, and the provision of worm prevention wall

charts.

          ICS obtained community consent in all treatment schools in 1998. A series of community and

parent meetings were held in treatment schools, at which the project was described and parents who did

not want their child to participate in the project were asked to inform the school headmaster. Under the

recommendation of the Kenya Ministry of Health, beginning in January 1999 ICS required signed

parental consent for all children to receive medical treatment; consent typically took the form of parents

signing their name in a notebook kept at school by the headmaster. This is not a trivial requirement for

many households: travelling to school to sign the book may be time-consuming, and some parents may be



11
  In 1998, pupils received 600 mg albendazole doses during each round of treatment, following the protocol of an
earlier Government of Kenya Ministry of Health deworming project in Kwale, Kenya. In 1999, pupils were treated
with 400 mg albendazole (WHO [1992]). Praziquantel was provided at approximately 40mg/kg (WHO1992) in
both 1998 and 1999. The NGO used generic drugs in 1998 and non-generic drugs – SmithKline Beecham’s Zentel
(albendazole) and Bayer’s Biltricide (praziquantel) – in 1999.



                                                                                                               11
reluctant to meet the headmaster when they are behind on school fees – a common problem in these

schools.



3.3 Compliance with Medical Treatment

           Table 4 presents medical compliance information, and indicates that 78 percent of those pupils

scheduled to receive treatment (i.e., girls under thirteen years old and all boys in treatment schools)

received at least some medical treatment through the program in 1998. Absence from school on the day

of drug administration was the recorded cause of non-compliance in the majority of cases. Nineteen

percent of girls thirteen years of age or older also received medical treatment in 1998, which was partly

because of confusion in the field about pupil age, and partly because in the early stages of the program

several of the Kenya Ministry of Health public health nurses administered drugs to some older girls,

judging the benefits to outweigh the risks. Treatment rates were considerably lower in 1999 than in 1998:

among girls under thirteen years of age and all boys in treatment schools, approximately 57 percent

received medical treatment at some point in 1999, while only 9 percent of the girls thirteen years of age

and older received treatment. The drop in deworming treatment among girls younger than thirteen and

boys appears to be due to two factors. First, a substantial subset of the initial sample had dropped out of

school by 1999 and thus were unlikely to receive treatment, and second, the need to obtain signed

parental consent in 1999 may have contributed to lower compliance rates.

           Other sources of non-compliance with assigned treatment status were minor. The 1999 PSDP

Pupil questionnaire surveyed pupils about their deworming treatment history and indicates that only five

percent of comparison school pupils had ever received medical treatment for worms independently of the

program.12 In an anthropological study examining worm treatment practices in a nearby region of


12
   A survey to assess the availability of deworming drugs in this area, conducted during May to July 1999, provides
further evidence that few children in western Kenya receive medical treatment for helminth infections. All
hospitals, health clinics, dispensaries, and pharmacies, as well as many local shops (dukas) in all towns and markets
in the area were surveyed, for a total of 89 health facilities and shops. None of the 64 local shops surveyed had
either the WHO-recommended broad-spectrum treatments for geohelminths (albendazole and mebendazole) or
schistosomiasis (praziquantel) in stock on the day of the visit, though a minority of local shops carried cheaper but
less effective deworming drugs (levamisole hydrochloride and piperazine). Although the survey results indicate that


                                                                                                                   12
western Kenya (Geissler et al. 2000), in no case did a child or her parent ever obtain deworming drugs in

a local store or clinic.13 Although pupils assigned to comparison schools could also potentially transfer to

treatment schools to receive deworming medical treatment through the program, there is no evidence of

large asymmetric flows of pupils into treatment schools. Table 5 indicates that the rate of transfers across

schools was roughly symmetric across all three groups of schools in 1998 and 1999: among sample

pupils, approximately two percent transferred into a different school in 1998, with nearly equal

proportions transferring into Group 1, Group 2, and Group 3 schools. Approximately eight percent of

pupils had transferred into a different school by the end of 1999, again with similar proportions

transferring to all three groups. These relatively low and symmetric transfer rates are unlikely to have a

substantial impact on the empirical results. As is standard in Intention-to-Treat (ITT) estimation,

throughout the study pupils are assigned the treatment status of the school in which they were initially

enrolled in early 1998, even if they later switched schools.



4. Estimation Strategy

         The most important feature of the identification strategy is the project’s randomized design.14

Since treatment status was randomly assigned across schools, program participation is not correlated in

expectation with either observed or unobserved individual characteristics. This project design is likely to

lead to smaller deworming treatment externalities for the comparison pupils than in the existing studies

that randomize treatment within schools.




over eighty percent of clinics and pharmacies stocked albendazole, and that it can be obtained at a moderate price
(approximately 100 shillings per dose), praziquantel is rarely found even in government clinics and pharmacies, and
where praziquantel is stocked it is prohibitively expensive for most residents of the area, costing an average of
nearly 900 Kenyan Shillings per dose (60 Kenyan Shillings equaled 1 U.S. dollar in 1999), several weeks of average
wages per dose.
13
   Geissler et al. (2000) find that most schoolchildren self-treated helminth infections with local herbs. To the extent
that children in Busia also use similar herbs and that these herbs have a positive effect on child health, the impact of
the PSDP can be interpreted as the net benefit of deworming above and beyond the herbs, and as a lower bound on
the effect of deworming in a setting in which children do not self-treat with such herbs.
14
   Recent econometric research emphasizes the value of experimental methods in identifying treatment effects
(Heckman et al. 1998). Heckman and Smith (1995) discuss the potential limitations of social experiments.


                                                                                                                      13
         This section first presents how we estimate differences across treatment and comparison schools,

and then discusses how we estimate cross-school externality effects. We employ both types of

information to estimate overall treatment effects in sections 5, 6, and 7. Equation 1 illustrates how we

estimate the difference in outcomes between treated and untreated schools using individual-level data.

                           Yijt =a + β1⋅ T1it + β2⋅ T2it + Xijt’δ + ui + eijt                               (1)



         Yijt is the individual educational outcome; Xijt are school and pupil characteristics; T1it and T2it are

indicator variables for school assignment to a first and second year of deworming treatment; and eijt is the

individual disturbance term, where i refers to the school, j to the student, and t to the year of the program,

t ∈ {1, 2}. Disturbance terms are assumed to be independent across schools, but are clustered for

observations within the same school, where the school effect is captured in the ui term. School and pupil

controls include the average school result on the 1996 Kenya government District Mock exams for grades

5 to 8;15 the prevalence of moderate-to-heavy helminth infections in the pupil’s grade and geographic

zone (the pre-treatment average for 1998 and 1999); an indicator variable which equals one in both

treatment and comparison schools for girls under thirteen years of age and all boys; indicators for school

involvement in other ongoing non-governmental organization assistance projects;16 time controls

(indicator variables for each six-month period capture the downward trend in school participation due to

dropouts); and grade cohort indicator variables. These explanatory variables control for those pre-

treatment differences across schools that were present despite randomization, and they increase the

precision of the coefficient estimates. Equation 2 is used to estimate the cross-school treatment

externalities. We examine the impact of schools’ geographic proximity to treatment schools using GPS

school location data; children who live near treatment schools could have lower environmental exposure

15
   Average school scores from 1996 -- two years before the first year of the project -- were employed since the
district mock exam was not offered in 1997 due to a national teacher strike. Average school exam scores are used
because individual exam results are unavailable for 1996. However, the 1996 scores are corrected to be in units of
individual-level standard deviations, and are thus comparable to the 1998 and 1999 test scores under the assumption
that the decomposition of test score variance within and between schools was the same in 1996, 1998, and 1999.
16
   Twenty-seven of the sample schools were also receiving other assistance from ICS in 1998 and 1999. Since this
assistance varied across years, school assistance indicators interacted with the year are also included as controls.


                                                                                                                  14
to helminths, which would lead to less re-infection and lower worm burdens. The GPS data allow us to

compute the total number of primary school pupils (Ndit) and the number of pupils in deworming

treatment schools (NTdit) who attend other schools within a certain distance from school i in year t of the

program. Given the total number of children attending primary school within a certain distance from the

school, the number of treatment school pupils located nearby is exogenous and randomly assigned.

Equation 2 presents a linear regression specification for simplicity:

                          Yijt =a + β1⋅ T1it + β2⋅ T2it + Xijt’δ                                 (2)

                                   + ∑d (γd ⋅ NditT) + ∑d (φd ⋅ Ndit) + ui + eijt



        For example, in Sections 5 and 6, d=03 denotes schools that are located within three kilometers

of school i, and d=36 denotes schools that are located between three and six kilometers away.17

        Since treatment within schools was not randomized, we adopt a number of other approaches to

assess within-school externalities, as discussed in Section 5.



5. Deworming Treatment Effects on Health and Nutrition

        Children in deworming treatment schools experienced a range of health benefits, and there is

evidence that these benefits spilled over to non-treated pupils. Subsection 5.1 first documents differences

in health status between treatment and comparison schools, which we term the “naïve” treatment effect

estimate; Subsection 5.2 provides evidence that health benefits spilled over both to untreated pupils in

treatment schools and to neighboring comparison schools; and Subsection 5.3 combines information on

differences in health between treatment and comparison schools with information on health externalities

to construct estimates of (or at least bounds on) the effect of the program on the treated and on the

population as a whole.




17
  We do not have data on the location of pupils’ homes, and hence cannot examine if pupils living near Group 1
schools obtain greater externality benefits.


                                                                                                                 15
5.1 Differences Across Treatment and Comparison Schools

        Table 6 presents the prevalence of moderate-to-heavy helminth infections among Group 1 and

Group 2 schools in early 1999, one year after the first round of medical treatment but before the second

year of medical treatment. These data were collected during a Kenyan Ministry of Health parasitological

survey of grade three to eight pupils in both Group 1 and Group 2 schools conducted in January and

February 1999, when Group 2 schools had not yet been treated. The results indicate that the prevalence

of moderate-to-heavy hookworm, roundworm, schistosomiasis, and whipworm infections was lower in

Group 1 (1998 treatment) schools than in Group 2 (1998 comparison) schools: overall, 27 percent of

pupils in Group 1 schools had a moderate-to-heavy helminth infection in early 1999 compared to 52

percent in Group 2 schools, and this difference is significantly different than zero at 99 percent

confidence. The program was somewhat less effective against whipworm, perhaps as a result of the lower

efficacy of single-dose albendazole treatments for whipworm infections, as discussed above. It is worth

noting that the average difference in prevalence between treated and comparison schools is likely to have

been even greater over the course of the year, since pupils whose infections were cleared may have been

reinfected by the time of the January-February 1999 parasitological survey, nearly one year after the first

round of medical treatment and three months since the second round of treatment. The rise in overall

moderate-to-heavy helminth infections between 1998 and 1999 (refer to Table 3) is likely to be due to the

extraordinary flooding in 1998 associated with the El Niño weather system. Flooding increased exposure

to infected fresh water (note the especially large increases in moderate-to-heavy schistosomiasis

infections), created moist conditions favorable for geohelminth larvae, and led to overflow of latrines and

a major cholera outbreak.

        Group 1 pupils also reported better health outcomes after the first year of deworming treatment:

four percent fewer Group 1 pupils reported being sick in the past week, and three percent fewer pupils

reported being sick often (these differences are significantly different than zero at 95 percent confidence).

Group 1 pupils also had significantly better height-for-age – a measure of nutritional status – by early

1999, although their weight-for-age was no greater on average.



                                                                                                           16
         Although Group 1 pupils had higher hemoglobin concentrations than Group 2 pupils in early

1999, the difference is not statistically different than zero. Anemia is the most frequently hypothesized

link between worm infections and cognitive performance (Stoltzfus et al. 1997). Severe anemia is

relatively rare in Busia: fewer then 4 percent of pupils in Group 2 schools (comparison schools in 1998)

fell below the Kenya Ministry of Health anemia threshold of 100 g/L in early 1999 before deworming

treatment. This is low relative to many other areas in Africa, some of which have substantial helminth

problems: a recent survey of studies of anemia among school children in less developed countries (Hall et

al. 2000) indicates that there is considerably less anemia in Busia than in samples from Ghana, Malawi,

Mali, Mozambique, and Tanzania. Average hemoglobin levels among 12- to 14-year-old school children

in these other African settings was 116.7 g/L, compared with 123.9 g/L in Busia.18

         Table 6 suggests that health education had a minimal impact on behavior, so that to the extent that

the program improved health, it almost certainly did so through the effect of anthelmintics rather than

through health education. As noted earlier, worm prevention education emphasized good hygiene, such

as hand washing, in order to avoid ingesting roundworm and whipworm larvae; wearing shoes in order to

avoid hookworm infection; and not swimming in infected fresh water, to avoid schistosomiasis.

However, there are no significant differences across treatment and comparison school pupils in early 1999

in terms of observed pupil cleanliness, the proportion of pupils wearing shoes, or self-reported exposure

to fresh water.



5.2 Health Externalities

         Deworming led to large positive health externalities both among untreated pupils in the treatment

schools and among children in neighboring schools. Externality effects for the geohelminths tend to be


18
  One possible explanation for low levels of anemia in this area is geophagy (soil eating): Geissler et al. (1998)
report that 73 percent of a random sample of children aged 10 to 18 years old in a neighboring region of Western
Kenya reported eating soil daily. Given the average amount of soil children were observed eating daily, and the
measured mean iron content of soil in this area, Geissler et al. conclude that soil provides an average of 4.7 mg iron
per day, over one-third of the recommended daily iron intake for children. Unfortunately, geophagy could also
increase exposure to geohelminth larvae, promoting re-infection.



                                                                                                                     17
localized, and are largest within treatment schools, while the externalities across schools are larger for

schistosomiasis. The different results for geohelminths and schistosomiasis are consistent with their

modes of transmission. Geohelminth eggs are deposited in the local environment when children defecate

in the “bush” surrounding their home or school, rather than using a latrine or toilet. Schistosomiasis

externalities are less likely to be tied to the immediate vicinity than geohelminths since the

schistosomiasis parasite is spread through contact with infected fresh water. The water-borne

schistosome may be carried considerable distances by stream and lake currents, and the snails that serve

as its intermediate hosts are themselves mobile, both of which tend to extend the geographic reach of

schistosomiasis externalities. Moreover, children are often infected with schistosomiasis by bathing or

fishing in Lake Victoria, and children from different schools may fish or swim at the same points on the

lake.

         Table 7 provides evidence for externalities within treatment schools. In order to at least partially

deal with potential biases due to selection into medical treatment, Group 1 pupils who did not receive

treatment in 1998 are compared to Group 2 pupils who did not receive treatment in 1999, the year that

Group 2 schools were incorporated into the treatment group. We compare the groups as of January-

February 1999, when Group 1 schools had already been treated (in 1998) but Group 2 schools had not. If

the process determining selection into treatment conditional on attending a treatment school is the same in

1998 and 1999, then equation 3 is an estimator of the within-school treatment externality, where

I(treated)ijt is an indicator variable that takes on a value of one if individual i in school j received

treatment in year t of the program:19

         E[Yijt | T1i1 = 1, I(treated)ij1 = 0] – E[Yijt | T1i1 = 0, T1i2 = 1, I(treated)ij2 = 0]              (3)




19
  Changes in the determinants of selection into medical treatment between 1998 and 1999 are likely to bias the
coefficient estimates against finding an externality effect. Although sick people could theoretically be either more
or less likely to obtain treatment, the results in Table 7 indicate that, both among Group 1 pupils in early 1998 and
Group 2 pupils in early 1999, pupils who would remain untreated had somewhat higher initial rates of moderate-to-
heavy infection. Since a larger proportion of individuals remained untreated in 1999, the average initial health status
of the 1999 untreated is likely to be somewhat better than that of the 1998 untreated.



                                                                                                                     18
         As shown in the bottom panel of Table 7, there are no significant differences in socioeconomic

characteristics, weight-for-age, grade progression, or self-described health status between the untreated

Group 1 pupils and Group 2 pupils who would later miss their opportunity for treatment, suggesting that

the groups are essentially comparable aside from the effects of deworming treatment. Among girls under

thirteen years of age and all boys – those children who were supposed to receive medical treatment

through the project – rates of moderate-to-heavy infections were 21 percentage points lower among

Group 1 pupils who did not receive medical treatment in 1998 (34 percent) than among Group 2 pupils

who did not receive treatment in 1999 (55 percent), and this difference is significant at 95 percent

confidence. These differences are negative and statistically significant for hookworm and roundworm,

and negative but insignificant for schistosomiasis and whipworm; since the difference in whipworm

infection between Group 1 and 2 schools was minimal and there is evidence that single-dose albendazole

treatments are sometimes ineffective against whipworms, it is not surprising that evidence of within-

school externalities is weak for whipworm.20

         Group 1 pupils who were treated in 1998 had a 24 percent chance of moderate-to-heavy infection

in January to February 1999, while Group 2 pupils who would later obtain treatment in 1999 had a 51

percent chance of infection, for a difference of 27 percentage points.21 Thus the difference in the

prevalence of moderate-to-heavy infections among the untreated was approximately three-quarters the

difference in prevalence for the treated (21 percentage points versus 27 percentage points).

         An additional source of evidence on local deworming externalities comes from a parasitological

survey of children entering preschool who had not yet received medical treatment through the program.

In 2001, before Group 3 schools had begun receiving deworming treatment, children entering preschool

in Group 1 and 2 schools had 7.3 percentage points fewer moderate-to-heavy hookworm infections than


20
  Among girls older than twelve years of age in Group 1 schools, who under the medical protocol were not
supposed to receive medical treatment through the program, rates of moderate-to-heavy helminth infections were
thirteen percent lower than among similar girls in Group 2 schools, although this difference is not significantly
different than zero (results not shown).




                                                                                                                    19
those entering Group 3 schools (results not shown), and this effect is significantly different than zero at 90

percent confidence. Given that only 15.4 percent of the Group 3 preschool children suffered from

moderate-to-heavy hookworm infections, this constituted a substantial reduction in the proportion of such

infections, cutting rates by nearly half. Note that to the extent that children with moderate-to-heavy worm

infections are less likely to attend preschool and thus to appear in our sample from the Group 3 schools,

our estimates understate the true externality impact of deworming on the health of younger children.

         There is also evidence for deworming health externalities across schools. Using GPS school

location data, we examine rates of moderate-to-heavy helminth infections in both Group 1 and Group 2

schools in early 1999 as a function of their geographic proximity to other Group 1 schools; children who

live near treatment schools should have lower environmental exposure to helminths, which would lead to

less re-infection and lower worm burdens.22 As discussed above, the proportion of Group 1 schools

located nearby is exogenous since schools’ treatment status is randomly assigned.

         Table 8 suggests that children who attend primary schools located near Group 1 schools had

lower rates of moderate-to-heavy helminth infection: controlling for the total number of children

attending any primary school within three kilometers, the presence of each additional thousand pupils

attending Group 1 schools located within three kilometers of a school is associated with 12 percentage

points fewer moderate-to-heavy infections, and this coefficient estimate is significantly different than zero

at 95 percent confidence. Each additional thousand pupils attending a Group 1 school located between

three to six kilometers away is associated with 8 percentage points fewer moderate-to-heavy infections,

which is somewhat smaller than the effect of pupils within three kilometers, as expected, and is

significantly different than zero at 90 percent confidence. Due to the relatively small size of the study

area, we are unable to precisely estimate the impact of additional treatment school pupils farther than six

kilometers away from a school, and thus we cannot rule out the possibility that there were also cross-

school externalities at distances beyond six kilometers from each treatment school, and possibly for the

21
  Initial grade progression was actually lower among treated Group 1 pupils, suggesting that if anything, these
pupils started off disadvantaged relative to their counterparts in Group 2 schools.




                                                                                                                  20
study area as a whole, in which case the estimates presented in Table 8 (and discussed below) would be

lower bounds on actual deworming externality benefits.

         The cross-school externality effects are mainly driven by reductions in moderate-to-heavy

schistosomiasis infections (Regression 2);23 the effect on geohelminth infections is negative but

insignificantly different than zero (Regression 5). Regression 3 indicates that schistosomiasis reductions

in Group 2 schools – schools that were still untreated by early 1999 – account for most of these gains. In

other words, schools that were treated themselves show little benefit from proximity to other treatment

schools, but comparison schools are substantially better off if they are located near treatment schools.

Schools near Lake Victoria, where schistosomiasis infections are concentrated, showed the largest

externality gains: Regression 4 indicates that for schools located on Lake Victoria, the presence of an

additional thousand pupils attending Group 1 schools located less than three kilometers away led to a 21

percentage point reduction in the prevalence of moderate-to-heavy schistosomiasis infections, while the

presence of an additional thousand pupils attending Group 1 schools between three to six kilometers away

led to a reduction of 27 percentage points.

         A well-known epidemiological model of the transmission of helminth infections (Anderson and

May 1991, p. 488) suggests that externalities of this magnitude are plausible. Using standard parameter

values for schistosomiasis mansoni,24 the helminth that showed the largest externality effects in Table 8,

this model implies that in steady-state regular mass treatment against schistosomiasis in a random ten

percent of the local population would lead to a 37 percent reduction in the total local worm burden, with

over three quarters of this reduction due to the externality, while mass treating a random thirty percent of


22
   Measurement error in GPS locations – due to U.S. government downgrading of GPS accuracy until May 2000 –
leads to attenuation bias, making it more difficult to find treatment externalities.
23
   The schistosomiasis externality results are robust to including the proportion of Group 1 pupils in the surrounding
area, rather than the total number of Group 1 pupils in the surrounding area, as an explanatory variable (results not
shown).
24
   Using Anderson and May’s terminology, these parameters values are: average lifespan (A) = 3, basic reproductive
rate (R) = 2, aggregation parameter (k) = 0.5, and efficacy of the drugs (h) = 0.8. One third of local primary schools
were treated in 1998, and school-aged children comprise approximately one third of the population of Kenya (World
Bank 1999). However, given the high concentration of worm burden in children, and the fact that children are much
less likely to use latrines than adults, and hence more likely to deposit larvae conditional on infection, we report
estimates for both g=0.1 and g=0.3, where g is the proportion of the population treated.


                                                                                                                   21
the local population against worms would lead to a reduction of 89 percent of the total local worm

burden. The relatively short average lifespan of these helminths – approximately one to three years –

suggests that substantial externality benefits are likely to be apparent in the first year after treatment.



Estimating Treatment Effects in the Presence of Externalities

        The estimation of treatment effects on the treated in this setting is complicated by the possibility

of health externalities for untreated children in treatment schools. It is not valid to use assignment to a

treatment school as an instrumental variable for actual medical treatment in the presence of such

externalities (Angrist, Imbens and Rubin 1996),25 since the exclusion restriction fails to hold: assignment

to a treatment school has a direct effect on pupil health outcomes due to the externality, rather than only

affecting health through the likelihood of receiving medical treatment. Comparing prevalence before and

after treatment is also unattractive, given that worms are affected by time-varying shocks, such as the

flooding induced by El Niño.

        We instead utilize information on cross-school health spillovers to construct estimates of the

treatment effect on the treated. This calculation suggests that moderate-to-heavy helminth infections

among children in this area were 11 percentage points lower on average in early 1999 as a result of health

spillovers across schools – approximately one-quarter of overall moderate-to-heavy infection rates in

Group 2 schools. To see this, note that the average spillover gain is the average number of Group 1 pupils

located within 3 km divided by 1000 (E[NT03]) times the average effect of an additional 1000 Group 1

pupils located within 3 km on infection rates (γ03), plus the analogous spillover effect due to schools

located between three to six kilometers away from the school (refer to equation 2). Equation 4 presents

this calculation, based on the externality estimates in Table 8:

        Average cross-school externality reduction                                                     (4)
        in moderate-to-heavy helminth infections
                                                = γ03 * E[NT03, 1] +γ36 * E[NT36, 1]
                                                =[430*0.12 + 739*0.08]/1000 = 0.11




                                                                                                              22
If there were spillovers beyond six kilometers, the average externality effect would be even larger.

          The existence of substantial cross-school health externalities implies that the difference in

average outcomes betweeen treatment and comparison schools – the “naïve” treatment effect estimator –

understates the actual effects of mass deworming treatment on the treated. If externalities disappear

completely after six kilometers, the true reduction in moderate-to-heavy infection rates among treated

pupils in Group 1 schools would be the sum of the naïve treatment effect in early 1999 presented in Table

7 (27 percentage points) and the average cross-school externality gain (11 percentage points), which

equals 38 percentage points. The treatment effect among untreated pupils in Group 1 schools would be

the sum of the naïve treatment effect presented in Table 7 (21 percentage points) and the cross-school

externality gain, or 32 percentage points. The magnitude of the cross-school externality is approximately

thirty percent of the magnitude of the effect on the treated in Group 1 (11 divided by 38). However, to

the extent that some deworming treatment gains spilled over beyond six kilometers, this estimate is still a

lower bound on the actual effect of deworming.26 A lower bound on the total number of moderate-to-

heavy helminth infections eliminated through the program is thus:

Number of moderate-to-heavy
helminth infections eliminated                = (0.38) * (7,020 Treated pupils in Group 1 schools)   (5)
                                              + (0.32) * (2,797 Untreated pupils in Group 1 schools)
                                              +(0.11) * (19,493 Pupils in Group 2 and 3 schools)
                                              = 5707 infections

          This is nearly one infection eliminated per treated child in Group 1 schools. Even this figure

underestimates the actual total treatment effect of the program by excluding benefits for school-age

children not enrolled in school, other community members not of school age – such as pre-primary

children – and people who live in areas bordering Budalangi and Funyula divisions, whom we did not

survey.




26
  Under spatial externality models in which a reduction in worm prevalence at one school affects neighboring
schools – and this in turn affects their neighbors – some externalities would spill over beyond six kilometers.
Although estimated externality effects beyond six kilometers are insignificant since standard errors are large, it is
difficult to know whether externality effects do fade out after six kilometers.



                                                                                                                        23
6. Deworming Treatment Effects on School Participation

          This section argues that deworming increased school participation in treatment schools by at

least seven percentage points, a one-quarter reduction in total school absenteeism. Deworming may

improve school participation by allowing previously weak and listless children to attend school regularly

or by improving children’s ability to concentrate, which may make attending school increasingly

worthwhile relative to other activities, such as agricultural labor, staying at home, or fishing in Lake

Victoria. As with the direct health impact, deworming creates externalities in school participation both

within and across schools; after accounting for those externalities we estimate that overall school

participation in this area likely increased by at least 0.15 years per pupil treated. The response of school

participation to deworming is larger than would be expected from retrospective estimates of the

correlation between worm burden and school participation.

         In analyzing school participation, our sample consists of all pupils enrolled in school or listed in

the school register during the first term in 1998.27 Since many pupils attend school erratically and the

distinction between an absent pupil and a dropout is often not clearly made in school records, it is difficult

to distinguish sharply between dropping out and long-term absenteeism; moreover, measuring pupil

attendance conditional on not dropping out is unattractive since dropping out is endogenous. We

therefore focus on a comprehensive measure of school participation: a pupil is considered a participant in

school if he or she is present in school on a given day, and to be a non-participant if he or she is not in

school on that day, regardless of the cause. Since school records are often badly kept, school participation


27
  Since many pupils who were recorded as dropouts in early 1998 re-enrolled in school at some point during the
1998 or 1999 school years, we include them in the sample. However, many initial dropouts were not assigned a
grade by the NGO field staff, complicating the analysis of participation rates by grade. Such pupils are assigned
their own grade indicator variable in Table 11. Some pupils have missing year of birth information due to absence
from school on the days of questionnaire or exam administration, and certain assumptions need to be made
regarding the treatment assignment status of girls with missing age information. Girls in treatment schools in
preschool and grades 1, 2, and 3 are assumed to be eligible for treatment, and while those in grades 7 and 8 are
assumed not to be, since all but a small fraction of girls in these grades meet the respective age eligibility criterion.
Girls with missing ages in grades 4, 5, and 6 and those recorded as dropouts are assigned missing values, eliminating
99 girls from the sample of approximately 30,000 children, a small reduction in the sample. An additional 119
pupils are dropped from the sample due to both missing age and sex information.


                                                                                                                       24
was measured during unannounced visits by NGO field workers to schools. Schools received an average

of 3.8 school participation check visits per year in 1998 and 1999. Note that since the days of medical

treatment were pre-announced, and the school participation figures do not include attendance on these

days, effects on attendance are not due to children coming to school in the hope of receiving medicine.



6.1 Differences across Treatment and Comparison Schools

        Table 9 presents differences in school participation across project groups and across time. Among

girls younger than thirteen years old and all boys, the difference in school participation for the five post-

treatment participation observations in the first year after medical treatment is 9.3 percentage points, and

this is significantly different than zero at 99 percent confidence. The difference between Group 1 and

Group 3 schools in 1998 is somewhat smaller, at 7.4 percentage points, but remains significantly different

than zero at 95 percent confidence. The difference is larger among boys and young girls than among the

older girls (5.7 percentage points), which is consistent with the fact that a smaller proportion of older girls

received medical treatment (Table 4). The differences in 1999 school participation for boys and younger

girls are also large and significantly different than zero at 90 or 95 percent confidence for both Group 1

(1998 and 1999 treatment schools) and Group 2 (1999 treatment schools), at 5.0 and 5.5 percentage

points, respectively; these “naïve” treatment effect estimates are likely to represent lower bounds on the

actual effect of deworming due to health spillovers across schools, as discussed below. The downward

bias due to cross-school externalities is likely to be greater in 1999, since more schools had been treated

by that time.

        School participation differences across treatment and comparison schools are particularly large

among pupils in lower grades: in 1998 the average difference in school participation between treatment

and comparison groups for preschool through grade 2 was 10.0 percentage points (significantly different

than zero at 99 percent confidence), while for pupils in grades 6 to 8 it was 5.9 percentage points, and in

1999 the comparable gains for Group 2 pupils were 8.5 percentage points and 2.6 percentage points,

respectively. The larger impact of treatment in lower grades may partially result from higher rates of



                                                                                                             25
moderate-to-heavy infection among younger pupils (Table 3). It is also possible that school participation

is more elastic with respect to health for younger pupils: many Kenyan children drop out of school before

reaching the upper primary grades, which implies that those older children who remain in school may be

academically serious and thus determined to attend school despite illness.

          The estimated difference in school participation between treatment and comparison schools in

1999 is somewhat smaller than that in 1998, although it is impossible to reject the hypothesis that the

differences in 1998 and 1999 are the same. One possible explanation for the apparently smaller impact of

the program in 1999 is the lower proportion of pupils taking deworming drugs compared to 1998 (Table

4). Deworming externalities for comparison schools are also likely to have been larger in 1999 than in

1998 since a larger proportion of local primary schools received medical treatment in 1999 (50 of 75

schools) than in 1998 (25 of 75 schools). Finally, the larger school participation differences between

treated and comparison schools in 1998 may be due to the widespread El Niño flooding in this area in

1998, which substantially increased worm loads between early 1998 and early 1999 (compare Tables 3

and 6).

          Figure 2 presents the time pattern of school participation rates from May 1998 to November 1999

for girls under thirteen and for all boys. Diamonds represent the differences in average school

participation between Group 1 and Group 3 schools, and squares represent the difference between Group

2 and Group 3 schools. School participation rates for Group 1 schools are consistently higher than rates

in Group 3 schools in both 1998 and 1999, and the gap stands at nearly ten percentage points by

November 1999. Group 2 schools have lower school participation than Group 3 schools in 1998 – when

both groups were comparison schools – but begin to show participation gains in early 1999. Participation

gains in Group 2 schools increase gradually in the first half of 1999, possibly because the first round of

1999 treatment was not concluded until June.

          Figure 3 presents histograms of average pupil school participation rates from May 1998 to

November 1999 in Group 1 and Group 3 schools, and indicates that the school participation gains resulted




                                                                                                             26
primarily from improved attendance – a higher density in treatment schools at participation rates near one

– although there were also noticeably fewer dropouts.



6.2 School Participation Externalities

        The large participation gains among older girls – who were not supposed to be treated – in 1998

and 1999 provides the first hint that school participation externality benefits were substantial. Although

the 1998 gains among older girls could have been driven in part by non-trivial rates of medical treatment,

there were also large participation gains among older girls in Group 2 schools in 1999 despite the fact that

only ten percent of them received medical treatment (Table 4). Table 10 presents evidence of externality

school participation benefits among untreated pupils in Group 1 (1998 treatment) schools during the first

year of the study. As in Table 7, Group 1 pupils who were untreated in 1998 are compared to Group 2

pupils who were later untreated during the two rounds of medical treatment in 1999, in order to address

selection into treatment. Among girls under thirteen years old and all boys, the difference in May 1998 to

March 1999 average school participation across these two groups of untreated pupils was 8.0 percentage

points, which is significantly different than zero at 95 percent confidence, corresponding to one quarter of

total pupil non-participation in this subsample. We also compare Group 1 pupils who were treated in

1998 to Group 2 pupils who were treated in 1999. The difference in their May 1998 to March 1999

school participation is 6.4 percentage points, amounting to one-third of overall non-participation in the

comparison schools.

        School participation externality estimates across schools using individual-level data are presented

in Table 11. The dependent variable is average individual school participation in either the first year

(May 1998 to March 1999) or the second year (April 1999 to November 1999) of the project. ICS school

assistance controls, grade indicator variables, the school average exam score in 1996, the proportion of

moderate-to-heavy infections in the pupil’s standard and geographic zone, and time indicator variables for

each six-month interval following the start of the project are included as explanatory variables in all




                                                                                                            27
specifications. Disturbance terms across observations in the same school are clustered, while errors

across schools are assumed to be independent.

        Regression 1 indicates that the average school participation gain for treatment schools relative to

comparison schools across both years of the project is 5.6 percentage points, and this is significantly

different than zero at 99 percent confidence. Regression 2 presents the “naïve” treatment effect estimate

of six percentage points for the first year of treatment and four percentage points for the second year, with

significance levels of 99 percent and 90 percent respectively. Confidence intervals are wide enough that

we cannot reject the hypothesis that the effect is the same in both years. The coefficient estimates on

other explanatory variables have the predicted signs: the school average exam score in 1996 is positively

related to participation rates, and the proportion of moderate-to-heavy infections in the pupil’s standard

and geographic zone is negatively (though insignificantly) associated with participation (result not

shown). The magnitude of the effects remains nearly unchanged when pupils initially recorded as

dropouts in early 1998 are excluded from the sample (results not shown).

        Regression 3 includes the numbers of treatment school pupils and total pupils attending primary

school within three kilometers of the school as explanatory variables in order to explore the possibility of

school participation externalities. The coefficient estimate on the number of local treatment pupils is

positive and significantly different than zero at 90 percent confidence. The coefficient estimate implies

that each additional one thousand pupils attending treatment schools within three kilometers leads to an

increase of 3.4 percentage points in average school participation. Since there are 449 Group 1 pupils and

570 Group 2 pupils within three kilometers of the average primary school, this implies that school

participation was approximately 1.5 percentage points higher on average throughout this area in 1998 due

to deworming externalities, and 3.4 percentage points higher on average in 1999. Adding these figures to

the “naïve” treatment effect estimates suggests that the effect of deworming on school participation in

treatment schools was at least 7 percentage points in both 1998 and 1999, although even this is a lower

bound, since it is possible that some benefits spilled over beyond three kilometers from treatment schools.




                                                                                                             28
         The following calculation estimates the overall school participation gain due to the program. The

program increased school participation in comparison schools by about 1.5 percentage points on average

in 1998, when there were approximately three Group 2 and Group 3 pupils for every child treated in

Group 1 schools. Children in treatment schools increased school participation by about 7 percentage

points, and for every two treated children in a treatment school, there was approximately one untreated

child. Hence treating one child led to an estimated lower bound increase in school participation of

(1*0.07) + (0.5*0.07) + (3*0.015) = .15 school years.

         We examined whether pupils in more heavily infected areas gain most from deworming

treatment. However, the regressions indicate that average treatment gains are not significantly larger in

areas with higher infection levels (results not shown). This may not be the case in a setting with more

variation in local infection levels; the proportion of moderate-to-heavy infection is high across most of the

Budalangi and Funyula divisions. The sample of pupils in the parasitological survey may also not be

representative if sick children are less likely to attend school on the day of the survey, complicating

interpretation of the coefficient estimates.28 The coefficient estimate on the interaction term between

treatment and the local infection level is downward biased to the extent that cross-school deworming

externality benefits are greatest in areas with the highest infection rates. As discussed further below,

attenuation bias due to measurement error in the parasitological data is also a concern in this setting and

would mean that coefficient estimates are further biased towards zero.

         The coefficient estimates on interactions between pupil characteristics – including latrine

ownership at home, livestock ownership, initial weight-for-age and height-for-age, and gender – with

treatment assignment indicators are all insignificantly different than zero (results not shown).

         The coefficient estimates on the interactions between treatment indicators and distance to lake

Victoria – which is highly correlated with the prevalence of schistosomiasis in this area (refer to Table 3


28
  The deworming treatment effect may also be non-monotonic with respect to local infection intensity if areas with
many serious infections also suffer disproportionately from other health problems that lead to persistently low
school attendance. Local rates of moderate-to-heavy helminth infections are in fact positively correlated with self-
reported malaria across geographic zones in this area (results not shown).



                                                                                                                   29
and to Brooker et al. 2001) – are not significantly different than zero, indicating that school participation

treatment effects among those infected with both schistosomiasis and geohelminths are not considerably

larger than the effects for children with geohelminth infections alone.



6.3 Comparing Retrospective and Experimental Estimates

        Retrospective estimates of the impact of worms on school participation are considerably smaller

than would be suggested by the experimental estimates. This may be explained by attenuation bias in the

retrospective estimates, a form of selection bias, and complementarity across students in school

participation.

        Regression 4 in Table 11 retrospectively examines the association between moderate-to-heavy

worm infection and school participation in the first year after the start of medical treatment (May 1998 to

March 1999). It is restricted to the sub-sample of pupils in grades three to eight for whom there is 1999

parasitological data. We thus lack information on the preschool, grade 1, and grade 2 pupils that exhibit

the largest experimental treatment effect estimates. Regression 4 indicates that pupils who were

moderately or heavily infected in early 1999 had significantly lower participation rates (2.8 percentage

points lower). However, the retrospective estimate of 2.8 percentage points is smaller than might be

anticipated given the 2 to 7 percent difference in school participation rates between treatment and

comparison schools for this older age group (Table 9). Given that moderate-to-heavy infections in early

1999 were 25 percentage points lower in treatment schools, if only pupils with moderate-to-heavy

infections increased their school participation, the experimental estimates would imply that on average

each of these pupils increased school participation by 8 to 28 percentage points, rather than the 2.8

percentage point retrospective estimate. Of course, the average difference over the year in infection rates

between treatment and comparison schools may have been larger than 25 percentage points, since many

treated children may have had moderate-to-heavy infections cleared or reduced to lower levels as a result

of treatment, only to re-acquire moderate-to-heavy infections by the time of the next parasitological




                                                                                                           30
survey. If more pupils actually benefited from medical treatment, the implied school participation

improvement among the moderately to heavily infected would be smaller.

        Nonetheless, the retrospective estimate may initially seem surprisingly small given the possibility

of negative omitted variable bias. For example, if children with lower socioeconomic status – which is

imperfectly observed – are both more likely to drop out of school and are more likely to have serious

worm infections, the retrospective estimate would be more negative than the experimental estimate. (It is

worth noting that omitted variable bias could also go the other way; for example, dynamic and energetic

children may both play more in Lake Victoria – putting them at risk of schistosomiasis – and be more

successful students.)

        One potential explanation for why experimental estimates of the deworming effect are larger than

suggested by retrospective estimates is error in measuring the severity of disease, leading to attenuation

bias. Measurement error is likely to be substantial and could take several forms: pure measurement error

performing egg counts (from stool samples) in the lab; time variation in worm burden, so that those

individuals who were moderately to heavily infected in early 1999 were not necessarily the same ones

who were most heavily infected over the course of the school year; coarseness in our binary measure of

worm burden; heterogeneity in the impact of different worm species on school participation; and

interactions among worms that are not captured by our binary measure, so that some individuals who are

classified as having multiple light worm infections in fact suffer from substantial morbidity. Moreover,

epidemiologists have argued that there is a noisy relationship between worm egg counts – the basic

measure of infection intensity in this and many other studies – and actual worm infection burden (Medley

and Anderson 1985), further exacerbating measurement error.

        Under certain assumptions, heterogeneous treatment effects may interact with sample attrition to

further exacerbate estimation biases. This is because those pupils for whom high measured worm burdens




                                                                                                             31
are not associated with absenteeism are more likely to be in school on the day of the parasitological exam

and hence to make it into our sample.29

         The difference between retrospective and experimental estimates of the impact of worms could

also be due in part to complementarities among pupils in school participation. For example, if the

preschoolers, first-graders, and second-graders for whom we estimate the largest school participation

effects stay home sick with worms in the comparison schools, their older sisters may have to stay home to

take care of them. This may partially explain the relatively large treatment effects we find for older

girls.30 To take another example, children may be more inclined to go to school if their friends are also in

school, so school participation gains in treatment schools may partially reflect increased school

participation among children who were not infected. None of these effects would be picked up in a

regression of school participation on worm level, or even in a prospective study in which treatment is

randomized at the individual level, but they are captured in a prospective evaluation in which treatment is

randomized at the school level.



7. Test Scores and Promotion Rates

         Deworming could potentially improve test scores both by increasing time spent in school and by

improving learning while pupils are in school. Deworming could also potentially reduce test scores

through congestion or negative peer effects.

         The first positive channel, increasing the total amount of time spent in school, is likely to be weak

given the observed cross-sectional relationship between school participation and test performance. The

ICS exams in English, Mathematics, and Science-Agriculture – which are modelled on Kenyan Ministry


29
   For example, suppose that half those for whom egg counts would suggest high worm burdens actually have normal
school participation, while the other half of children with high measured worm burdens have dropped out or attend
rarely, and have 1/3 normal school participation. On average, then, those with high recorded egg counts have 2/3
normal school participation. However, since those children with high measured worm burden whose attendance is
unaffected are sampled for the parasitological survey three times as often as those with 1/3 normal participation, the
group of moderately –to heavily infected children will appear to have a school participation rate 3/4 * 1 + 1/4 * 1/3
= 5/6 the normal level, so the estimated effect of moderate-to-heavy helminth infections on school participation will
be –1/6, one-half the true value of -1/3.
30
   Since we do not have data on family relationships among pupils, we cannot directly test this hypothesis.


                                                                                                                    32
of Education exams – were administered in 1998 and 1999. The average score across all subjects is

employed as the principal test score outcome measure for each set of tests, although the basic results are

unchanged if subjects are examined separately (regressions not shown).31 For both 1998 and 1999, test

scores were normalized to be mean zero and standard deviation one among comparison pupils initially

enrolled in the same grade in early 1998.

         Regression 1 of Table 12 shows the cross-sectional relationship between individual school

participation and individual test score performance: the coefficient estimate on average individual school

participation is approximately 0.6. The coefficient estimate suffers from attenuation bias due to

measurement error, since the school participation measure for each individual is the average of only 3.8

participation observations per year. It is straightforward to correct this coefficient estimate for attenuation

bias since the average participation rate and the number of participation observations are known.32 The

corrected coefficient estimate is approximately 1.8. This implies that a year of absence is associated with

a 1.8 standard deviation fall in test scores, while a ten percentage point gain in attendance is associated

with a 0.18 standard deviations higher score on the ICS exam. If deworming leads to test score gains

solely through improvements in attendance, and average school participation in treatment schools exceeds

that in comparison schools by approximately 5.6 percentage points as a result of deworming (Table 11),


31
   Although the ICS tests for 1998 and 1999 are similar in content, they differ in two important respects. The 1998
exam features multiple-choice questions while the 1999 test featured short answers. Second, while each grade in
1998 was administered a different exam, in 1999 the same exam – featuring questions across a range of difficulty
levels – was administered to all pupils in grades 3 to 8. Administering a single exam to all pupils is particularly
useful if grade promotion rates differ across treatment and comparison schools. Government District Mock exams in
English, Maths, Science-Agriculture, Kiswahili, Geography-History, Home Science, and Arts-Crafts were also
administered in both years. Treatment effect estimates are similar for both sets of exams (results not shown). There
are several reasons to focus on the ICS exams. Exam participation was higher on the ICS exam than on the District
Mocks – for example, 84 percent of enrolled pupils took the ICS exam in 1998 while the corresponding rate for the
Mocks was 66 percent – presumably since pupils must pay an exam fee to sit for the Mocks, while taking the ICS
exam was free. The ICS exam estimates thus contain average treatment effect information for a larger proportion of
pupils. Moreover, treatment schools showed far higher participation than comparison schools on the Mocks,
potentially exacerbating selection biases.
32
   The following calculation is not exactly correct, since the number of participation observations differs across
individuals, but it serves as a useful approximation. The average participation rate among this subsample of pupils
is 0.886, which implies that the variance of a single participation observation is (0.886)(1-0.886) = 0.101. Pupils are
observed 3.8 times per year on average, which implies that the sampling variance of average annual participation
(σ2S) is approximately 0.026; the total variance in average annual school participation (σ2T) is 0.039. The true
coefficient estimate on average annual attendance β is related to the coefficient estimate b by the standard
attenuation bias formula: β = b(σ2T /σ2T –σ2S).


                                                                                                                    33
the estimated “effect” of deworming on test scores in the absence of omitted variable bias would be

(0.056)*(1.8), or approximately 0.1 standard deviations.

        However, the coefficient estimate on average school participation in this regression is likely to

overstate the true impact of increased participation on test scores for two reasons. First, it reflects not

only the causal impact of higher participation on test scores, but also unobserved omitted pupil

characteristics correlated with both test scores and school participation. Second, the coefficient estimate

on school participation is likely to reflect the impact of better attendance over the course of a child’s

entire school career, whereas this study only examines attendance gains over one or two years; 5.6

percentage points higher school participation for two years translates into fewer than twenty additional

days of schooling, and might plausibly have only a limited effect on academic performance. For

example, if omitted variable bias accounted for half of the observed correlation between test scores and

school attendance, and if the remainder of the correlation reflects the effects of the past five years of

schooling on academic performance, then one would expect that increasing attendance by 5.6 percentage

points for two years would increase test scores by less than 0.02 standard deviations.

        The second channel through which deworming could increase scores is by improving the

efficiency of learning per unit of time spent in school. However, since severe anemia is rare in this area

(Table 6) and there were only small differences in anemia between treatment and comparison schools, the

most frequently hypothesized link between worm infections and cognitive performance (Stolzfus et al.

1997) may not have been operative during the study.

        On the other hand, deworming could potentially have reduced test scores in treatment schools

through congestion and peer effects. Classrooms were more crowded in treatment schools as previously

ill children attended school more regularly, and the presence of these additional pupils in the classroom

may have imposed negative learning externalities on other pupils. For example, it may be more difficult

to maintain classroom discipline in larger classes, and teachers may need to repeat concepts extra times

for low-achieving students, who would have dropped out in the absence of the deworming program.

Assuming that the class size effect in Angrist and Lavy (1999) is linear, and that the Israeli relationship



                                                                                                              34
between class size and academic outcomes also applies in Kenyan primary schools, deworming

participation gains of the magnitude we find would lead to a drop of between 0.02 to 0.05 standard

deviations in average exam scores.33

        The estimated differences in test scores between pupils in treatment and comparison schools in

regression 2 are -0.041 standard deviations for the first year post-treatment and -0.045 standard deviations

for the second year, neither of which is significantly different than zero (Regression 2, Table 12). The

1996 average school scores on District Mock exams are included in all regressions as a control for pre-

treatment school quality. The coefficient estimate on the number of treatment pupils attending primary

schools within three kilometers is insignificantly different than zero (results not shown).

        The results could potentially have been affected by differential attrition across treatment and

comparison schools, if the additional treatment school pupils who participated in the exam after

deworming were below-average performers. In the 1998 ICS exams, 85 percent of Group 1 pupils sat,

compared to 83 percent in the comparison Group 2 and Group 3 schools. To address this issue,

regression 3 restricts the sample to pupils who were administered the 1998 pupil questionnaire,

eliminating over twenty percent of the sample and much of the potential exam participation bias since

nearly identical proportions of these pupils took the ICS exam in treatment and comparison schools.

Estimates using this restricted sample are similar to those using the complete sample and remain

insignificantly different than zero at traditional confidence levels, suggesting that at least among this sub-

sample, deworming did not substantially raise test scores.

        We can only measure the impact of the program on test scores among the roughly 85 percent of

pupils who took the exam, so it remains possible that benefits may have accrued disproportionately

among the 15 percent of pupils who missed the exam, especially if they suffered from the most intense

helminth infections. However, we do not find a strong association between worm burden and the


33
  The increase from thirty to forty pupils in Israeli grade four and five classes is associated with a drop of
approximately 0.13-0.29 standard deviations in academic achievement test scores. The average class size in Kenyan
primary schools, between grades 3 to 8, is approximately 30 pupils, and the average increase in school participation
as a result of the deworming program was approximately 5.6 percent, which increases average class size to 31.7
pupils.


                                                                                                                  35
likelihood of missing the exam within the sample of students in the parasitological sample. 34 A higher

promotion rate could result if deworming increased learning among weak students who did not take ICS

exams. Promotion rates in treatment schools between 1998 and 1999 are in fact two percentage points

higher than in comparison schools, although this difference is not significantly different than zero (results

not shown).

         Given the observed cross-sectional relationship between participation and test scores, the absence

of a strong time-in-school effect on test scores is not surprising. However, the data are not consistent with

the hypothesis of a strong effect on the efficiency of learning per unit of time in school for the subsample

who took the test. It is worth noting that several other primary school interventions in this region of

Kenya – including textbook provision (Glewwe, Moulin, and Kremer 1999), school grant provision, and

an incentive scheme to promote teacher attendance – have also had limited success in improving

academic test scores.



8. Cost Effectiveness and Welfare Analysis

         The controversy over whether mass school-based deworming treatment should be a public policy

priority for the poorest countries can be approached in several ways. Under the “health cost effectiveness

approach,” health projects are considered cost-effective up to some threshold cost per Disability-Adjusted

Life Year (DALY) saved, perhaps $25 to $100 per DALY in the poorest countries. We also consider the

“educational cost effectiveness” of promoting school participation through deworming rather than

through alternative educational interventions. The “human capital investment approach” estimates the

34
  A subset of pupils who did not take the 1998 ICS exam (including dropouts) were followed up in twenty of the
seventy-five deworming schools and encouraged to sit for the exam shortly after the ICS exam was administered in
school, allowing us to impute test scores for dropouts. In total, 214 pupils were administered the follow-up exam in
these schools. Among grade 3-8 pupils with missing ICS exams, similar proportions were administered the follow-
up exam in Group 1 (treatment) schools – 34 percent – and Group 2 and Group 3 (comparison) schools – 32 percent
– suggesting that selection bias is unlikely to be large (although it remains possible). Missing 1998 ICS test score
data was imputed in two steps. First, the normalized test scores of the follow-up pupils were regressed on a set of
indicator variables for their grade, geographic zone, and school assistance group (assistance from other NGO
projects) separately for Group 1, Group 2, and Group 3 schools. It was impossible to condition on a broader set of
covariates since many of the pupils with missing exam data are also missing pupil questionnaire data. Second,
missing test score values for other pupils with missing tests are imputed as predicted values of this regression, again



                                                                                                                     36
rate of return to deworming in future earnings. The “externality approach” attempts to identify the

subsidy which would lead individuals to fully internalize treatment externalities.35

         The externality and school participation effects examined in this paper turn out to play an

important role under a variety of approaches. For example, as discussed below, we find that under the

health cost effectiveness approach, treatment of schistosomiasis is extremely cost effective, but that a

naïve estimate ignoring externalities would severely underestimate its cost effectiveness. Treatment of

geohelminths would not meet standard cost-effectiveness criteria in the poorest countries based on its

health impact alone, but is extremely cost effective relative to other ways of increasing school

participation in the area that have been examined using prospective evaluations. While estimates of the

long-run labor market impact of deworming are speculative, our best estimate is that deworming is an

excellent human capital investment given its impact on school participation, and that the externalities

from deworming justify fully subsidizing treatment.



8.1 Health Cost Effectiveness

         Annual government expenditure on health in Kenya was approximately five U.S. dollars per

capita from 1990 to 1997 (World Bank 1999), so mass deworming is clearly only one of many health

interventions competing for scarce resources. For example, the vaccination rate against measles and DPT

(diptheria, pertussis, and tetanus) among Kenyan infants of less than one year of age was just 32 percent

in 1997 (World Bank 1999), and these vaccinations are thought to be highly cost effective, at only 12 to

17 U.S. dollars per disability-adjusted life year (DALY)saved.

         We use deworming program cost estimates from the Partnership for Child Development (PCD),

which reports costs of 0.49 US dollars per pupil per year in a large-scale government intervention in

Tanzania. These costs are probably more relevant for potential large scale programs than the PSDP costs,


separately for Group 1, Group 2, and Group 3 schools. Treatment effect estimates remain negative and
insignificantly different than zero using this augmented sample (results not shown).
35
   We consider various approaches since restricting public health subsidies to the goal of addressing treatment
externalities may not be appropriate in the presence of credit market imperfections, behavioral and information
problems, or imperfect within-household altruism, all of which are concerns in this setting.


                                                                                                                  37
since the PSDP was not able to fully realize economies of scale in drug purchase and delivery, and since it

is difficult to disentangle evaluation and delivery costs in the PSDP. 36

         According to the World Health Organization, schistosomiasis infections are associated with much

greater disease burden per infected individual than geohelminths, on average. Given data on the burden

of disease in WHO (2000), and the number of people infected worldwide, the implied average DALY

burden per person infected is 0.0013 for hookworm; 0.0004 for roundworm; 0.0005 for whipworm; and

0.0097 for schistosomiasis. Approximately 18 percent of those infected with helminths globally are

thought to suffer morbidity as a result of their infection, and in our cost-effectiveness calculations we

assume that the entire disease burden is concentrated among individuals with moderate-to-heavy

infections (Bundy et al. 2001).37

         In calculating the overall reduction in disease burden due to the program, we consider direct

treatment effects (corrected for cross-school externalities) on the treated in treatment schools from Table

7; externality effects (corrected for cross-school externalities) on the untreated in treatment schools from

Table 7; and externalities for untreated pupils in comparison schools, from Table 8. We only consider

cross-school externalities for schistosomiasis, since only these were significantly different than zero in

Table 8. Given the project’s randomized design, we assume that Group 3 schools (which are lacking

1999 parasitological data) experienced the same externality benefits as Group 2 schools through early

1999 when neither group had yet received treatment.

         Summing these three components of the treatment effect, the total number of DALY’s averted as

a result of the program is 256, which translates into a cost of approximately $12 per DALY averted, using

the costs of the PCD program in Tanzania. This estimate still ignores the health spillover benefits for

other untreated children and adults in the treatment area. Even if the PCD costs were underestimated by a


36
   For example, the PSDP used trained nurses, held meetings to explain consent procedures, individually recorded
the names of all pupils taking medicine, and was headquartered in Busia town, several hours drive away from many
of the project schools. All of these costs might have been unnecessary in a full-scale program that did not include an
evaluation component. Overall, excluding the costs most clearly linked to the evaluation yields a cost per pupil
treated through the PSDP in 1999 of 1.46 US dollars, with nearly half of this cost in drug purchases.
37
   Note that this implies that the burden of disease per infected individual in our sample is greater than the world
average; this is appropriate, since levels of moderate-heavy infection are relatively high in this setting.


                                                                                                                    38
factor of two, deworming would still be among the most cost-effective health interventions for less

developed countries.

         The externality benefits of treatment (both within and across schools) account for 61.1 percent of

the DALY reduction. A naïve treatment effect estimate that failed to take externalities into account

would underestimate program treatment effects, not only because externalities would be missed, but also

because gains among the treatment group would be underestimated. Consequently, the naïve estimate

would overestimate the cost per DALY averted by almost a factor of five, leading one to mistakenly

conclude that deworming does not meet the strictest cost-effectiveness standards.

         The health gains are overwhelmingly attributable to reductions in the prevalence of moderate-to-

heavy schistosomiasis: 94 percent of the total DALY reduction is due to averted schistosomiasis. We can

separately calculate the cost per DALY averted for the geohelminths; geohelminth infections lead to less

morbidity according to the WHO, but are also much cheaper to treat than schistosomiasis. Assuming that

all drug delivery costs remain the same, but considering only albendazole drug costs in this exercise, the

cost per geohelminth DALY averted would be $155, which implies that mass geohelminth treatment in

areas without schistosomiasis would not meet strict cost effectiveness criteria in the poorest countries

based purely on its health impact.38 As discussed below, however, it is likely to be justified on other

grounds.



8.2 Educational Cost Effectiveness

         Deworming was by far the most cost-effective method of improving school participation among a

series of educational interventions implemented by ICS in this region of Kenya that were subject to

randomized evaluations. ICS has implemented and evaluated textbook provision, grants to school

committees, training for teachers, and incentives for teachers based on student test scores and dropout

rates. Given that the deworming program increased school participation by approximately 0.15 years per

   The cost per DALY for geohelmnith treatment would be lower if albendazole were delivered as part of an ongoing
school-based project in areas where schistosomiasis is being treated, although schools would still have to be visited
at least once more per year for an additional round of for treatment with albendazole.


                                                                                                                  39
treated child (see Section 6), a large scale program with the Tanzania PCD cost of 0.49 US dollars per

child would cost approximately $0.49 / 0.155, or $3.27 US dollars per additional year of school

participation, including both effects on the treated and externality benefits.

         Aside from deworming, the program which was most successful in increasing school

participation was the ICS Child Sponsorship Program (CSP). This program had a number of components,

but the key component was substantially reducing the cost of school attendance by paying for the

uniforms that Kenyan children are required to wear to school. Even under optimistic assumptions,

reducing the cost of schooling in this way costs approximately $99 per additional year of participation

induced. 39, 40



8.3 Deworming as Human Capital Investment

         Given that the PSDP increased school participation but not test scores, any calculation about its

effects on human capital accumulation must necessarily be speculative. Nonetheless, a rough calculation

suggests that the labor market benefits of deworming may far outweigh its costs. Knight and Sabot

(1990) estimate returns to education in Kenya controlling for a wide range of variables including

cognitive tests. They decompose the returns to education into a return to cognitive performance (on tests

of literacy, numeracy, and reasoning) and a direct return to years of schooling and find that years of

schooling alone account for approximately 40 percent of the 17 percent rate of return to education.41 If

one interprets this as a human capital effect rather than a signalling effect, the return to an additional year

of primary school would be approximately 7 percent.

39
   Our assumptions about the cost of attracting children to school by reducing the cost of school are optimistic
because we assume that CSP’s impact on school participation was due entirely to reducing the cost of school. The
program also provided textbooks and new classrooms; another evaluation in the same area found that provision of
textbooks did not affect school participation. School participation improved immediately through CSP, while
classrooms were only provided several years into the CSP program. In any case, if textbook or classroom costs are
included, deworming appears even more cost effective.
40
   Even under the extreme assumptions that uniforms are a pure transfer to parents so the social cost of the CSP is
simply the deadweight loss associated with raising tax revenue, and that households obtained no consumption
benefits from the deworming program, the social cost of deworming per year of extra school participation is likely to
be far lower than that of purchasing school uniforms.




                                                                                                                  40
         After correcting for the fact that comparison schools were also affected, the program increased

school participation by 0.15 years per pupil treated, as discussed in Section 6. Output per worker in

Kenya is 570 U.S. dollars (World Bank 1999). To calculate the effect on the net present value of

discounted wages, we assume that sixty percent of output per worker in Kenya is wages and that wage

gains from higher school participation are earned over forty years in the workforce and discounted at ten

percent per year. Against this long-run wage increase, we set the opportunity cost of schooling, as

children may work rather than attend school. However, children who are heavily infected with worms are

unlikely to be particularly productive as workers and may not work at all. We assume that the average

primary school child who misses school due to worms is half as productive as the average adult; this is

likely to represent an upper bound on productivity of children in general, let alone sick children.42 Under

these assumptions, deworming increases the net present value of wages by more than $20 per treated

child at a cost of only $0.49. If one assumes that the children who missed school as a result of worms

were only 20 percent as productive as adults, then the benefit-cost ratio for the program still exceeds ten

even if the rate of return to an additional year of schooling is only 1.5 percent (calculations not shown).



8.4 Externalities and Optimal Deworming Subsidies

         The externality benefits of deworming in terms of future wages (as calculated in Section 8.3)

alone appear to be far larger than the costs of deworming, suggesting a rationale for subsidies even under

an orthodox externalities analysis. The total net externality gain (within and across schools) per child

treated is then $11.70 per child treated, over twenty times as large as the $0.49 cost of deworming,

suggesting that a large government deworming subsidy is optimal. This figure excludes the potentially




41
   Knight and Sabot (1990) performed this decomposition for returns to secondary education, but it serves as a useful
approximation in the absence of a similar decomposition for primary education.
42
   Udry (1996) finds that children’s agricultural labor productivity is much less than one-half that of adult
agricultural labor productivity in another rural African setting (Burkina Faso).


                                                                                                                  41
substantial benefits experienced by school-age and younger children not enrolled in school, by adults in

these communities, and individuals in areas bordering the study area.43

         To summarize, treatment of schistosomiasis appears to be an extremely cost-effective health

intervention under standard health cost effectiveness criteria for less developed countries, although this is

less true for the treatment of geohelminths. Even in areas with geohelminths but little schistosomiasis,

deworming is a cost-effective way to boost school participation relative to other educational interventions

evaluated in the same area, such as directly reducing the cost of school through the provision of school

uniforms. It also appears likely that deworming can be justified as a human capital investment. Finally,

the externality benefits from deworming are sufficient to justify fully subsidizing treatment in the

program we examine. Since helminth transmission does not respect local primary school boundaries, and

externalities across schools are substantial (Tables 8 and 11), subsidies may be warranted at levels higher

than local school committees, such as the district or provincial government level.

         Note that while we can conclude that there were substantial externalities from the deworming

treatment provided from the PSDP, it is difficult to draw conclusions about the optimal deworming

subsidies in the absence of a fully-fledged behavioral and epidemiological model. This is because the

marginal positive externalities from treatment depend on how many others are also being treated. While

positive externalities from PSDP were large on average, it is difficult to identify marginal positive

externalities, and even harder to gauge how large treatment externalities would be at alternative coverage

levels. We also do not know how coverage is likely to vary with subsidies, although we hope to collect

such information in the future. Depending on epidemiological parameters, some incomplete level of

coverage could potentially be sufficient to eliminate the disease from the population, and in this case there

would be no purpose in raising subsidies above the amount that would generate this level of coverage.


43
   Even if one believes that the increased school participation led to negative congestion externalities by increasing
class size, the positive externalities are easily large enough to pay for the additional teachers needed to offset any
increase in class size. To see this, note that deworming increased school participation by 0.15 years per pupil
treated, and that with one teacher per thirty pupils, this would require an additional 0.005 teachers. If teachers cost
$2000 per year, this amounts to $1 per treated pupil. So a program that provided deworming and additional teachers
would generate $11.70 in positive externalities at a cost of $1.49 per pupil.



                                                                                                                     42
Caution is similarly needed in extrapolating these results to areas with different worm prevalence. While

the direct benefits of deworming may be proportional to worm burden, the externality benefits are likely

to vary non-linearly with worm burden. Additional research is needed to determine optimal deworming

subsidies in this and other settings.



9. Conclusion

        To summarize the results of the current study, a school-based deworming program in Kenya led

to at least a seven percentage point average gain in primary school participation in treatment schools,

reducing overall school absenteeism by one quarter. Treatment created positive health and school

participation externalities for untreated students in the treatment schools and for pupils in neighboring

schools. A rough calculation suggests that these spillovers alone are sufficient to justify not only fully

subsidizing deworming treatment, but even paying people to receive treatment.

        Our results have methodological implications for the literature on the educational effects of

deworming. The existing literature primarily focuses on test scores, but our results suggest that

researchers should also examine the effects on school participation, where we find large impacts. Given

our findings of an impact on school participation, earlier studies examining test scores may be subject to

attrition bias. Most important, our results also suggest that existing estimates of the effect of deworming,

based on studies that randomize treatment within a school, doubly underestimate the effects of

deworming programs. First, they entirely miss the external effects of deworming, and second, they

underestimate the direct effects to the extent that control group pupils benefiting from deworming

externalities bias existing treatment effect estimates toward zero. This problem can be addressed by

randomizing at the level of larger units such as schools, rather than at the individual level, although our

finding of substantial treatment spillovers across schools suggests that units even larger than the school

would be ideal.

        The large improvement in school participation following deworming found in this study points to

the role that tropical diseases such as intestinal worms may play in reducing educational attainment in



                                                                                                              43
sub-Saharan Africa, the region with the highest prevalence of helminths and other tropical diseases

(World Bank 1993). This provides microeconomic support for claims that Africa’s high tropical disease

burden is a causal factor contributing to its low income.44 To the extent that the treatment of other

tropical infectious diseases also generates spillovers benefits similar to deworming, the externality

findings of the current study may also provide an additional rationale for a substantial public role in

subsidizing medical treatment for infectious diseases in less developed countries.45




44
   However, even under optimistic assumptions, the impact of deworming on wages probably cannot explain more
than a small fraction of the enormous income gap between African and industrialized countries. If school-based
deworming were equally as effective through Kenya as in Busia (which is unlikely, since the study area was selected
precisely because of its high helminth infection prevalence), educational attainment would be seven percent higher
in the country as a whole, or approximately (0.07)*(6 years) = 0.42 years. If an additional year of primary schooling
has a seven percent return, this gain in educational attainment translates into approximately three percent higher
average wages. However, according to World Bank figures, U.S. GDP per capita is over eighty times are large as
Kenyan per capita income.
45
   An important issue for future research is why parents are not currently purchasing deworming drugs for their
children, given the moderate costs of the drugs and their potentially important health, educational, and labor market
benefits, and why a large minority of children did not receive deworming drugs through the program. We are
currently investigating the role that rural social networks play in the transmission of knowledge about health, and
about worms in particular; the randomized provision of the deworming treatment intervention through the project
allows an examination of information diffusion, peer effects, and social learning (Miguel and Kremer 2001). In
2001, the NGO introduced a parent user fee for participation in the deworming project, and we will explore which
parents participate in cost-sharing and their reasons for participating.

     The results are school averages weighted by pupil population. Standard errors in parentheses. Significantly
  different than zero at 99 (***), 95 (**), and 90 (*) percent confidence. Data from the 1998 ICS Pupil Namelist,
  1998 Pupil Questionnaire and 1998 School Questionnaire.
  47
     1996 District mock exam scores have been normalized to be in units of individual level standard deviations, and
  so are comparable in units to the 1998 and 1999 ICS test scores.

     This excludes two outlier schools with greater than 1000 Kenyan Shillings per pupil; however, the difference
  across groups remains insignificantly different than zero when these schools are included. The exchange rate in
  1997 was approximately 50 Kenya Shillings = 1 USD.

  These are averages of individual-level data, as presented in Brooker, et al. (2000b); correcting for the
oversampling of the (numerically smaller) upper grades does not substantially change the results. Standard errors in
parentheses. Sample size: 1894 pupils. Fifteen pupils per standard in grades 3 to 8 for Group 1 schools were
randomly sampled. The bottom two rows should be interpreted as the proportion with at least two or at least three
moderate-to-heavy helminth infections, respectively.

The data were collected in January to March 1998 by the Kenya Ministry of Health, Division of Vector Borne
Diseases (DVBD). The moderate infection thresholds for the various intestinal helminths are: 250 epg for S.
mansoni, and 5,000 epg for Roundworm, both the WHO standard, and 750 epg for Hookworm and 400 epg for
Whipworm, both somewhat lower than the WHO standard. Refer to Brooker, et al. (2000b) for a discussion of this
parasitological survey and the infection cut-offs. All cases of schistosomiasis are S. mansoni.

The moderate-to-heavy infection thresholds for the various intestinal helminths are: 250 epg for S. mansoni, and
5,000 epg for Roundworm, both the WHO standard, and 750 epg for Hookworm and 400 epg for Whipworm, both
somewhat lower than the WHO standard. Refer to Brooker, et al (2000b) for a discussion of this parasitological
survey and the infection cut-offs. Kenya Ministry of Health officials collected the parasitological data from January
to March 1998 in Group 1 schools, and from January to March 1999 in Group 1 and Group 2 schools. A random
subset of the original 1998 Group 1 parasitological sample was re-surveyed in 1999. Hb data were collected by
Kenya Ministry of Health officials and ICS field officers using the portable Hemocue machine. The self-reported
health outcomes were collected for all three groups of schools as part of Pupil Questionnaire administration.

 We attempted to track a random sample of half of the original 1998 parasitological sample. Because some pupils
were absent, had dropped out, or had graduated, we were only able to re-survey 72% of this subsample.

     The results are school averages weighted by pupil population. Standard errors in parentheses. Significantly
  different than zero at 99 (***), 95 (**), and 90 (*) percent confidence. The participation rate is computed among all
  pupils enrolled in the school at the start of 1998. Pupils who are present in school on the day of an unannounced
  NGO visit are considered participants. Pupils had 3.8 participation observations per year on average. The figures
  for the “Preschool-Grade 2”; “Grade 3-5”; “Grade 6-8”; and “Dropout” rows are for girls < 13 years, and all boys.
  56
     396 pupils in the sample are missing information on gender. For this reason, the average of the female and male
  participation rates does not equal the overall average.
  57
     Examining girls ≥14 years old eliminates the cohort of girls in Group 1 schools (12 year olds in 1998) who
  received deworming treatment in 1998.

   NGO visit are considered participants. Pupils had 3.8 participation observations per year on average. School
   participation rates are for grades 1 to 7; grade 8 pupils are excluded since many graduated after the 1998 school
   year, in which case their actual 1999 treatment status is not relevant. Preschool pupils are excluded since they
   typically have missing compliance data. All 1998 pupil characteristics (access to latrine, weight-for-age, etc.) are
   for grades 3 to 7, since grade 1-2 pupils were not administered the Pupil Questionnaire.

   The dependent variable is average individual school participation in each year of the program (Year 1 is May
1998 to March 1999, and Year 2 is May 1999 to November 1999); disturbance terms are clustered within schools.
Robust standard errors in parentheses. Significantly different than zero at 99 (***), 95 (**), and 90 (*) percent
confidence. Additional explanatory variables include an indicator variable for girls < 13 years and all boys, and the
rate of moderate-heavy infections in geographic zone, by grade (zonal infection rates among grade 3 and 4 pupils are
used for pupils in grades 4 and below and for pupils initially recorded as dropouts as there is no parasitological data
for pupils below grade 3; zonal infection rates among grade 5 and 6 pupils are used for pupils in grades 5 and 6, and
similarly for grades 7 and 8). Participation is computed among all pupils enrolled at the start of the 1998 school
year. Pupils present during an unannounced NGO school visit are considered participants. Pupils had
approximately 3.8 attendance observations per year. Regression 4 includes pupils with parasitological information
from early 1999, restricting the sample to a random subset of Group 1 and Group 2 pupils. The average number of
treatment school pupils within 3 km from May 1998 to March 1999 is the average number of Group 1 pupils
(449.4); the average number of treatment school pupils within 3 km after March 1999 is the average number of
Group 1 and Group 2 pupils (1020.9).

   The GPS locations were collected before May 2000 (when the U.S. stopped intentionally downgrading GPS
accuracy), and so may only be accurate to within several hundred meters, thus one school in Figure 1 appears to be
in Uganda. The school that appears to be in Lake Victoria is actually on a small island.
