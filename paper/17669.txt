Sustainable Cooperation in Global Climate Policy: Specific Formulas and Emission Targets
to Build on Copenhagen and Cancun

December 2011
JEL No. Q54

                                            ABSTRACT

We explore a framework that could be used to assign quantitative allocations of emissions of greenhouse
gases (GHGs), across countries, one budget period at a time. Under the two-part plan: (i) China, India,
and other developing countries accept targets at Business as Usual (BAU) in the coming budget period,
the same period in which the US first agrees to cuts below BAU; and (ii) all countries are asked in
the future to make further cuts in accordance with a common numerical formula to all. The formula
is expressed as the sum of a Progressive Reductions Factor, a Latecomer Catch-up Factor, and a Gradual
Equalization Factor. This paper builds on our previous work in many ways. First we update targets
to reflect pledges made by governments after the Copenhagen Accord of December 2010 and confirmed
at the Cancun meeting of November 2010. Second, the WITCH model, which we use to project economic
and environmental effects of any given set of emission targets, has been refined and updated to reflect
economic and technological developments. We include the possibility of emissions reduction from
bio energy (BE), carbon capture and storage (CCS), and avoided deforestation and forest degradation
(REDD+) which is an important component of pledges in several developing countries. Third, we
use a Nash criterion for evaluating whether a country’s costs are too high to sustain cooperation.

          In December 2011, the UNFCC Conference of Parties in Durban, South

Africa, chose 2015 as the deadline for negotiating a successor agreement to the

Kyoto Protocol on Global Climate Change. Crucially, major developing

countries agreed for the first time to the principle of legally binding emission

limits.

          This study explores a possible agreement in the form of a framework of

formulas that produce precise numerical targets for emissions of carbon dioxide

(CO2) and other greenhouse gases, in all regions of the world in all decades of this

century. The formulas are based on pragmatic judgments about what kind of

cooperation is sustainable. The reason for this approach is the authors’ belief that

many of the usual science-based, ethics-based, and economics-based paths are not

viable in practice. Successor governments will not be able politically to abide by

the commitments that today’s leaders make if those commitments become

excessively costly relative to a strategy of dropping out.

          If unraveling in a future decade is foreseeable at the time that long-run

commitments are made, then those commitments will not be credible from the

start. Firms, consumers, and researchers base their current decisions to invest in

plant and equipment, consumer durables, or new technological possibilities on the




                                                                                   2
expected future price of carbon: If government commitments are not credible from

the start, then they will not raise the expected future carbon price.

       Three political constraints seem inescapable if key countries are to join a

new treaty and abide subsequently by their commitments: (1) Developing

countries are not asked to bear any cost in the early years. (2) Thereafter, they are

not asked to make any sacrifice that is different in kind or degree from what was

made by those countries that went before them, with due allowance for differences

in incomes. (3) No country is asked to accept an ex ante target that costs it more

than Y% of income in present discounted value (PDV), or more than X% of

income in any single budget period. The logic is that no country will agree to ex

ante targets that have very high costs, nor abide by them ex post. We begin with

thresholds of X=5.0 and Y=1.0.

       The proposed targets for emissions are formulated assuming the following

framework.     Between now and 2050, the European Union follows the path laid

out in the 2008 European Commission Directive; the United States and other

advanced countries follow the paths specified in their submissions under the

Copenhagen Accord as recorded by the time of the Cancun Summit of December

2010; while China, India and other developing countries agree immediately to

quantitative emission targets, which in the first decades merely copy their

business-as-usual (BAU) paths, thereby precluding leakage. These countries are

not initially expected to commit to emission targets below their BAU trajectory.




                                                                                   3
       When the time comes for developing countries to join mitigation efforts

their emission targets are determined using a formula that incorporates three

elements: a Progressive Reductions Factor, a Latecomer Catch-up Factor, and a

Gradual Equalization Factor.       These three factors are designed to persuade the

joining countries that they are only being asked to do what is fair in light of

actions already taken by others, to follow in the footsteps of those who have gone

before. In the first years that a country’s emission target is to decline below the

BAU path, the Progressive Reductions Factor dominates. The reductions asked of

lower income countries are proportionately lower. As time passes, the Latecomer

Catch-up Factor becomes more important.            Countries are increasingly pulled

further from their BAU path and closer toward what their emissions were at the

end of the 20th century.       In the latter part of the 21st century, the formula that

determines the emissions path is increasingly dominated by the Gradual

Equalization Factor. National targets gradually converge in per capita terms. The

glue that holds the agreement together is that every country has reason to feel that

it is only doing its fair share.



       We use the WITCH model to analyze the results of this approach in terms

of projected paths for emissions targets, permit trading, the price of carbon, lost

income, and environmental effects.        Overall economic costs, discounted at 5

percent, average 0.6 percent of Gross World Product. The largest discounted

economic loss suffered by any country from the agreement overall is 1.0 percent


                                                                                     4
of income. The largest loss suffered by any country in any one period is less than

5.0 percent of income. Atmospheric CO2 concentrations level off at 500 parts per

million (ppm) in the latter part of the century.     We also see if it is possible to

attain more ambitious environmental goals by choosing more aggressive

parameters for the formulas. We manage to cap CO2 concentrations below 450

ppm -- delivering a predicted temperature increase of about 2.3°C in 2100, not too

far above the widely desired 2°C -- but only by means of an approximate doubling

of economic costs.



       We do not take a position on what level of concentrations is low enough or

what level of economic costs is too high.          Our claim is that, whatever the

environmental goal, the chances that cooperation to achieve it will be sustainable

are higher if all countries join an agreement and if it is credible that they will

continue to comply. These conditions, in turn, are more likely if each is given

reason to feel it is being asked to do no more than its fair share, taking due account

of differences in income, and if no country has to absorb an unusually large

economic loss in any given period.




                                                                                    5
1.     Introduction


       Of all the obstacles that have impeded a global cooperative agreement to address

the problem of Global Climate Change, perhaps the greatest has been the gulf between

the advanced countries on the one hand, especially the United States, and the developing

countries on the other hand, especially China and India.              As long ago as the

“differentiated responsibilities” language of the Berlin Mandate of 1995 under the United

Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), it was understood that

developing countries would not be asked to commit legally to emissions reductions in the

same time span that industrialized countries did.      But as long ago as the Byrd-Hagel

Resolution of 1997, it was understood that the U.S. Senate would not ratify any treaty

that did not ask developing countries to take on meaningful commitments at the same

time as the industrialized countries.   Sure enough, the United States did not ratify the

Kyoto Protocol that was negotiated later the same year.1

       Each side has a valid point to make. On the one hand, the U.S. reasoning is clear:

it will not impose quantitative limits on its own GHG emissions if it fears that emissions

from China, India, and other developing countries will continue to grow unabated. Why,

it asks, should American firms bear the economic cost of cutting emissions, if energy-

intensive activities such as aluminum smelters and steel mills would just migrate to

countries that have no caps and therefore have cheaper energy – the problem known as

leakage – and global emissions would continue their rapid rise?      On the other hand, the

leaders of India and China are just as clear: they are unalterably opposed to cutting



1
  Nor did Australia. Some other countries like Canada ratified, but are clearly missing their
agreed emission targets by a large margin. The EU is expected to meet its target.


                                                                                           6
emissions until after the United States and other rich countries have gone first. After all,

the industrialized countries created the problem of global climate change, while

developing countries are responsible for only about 20 percent of the CO2 that has

accumulated in the atmosphere from industrial activity over the past 150 years. Limiting

emissions, they argue, would hinder the efforts of poor countries at economic

development. As India points out, Americans emit more than ten times as much carbon

dioxide per person as it does.

        In December 2011, the UNFCC Conference of Parties in Durban, South Africa,

produced a new ray of hope for an agreement. It chose 2015 as the deadline for

negotiating a successor to the Kyoto Protocol to come into force by 2010. Crucially,

major developing countries agreed for the first time to the principle of legally binding

emission limits.

        What is needed is a specific framework for setting the actual emission targets that

signers of a Kyoto-successor treaty can realistically be expected to adopt.2 There is one

practical solution to the apparently irreconcilable differences between the US and the

developing countries regarding binding quantitative targets. The United States would

indeed agree to join Europe in adopting serious emission targets.        Simultaneously, in the

same agreement, China, India, and other developing countries would agree to a path that

immediately imposes on them binding emission targets as well—but targets that in the

first period simply follow the so-called business-as-usual path.        BAU is defined as the


2
  Technically the Copenhagen Accord and Cancun Agreements are not building a successor
regime to the Kyoto Protocol, because they include quantitative commitments from developing
countries whereas the Kyoto Protocol continues to exist and continues to apply only to so-called
Annex I countries. The sooner the two separate tracks are integrated, the better. In this study,
when we speak of a workable successor to Kyoto we are talking about a regime that includes
developing countries.


                                                                                                   7
path of increasing emissions that these countries would experience in the absence of an

international agreement, preferably as determined by experts’ projections.

       Of course an environmental solution also requires that China and other

developing countries subsequently make cuts below their BAU path in future years, and

eventually make cuts in absolute terms as well. The sequence of negotiation can become

easier over time, as everyone gains confidence in the framework.        But the developing

countries can be asked to make cuts in the future that do not differ in nature from those

made by Europe, the United States, and others who have gone before them, taking due

account of differences in income. Emission targets can be determined by formulas that:

       (i) give lower-income countries more time before they start to cut emissions,

       (ii) lead to gradual convergence across countries of emissions per capita over the

       course of the century, and

       (iii) take care not to reward any country for joining the system late.



       We have proposed a set of formulas of this sort in past research and have

projected the possible economic environmental effects by means of the WITCH model.

The choice of parameters in Frankel (2009) allowed the world to achieve global

concentrations of 500 ppm CO2 in the year 2100, while the estimated economic costs

obeyed two political constraints: no single country or region is expected to bear a loss of

more than 5% of income in any given period nor to bear a loss of more than 1% of

income in terms of present discounted value.      The choice of parameters in Bosetti and

Frankel (2012) was more aggressive, to attain somewhat ambitious environmental goals

at higher economic costs.




                                                                                         8
       The present study revises and updates our exercise along a variety of dimensions.

As a result of the Copenhagen Accord and Cancun Agreements, we now have

undertakings from more than 80 countries, including numerical goals not just for the EU

27 but also for 13 other Annex I countries (advanced countries plus a few former

members of the Soviet Bloc) and – most importantly – for 7 big emerging markets:

Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, South Africa, and South Korea.         Thus we have

a firmer numerical basis on which to extrapolate what sorts of emission targets are

politically reasonable.

       The WITCH model has been recalibrated to reproduce the most updated dataset

for the economy and the technologies. Ongoing revisions of the WITCH model have

been necessary to take into account such economic developments as the 2008-09 global

recession and such climate policy developments as the agreed or contemplated inclusion

of other gases, forestation, biomass, and carbon capture and storage. India has been

broken out separately, so we now have twelve countries or regions instead of eleven.

Other refinements to the WITCH model include accounting for lost income for oil

producers (which works to raise cost estimates), and new estimates of alternative

technologies such as wind, bio energy, and CCS (which works to reduce cost estimates).3

The climate model has also been updated, with a better effort to account for aerosols.

        In this study we adopt a criterion for measuring each country’s economic costs

that better suits the fundamental Nash theory of the sustainability of cooperative

agreements. In the classic prisoner’s dilemma, the two players are doomed to the Nash

3
  Previously, the WITCH model had not treated wind power independently from solar energy, and
there had been no allowance for intermittency. Similarly, the possibility of CCS with gas is now
included in all results. BE with CCS, which refers to the technology of woody bio-mass with
carbon capture and storage and has the potential for negative emissions, is included in some of
our results, where it is explicitly identified.


                                                                                              9
non-cooperative equilibrium if each calculates that he will be better off defecting from

the cooperative equilibrium even if the other does not defect.        But the cooperative

equilibrium is sustainable if every participant figures that the benefits of continuing to

cooperate outweigh the costs, taking the strategies of the others as given.   We will use

the phrase “Nash criterion” to describe the way of measuring economic costs to each

country of participating in the agreement relative to an alternative strategy of dropping

out while others stay in.

       Although the prospect of free riding works against the incentive to cooperate for

most countries, our results suggest that the estimated economic cost of cooperation for

those few regions that previously appeared to be at the greatest risk of defection is

smaller than expected.      If one assumes that all countries face some (small) penalty for

defecting, perhaps moral opprobrium or tariffs on carbon-intensive exports, then it might

be possible to sustain a cooperative equilibrium.

       We also continue to explore the possibility of more aggressive environmental

targets in our projections.    The resulting estimated economic costs are high. But since

national leaders have officially agreed on a goal of limiting global warming to 2 degrees

Celsius, the economist who wants to make himself or herself useful will see if there exist

ways to achieve such goals that are more practical than other ways.




                                                                                        10
2.      A Framework to Set Emissions Targets for All Countries and All

Decades


        Virtually all the many existing proposals for a post-Kyoto agreement are based on

scientific environmental objectives (e.g., stabilizing atmospheric CO2 concentrations at

380 ppm in 2100), ethical/philosophical considerations (e.g., the principle that every

individual on earth has equal emission rights), economic cost-benefit analyses (weighing

the economic costs of abatement against the long-term environmental benefits), or some

combination of these considerations.4        This paper studies a way to allocate emission

targets for all countries, for the remainder of the century, that is intended to be more

practical in that it is also based on political considerations, rather than on science, ethics

or economics alone.5



Before Copenhagen

        At the 2007 UNFCCC Conference of Parties in Bali, governments agreed on a

broad long-term goal of cutting total global emissions in half by 2050.              At a 2009

meeting in L’Aquila, Italy, the G8 leaders agreed to an environmental goal of limiting the



4
  Important examples of the science-based approach, the cost-benefit-based approach, and the
rights-based approach, respectively, are Wigley (2007), Nordhaus (1994, 2008), and Baer et al.
(2008).
5
  Chakravarty, et al (2009) and German Advisory Council on Global Change (2009) propose
gradual convergence of per capita targets. Llavador, Roemer and Silvestre (2011) propose
convergence in welfare per capita. Aldy, Barrett, and Stavins (2003) and Victor (2004) review a
number of existing proposals. Numerous others have offered their own thoughts on post-Kyoto
plans, at varying levels of detail, including Aldy, Orszag, and Stiglitz (2001); Barrett (2006);
Bierman, Pattberg, and Zelli (2010); Birdsall, et al (2009); Nordhaus (2006); Olmstead and
Stavins (2006), Seidman and Lewis (2009) and Stern (2007, 2011).



                                                                                                 11
temperature increase to 2°C, which is thought to correspond roughly to a GHG

concentration level of 450 ppm (or approximately 380 ppm CO2 only).

       These meetings did not come close to producing agreement on who will cut how

much in order to achieve the lofty stated goals. Further, the same national leaders are

unlikely still to be alive or in office when realistic multilateral targets to reach these goals

would come due. For this reason, the aggregate goals set out in these contexts cannot be

viewed as anything more than aspirational.

       Industrialized countries did, in 1997, agree to national quantitative emissions

targets for the Kyoto Protocol’s first budget period, so in some sense we know that

agreements on specific emissions restrictions are possible. But nobody has ever come up

with an enforcement mechanism that simultaneously imposes serious penalties for non-

compliance and is acceptable to member countries. Given the importance countries place

on national sovereignty it is unlikely that this will change. Hopes must instead rest on

relatively weak enforcement mechanisms such as the power of moral suasion and

international opprobrium or possibly trade penalties against imports of carbon-intensive

products from non-participants. It is safe to say that in the event of a clash between such

weak enforcement mechanisms and the prospect of a large economic loss to a particular

country, aversion to the latter would likely win out.



A framework to last a century

   Unlike the Kyoto Protocol, the plan studied here seeks to bring all countries into an

international policy regime on a realistic basis and to look far into the future.       But we

cannot pretend to see with as fine a degree of resolution at a century-long horizon as we




                                                                                             12
can at a five- or ten-year horizon. Fixing precise numerical targets a century ahead is

impractical. Rather, there will have to be a century-long sequence of negotiations, fitting

within a common institutional framework that builds confidence as it goes along.        The

framework must have enough continuity so that success in the early phases builds

members’ confidence in each other’s compliance commitments and in the fairness,

viability, and credibility of the process. Yet the framework must be flexible enough that

it can accommodate the unpredictable fluctuations in economic growth, technology

development, climate, and political sentiment that will inevitably occur.         Only by

striking the right balance between continuity and flexibility can a framework for

addressing climate change hope to last a century or more.



Political constraints

       We take five political constraints as axiomatic:

1. The United States will not commit to quantitative targets if China and other major

   developing countries do not commit to quantitative targets at the same time. (This

   leaves completely open the initial level and future path of the targets.) Any plan will

   be found unacceptable if it leaves the less developed countries free to exploit their

   lack of GHG regulation for “competitive advantage” at the expense of the

   participating countries’ economies and leads to emissions leakage at the expense of

   the environmental goal.

2. China, India, and other developing countries will not make sacrifices they view as

       a. fully contemporaneous with rich countries,




                                                                                         13
        b. different in character from those made by richer countries who have gone

            before them,

        c. preventing them from industrializing,

        d. failing to recognize that richer countries should be prepared to make greater

            economic sacrifices than poor countries, or

        e. failing to recognize that the rich countries have benefited from an “unfair

            advantage” in being allowed to achieve levels of per capita emissions that are

            far above those of the poor countries.

3. In the short run, emission targets for developing countries must be computed relative

    to current levels or BAU paths; otherwise the economic costs will be too great for the

    countries in question to accept. But if post-1990 increases were permanently

    “grandfathered,” then countries that have not yet agreed to cuts would have a strong

    incentive to ramp up emissions in the interval before they joined. Countries cannot

    be rewarded for having ramped up emissions far above 1990 levels, the reference year

    agreed to at Rio and Kyoto. Of course there is nothing magic about 1990 but, for

    better or worse, it is the year on which Annex I countries have until now based their

    planning.6

4. No country will accept a path of targets that is expected to cost it more than Y percent

    of income throughout the 21st century (in present discounted value). For now, we set

    Y at 1 percent.


6
  If the international consensus were to shift the base year from 1990 to 2005, our proposal
would do the same. Ten countries that accepted targets at Kyoto continued at Cancun to define
their targets relative to 1990, including the EU (counted as one country). Australia shifted to
2000 as its point of reference, Canada and the US to 2005. The latter three countries are
reflecting the reality of current emission levels that are by now very far above their 1990 levels.
But our Latecomer Catchup Factor fulfills the same function.


                                                                                                  14
5. No country will accept targets in any period that are expected to cost more than X

    percent of income to achieve during that period; alternatively, even if targets were

    already in place, no country would in the future actually abide by them if it found the

    cost to doing so would exceed X percent of income. For now, we set X at 5 percent.


       Of the above propositions, even just the first and second alone seem to add up to a

hopeless stalemate: Nothing much can happen without the United States, the United

States will not proceed unless China and other developing countries start at the same

time, and China will not start until after the rich countries have gone first. There is only

one possible solution; only one knife-edge position satisfies the constraints. At the same

time that the United States agrees to binding emission cuts in the manner of Kyoto, China

and other developing countries agree to a path that immediately imposes on them binding

emission targets—but these targets in their early years simply follow the BAU path.

       In later decades, the formulas we consider do ask substantially more of the

developing countries. But these formulas also obey basic notions of fairness, by asking

only for cuts that are analogous in magnitude to the cuts made by others who began

abatement earlier and by making due allowance for developing countries’ low per capita

income and emissions and for their baseline of rapid growth.             These ideas were

developed in earlier papers7 which suggested that the formulas used to develop emissions

targets incorporate four or five variables: 1990 emissions, emissions in the year of the

negotiation, population, and income.       One might also include a few other special

variables such as whether the country in question has coal or hydroelectric power --

similar proposals.


                                                                                         15
though the 1990 level of emissions conditional on per capita income can largely capture

these special variables -- and perhaps a dummy variable for the transition economies.



       We narrow down the broad family of possible formulas to a manageable set, by

the development of the three factors: a short-term Progressive Reductions Factor, a

medium-term Latecomer Catch-up Factor, and a long-run Gradual Equalization Factor.

We then put them into operation to produce specific numerical targets for all countries,

for all remaining five-year budget periods of the 21st century. Next, these targets are fed

into the WITCH model to see the economic and environmental consequences.

International trading plays an important role. The framework is flexible enough that one

can adjust a parameter here or there—for example if the economic cost borne by a

particular country is deemed too high or the environmental progress deemed too low—

without having to abandon the entire framework.



Estimation of Business As Usual path

       One must acknowledge that BAU paths are neither easily ascertained nor

immutable.    Countries may “high-ball” their BAU estimates in order to get more

generous targets (though this may be difficult for those who have hitherto “low-balled”

their claimed emissions path to appear virtuous global citizens). Even assuming that

estimates are unbiased, important unforeseen economic and technological developments

could occur between 2010 and 2020 that will shift the BAU trajectory for the 2020s, for

example. Any number of unpredictable events have already occurred in the years since

1990. They include German reunification, the 1997–1998 East Asia crisis, the boom in




                                                                                        16
the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, and China), the global financial crisis of 2008–

2009, and great volatility in world oil prices over the last decade including the spikes of

2008 and 2011.

       A first measure to deal with the practical difficulty of setting the BAU path is to

specify in the Kyoto-successor treaty that estimates must be generated by an independent

international expert body, not by national authorities. A second measure, once the first

has been assured, is to provide for updates of the BAU paths every budget period.

Allowing for periodic adjustments to the BAU baseline does risk undermining the

incentive for carbon-saving investments, on the logic that such investments would reduce

future BAU paths and thus reduce future target allocations. This risk is the similar to the

risk of encouraging countries to ramp up their emissions. That is why we introduce a

Latecomer Catch-up Factor into the formula which rapidly diminishes the weight

assigned to BAU after a few budget periods and instead tethers countries to their 1990

emission levels in the medium run.




3. The Post-Copenhagen Submissions as Starting Points



       Countries are expected to agree to the second step, quantitative targets that entail

specific cuts below BAU, at a time determined by their circumstances. In our initial

simulations, the choice of year for introducing an obligation actually to cut emissions was

generally guided by two thresholds: when a country’s average per capita income exceeds

$3000 per year and/or when its per capita annual emissions approach 1 ton or more.



                                                                                        17
But we found that starting dates had to be further modified in order to satisfy our

constraints regarding the distribution of economic losses.

       As already noted, this approach assigns emission targets in a way that is more

sensitive to political realities than other proposed target paths. Specifically, numerical

targets are based (a) on commitments that political leaders in various key countries have

already proposed or adopted, as of December 2010, and (b) on formulas designed to

assure latecomer countries that the emission cuts they are being asked to make represent

no more than their fair share -- in that they correspond to the sacrifices that other

countries before them have already made.



The Cancun targets

       Table 1 summarizes the quantitative targets submitted under the Copenhagen

Accord and recognized in Cancun in December 2010. Most countries defined their

targets relative to their 1990 emission levels (as was done in the Kyoto Protocol), some

relative to a more recent base year (usually 2005) and some relative to BAU (a baseline

that is more subject to interpretation). When evaluating the Latecomer Catch-up Factor,

we will want to express targets relative to 1990. When evaluating the Progressive

Reduction Factor, we express the targets relative to BAU as estimated by the WITCH

model (not by the country itself), shown in the last two columns of the table.     For all

non-OECD countries we assume that caps imposed before 2025 are no more stringent

than BAU levels. Even though a few individual countries expressed readiness for caps

that bind more sharply at Copenhagen and Cancun (e.g., Brazil’s 2020 pledges), we do




                                                                                       18
not feel that it would be appropriate to extend such commitments to the entire region in

which such countries are located (e.g., Latin America).



Targets for EU

       Brussels in 2008 committed unilaterally to reduce European Union emissions 20

percent below 1990 levels by 2020.8 But the European Union (EU) also said it would cut

emissions 30 percent below 1990 levels by 2020, conditional on other countries joining

in. Thus, given assumptions on other countries’ commitments, we now set an EU target

of 30 percent below 1990 levels. EU targets continue their downward trajectory in the

third period, 2020–2025, to 35 per cent below 1990 levels and then progress in equal

increments to a level 50 percent below in the eighth period, 2045–2050.



Target for Japan

       Japan’s Copenhagen pledge for 2020 is 25 percent below 1990 levels, which is 29

percent below 2005 levels. This is the same as what he had assumed previously, based

on prime ministers’ statements.



Target for US

       The American submission under the Copenhagen Accord is 2020 emissions at

17% below 2005 levels (which would represent the achievement of the Kyoto goal of 5%

below 1990 levels, but delayed by an entire decade). We had previously taken our cue

from bills in the US Congress in assuming that emissions were targeted roughly to flatten

                                                                                            19
between 2012 and 2020. This is more aggressive than that with respect to the near term,

which is consistent with the evidence n the meantime that American emissions peaked in

2007, as a result of the ensuing recession. The Congressional bills had been aggressive in

the longer term, and we follow them in assuming a year-2050 target that is 83% below

the 2005 level.



Targets for Korea, South Africa and Australia

       These three coal-dependent countries are grouped together. We had previously

assumed that the Korean target would show flat emissions from 2005 to 2020. But Korea

has persisted with more aggressive targets: its Cancun submission for 2020, though

defined as 30 percent below BAU, translates to 18% below 2005 emissions.        Similarly

with South Africa: phrased as 34 percent below BAU, it translates to 23% below 2005.

Australia is having great difficulty making up its mind.   Its targets could lie anywhere

from 11% to 32% below 2005.        We take the South African target, 34 per cent below

BAU, to represent the threesome.



Targets for Latin America

       Mexico, preparing for the Cancun meeting in December 2010, felt the usual host’s

obligation to make a significant offer.   Mexico and Brazil both suggested 2020 targets

phrased relative to BAU. Brazil’s is the more aggressive, translating to 34 to 37 per cent

below 2005 levels.     We assume that, although pledges for Brazil are stricter, Latin

America overall is not yet prepared to undertake any cuts below BAU.      We assume that




                                                                                       20
the region is prepared to start cutting below BAU in 2040, or in 2025 when we turn to a

more aggressive scenario.



Targets for East Asia

                  East Asia is a category that here excludes Japan, China and Korea; thus it is really

Southeast Asia.                            Its largest member is Indonesia.                                                      Indonesia’s Copenhagen target,

translated from BAU terms, is in the range 24 to 39 per cent below 2005 levels by 2020.

But, again, we assume that the larger region is not yet prepared to be this aggressive.

We continue to give BAU targets to the Southeast Asians until 2060, or until 2025 in the

more ambitious case.

Targets for China and India

                  In important breakthroughs, China and India announced targets after Copenhagen.

They expressed the targets in terms of intensity (carbon emissions divided by GDP). We,


                                                                                                                                                                                         21
as others, estimate that these targets translate approximately into these countries’

respective BAU paths. Environmentalists and American business interests may complain

that these important countries do not propose to cut emissions below what they would be

in the absence of an international agreement. But this has been our plan all along for

China and India in the near term. The important thing is to cap their emissions and get

them in the trading system. Targets below BAU come later.

       Environmentalists and businessmen may come to realize that the commitment,

even though only a commitment to BAU targets, is more important than it sounds. It

precludes the carbon leakage which, absent such an agreement, would undermine the

environmental goal, and it ameliorates the competitiveness concerns of carbon-intensive

industries in rich countries. A commitment to BAU targets would provide assurance that

developing countries will not exploit the opportunity to go above their BAU paths, as

they might in the absence of this commitment.

       Our approach recognizes that it would be politically difficult to get China to agree

to substantial actual cuts in the short term. Indeed China might well continue to register

strong objections to being asked to take on legally binding targets of any kind at the same

time as the United States.   But the Chinese may be coming to realize that they would

actually gain from such an agreement, by acquiring the ability to sell emission permits at

the same world market price as developed countries. (China currently receives lower

prices for lower-quality project credits under the Kyoto Protocol’s Clean Development

Mechanism.)

       How do we know they would come out ahead?              China is currently building

roughly 100 power plants per year, to accommodate its rapidly growing demand. In the




                                                                                        22
absence of environmental policy, most would continue to run on cheap coal. The cost of

shutting down an already-functioning coal-fired power plant in the United States is far

higher than the cost of building a new clean low-carbon plant in China in place of what

otherwise might be a new dirty coal-fired plant. Because of this gap in costs, when an

American firm pays China to cut its emissions voluntarily, thereby obtaining a permit that

the American firm can use to meet its emission obligations, both parties benefit in strictly

economic terms.



Targets for former Soviet republics

       Four countries report emission targets that actually work out to constitute

increases above their BAU paths. These are not developing countries, but rather countries

that were once part of the Soviet Union: Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan. Their

proposed cuts appear as the four points below the zero axis in Figure 1a. In the case of

Ukraine, the proposed target is a full 44% above its current BAU.       This is because the

targets keyed to 1990 for these countries were rendered obsolete, based on the judgment

that their economies had collapsed following the collapse of the Soviet Union. These

countries are seeking a continuation of the “hot air” that they received under the Kyoto

Protocol.

       One sometimes hears claims that the hot air for these countries agreed at Kyoto

was inadvertent. After all, it created the potential for them to sell permits and thus get

paid for emission reductions that had already occurred for reasons unrelated to the

environment.      This concession was in fact not inadvertent, but was judged by other

delegations to be necessary to induce the former Soviet countries to agree to the Kyoto




                                                                                         23
Protocol.     (An additional factor in this calculation was that Russia arguably has much

less of a stake in avoiding global warming than do most other countries.) The fact that

other delegations judged this concession warranted in 1997 does not necessarily mean

that an extension of it is warranted again today.

         We will consider two cases, one where the targets for the four former Soviet

countries are set equal to BAU (as estimated by us, not the countries themselves),

similarly to the lower-income countries, and another where they are given the extra

benefits implicit in their Cancun submissions.9



“Fair” emission targets

            Economists usually try to avoid the word “fair,” since it means very different

things to different people. In the context of climate change policy, “fair” to industrialized

countries implies that they shouldn’t have to cut carbon emissions if the emission-

producing industries are just going to relocate to developing countries that are not

covered by the targets. Our plan addresses this concern by assigning targets to all

countries, rich and poor, even if in some cases they are only BAU targets. “Fair” to

developing countries means that they shouldn’t have to pay economic costs that are

different in nature than those paid by industrialized countries before them, taking into

account differences in income. Our plan addresses this concern by including in the

formula the Progressive Reductions Factor, which in the early years assigns to richer



9
  The first draft of the paper presented the first case, i.e., no hot air. When it comes to computing the
economic costs of emission targets for the more stringent policy we investigate here, we find that the
Transition Economies incur high costs unless they are given the early hot air or some other benefit to ease
the burden, so we allow let them keep their hot air in the more stringent policy scenario. (Their costs are
almost as high as for the MENA countries, and for the same reason: according to the new version of the
WITCH model, oil producers pay a heavy price for the climate change regime.)


                                                                                                          24
countries targets that cut more aggressively relative to BAU, as well as the Gradual

Equalization Factor, which dictates that in the long run all countries converge in the

direction of equal emission rights per capita.




Estimating the degree of progressivity

       Our first statistical exercise is to run a regression of the cuts implied by the

Copenhagen-Cancun targets against the countries’ current income per capita. We expect

to find a positive statistical relationship between income per capita and the emission cuts,

under the hypothesis that it is reasonable from a political economy viewpoint for

countries to make deeper percentage cuts relative to BAU the richer they are. This is the

progressive relationship that was uncovered in the Kyoto targets (Frankel, 1999, 2009):

The targets agreed among Annex I countries at Kyoto in 1997, including among members

of the EU considered separately, implied an estimated progressivity parameter of 0.14.

Running the regression on the Copenhagen-Cancun numbers could be viewed either as an

exercise in hypothesis-testing or as an exercise in parameter estimation.              If our

hypothesis -- that it is reasonable as a matter of political economy to expect countries in

their first year of emission cuts to accept larger cuts relative to BAU the higher their

income -- is correct, then this progressive pattern should again show up in the numbers

recorded under the Cancun Agreements. Alternatively, we could use the regression to

obtain a new estimate of the progressivity parameter.

       In Table 2a we regress emission cuts (from BAU) against income per capita,

including all the Cancun targets, corresponding to Figure 1a. Progressivity is highly

significant: the t-statistic is 3.7 and the R2 is .42.         The estimated parameter is .16.

When we eliminate excess over BAU in the emission targets for the four former Soviet

countries as illustrated in Figure 1b, the results are even more highly significant. The t-

statistic is 3.9 and the R2 is .44. The estimated parameter is .13. This is an encouraging

result. The estimated progressivity parameter is not just statistically significant, but

extraordinarily close to the estimate on a very different set of numbers determined 13

years earlier, at the time of the Kyoto Protocol.            The current estimates, .13 and .16,

bracket the earlier estimate, .14.     We are happy with this bit of external validation of the

theory. We see no need to update the estimate of the progressivity parameter γ used in

the model, since the new estimates lie so close to the old one.

(1-β) ≡ weight on BAU

λ ≡ strength of latecomers’ catch-up.

We estimate the formula shown in equation (1) by running the regression:

       All three coefficients come out showing the hypothesized sign and high statistical

significance. This looks like further evidence in favor of our political economy theory.

Indeed, one could hardly have wished for a stronger outcome of the hypothesis test.

The point estimates of the coefficients are c=1.384,  = 0.156, β = 0.376, and βλ = 0.328.

The progressivity parameter is still very close to its preceding value γ =0.16, even

though we are now controlling for other factors. Take the ratio of the last two

coefficients to get the estimate λ = 0.872. We will use these estimates to update the

parameters in our formulas.




4. Constructing the formula and parameters



       Our approach is to assume that countries determine whether to join the climate

change regime and to abide by any agreement by balancing the costs and benefits,

broadly interpreted. The benefits to a given country from participating are not modeled.

But they include country’s contribution to mitigating global climate change itself (which

is not important for small countries), auxiliary benefits such as the environmental and

health effects of reducing local air pollution, the avoidance of international moral

opprobrium, and perhaps the avoidance of trade penalties against non-participants.



Constraints on economic costs

       The costs of participating are economic. The benefits that some countries get

from the right to sell emission permits are explicitly counted within (net) economic costs.



                                                                                           29
        As noted, we capture the cost-benefit calculation by interpreting political

constraints as precluding that a country agrees to participate if the targets would impose

an economic cost greater than Y% of income in terms of present discounted value.       In

other words, Y can be interpreted as the sum of the benefits of participation. If costs

exceed benefits, the country will defect. We further assume that political constraints

preclude that a country will continue to comply with an agreement if the targets would

impose a cost in any one period greater than X% of income. In Frankel (2009), X was set

at 5% of income, and Y at 1%. Bosetti and Frankel (2012) allowed looser constraints.

       What is the benchmark to which each country compares participation when

evaluating its economic costs? In our previous work, we assumed that the alternative to

participation is BAU: what the world would look like if there had never been a serious

climate change agreement in the first place. This may indeed be the relevant benchmark,

especially when the X threshold for the present discounted value of cost is interpreted as

determining whether countries agree to the treaty ex ante, each conditional on the others

agreeing. Treaties like the Kyoto Protocol do not go into effect unless a particular high

percentage of parties ratify the treaty.   There was room for no more than one large

holdout.

       In the context of the Nash criterion, however, one could argue that cooperation is

unlikely to be sustained when each individual country calculates that if it were to defect

from the agreement on its own, with others continuing to abide by the agreement, the

benefits of defecting would outweigh the benefits of participation. It is not enough to

calculate that bringing down the entire global agreement would inflict high costs. The




                                                                                       30
concern is that individual temptations to free-ride will torpedo cooperation, even though

cooperation is in the collective interest.

        Therefore we introduce here a new interpretation of the political constraint. Each

country calculates the economic benefit of dropping out of an agreement under the

assumption that the rest continue to participate, which we call the Nash criterion for

evaluating the economic cost of participating. If that economic benefit exceeds X% of

GDP in any given year, the country will drop out.       In that case – perhaps – the entire

agreement will unravel, as other countries make similar calculations. If this weakness is

perceived from the beginning, then the agreement will never achieve credibility in the

first place.

        The Nash criterion may sound like a more difficult test to meet than the earlier

one. If one adds the gains from free-riding to the costs of compliance with an agreement,

then it sounds less likely that we will find 500 ppm or any other given environmental

target to satisfy the constraint that economic costs remain under the threshold for

sustainable cooperation. But that would be to view the question solely from the viewpoint

of the many countries for whom a viable international climate regime is a good thing.

From the viewpoint of most oil producers, any international climate regime reduces the

demand for fossil fuels and so probably leaves them worse off. Free riding on others’

efforts is not a meaningful concept in their case. For the oil producers, therefore, defining

the benchmark as the case where they drop out alone but the rest of the world stays in

produces lower estimated costs to abiding by the agreement. The global oil price is going




                                                                                          31
to go down regardless. This could make the cost-benefit test easier to meet than under

the earlier criterion.10



         MENA shows up with far higher costs than was true in our earlier research. The

reason is that many countries in the Middle East and North Africa are oil exporters, and

the current version of the WITCH model pays more attention to the economic costs

imposed on oil producers from a decline in world demand for fossil fuels. We presume

these cost estimates to be well-founded; therefore to get them down we now grant MENA

a later starting date. The same is true to an extent of costs estimated for the Transition

Economies and Canada. When pursuing the more ambitious environmental goal, in

Section 7, we let the TE countries keep the hot air that is implicit in their Cancun

submissions, in order to bring down their costs. Among the countries not considered oil

producers, the category that includes Korea, South Africa and Australia generally shows

the highest costs, especially toward the end of the century.                      This turns out to be

attributable to an assumption of the model that these countries include deposits of

“unconventional oil” that become profitable later in the century, but that is penalized by a

climate change regime along with the conventional oil producers. We are not convinced

that the potential for these “oil grades 7 and 8” is necessarily well-founded and so we

have chosen to emphasize in our simulations a version of the model that omits them, with

the result that costs are not so high for Korea, South Africa and Australia.




10
  The test of sustainability becomes easier to satisfy if the oil exporters are the ones who are otherwise in
most danger of violating the X and Y thresholds. This in fact turns out to be the case in our estimates. (The
test would become harder to satisfy if the other countries, those that want a climate change regime to work,
are the ones who are most in danger of violating the X and Y thresholds.)


                                                                                                          32
Choice of parameters

       We perform our analysis with values for λ and other parameters based on the

econometric estimation of the equation parameters from the Copenhagen-Cancun

submissions (i.e., the coefficients estimated in Table 2a). We round off to λ = 0.9 the

estimate from Table 2a for the latecomer catch-up factor in the first budget period during

which a country accepts targets below BAU.

       We have all along intended that the latecomer catch-up process would be

complete within a few decades, in other words that the partial accommodation accorded

to countries that have ramped up their emissions between 1997 and 2012 would not be

long-lasting. Thus where we extend the analysis to modify parameter values in light of

the Copenhagen-Cancun submissions, we will set in the second period of cuts for

any given country (call it year τ), so that the equation in that case becomes:
.

(LnTarget τ - lnBAU τ ) = c – γ (income/cap) + β (lnBAU τ -ln emissions1990)     (2a)


In words, the level of emissions in 2007 drops out of the equation as early as the second

period of cuts for any given country. The formula for the target in this case becomes a

weighted average of BAU and 1990 (minus the usual Progressive Reduction Factor). We

can round off to 0.4 the parameter β (which is now the weight placed on 1990 emissions,

versus BAU). Needless to say, spurious precision in these parameter choices would not

be appropriate.



       The third component of the formula is the Gradual Equalization Factor (GEF).

Beginning in 2050 we switch to a formula that in each period sets assigned amounts in



                                                                                          33
per capita terms, as follows: a weighted average of the country’s most recent assigned

amount and the global average, with a weight of δ on the latter. In past work we set

δ=0.1, so that the speed of convergence across countries was 1/10 per five-year budget

period.     In Section 5 here, when the environmental goal is year-2100 concentrations of

CO2 equal to 500 ppm, we set the constant term c = 0.811 and δ = 0.11. When we turn to

a more stringent environmental goal, we adjust the constant term down to c = 0.3 for all

countries and the GEF weight back down to δ = 0.10.



5. The numerical emission target paths that follow from the formulas


          Table 2 reports the emissions targets produced by the formulas for each of twelve

geographical regions, for every period between now and the end of the century.

          The twelve regions are:

US = United States                                     KOSAU = Korea, South Africa, and Australia
CAJAZ = Canada, Japan, and New Zealand                 TE = Russia and other Transition Economies
MENA = Middle East and North Africa                    SSA = Sub-Saharan Africa

  We make an exception to our general practice of applying a uniform formula to all: we give the TE
group a constant term of 0.5 rather than 0.8 (to allow for the special circumstances of their obsoletely high
emissions in 1990).

        Starting at the most highly aggregated level, Figure 2 shows global emissions.

The path is a bit more aggressive than in previous work, as a reflection of the pledges

made at Cancun. The emissions peak comes in 2045. Cuts steepen after 2050, so that

energy-related emissions worldwide fall from over 40 Gigatons (Gt) of CO2 in 2040 to

20 in 2100, ¼ their BAU level.



        How important is it that all countries/regions participate?          If one country drops

out and others respond by doing the same, so that the result is to unravel the entire

agreement, then obviously the effect is very large. But what if just one country or region

drops out, or fails to sign up in the first place? Figure 3 examines this question.             The

bottom path represents full cooperation, the same as in Figure 2: all countries sign up

and continue to participate throughout the century. If South Asia alone refuses to play,

the result is the next-lowest path; it hardly makes any difference for global emissions as

these economies are small. If Canada, Japan and New Zealand are the only ones to drop

out, the effect is just a bit more. And so on.        The uppermost path shows what happens

if China alone drops out. It represents a big jump over the second highest path (the case

where India alone drops out), or the third highest (where the USA alone drops out).

This illustrates that Chinese participation is the sine qua non of a successful global effort

to address climate change, followed in importance by the participation of India and the

United States. It is more than noteworthy that these three big countries did not accept

targets under the Kyoto Protocol.12

   In each of the “Nash” simulations, where one country drops out at a time, it turns out that the
free riding country emits less than it would in the BAU baseline. According to the WITCH
model, they take the opportunity from the cost improvements in the carbon free technologies
among those countries that continue to participate and this outweighs the conventional leakage

effects (according to which they consume more fossil fuels because the world price is reduced
and they expand production in energy-intensive sectors because they gain a competitive
advantage).


                                                                                                37
         Next we disaggregate between industrialized countries and developing countries.

Figure 4a shows the former, defined now as members of the Organization for Economic

Cooperation and Development (Annex I countries excluding TE). Emissions begin to

decline as early as 2010, reflecting a real-world peaking of emissions around 2007 and

recalibration of baselines caused in large part by the global recession that reduced

industrial country activity sharply in 2009.13 (Targets go on to decline from about 13 Gt

of CO2 in 2010 to less than 3 Gt of CO2 in 2100. )

         The graph also shows the simulated value for actual emissions of the rich

countries, which decline more gradually than the targets through mid-century because

carbon permits are purchased on the world market, as is economically efficient.                        The

total value of the permit purchases runs about 6 Gt of CO2 in the middle decades of the

century and then declines.

         Figure 4b shows that among non-OECD countries overall, both emissions targets

and actual emissions peak in 2045. The simulated path of actual emissions lies a little

above the target caps. The difference, again, is the value of permits sold by the poor

countries to the rich countries. Thanks to emission permit sales, actual emissions fall

below the BAU path, though still rising well before developing countries are forced to cut

by more aggressive targets after 2045. The total falls from the peak of about 38 Gt of

energy-related CO2 emissions in 2045 to less than half that in 2100.                      The year-2100

emissions are about one third of the BAU level for that year.




13
  That the peaking of rich-country emissions is attributable to the 2009 recession is consistent with the
failure of most models to predict it (absent strong climate change policy). In Frankel (2009), emissions
did not begin to fall until 2025. Even in the more aggressive policy scenario of Bosetti and Frankel (2012),
they only peaked in 2010 and began to fall in 2015.

share of emission reductions in the form of permit purchases.                                                                               The estimates for the size

of the international market in carbon emission permits are presented in Appendix 2

        The bar chart in Figure 5 expresses emissions in per capita terms, for every region

in every budget period.      The United States, even more than other rich countries, is

currently conspicuous by virtue of its high per capita emissions: close to 5 tons CO2 per

capita. But they start to come down after 2015, like the other rich regions. Emissions in

developing countries continue to rise for a bit longer, and then come down more

gradually. But their emissions per capita numbers of course start from a much lower

base.      China peaks at almost 3 tons CO2 per capita in 2040. Most of the other

developing countries rarely get above 1 ton CO2 per capita; India climbs just over 1 ton

per capita briefly at the peak in 2060. In the second half of the century, everyone

converges toward levels below one ton per capita, thanks to the gradual equalization

formula.



6. Consequences of the targets, according to the WITCH model


        We run these emission levels through the WITCH model to see the effects.

Before we turn to the costs in terms of lost income, which is the measure of economic

welfare that is relevant to economists, we look first at the effect on the price of energy,

which is politically salient and also a good indicator of the magnitude of the intervention.



Economic effects

   Figure 6 reports that the price of carbon remains quite reasonable through 2045, but

then begins to climb steeply.   By 2100 it surpasses $250 per ton of CO2.      Many in the

business world would consider this a high price. The effect translates into an increase in

the price for US gasoline around $2.5 per gallon. Needless to say, this idea would be

taxes today in Europe and Japan. 14

           Global economic losses measured in terms of national income are illustrated in

Figure 7a, for the case where bio energy with CCS is excluded. Cost rises gradually

over time up to 2085. Given a positive rate of time discount, this is a good outcome. As

late as 2050 they remain below 1% of income. In the latter part of the century losses rise

but never exceed 3% of income. Figure 7b illustrates the case that allows for bio energy

with CCS. Now global costs stay below 2.1 per cent of income even late in the century.

Either way, the present discounted value of global costs is less than 0.7 per cent of

income, using a discount rate of 5%.

   The prices for carbon and gasoline here are substantially less than the prices estimated in Frankel (2009),
let alone Bosetti and Frankel (2012). The explanation is partly the greater attention paid to wind and to gas
plus CCS, but mainly because of BE with CCS. The lower number of carbon-free alternatives, the larger
role for energy saving. The implication is a higher price of carbon but also lower amounts of carbon in the
economy.

         Until 2050, costs remain below 1.2% of income for every country or region. In

the second half of the century they rise, for the Annex I countries of Kyoto in particular.

But for every country and in every budget period the cost remains under 5% per cent of

income. This is good news: it is the (admittedly arbitrary) threshold that we have used

from the beginning, under the logic that no government could afford politically to

continue to abide by an agreement that was costing the country more than 5 per cent of

income. It would make no difference if such a country had benefited from permit sales

in the early years or even suffered no loss at all in present discounted value; large

potential losses in later years would render any earlier commitments “dynamically

inconsistent.”

         Our other political constraint is that no government will sign its country up for an

agreement that in ex ante terms is expected to cost more than a particular threshold,

which Frankel (2009) – again arbitrarily – set at 1 per cent of income. Table 4 reports the

present discounted value of economic losses for each country or region, using a discount

rate of 5 per cent. In Table 4a the question is how much it costs the country in question

to participate if the alternative is the case where there never was an operational

international climate policy in the first place, in other words BAU. The range of

economic burdens across countries is wide. It is close to zero for India and other poor

countries.15 But it is as high as 2.2 percent of income for the Middle East and North

Africa, well above our desired threshold, and 1.2 percent for the Transition Economies.16

It lies in between for the United States, at 0.6 percent of income.


15
   Pakistan and other non-India countries in South Asia actually gain, from the ability to sell permits, as
does Sub-Saharan Africa.
16
   The cost estimates for the two regions are higher than in past research, because the WITCH model has
been revised to capture the losses to oil producing countries from a reduced global demand for fossil fuels.


                                                                                                          44

        One could argue that the relevant criterion in deciding whether cooperation is

sustainable is not whether individual countries find the economic cost to be too high

relative to an alternative where there was never any international policy action in the first

place, but rather whether individual countries find the cost to be too high relative to a

strategy where they drop out but others continue to cooperate (i.e. a game theoretic

viewpoint).

        We are not claiming to prove any theorems regarding sub-game perfect

cooperative equilibria. But the spirit is that the international regime imposes moderate

penalties for a country that does not participate, such as international opprobrium or trade

penalties against imports of carbon-intensive products, and that these penalties are in the

range of the thresholds X and Y (which we have been taking as 5% and 1% of income,

respectively). Under these assumptions, if the economic gain from dropping out

measured by the Nash criterion is below the threshold, then cooperation would seem to

be sustainable. Only if cooperation in future periods is seen to be sustainable ex ante will


                                                                                              45
the agreement be credible from the beginning. Only if the agreement is credible will

firms begin early to phase in new and existing low-carbon technologies, in anticipation of

higher carbon costs in the future. Only if firms begin to phase in these technologies from

the beginning will an emissions target path that begins slowly succeed in its motivation of

reducing costs by allowing sufficient time for the capital stock to turn over.

       Table 4b estimates costs by the Nash criterion. The question is how much does it

cost the country in question – considering each country one at a time – to participate if

the alternative is the case where it drops out of the international agreement but the other

countries continue to abide by it. One might expect that the prospect of free riding would

entail substantial gains for the country dropping out, i.e., that continued participation

would entail substantial costs. This is the essence of leakage. Indeed the costs are

higher in Table 4b than Table 4a for most of the countries, including most of the

industrialized countries. But for the former members of the Soviet Bloc (TE) and

especially for the MENA countries, the economic cost is much lower in Table 4b than in

Table 4a. The explanation is that, regardless what they themselves do, oil producers bear

substantial losses when participating countries reduce their demand for fossil fuels. [In

this sense, their cooperation is not really required.]

       The effect of switching to the Nash criterion is to narrow the range of costs across

regions, so that it runs only from 0.7 per cent of income for India to 0.8 per cent for

MENA, TE and one per cent for China. This is very important. The importance does not

stem primarily from equity considerations. If equity were the driving criterion then the

benchmark would be not just a world in which no climate change policy is undertaken,

but a world in which none is needed because there haven’t been any greenhouse gas




                                                                                            46
emissions in the first place.17 The importance stems, rather, from the game theory

considerations: any country that bears especially high costs for continuing to participate

is likely to drop out. But the high-cost countries are the same as those that lose rather than

gain from free riding on the coalition.     In Table 4b, the costs borne by the three highest

country/regions – MENA, TE, and China – are in each case below 1 per cent of GDP, the

Y=1 % threshold for every region.



        The economic losses in Figures 8a and 8b were measured according to the Nash

criterion as well. That is, the bar charts show the costs to each country, considered one at

a time, to staying in the agreement, relative to a strategy of dropping out under the

assumption that others continue to abide by the agreement. As already noted, every

country in every period shows an economic cost from participating that is less than 5

percent. Thus we have succeeded in meeting the X = 5% threshold.            Figure 9

summarizes the economic costs of participation for each country or region, under the

Nash criterion. For each, the first bar shows the present discounted value. For all 12

regions the cost is below 1 per cent. To recall a lesson of Figure 2b, the regime could

probably survive the defection of MENA (and also TE), but it is much less likely that it

could survive the defection of China. For each region the second bar shows the

economic loss in whatever period that loss is highest. TE is the highest, almost reaching

the threshold value of 5 per cent of income. Next come China and Korea-South Africa-

Australia. The finding that costs are able to stay under the thresholds is gratifying.



17
   Viewed from this perspective, places such as India and Africa could sue countries such Saudi
Arabia and the United States for the damage that their cumulative past emissions are inflicting on
climate-sensitive tropical regions.

atmosphere is projected to reach 500 ppm in the late years of the century. Figure 10

7.     Seeking more ambitious concentration targets: 450 ppm or better


       The concentrations goal that is attained by the emissions path specified above,

500 ppm CO2, is nowhere near sufficient to accomplish the environmental goals that

leaders seek. As we have seen, it is estimated to reduce average temperature from a 4

degree increase above pre-industrial levels to 3 degrees. But leaders have supposedly

agreed to a target of 2 degrees. We conclude the study by reporting on our most recent

explorations of more ambitious environmental goals.

       Several of the countries reported more than one possible emissions target under

the Copenhagen Accord and Cancun Agreements, in some cases conditioned on what

other countries did, as Table 1 reports. The EU, for example, has since 2009 said that it

was prepared to achieve a target of emissions 20 per cent below 1990 levels by 2020 if

there were no comprehensive international agreement, but 30 per cent below if there was

such an agreement. Accordingly we adopt the more aggressive national targets as the

starting point for this exercise. Table 5 in Appendix 1 reports these targets for 2020 and

2050, aggregated into the 12 regions that we need for our model. The target here is on all

emissions now, including land use emissions and other gasses. We include abatement

options in other gasses and avoided deforestation (though not afforestation), consistent

with the REDD initiative. As in the previous experiment, the data in the following also

include bioenergy with CCS, unless otherwise specified. Other modifications in order to

move the targets in a more ambitious direction are reported in Table 5 in Appendix 1.

       Figure 12 illustrates the global GHG emissions targets that result from the more

ambitious parameter choices. (It and the other graphs described in this section appear in



                                                                                           50
Appendix 1.) Emissions of all gases aggregated together do not achieve the Bali

objective of halving by 2050 (unless one is measuring relative to BAU). But they do fall

to 20 Gt by the end of the century, which is less than half the 2010 level and one fifth the

BAU level.

       Next, Figure 13 shows the targets for OECD countries. The path of the assigned

amounts is not very different from the less ambitious case. Either way, they decline

sharply from 2020 to 2050. The big difference is that actual emissions are substantially

lower: by 2035 aggregate emissions have declined below 10 Gt, whereas in Figure 3

emissions (of CO2) had barely begun to decline at all. This is because the rich countries

now find it far more difficult to buy permits as easily, because the poor countries have

fewer to sell. Figure 14 shows the more ambitious targets for developing countries.

Assigned amounts now peak as early as 2025. Actual emissions begin to decline from

the beginning, as the poor countries sell permits to the rich. But the graph confirms that

permit sales are quite small, because assigned amounts are pushed below 30 Gt as early

as 2030, so that there are indeed few extra permits to spare.

       The bars in Figure 15 show per capita emissions by each region in each period

under the more aggressive targets. Some high emitters like the United States and

Australia show targets that are already by 2015 about 1 ton lower per capita than in the

450ppm case. China peaks at 2 tons per capita in 2020 and India never gets much above

½ ton. Convergence toward a common low target toward the end of the century is

smoother than before.


       Turning to the economic effects of these targets, Figure 16a shows the shadow

price of a ton of CO2 rising almost to $500 a ton and the price of a gallon of gas rising



                                                                                            51
almost to $4.5 a gallon, respectively – twice as high as when the environmental goal was

less ambitious (Figure 6).


       Figure 16b illustrates the aggregate global costs. The present discounted value

now stands at about 2 per cent of income: 1.6% if BECCS is allowed and 2.1% if it is not.

       Table 6 reports the present discounted value of economic costs for each region

where the alternative of dropping out is defined by the BAU criterion. Economic costs

are higher for everyone -- three times the costs of the 450ppm goal in the case of TE,

Latin America, and China.


       Figure 17 summarizes the economic costs of participation for each country or

region measured with respect to the no policy baseline. For each, the first bar shows the

present discounted value and the second bar shows the economic loss in whatever period

that loss is highest. That costs are very high for the oil producing countries is perhaps not

ultimately fatal, because we have argued that the regime could probably survive their

non-participation. It may be more worrisome that costs for the big three -- the US, China

and India – are above the threshold at least in terms of present discounted value (1%)

and, for China, also above the threshold of the highest cost in any single year (5%).



       One way to give perspective to the estimated costs of climate change mitigation is

to express them in terms of delay to economic growth. To attain the environmental goal

of 500 ppm, global income at the end of the century is two years behind what it would be

under BAU. To attain 440 ppm, income in 2100 is four years behind.




                                                                                          52
       The environmental consequences of the more aggressive emissions path are also

shown in Appendix 1. Figure 18b continues to report concentrations in terms of carbon

dioxide alone, for purposes of comparison with the preceding results. Concentrations

toward the end of the century level off below 450ppm of CO2, as compared to 500 ppm

and rising in the less aggressive case, or shooting through 700 ppm under BAU. Now

that we are including other modes of mitigation, Figure 18a reports concentrations in

terms of all greenhouse gases. Mitigation is seen to cut total emissions by almost half

(from a BAU level that measures almost 1000 ppm in GHGs). Finally, Figure 19

reports the effect on temperature, which is now substantial: the rise above pre-industrial

levels is only 2.3 degrees Celsius, as opposed to about 3 in the less aggressive case or 4 in

BAU (or as compared to about 1 degree so far, as of 2011).




8. Concluding perspective



       Section 7 put the estimated global cost of attaining an environmental outcome

corresponding to 2.3 degrees centigrade of global warming at about 2 per cent of income

under our formulas approach. One might wonder whether these estimated costs of

mitigation are justified by estimates of the avoided costs of environmental damage.

       Some economists attempt full cost-benefit analysis, to weigh economic costs of

climate change mitigation against estimates of the monetized benefits of climate change

mitigation, by means of integrated assessment models. Typical estimates of the

monetized costs of a concentrations path corresponding to a 4 degree increase in year-

2100 temperature (the BAU estimate), as compared to limiting the warming to 2 degrees,



                                                                                          53
are between 1 and 4 per cent of aggregate global income.18 This range, wide as it is, by

no means spans the range of estimates by reputable economists.19 Furthermore, many

impacts that might be associated with climate change have not yet been estimated. The

debate on how to evaluate the impact of extreme events is wide open.             Thus the

mitigation scenarios studied here could be either far too mild or far too aggressive. The

wide range of the damage estimates is one reason why we prefer to leave it to society to

make the tradeoff between economic cost and environmental damage and do not attempt

to do so ourselves.   Our focus is, rather, on how to design a framework under which

cooperation is as sustainable as possible, for any given level of environmental ambition.

       Some readers, especially those not familiar with the economic models of climate

change policy, may be surprised at the high estimated economic costs for hitting what

seem like moderate environmental goals. They can rest assured that the cost estimates of

the WITCH model allow for dynamic technology effects (hence “Induced Technical

Change” in the name) and tend to lie in the middle of the pack of leading economic

models (for example the 11 models compared in Clarke, et al, 2009).20



18
   At the lower end of this range, the 1% of income estimate comes from Tol (2002a,b).
He estimates the costs (monetized damages) of 4 degrees of global warming at
approximately 1 % of income if national costs are aggregated directly and 1 ½ % if they
are aggregated by population under an equity argument, as compared to costs of 2
degrees warming equal to 0 or ½ % of income, respectively. (See also Tol, 2005.) At
the higher end of this range, Nordhaus and Boyer (2000) estimate the costs of 4 degrees
of global warming at approximately 4 % of income if national damages are aggregated
directly and 5 % if they are aggregated by population, as compared to costs of 2 degrees
at about 1 % of income aggregated by either method. (See also Nordhaus, 1994, 2008.)
19
   Mendelsohn et al (1998) estimate much lower damages from global warming, as they
concentrate on agricultural impacts where adaptation would play a key role. Stern (2007,
2011) estimates much higher damages, attributable, in particular, to the assumption of a
low discount rate which gives weight to estimated damages very far into the future
20
   Tavoni and Tol (2010) argue that the standard models may underestimate the economic
costs of attaining the target of 2 degrees C.


                                                                                        54
       But of course nobody can be sure that the estimates in these models are correct.

Uncertainty regarding economic costs of mitigation is probably not as large as

uncertainty regarding the avoided costs of environmental damages.             Nevertheless,

economic costs may turn out to be either higher or lower than estimated in our model. In

future research we plan to explore the implications of uncertainty in technology,

economic growth, and the environment.         A central attraction of putting the formula

approach into effect would be that the parameters could readily be adjusted in future

budget periods, as more information becomes available. If technological innovations

occur that reduce the cost of hitting any given environmental goal, parameters and targets

can then be changed accordingly. The success of the international climate regime is

much less sensitive to the designer’s initial guess as to the appropriate endpoint than it is

to whether the designer takes care not to impose unreasonable costs on any critical

country, so that the agreement is comprehensive and credible.
