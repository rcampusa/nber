                                         ABSTRACT

We decompose the response of aggregate consumption to monetary policy shocks into
contributions by households at different stages of the life cycle. This decomposition finds that
older households have a higher consumption response than younger households. Amongst older
households, the consumption response is also increasing in income. This, along with data on age-
related net wealth, presents evidence for a wealth effect playing a role in driving the response
patterns. This mechanism is studied further in a partial-equilibrium life-cycle model of
consumption, saving, and labor-supply decisions. The model qualitatively explains the empirical
patterns. Understanding the heterogeneity in consumption responses across age groups is
important for understanding the transmission of monetary policy, especially as the U.S.
population grows older.

1      Introduction
This paper studies how consumption expenditures of different age groups respond to monetary
policy shocks. We decompose the response of aggregate consumption to monetary policy shocks
into contributions from households at different stages of the life cycle. Empirically, we find that
monetary policy shocks have a larger impact on consumption expenditures of older households.
Aggregate consumption responses to monetary policy shocks of older households also increases
with income. The data show that older households have higher net-wealth than younger house-
holds. Since income is also correlated with wealth, this evidence points to a wealth-effect in
driving the differential consumption response patterns. To better understand the mechanism
that underlies these empirical patterns, we study a partial-equilibrium life-cycle model of con-
sumption, saving, and labor-supply decisions. The model endogenously produces age-related
consumption response heterogeneity to interest rate shocks in a manner that is largely consistent
with the data.

    Two motivations drive our inquiry. First, since consumption is the largest component of
GDP, a better understanding of age related heterogeneity in consumption responses to monetary
policy shocks can improve our knowledge of the aggregate transmission channel and about those
population segments most impacted by monetary policy. The second motivation is the rapid
aging of the population, currently underway in the U.S. and other developed economies. As
seen in Figure 1, the ratio of the U.S. population over 65 to those between 25 and 64 is, in
demographic time, rapidly increasing. The ratio, which had been fairly steady around 0.2 from
1980 to 2010, is projected to double by 2050 as post-war baby boomers age into retirement.

                                                                      2
Age-related heterogeneity in consumption responses could potentially alter the effectiveness of
monetary policy as the population ages.
      In the paper, Section 2 gives an overview of the data and Section 3 reports the main empirical
analyses. We employ impulse responses from structural vector autoregressions (VARs) and from
local projections (Jord`
                       a (2005)). Using consumption data from the U.S. Consumer Expenditure
Survey (CEX), we classify households into young (household head aged 25-34), middle (35-64),
and old (65+), and study how aggregate within-group consumption responds to four alterna-
tive monetary policy shocks. The U.S. monetary policy shocks were identified and constructed
by other researchers. Three of the policy shocks were constructed using the high-frequency
identification methods of Barakchian and Crowe (2013), Gorodnichenko and Weber (2016), and
G¨
 urkaynak et al. (2005). The fourth uses the narrative/Greenbook methodology of Romer and
Romer (2004).1 Our general finding across two empirical methods and four identified shock se-
ries is that old households have the highest proportionate consumption response to monetary
policy shocks. Young household consumption appears to be more responsive than middle-aged
households, but the evidence here is less definitive.
      Section 4 studies the data further in order to understand the economic mechanism that
underlies these data patterns. We conjecture four potential life-cycle related effects. First, older
households tend to be wealthier than younger households, so a given decline in the interest rate
generates a larger capital gain for the old. Second, older households may be more sensitive to
interest rate changes due to the composition of their portfolios. Using data from the Survey
of Consumer Finances (SCF), we show that the composition of wealth for older households is
tilted towards long-term assets (home equity, bond retirement funds, and equities) whose value
is more interest-rate sensitive than short-term assets. Third, younger households tend to finance
consumption with labor income. They can adjust their labor supply and substitute leisure for
consumption in response to monetary policy shocks. Their consumption will be less interest-rate
sensitive than older (and retired) households who do not have a labor supply margin and rely on
assets whose value are interest-rate sensitive to pay for consumption. Fourth, older households
discount the future more heavily on account of a higher probability of death. This, combined
with shorter planning horizons, makes monetary policy shocks feel more permanent for the older
households, and induces additional interest-rate sensitivity into their consumption. Empirically,
we explore the wealth mechanism by employing household income as a proxy for wealth. When

policy shocks.

we estimate the structural VARs and local projections for consumption on households classified
by income and by age, we observe the highest consumption responses to monetary policy shocks
to be by the old high income group.
   Our focus is on measuring the aggregate within-age group consumption response because this
directly translates into understanding the effects of monetary policy shocks on the aggregate
economy. We want to underscore that our aggregative empirical approach is fundamentally
different from analyses of the average household response undertaken by research such as Cloyne
et al. (2018) and Wong (2018). In Section 5, we contrast these two approaches and discuss
how estimated aggregate effects and average household effects can diverge. Wong (2018), for
example, obtains a high average response by young households and a low average response by
older households. She uses this evidence to motivate the importance of housing in monetary
policy transmission. Our own average household response estimates continue to show the old
to have the highest responsiveness. We also estimate the average response by the young to be
higher than the aggregate young response. If responsiveness is not symmetrically distributed
across households, there is no reason for the average and the aggregate estimates to coincide.
We show how, if negative policy shocks induce a relatively small number of high-consumption
households, within an age group, to increase consumption while the relatively large number
of low-consumption households are unresponsive or reduce consumption, the impact on total
consumption growth will be larger than the average household effect.
   Drawing on our empirical evidence on wealth effects, Section 6 undertakes a complementary
analysis for how age and wealth heterogeneity can drive these consumption response patterns
using a life-cycle model of consumption, saving, and labor-supply decisions. Preferences in the
model are given by Epstein and Zin (1989)­Weil (1989) recursive utility. Finitely-lived people
work and earn labor income from ages 25 to 64. From age 65 to (at most) 86, they live on pension
income and accumulated assets. Both labor and retirement income are subject to idiosyncratic
uncertainty, as is the time of death, which gives people both a precautionary and a retirement,
or life-cycle, motive to save. People can borrow or lend during their working years by taking
short or long positions in a long-term asset but are not allowed to die with negative net worth.
We adopt a long-term asset to be consistent with actual household net wealth patterns, which
are weighted toward long-term assets. Consumption impulse responses to interest rate shocks in
the model qualitatively match the age-related pattern of responses in the data ­ notably, older
households have the largest consumption responses.
   Section 7 concludes the paper. The appendix describes the construction of our micro and

macro data sets, additional robustness analyses, and additional information about the model.
       Our paper is part of the growing interest in the macroeconomic implications of agent hetero-
geneity. Studies of monetary policy transmission with heterogeneity include Gornemann et al.
(2012), McKay et al. (2016), and Luetticke (2016). Coibion et al. (2017) studies how mone-
tary policy shocks affect inequality in the United States while Bunn et al. (2018) do so for the
United Kingdom. Leahy and Thapar (2019) find that personal income and employment is less
responsive to monetary policy shocks in U.S. states with higher percentages of young people. Fu-
jiwara and Teranishi (2007) embed life-cycle behavior in a New Keynesian model, and, similarly,
Bielecki et al. (2018) consider how demographic change affects the interest rate within a New-
Keynesian model of monetary policy. Also, Doepke and Schneider (2006) find large responses
by older households, although their focus is primarily on inflationary episodes as opposed to the
identified monetary policy shocks studied in more recent papers.
       Research that examines the role of wealth effects for monetary policy include Krueger and
Perri (2006), who study the effects on consumption volatility in Italian and U.S. data, Sterk and
Tenreyro (2018), who focus on the inflationary consequences of monetary policy for wealth and
spending on durables, Glover et al. (2017), who discusses how changes in asset prices during the
last recession disproportionately impacted older households, and Auclert (2019), who stresses
heterogeneity in the duration of an agents net worth (among other channels). Also, Storesletten
et al. (2007) consider idiosyncratic shocks in a life-cycle model, but their focus is on explaining
the equity premium puzzle.
       Several recent papers research the transmission of monetary policy to consumption through
its impact on mortgage finance.2 Cloyne et al. (2018) study the average effect of monetary policy
shocks on non-durable consumption across households with different home ownership categories
and find a higher response by renters and those with outstanding mortgages, who tend to be
younger than home-owners without mortgages. Di Maggio et al. (2014) study how households of
different income levels respond to reductions in mortgage interest payments, while Wong (2018)
and Eichenbaum et al. (2018) study how expansionary monetary policy shocks, working through
mortgage refinance, changes consumption for younger households.
   2
    Relatedly, Mian and Sufi (2009), Mian and Sufi (2011), and Mian et al. (2013) stress that changes in housing
wealth affect household consumption. Although, Guren et al. (2018) and Guren et al. (2019) argue that housing
wealth effects may be moderate in size. The mechanism that we put forth stresses wealth effects across a broad
range of assets.

2         The Data
This section describes the data used in our main empirical analysis where we estimate the
within-age group aggregate consumption response to unanticipated monetary policy shocks. The
consumption data is described in Section 2.1 and the monetary policy shocks are discussed in
Section 2.2.


2.1        Consumption Expenditures
The household consumption expenditure data comes from interview samples of the U.S. Con-
sumer Expenditure Survey (CEX), spanning from 1984Q1 to 2007Q4.3 We collect quarterly
household consumption expenditures on 19 broad categories. We deflate these expenditures by
the corresponding categorical price indices from the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to convert into
real terms. We follow Krueger and Perri (2006) in matching categories between the CEX and
CPI. Aggregating over the 19 real expenditure components within each household gives our mea-
sure of total real consumption by household. The age of the household head is used to classify
households into young (25-34), middle (35-64), and old (65+) age groups. Our rationale for these
age categories is as follows. The 25-34 age group encompasses most first-time home buyers, when
long-term asset accumulation generally begins, while people 65 and older are usually retired.
        To obtain real per capita household consumption, we divide total real household consumption
by the number of household members. The data is not seasonally adjusted so we include seasonal
dummy variables in all of the regressions. We do not employ the CEX provided weights because
Dynan (2009) (among others) warns that the CEX weights are not justifiable when observations
are grouped by demographic characteristics. Appendix A gives a detailed description of the
construction of the consumption data. The appendix also reports many additional computations,
including showing that our results are robust to the application of the CEX weights.



2.2        Monetary Policy Shocks
We consider four alternative measures of identified U.S. monetary policy shocks. These shocks
are not our own, but were constructed by other researchers. Using different methodologies and

monetary policy in the U.S. resulting from the global financial crisis.

underlying data, the creators sought to identify the portion of changes to the federal funds
rate that are both unanticipated and exogenous to current economic conditions. The original
monetary policy shock series are monthly. To match the sampling frequency of our consumption
data, we cumulate these monthly observations to a quarterly frequency.
      The first measure we consider comes from Barakchian and Crowe (2013) who employ a high
frequency identification (HFI) method. Their signal of the policy stance is the term-structure of
the federal funds futures contracts for the current month and at 1 through 5 months ahead. The
information in the 6 contract horizons is represented by a factor model, and the policy shock is
the change in the first factor on the day of an announcement following a Federal Open Market
Committee (FOMC) meeting. The change in the factor is intended to capture the unexpected
change in the term-structure of federal funds futures prices induced by policy surprises. Their
series begins in 1988Q4 with the establishment of federal funds futures at the Chicago Board of
Trade. We refer to this term-structure based shock series as HFI-TRM.
      The second monetary policy shock series is the instrument employed in Gertler and Karadi
(2015), which they call FF4. They employ the HFI approach of G¨
                                                              urkaynak et al. (2005) and use
the change in the three-month ahead federal funds futures price within a 30 minute window of an
FOMC announcement. The idea of the short window is to capture that part of the futures price
response only to FOMC announcements and not to other news. We refer to this shock series as
HFI-3MO.4
      Our third shock series combines G¨
                                       urkaynak et al. (2005) from 1990 through 1993, and the
monetary policy surprises from Gorodnichenko and Weber (2016) (online appendix Table 16)
from 1994 through 2007. Their shock is based on the change in current month federal funds
futures within a 60 minute window around FOMC announcements. We label this shock HFI-
CMO.5
      The fourth shock series is constructed following the approach in Romer and Romer (2004).
They first draw on narrative accounts from FOMC meetings to create the intended federal funds
rate. Then to control for anticipated movements in the federal funds rate, they regress the
change in the intended federal funds rate on unemployment, Greenbook estimates of past and
future inflation and real output, and revisions in these forecasts. The shock is then the residual
series, which is argued to be exogenous to current economic conditions and free from anticipatory

and we refer to the narrative/Greenbook series as NAR-GBK. Their series starts in 1969, but
we begin with 1984Q2 to coincide with the beginning of our CEX consumption growth series.

Notes: In Panel C, Newey-West t-ratios are in parentheses. The Wald test is for joint significance of the 4-lag coefficients. The
starting dates for the series are: 1988Q4 for HFI-TRM, 1990Q1 for HFI-3MO, 1990Q1 for HFI-CMO, and 1984Q2 for NAR-GBK.
The ending dates are 2007Q4.



    Table 1 reports basic features of the four shock series through 2007Q4. Panel A shows that
the shock means are insignificantly different from zero. Also, the standard deviations reveal
that the NAR-GBK shocks are about twice the size of the HFI shocks. As one might expect,
Panel B shows that HFI-3MO and HFI-CMO are highly correlated with each other. However, the
generally low pair-wise correlations with the other shocks points to heterogeneity of information
content across the alternative shocks.
    Truly exogenous monetary policy shocks should be serially uncorrelated. To check this,
Panel C shows fitted fourth-order autoregressions for each of the shocks. The HFI-TRM and


                                                               8
HFI-CMO shocks come closest to satisfying this criteria, as the Wald test for joint significance
of lagged coefficients are insignificant for these shocks, while significant for HFI-3MO and NAR-
GBK. Although the autoregressions display some evidence against exogeneity for these latter
two shock series, we proceed by imposing the assumption of exogeneity in the empirical work.
        To facilitate comparisons of the consumption responses across the alternative monetary pol-
icy shock series, we normalize each shock to have the same standard deviation, 0.88 percent per
annum, as quarterly changes in the real federal funds rate. Hence, the response to a one stan-
dard deviation innovation in the monetary policy shock series is comparable to a one standard
deviation unanticipated change in the policy rate.


3         Empirical Results
This section presents our empirical methodology and reports the main estimation results. In
Subsection 3.1, we employ a structural vector autoregression (VAR) approach. In Subsection 3.2,
we use local projections as an alternative method. Subsection 3.3 reports the structural VAR and
local projection results for non-durable consumption instead of total consumption, which includes
expenditures on durables and non-durables. Across the four shocks, two estimation methods,
and many robustness checks, the weight of the evidence is that the highest consumption response
to monetary policy shocks is by older households. Additionally, the heterogeneity across age
groups is quantitatively large. The results of several additional robustness checks are reported
in Appendix B.


3.1        Structural Vector Autoregressions
The VARs are similar to those employed by Anderson et al. (2016) and Ramey (2011), who study
consumption responses to fiscal policy shocks. The three variables in the VAR are, (i) gc,j,t =
100 ln(cj,t ), the quarterly percentage growth rate of average real per capita consumption of age
group j = {young, middle, old} at time t, (ii) st , the monetary policy shock and (iii) rt , the real
federal funds rate.6 We estimate separate VARs for young (25-34), middle (35-64), and old (65+)
households. To avoid clutter in this exposition, we suppress the age group j subscript.
    6
    The nominal federal funds rate is deflated by the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) price index to
obtain the real federal funds rate. The nominal federal funds rate and the PCE come from the Federal Reserve
Bank of St. Louis FRED database.

      Consumption growth is allowed to respond to contemporaneous monetary policy shocks and
changes in the real federal funds rate. The real federal funds rate is affected by contemporaneous
policy shocks but not contemporaneous consumption growth. Because the monetary policy
shocks are exogenous, neither lags of the shock nor lags of other variables appear in the equation
for st . Suppressing the constants, we impose these conditions in the structural VAR as,

Due to the relatively short time-span of the data, imposing these theoretical restrictions lightens
the parameterization of the VAR and preserves degrees of freedom.7
      We estimate the VARs with k = 8 lags. Figure 2 shows impulse response functions (IRFs) of
cumulated consumption growth by age group to a negative (expansionary) one standard deviation
monetary policy shock. The horizontal axis measures time in quarters, up to five years after the
shock. The vertical axis measures the consumption response in percent. The response to the
HFI-TRM shock are shown in Panel A, to the HFI-3MO shock in Panel B, to the HFI-CMO
shock in Panel C, and to the NAR-GBK shock in Panel D. The shaded areas are plus and minus
one asymptotic standard error confidence bands, commonly used in monetary policy VARs (e.g.,
Romer and Romer (2004)).
  7
   After accounting for 8 start-up values, the HFI-TRM VAR has 69 quarterly observations, HFI-3MO has 64,
HFI-CMO has 64, and NAR-GBK has 87.

                                                                11
       Following an expansionary HFI-TRM shock, shown in Panel A, the largest consumption
response is by the old. Responses by the young and middle age groups are muted in comparison.
After about eight quarters, consumption for the old households has increased dramatically, and
the effect seems permanent.8 The peak consumption response for old households is about twice as
high as the peak for the middle-aged. As time passes, the impact on young households dissipates.
       The HFI-3MO monetary policy shock, shown in Panel B, also induces a striking contrast in
consumption responses across age groups. Here, the response for the young is generally negative.
Consumption by middle-aged households increases two to five quarters after the shock, but this
response is short-lived. Consumption for old households increases significantly and again appears
to be permanently impacted.
       An expansionary HFI-CMO shock, shown in Panel C, also leads to an apparent permanent
increase in consumption by old households. The shock induces a relatively large but temporary
increase in middle-aged consumption. Consumption of the young declines.
       The consumption responses to an expansionary NAR-GBK shock, shown in Panel D, are
relatively subdued compared to the responses to the other policy shocks. Young and middle
consumption display similarity in timing and magnitudes, both exhibiting modest decreases.
Old consumption also initially declines in response to the negative NAR-GBK shock, but then
the response gradually turns positive.
       To summarize, for each of the four monetary policy shocks, we uncover heterogeneity in
consumption responses across age groups with the old having the largest response. Figure 3 plots
old minus young and old minus middle impulse responses to draw out the comparison amongst
the age groups. The differences across age groups is also quantitatively large. Conditional on
the particular policy shock, the old clearly have the most positive response in consumption.
   8
    Romer and Romer (2004) and Coibion et al. (2017) also find persistence in the effects from monetary policy
shocks.

Changing Monetary Policy Effectiveness over Time. The heterogeneous consumption responses
across age groups suggest that the evolving demographic composition may increase the effective-
ness of monetary policy. To get a sense of the potential impact, we aggregate our age-specific
impulse responses and combine them with alternative demographic profiles to estimate policy
effectiveness at different points in time. Let cA be real per capita consumption and NA be the
number of people in the aggregate. Similarly, let cy , cm , co (Ny , Nm , No ) be consumption (num-
bers of) of young, middle, and old respectively. Then aggregate consumption is NA cA , and the
approximate relative change in this aggregate is

where estimates of the change in young, middle, and old household real per capita consumption

data (as in Figure 1). For the weights c

                                           ¯A , etc., we use average age-group consumption shares
of aggregate consumption. The exercise here holds the responses and the relative consumption of
each age group fixed, but varies the age-distribution (Ny , Nm , and No ) over time to isolate how
changes in the demographic composition impacts monetary policy effectiveness. We abstract
from changes in family size and composition within-age groups.
      We estimate the response of cumulated aggregate consumption growth to each of the four
monetary policy shocks using population weights in years 1990, 2010, and 2030. Figure 4 displays
the results. Panel A plots the difference in the responses to expansionary monetary policy shocks
between 2010 and 1990 and between 2030 and 1990. According to our results, population aging
from 1990 through 2030 increases monetary policy effectiveness.
      Panel B aggregates the flow consumption differences between 2010 and 1990 estimates and
between the 2030 and 1990 estimates over the five years after the shock.9 These figures highlight
how dramatically the age-distribution changes the likely effectiveness of monetary policy, espe-
cially for the HFI-TRM, HFI-3MO, and HFI-CMO shocks. The predicted demographic change
is estimated to generate as much as an additional 2.0 percent cumulated change in consumption
for a one standard deviation expansionary monetary policy shock in 2030 relative to 1990. While
population aging from 1990 through 2030 increases monetary policy effectiveness when measured
by the three `high-frequency' shocks, the differential consumption responses to the NAR-GBK

normalized such that one standard deviation changes in the series match a one standard deviation change in the real federal funds

measured in percent in Panels A and B. We estimate the consumption responses by age group to a monetary policy shock and hold
them fixed and then change demographics according to UN World Population Prospects 2017 Revision data. Panel A: Absolute
difference between responses in 2030 and 2010 relative to 1990. Panel B: Cumulated percent difference in total consumption in 2030

3.2      Local Projections
Using the structural VARs, we find monetary policy shocks to impart heterogeneous consumption
responses across households of different age groups. In this section, we examine the robustness


                                                               15

past real federal funds rate, and seasonal effects in the regressions. The local projections are the

subscript suppressed),

                                                                                7

where ct is average per capita consumption within an age group at time t, st is the identified
monetary policy shock, and rt is the real federal funds rate. To preserve degrees of freedom,
we control for past consumption growth at the yearly horizon instead of including 8 lags of
consumption growth.10
       The coefficient of interest is h , which measures the percent change in the consumption
response from time t to t + h due to the monetary policy shock at time t. To express the
response to an expansionary shock, Figure 5 displays plots of ­h with ±1 Newey and West
(1987) standard-error bands.
       The local projections exhibit consumption response heterogeneity by age group. The response
of the old to the HFI-3MO and HFI-CMO shocks are higher than for the younger age groups
over much of the following 20 quarters. The old also exhibit a higher consumption response to
the other two shocks relative to the middle-aged group. Although, the old consumption increases
only modestly for about two years after a NAR-GBK shock, the response then turns negative.
The middle group exhibits an initial positive response to the HFI-3MO, HFI-CMO, and NAR-
GBK shocks, but it quickly dies out. Looking across the panels, the responses by the young are
generally near zero and sometimes quite negative.
  10
     If the shocks st are truly exogenous, as pointed out by a referee, controlling for lagged consumption and the
real federal funds rate may not be necessary. In Appendix B, we show that our local projection results are robust
to omitting these controls.

      To summarize the local projections results, old consumption responds strongly positively to
the HFI-TRM and HFI-3MO expansionary monetary policy shocks and, within the first three
years after the shock, responds positively to the HFI-CMO shock. To draw out the differences
across age groups, Figure 6 plots the difference between the old and young response and the old
and middle response. Old consumption generally increases the most. The relative ranking of
consumption responses between young and middle households is less definitive.


3.3      Response of Non-Durable Consumption
The consumption data studied to this point includes durables, whose purchases may be debt
financed. Researchers and policy makers may also be interested in understanding patterns of
non-durable consumption. To examine this, and to verify that our results are not driven entirely
by durable expenditures, this subsection examines the non-durable consumption responses across
age groups to monetary policy shocks. Our measure of what constitutes non-durable expenditures
follows Krueger and Perri (2006).11
      Figure 7 shows cumulated non-durable consumption growth responses from the structural
VAR. As can be seen, both the response patterns and the magnitudes are similar to the total
consumption responses displayed in Figure 2. In general, the size ordering of responses across
all four shocks is old > middle     young.
 11
   Real non-durable consumption expenditures is the sum of consumption components 1-13 given in the Ap-
pendix A Table A­1.

      Figure 8 shows the corresponding local projection results. Again, the responses to all four
shocks are similar. With the possible exception of the NAR-GBK shock, the response among the
old remains the greatest.
      To summarize, the qualitative and quantitative responses of non-durable consumption by age
group from the structural VARs and the local projections remain similar to the total consumption
responses. For both methods, the general finding is that the old exhibit the largest responses to
monetary policy shocks. Figure 9 displays the results in terms of the difference in consumption
responses between the old households and the younger groups. Based on these findings, the dif-
ferences across age groups do not appear to be driven primarily by the types of goods purchased.
Instead, the differences likely come from how consumers finance their consumption as they move
through the life-cycle.

Additional Robustness Checks. Appendix B reports the following additional robustness checks:

    1.   Classification of households into six age groups.
    2.   Response of durable goods expenditure.
    3.   Response of consumption less housing expenditure.
    4.   Application of CEX weights in age group consumption aggregation.
    5.   The VAR in levels.
    6.   The VAR with k = 6 lags.
    7.   Local projections without lagged consumption or the real federal funds rate.

      Throughout the many specifications using structural VARs and local projections and across
the four shocks, the message remains that aggregate consumption of the old households is the
most responsive to monetary policy shocks. We next document key income and wealth facts by
age group.


4        Income, Wealth, and Portfolio Composition by Age
Above, we report that consumption of the old is most responsive to monetary policy shocks. This
section examines the relation among income, wealth, portfolio composition, and age using data
from the 1989, 1998, and 2007 waves of the U.S. Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) to explore
potential mechanisms driving our empirical findings. The span of the sample approximately
overlaps the time coverage of our CEX sample.12
 12
      The 1989 SCF survey is the first that allows us to identify holdings in stock mutual funds and annuities.



                                                        23
    The picture that emerges from this analysis is that retired older households, who typically
live off of wealth rather than labor income, have portfolios whose value are tilted toward more
interest-sensitive long-term assets. This points to heterogeneity in wealth and labor-supply
across age groups as a potential mechanism driving the variation in consumption response. Old
households adjust to the monetary policy shock induced wealth shock primarily by adjusting
consumption whereas younger households can adjust both consumption and labor supply. Be-
cause old households have higher net wealth, they have higher exposure to the wealth shock
than younger households. Auclert (2019) also makes this point, theorizing that households fac-
ing greater unhedged interest rate exposure respond more to monetary policy shocks. These
differences combined with differences in marginal propensities to consume are his mechanism in
propagating monetary policy shocks.

Labor Income across Household Age. Figure 10 shows the median and mean wage income as a
share of total income by 5 year age groups. We are looking to see where in the life-cycle labor
income is replaced by other sources. Both the median and mean shares begin a rapid decline
around age 55. By age 65, the median share of labor income is zero while the mean share lies
in the 20 to 30 percent range, depending on the survey year. Retirement, whether voluntary
or involuntary, takes place for most people before age 65. The typical older household does not
receive much labor income and pays for consumption using other sources.

Net Wealth and Portfolio Composition by Household Age. Here, we examine net worth and the
composition of long versus short-term assets across households of different ages. For each sample
year and age group, we construct three measures of net asset positions.

   1. Net Worth is total assets as stated by the SCF minus total debts.

   2. Net Long Term 1, is the sum of net property equity (value of properties, including own
         residence, less outstanding debt on the properties), stock holdings, stock mutual funds, and
         annuities - a measure of long term, interest sensitive assets.

   3. Net Long Term 2 is Net Long Term 1 plus non-stock mutual funds (but not money market
         funds) plus directly held bonds of all types.

       Table 2 reports the age-group median Net Worth relative to the overall median, from which
we see net wealth increasing with age. Since older age groups hold more wealth, they have higher
exposure to valuation changes induced by monetary policy shocks.

Notes: Net Worth = total assets - total debts. The table reports median net worth by age and year divided by median net worth of
all households in that year. Data is from the Survey of Consumer Finances.



       Table 3 reports Net Long Term 1 and Net Long Term 2 as a fraction of Net Worth (the
median of the ratio across households) by age group and year. Households with higher fractions
of these measures have higher proportions of net wealth composed of long-term assets, and
therefore higher exposure to interest rate fluctuations. The table shows that the share of long-
term assets in net worth increases consistently with age. The largest component of net asset
holdings for each age group is in property equity.13 These data show that older households not
only have higher net wealth but also that they hold more interest-rate sensitive assets.
  13
    While this is an important component of long-term assets, we also find the same relationship of increasing
shares of average interest-sensitive asset holdings by age when property equity is excluded in Net Long Term 1
and Net Long Term 2 and Net Worth. We also find that the oldest age groups hold (marginally) more stocks as
a share of financial asset holdings than the younger cohorts. These results are available upon request.

Notes: The table reports Net Long Term 1 and Net Long Term 2 as a fraction of Net Worth (the median of the ratio across
households) by age group and year. Net Worth = total assets - total debts. Net Long Term 1 = Net property equity (value of
primary residence + other residential property - remaining mortgage and debt secured by primary and other residential property
+ net equity in non-residential real estate) + stocks + stock mutual funds + annuities. Net Long Term 2 = Net Long Term 1 +
non-stock mutual funds (bond and other mutual funds, not including money market funds) + directly held bonds. Data is from the
Survey of Consumer Finances.



                   We would like to estimate the VARs using consumption stratified by age and wealth (or a
measure of interest rate exposure). Unfortunately, the CEX data does not contain a wealth
measure suitable for such analysis. As an alternative, we classify households using income as
a proxy for wealth. We recognize that some people may object because doing so confounds
income and wealth effects, particularly for working-aged households. Additionally, the income
stratification can misclassify those hand-to-mouth working households who are also high wealth
(Kaplan et al. (2014)). Nevertheless, due to lack of access to time-series data on wealth that can

                   Some motivation for doing so is presented in Figure 11, which plots log net worth against log

                                                                                          26
income from the SCF in 1989, 1998, and 2007.14 The size of each bubble is the representative
SCF weight for that household. The vertical and horizontal axes are median log income and log
net worth. The correlations between the variables are 0.56 in 1989, 0.58 in 1998, and 0.60 in
2007.15
       Accordingly, to implement this investigation, we split households in each age group into high
and low income, based on whether their income is above or below the within-age group median
income. Figure 12 shows the cumulated high-minus-low income household consumption impulse
responses from the structural VAR by age group to an expansionary monetary shock. We see
definitive differences between high and low income consumption responses to the HFI-TRM and
NAR-GBK shocks for the old and a bit less so for the middle-aged. There is less separation for
the old and middle in response to the other two shocks. The young display little separation in
response to all of the shocks.

      We drop negative net worth observations. Due to the extreme wealth observations in the tails, we use logs
to visualize the relationships.
   15
      In line with these estimates, R´
                                     ios-Rull and Kuhn (2016) find that the correlation between wealth and income
is 0.58 in the 2013 SCF (see Table 19).

    Figure 13 shows the corresponding high-minus-low income household consumption responses
from local projections. The local projections yield more systematic separations between high
and low income households for the old across all four shocks, and little separation for middle and
young households.
    These IRFs may be consistent with a number of stories, but they are also consistent with the
idea that the young and middle-aged are relatively low net-wealth households whose consumption
is paid mostly with labor income. Hence, after an interest rate shock, consumption for younger
high and low income households react similarly. Conversely, income for old households is gener-
ated primarily from asset payoffs, such as interest and dividends, so the high (low) income old
are also high (low) net wealth households. The rich and poor spending patterns differ from each
other because the high (low) wealth households have more (less) valuation exposure to interest
rates.


5        Divergence between Aggregate and Average Responses
We have presented evidence using structural VARs and local projections that the aggregate within
age group consumption response is highest for older households. Wong (2018), on the other hand,
using micro-level regressions, reports that the highest average household consumption response
to monetary policy shocks is from young households. Both sets of results (aggregate and average
responses) can be true if the consumption distribution and the distribution of the strength of
response to monetary policy shocks are not symmetric.
    Here is a simple example to illustrate how the two measures can diverge. Let there be two
agents. Agent 1 consumes 99 and Agent 2 consumes 1. Aggregate consumption is 100 and
agents are the same age. Following a shock, Agent 1 consumes 94 and Agent 2 consumes 2.
The aggregate response is a 4 percent decline from 100 to 96. This is what we are after - the
aggregate response within an age group. The average response in growth rates, however, is about
a 47 percent increase (-5 percent for Agent 1, and +100 percent for Agent 2).
    Subsection 5.1 illustrates this point with a small Monte Carlo experiment. Subsection 5.2
compares estimated average and aggregate consumption responses. We emphasize though, that
the average effect is not central to our analysis, as we are interested in understanding the effect
of monetary policy on the aggregate economy which naturally means studying the aggregate
responses.

5.1       Monte Carlo Experiment
Log consumption for household i evolves according to

                                     ln (ci,t ) = ln (ci,t-1 ) + µi + i rt +   i,t ,                       (5)

                 iid
where      i,t    N (0,  2 ), rt is the real federal funds rate, and µi is the household-specific consump-
tion growth rate. The consumption response to the interest rate, i , also varies by household.
       The relationships amongst initial consumption, ci,0 , i ,, and µi are governed as follows. Let Xi
be a 3 by 1 zero-meaned normal random vector, Xi  N (, ). Then µi is normally distributed
and i and ci,0 are log-normally distributed, µi = Xi,1 , i = -eXi,2 , and ci,0 = eXi,3 , where the
dependence among the three variables is specified in . This ensures that realizations of i are
all non-positive and for ci,0 , all non-negative.
       The size of the shock set for equation (5) was drawn from the data. The mean vector  and
covariance matrix  of the normal distribution were set to match characteristics we found in the
data. Values were set to directly target the average household consumption growth, µ, and the
mean and variance of log consumption, ln(ci,0 ), in 1986.16
       Our analysis of high and low income households revealed additional patterns in the data,
which we seek to capture in the simulations. Consumption growth for low-income young tends
to be higher than for the high-income young, while the opposite is true of the old. Hence, we
specify a small negative correlation between young-household consumption growth µ and initial
consumption, where high consumption presumably means high income, and a slightly larger
but positive correlation for old households. We also found, in Section 4, that consumption of
high-income old is more responsive than low-income old. The data is less definitive for the
young, but we make a tentative argument that consumption of the high-income young is less
responsive to monetary policy shocks than for the low-income young. Thus, we specify a positive
correlation between initial consumption and responsiveness ( is always negative) for the young,
and a negative correlation for the old. Table 4 shows the implied moments for household specific
growth, responsiveness to interest rate shocks, and initial consumption.

    This is the first year of usable observations in our VAR and Local Projections. The first two years are not
used because of our use of 8 lags.

   The experiments each are 5,000 replications of 725 households with time-series length of 128,
to approximately match the time-series observations in our macro analysis.
   We estimate a panel regression with fixed effects,

                                  100 ln (ci,t ) = ai + i rt +   i,t


                                                                       725
5,000 times. Also, we aggregate consumption (in levels) Ct =           i=1 ci,t   and estimate the aggregate
time-series version of the regression

                                   100 ln (Ct ) = a + rt +       t



5,000 times. Figure 14 shows the results.
   Panel A shows the scatter plot between i and ci,0 and kernel densities of the fixed-effects
estimate of the average household response and the aggregate time-series estimators for the
experiment on the young. The mean of the aggregate time-series response is -0.02, whose
magnitude is smaller than the -0.05 mean of the average household response estimator. In
Panel B, which shows results from the experiment for the old, we have a mean aggregate response
of -0.10 and a mean average response of -0.03. Thus, the monte carlo exercise demonstrates
how the average (micro-level) impulse response can differ from the aggregate response.

Appendix C provides the details about the construction of the micro data set.
   Here, st is the monetary policy shock at time t. The vector Xi,t includes time varying
household-level controls: changes in marital status of the household head (indicators capturing

the household head (indicators capturing not employed to employed, employed to not employed,
or no change), changes in household size, household size, changes in the number of persons 18
or younger in the household, and the number of persons 18 or younger. The vector Zi includes
time-invariant household controls: a household specific fixed effect (to control for any omitted
household factors) and the birth year of the household head (to control for cohort effects). A set
of quarterly indicators to control for seasonality is captured by Q,t .

       We suppress reporting results for middle-aged households, since the interesting contrasts are
between the old and the young. Panel A in Table 5 shows the cumulated responses over eight
quarters from estimating equation (6). We report cumulated responses over eight quarters in the
spirit of Wong (2018), but we note that our peak consumption responses in our structural VARs
and local projections occur beyond two years. Household observations are weighted by the CEX
supplied weights.17 Point estimates show old household consumption expands in response to each
of the four expansionary monetary shocks. Average young household consumption is estimated
to contract with HFI-TRM shocks. The average young are estimated to respond positively to
expansions from the other three shocks, but by less than the old.
  17
    The results are qualitatively unchanged if the CEX weights are omitted. If we instead weight by household
consumption, then the old become even more responsive relative to the young.

where Ct is aggregate consumption of a particular age group (young, middle, or old). Note that
Ct is not the same measure of aggregate consumption used in the structural VARs and local
projections. As explained in Appendix C, a large number of households must be dropped for
this analysis, which are not dropped in the structural VAR and local projections analysis.
    Equation 7 is estimated separately for each age group. The point estimates consistently show
that the aggregate young household responses go in the `wrong' direction following a monetary
policy shock. The point estimates of the aggregate old household responses are consistently
expansionary following expansionary shocks, as we found with the structural VARs and local
projections. The aggregate response to monetary policy shocks is driven by older households.
    As with the monte carlo experiment, the data reveals that the average response across house-
holds in an age group can differ from the aggregate response for that age group, in both size and
sign. This empirical finding is consistent with our hypothesis that households living primarily
off of their (high) wealth (who tend to be old households) are most responsive to interest rate
changes. We next study this theory further by embedding it in a life-cycle model.


6     Wealth-Effects and Consumption Heterogeneity in a
      Life-Cycle Model
This section presents an overlapping generations model of finitely-lived households to illustrate
how heterogeneity in net wealth, labor-supply choices, planning horizons, and discounting of the
future might explain the observed consumption dynamics across age groups. The model agents
save by accumulating long-term bonds both for retirement and to hedge against idiosyncratic
income shocks. Preferences are given by Epstein and Zin (1989)­Weil (1989) recursive utility.
Younger agents can supply labor while older agents are retired and survive on pension and asset
payoffs. With these key ingredients, the model can replicate the higher consumption response
among the old households and other features of the empirical impulse response functions reported




                                               35
above. The model does not include liquidity or financial constraints.18
       Once retired, model agents face an uncertain death and live a maximum of 86 years (344
quarters or periods in the model). People begin making economic decisions when they are 25
years old and enter economic life with no assets. At each point in time, 248 different decision
making cohorts are alive at different stages of the life cycle.
       We categorize people into the same three age groups as in the empirical section. Young
(25-34 years) and middle (35-64 years) aged people receive exogenous, risky labor income (W )
and decide their labor supply (L), consumption (C ), and net asset positions (A). Working age
households can borrow, but households are not allowed to die in debt. When people turn 65,
they retire, face uncertain death, and live off of reduced pension income (S ) and accumulated
assets. Retirees also have a bequest motive.19 To conform with the long-term interest-sensitive
assets that dominate household portfolios (as seen in the previous section), the long-term asset
in the model is a consol bond. We begin with a description of the exogenous income process.


6.1        The Income Process
We adopt the permanent-transitory income component model employed by Choi et al. (2017),
who in turn draw upon Zeldes (1989), Carroll (1992), and Carroll (1997). Let there be N
individuals per cohort. In each quarterly time period t, living cohorts are indexed by z  [1, 248] .
Cohort z = 1 begins economic life as a 25 year old household, cohort z  = 161 are newly retired,
and cohort z = 248 are in the last possible quarter of life.
       The characteristics of the income process differ across each of the age groups. Working age
household i of cohort z < z  draws labor income (Wi,z,t ) and each retiree (z  z  ) draws pension
income (Si,z,t ). Both labor and retirement income have a permanent component (Yi,z,t ) and a
transitory component (eui,z,t ). The idea behind subjecting retiree pensions to permanent income
risk is to capture events such as bad health shocks that generate large out-of-pocket medical
expenses, while recognizing that these are not utility enhancing consumption expenditures.
       The transitory income shock ui,z,t , is drawn from a mixture of a normal distribution and a
  18
       Others (e.g., Parker et al. (2013)) have argued that such frictions matter for the consumption responses by
age.
  19
   We do not explicitly link cohorts; upon death, the bequests simply disappear and are not distributed to
younger agents.

of distributions is frequently employed to model the empirical features of income data which is
approximately log-normally distributed except for a concentration of observations at the lower
tail. Recalling that cohort z  has just retired, the labor income for people in their working years
is
                                      Wi,z,t = Yi,z,t eui,z,t for z < z                                       (9)

and pension income for retired cohorts is

                                                      Yi,z,t      z = z

     During the working years, wage growth is driven in part by a common secular component,
whose gross growth rate is Mg , and also by the individual's movement along the age-earnings
profile. The gross growth rate along this profile at cohort z is Gz . In retirement, both Mg and
Gz become 1.

Note that in the retirement period, the household receives prr with certainty, after which income
resumes its risky evolution.

Estimates of the income process. We estimate the income process from biennial waves of the
Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). We select data between 1986 and 2007 to align with
the span of our CEX sample. We use the same definition of household income in the PSID as
Blundell et al. (2008) and Storesletten et al. (2007). Our estimation method follows Choi et al.
(2017), who build on Zeldes (1989), Carroll (1992), and Carroll (1997).

                                                       37
    From the raw income data, we first remove the aggregate time trend, predictable life-cycle or
occupation dependent fluctuations, and household fixed effects. The remaining variation is used
to estimate the parameters (n , u , p) separately for young, middle, and old households. The
gross secular growth rate of household income Mg is given by average real income growth across
households over the entire sample period. We estimate the age-income profile Gz using variation
in income by age. The age-income profile is assumed to be constant over time.

    Table 6 reports the estimated parameters for the income process. The data allow direct
estimation of the age-income profile for household heads aged 25-60. Given these estimates, we
`forecast' values for ages 61-64 with a cubic trend regression. As seen from the table, income


                                                                  38
peaks at age 51 and macroeconomic income growth is virtually nil, with an annual growth rate
of 60 basis points.
       Panel C shows the remaining parameters (p, u , n ), estimated separately for young, middle,
and old age groups. There are modest differences across age groups. The old are most likely to
experience a near zero income event with p = 0.31, whereas volatility of permanent income is
highest for the young, with n = 0.14.
       Heathcote et al. (2010) (pages 698, 699) obtain estimates of the standard deviations for the
transitory and permanent components of wages (not household income) that are very similar to
ours. So, the distinction between labor wages and total income may not matter substantially
for prime age workers (as is also suggested by the empirical work above). Overall, the shape
of the resulting life-cycle income process is in line with other recent estimates in the litera-
ture (see Guvenen et al. (2015) and Guvenen et al. (2018), for example) based on alternative
methodologies.


6.2       Preferences and Budget Constraints
Households have recursive, non-expected utility, following Epstein and Zin (1989) and Weil
(1989). Let Ci,z,t denote consumption of household i, with cohort z , at time t. Labor supply is
Li,z,t and, normalizing the time endowment to 1, leisure is (1 - Li,z,t ) .
       Working age household z < z  utility is,
                                                                                                 1
                                                                                       (1-)    (1-)

intertemporal elasticity of substitution.
       Households face idiosyncratic income risk and live in an incomplete markets environment.
Neither contingent claims nor insurance instruments are available.20 The non-human asset is a
non-state contingent long-term (consol) bond, that pays one unit of consumption each period
forever. The intent is for the long-term bond to mimic interest-rate sensitivity of home equity,
which forms a major part of the typical U.S. household's portfolio, without modeling specific
frictions (e.g., lumpiness, down payments, mortgage refinance, housing services in utility) asso-
  20
    Our estimation of income shocks in the data was net of all transfers and thus corresponds to the notion of
uninsurable risk in the model.



                                                            39
ciated with housing. Additionally, our previous analysis of the SCF data revealed that older
households hold many other long-term and interest-rate-sensitive financial instruments.
       A working-aged household can borrow or lend by going short or long the bond.21 The net
number of bonds held by the household is Ai,z,t . Upon retirement, households face a possibility
of death and must have non-negative assets in retirement to ensure that they do not die in debt.
A borrower, Ai,z,t < 0, pays one unit of consumption per bond while a saver receives one unit
of consumption per bond. The price of the bond is the inverse of the interest rate, Pta = 1/rt .
Current wealth for working-aged households consists of the net bond coupon (Ai,z,t ) plus the
market value of the bonds plus labor income less consumption. Their budget constraints are

                           Pta Ai,z+1,t+1 = Ai,z,t + Pta Ai,z,t + Li,z,t Wi,z,t - Ci,z,t ,                     (13)

which can be written in a more familiar form,

                            Ai,z+1,t+1 = Ai,z,t + rt (Ai,z,t + Li,z,t Wi,z,t - Ci,z,t ) .                      (14)

       Retired households have a bequest motive, supply no labor and face an uncertain death where
the cohort z specific probability of surviving to age z +1 is z,t . Following Gomes and Michaelides
(2005), we model the bequest motive of retirees as,

                                                                         1-
                                          1           1 Ai,z+1,t+1
                                            Et                                .
                                         1-           b     rt

Hence, utility for retired households, aged z   z < Z = 248, is
                                                                                                                      1

with Ai,z,t  0.


6.3       Solution and Parameterization
To solve the model, we discretize the state space and obtain policy functions for the stationary
model where variables are normalized by permanent income. The household's problem is solved
by working backwards from the last period of life. The implied level (un-normalized) values
are then obtained by multiplying by permanent income. Appendix D describes the stationary
transformation.
       An exogenous short-term interest rate, independent of household income, follows an AR(1)
process which we estimate from the data on the real federal funds rate and discretize following
Tauchen and Hussey (1991). We obtain the long-term interest rate from the short rate using
the expectations theory of the term structure with two modifications. Because the consol rate
implied by the expectations theory is constant, our first modification is to approximate the consol
rate with the implied 10 year yield. Second, because the expectations theory generates a flat
yield curve, we add a term premium of 1.309 percent, which is the average 10 year term premium
found in the data from 1990 to 2007. With 5 states for the interest rate, the long-term rate can
take values of 3.08, 3.27, 3.44, 3.61, and 3.78 percent per annum.
       Retirees receive 40% of the labor income from their last period of work as a pension (the
replacement rate is prr = 0.4). Baseline utility function parameters are  = 0.9962,  = 12,
 = 0.5, and  = 1.4-1 . This gives an annualized rate of time preference of 1.54% and an
intertemporal elasticity of substitution of 1.4 (which is the value estimated in the working paper
version of Choi et al. (2017) for American households).22
  22
    With infinitely lived agents, a value of  = 0.36 typically gives a steady state choice of time worked at 1/3 of
the time endowment. We set  at a slightly higher value.

6.4       Model Impulse Responses
We run the economy simulation for 300 periods (quarters). After 248 periods, the economy is
populated by the full complement of cohorts. Each cohort consists of 10,000 individuals. The
impulse event is a decline in the long-term bond rate generated by a decline in the short-term
rate.
       Empirically, the transmission mechanism runs from the monetary policy shock to the interest
rate then to consumption decisions. In the model, we want the interest rate dynamics driving
the model's impulse response to look as it does in the data. The way it looks in the data is
shown in Figure 15, which displays the impulse responses of the real federal funds rate to the
four monetary policy shocks from the structural VAR in Section 3.1.23

response to monetary policy shocks.


                                                               42
effects on the real federal funds rate. To conform to the empirics, we model the expansionary
interest rate shock as a persistent decline. For four periods before the shock, the long-term
interest is set at its mean value (3.44%). At the time of the shock, it declines to its lowest value
(3.08%) for 7 quarters, then rises to the next lowest value (3.27%) for the next 6 quarters, before
resuming its random evolution.
      We simulate un-normalized responses of log consumption, log labor supply, asset quantities,
and asset values for each individual to the negative interest rate shock.24 We then take the mean
within each age cohort, and then the mean within each of the three broad age groups.
      Figure 16 shows the relative responses of mean log consumption, mean asset holdings, mean
asset value, and mean log labor supply across age groups to the expansionary interest rate shock.
If the shock occurs at t, the relative responses are ln(Ct /Ct ) for consumption, ln(Lt /Lt ) for
labor, At /At for asset holdings, and (Pta At )/(Pta
                                                    At ) for asset value. Panel A shows that old
consumption is the most responsive to the negative interest rate shock. The response for the
young is also positive, though slightly smaller. The consumption response for the middle-aged
group is small and nearly zero. Overall, the life-cycle model can replicate the main qualitative
features of the consumption responses estimated from the CEX data.
 24
      Assets are not logged since young and middle households can borrow, resulting in negative values for assets.

for asset values. The horizontal axis indicates the number of quarters for up to five years after the shock.



    In the model, the mechanism works through the wealth effect and the labor-supply margin.
The persistence of the consumption response is induced by the persistent decline in the interest
rate. Even though the young draw down relatively more assets than the old (Figure 16, Panel B),
the old hold far more assets. The relative response patterns of asset values (Figure 16, Panel C)
held by the different age groups are roughly similar, but the young get the smallest capital gains.
Both the young and middle take more leisure and reduce labor in the first eight quarters following
the shock, with a larger response by young households (Figure 16, Panel D). The interest rate
cut causes both consumption and leisure for young households to increase, whereas the aggregate
response of middle-aged households is more muted.

                                                                  44
    Figure 17 shows the histograms of the asset holdings for the three age groups. The distribu-
tions are heavy in the right tail (note the difference in scale). From the figure, we also see that
the consumption response ordering follows from the old having the highest net worth, followed
by middle then young households. Because the intertemporal elasticity of substitution is greater
than 1, the young and middle-aged maintain positive net worth.

Notes: This figure shows the histograms of the asset holding positions for the three age groups. The horizontal axis denotes the asset
holding position per individual and the vertical axis denotes the number of individuals.



    The age-net worth pattern generated by the model mimics the pattern found in the SCF
data. The young in the model hold few assets relative to the large number of assets held by
the old. In the model, most households accelerate their asset holdings about ten years before
they retire. This results in a mixed and muted impact on the middle group, similar to what we
estimated in the structural VARs and local projections.
    In Figure 18 we divide households into `wealthy' (above median wealth) and `poor' (below
median wealth) for each age group, as we did with income in the empirical analysis of Section 4.
The figure shows consumption of the wealthy old to be more responsive to interest rate shocks
than consumption of the poor old. There is little difference between middle poor and wealthy
(note the scale). In contrast, the poor young increase consumption by more than wealthy young,
which is broadly consistent with the response patterns obtained in the structural VARs and local
projections. Also, the poor young reduce labor by more than the wealthy young (Figure 19).
This is due to the nonseparability between leisure and consumption in utility in which higher
consumption is associated with higher leisure.



                                                                 45

Notes: The figure shows simulated un-normalized relative responses of mean log consumption across age groups for the wealthy and
poor to a -0.36 percent decline in the long-term bond rate. If the shock occurs at time t, the relative response for consumption is
ln(Ct /Ct ). Wealthy households are those with above median asset holdings. The horizontal axis indicates the number of quarters
for up to five years after the shock.

Notes: The figure shows simulated un-normalized relative responses of mean log labor across age groups for the wealthy and poor
to a -0.36 percent decline in the long-term bond rate. If the shock occurs at time t, the relative response for labor is ln(Lt /Lt ).
Wealthy households are those with above median asset holdings. The horizontal axis indicates the number of quarters for up to five
years after the shock.



    To summarize, the model qualitatively explains key features of the data. In response to an
exogenous interest rate cut, both the data and the model exhibit i) consumption by the old
increases by more than the middle and young, ii) consumption by the wealthy old increases by
more than the poor old, iii) not much of a difference between consumption by the wealthy and
poor middle, iv) consumption of the young poor is higher than that of the wealthy poor.


                                                                46
    We close this section by mentioning that the recursive utility structure combined with a
labor-leisure choice for the young and middle-aged seem to be necessary to get the old to be the
most responsive. Section E of the appendix shows model impulse responses under alternative
parameter settings.


7     Conclusion
The weight of the evidence presented across alternative monetary policy shocks, empirical meth-
ods, and consumption measures is that aggregate consumption of old households react more to
monetary policy shocks than do middle and young households. We conjectured four potential
features of life-cycle heterogeneity, that together, form the underlying mechanism driving the
observed consumption response patterns. They are life-cycle heterogeneity in wealth, portfolio
composition, discounting and planning horizons, and labor supply.
    We investigate the explanatory power of these ideas with a life-cycle model where households,
who face uncertain labor income, death, and interest rates make consumption, saving, and labor
supply decisions. The model is able to replicate the most salient feature of the data, which is
that consumption of old households is more responsive to monetary policy shocks than younger
households.
    Understanding potential heterogeneous responses to monetary policy is an interesting topic
in its own right. Additionally, as the U.S. population continues to age, our results suggest a
potential change in the effectiveness of monetary policy.

A        The Consumption Data
Our consumption data is taken from the quarterly Consumer Expenditure Survey Interview
Sample from 1984Q1 to 2007Q4, compiled by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The data are
found in the Family Characteristics and Income (FAMILY) files.
    Following Krueger and Perri (2006), we construct real consumption expenditures by deflating
the household's expenditures for each of the 19 categories listed in Table A­1 by its category-
specific deflator. The table also lists the BLS CPI code. Total household consumption is the
sum of expenditures on components 1-19.
    Let ci,t be total household consumption divided by the number of members in household i at
time t. Let Ht be the total number of household observations in the group. Following Anderson
et al. (2016), within-group aggregate consumption is
                                                                Ht
                                                         1
                                                 ct =                 ci,t   .
                                                         Ht     i=1

Notes: The CPI codes are matched with CEX consumption categories following Krueger and Perri (2006) with the exceptions of
entertainment and vehicles.
 Prior to 1998 this is SA6 (Entertainment). From 1998 on it is SAR (recreation).
 We combine purchases and vehicle maintenance into Vehicles in the CEX category and use private transport in the CPI.




Generating Quarterly Consumption: The CEX is a rotating survey where respondents are in-
terviewed up to 5 times. Respondents are interviewed once a quarter, but the interview can

                                                            1
occur in any of the 3 months within that quarter. The first interview collects information on the
household's characteristics, but not it's consumption expenditures. Hence, each households has
at most 4 usable observations. In the subsequent interviews, the household reports expenditures
over the previous 3 months. There is a difference between the calendar quarter and the interview
quarter, and we discuss here how we calculate calendar quarter observations, which is illustrated
in Table A­2.25
    The table shows 4 fictitious households, HH-1 through HH-4, each interviewed in a different
month. HH-1 is interviewed in January about its October through December expenditures. HH-2
is interviewed in February about its November-January expenditures, and so forth.
    To align the interview-quarter expenditures to calendar-quarters, we treat expenditures in a
given month as representative of expenditures for the calendar-quarter. We illustrate in Table A­
3. HH-1's interview provides information for the entire 4th quarter of 2000, so the interpretation
is clear. HH-2 is reporting spending for 2 months in 2000Q4. We multiply that spending number
by 3/2 and that becomes HH-2's 2000Q4 consumption. HH-2 reports spending for 1 month in
2001Q1. That spending number is multiplied by 3 and that becomes HH-2's 2001Q1 consumption.
The adjustments for HH-3 and HH-4 follow analogously.26

     We have also considered an alternative way to calculate quarterly consumption - using weights on how many
months the consumption observation is in the sample. The results were not sensitive to this alternative.

B      Additional Empirical Results
This section reports the following additional empirical VAR results.

    1. Classification of households into six age groups (25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, 65-74, 75 and
       above).

    2. Response of durable goods expenditure.

    3. Response of consumption less housing expenditure.

    4. Application of CEX weights in age group consumption aggregation.

    5. The VAR in levels.

    6. The VAR with k = 6 lags

    7. Local projections without controlling for lagged consumption or the real federal funds rate.

B.1      Six Age Groups
Here, we consider 6 separate groups: 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, 65-74 and 75+. Figures B.1 and
B.2 report the consumption responses based on the structural VARs and local projections and
one standard deviation expansionary HFI-TRM, HFI-3MO, HFI-CMO, and NAR-GBK monetary
policy shocks. Once we split the sample into finer groups, we again see the old respond most to
monetary policy shocks, although in a few instances the 65-74 age group responds most. The
responses, in general, get progressively stronger as households age.

B.2    Durable Consumption
For Figure B.3 we only report responses of consumption on durable goods from our structural
VAR and local projections. In the data, the oldest age groups spend a larger share on non-
durable consumption than the consumption shown here: at the latter portions of the life-cycle,
households already have durable goods acquired through life and are possibly downsizing their
ownership of these goods. As a result, the data shows a lot of variation when we sub-divide
consumption expenditures to include this smaller component of total consumption.

B.3    Consumption Less Housing
Another aspect to consider is the inclusion of housing rents and imputed owner occupied dwelling
expenditures. As these categories tend to be rather large, it may be informative to consider
consumption expenditures without these categories. We use this consumption measure in our
structural VAR and local projections in Figure B.4. These results are closely in line with our
baseline results, suggesting housing expenditures are not solely driving our results.

B.4    Alternative within Age Group Aggregation of Consumption Ex-
       penditures
Here, we aggregate consumption by age using the CEX provided sampling weights. Our con-
sumption measure aggregates consumption by age group using the weights, and we transform
this into a per-person measure by dividing total consumption for each age group by the weighted
cohort sizes. The unattractive aspect of using this measure is that the weights are constructed
based on numerous household characteristics to calculate aggregate consumption across all age
groups, not just by household age. Nonetheless, Figure B.5 shows the responses to consumption
by this measure from our structural VAR and local projections. The results are close to our
baseline specification.

B.5    VAR in Levels
Here, we estimate our VAR in log levels of consumption and the results are plotted in Figure B.6.
The two main features of this are consistent with our baseline structural VAR: the old are the
most responsive age group and the effects are longest lasting for this age group. Moreover, the
level responses for the old are much larger under an innovation in the NAR-GBK monetary policy
shock.

In Figure B.7 we reduce the number of parameter estimates in our structural VAR by shortening
the lags in all variables to 6. The dynamic responses of consumption from the monetary shock
with 6 lags produces similar results to our baseline specification.

C     Household (Micro)-Level Regressions
This section of the Appendix provides additional details for the estimated impulse responses
by age group to monetary policy shocks based on household-level regressions, which follow the
empirical strategy employed by Coibion et al. (2017) and Wong (2018). This alternative method-
ology generates responses qualitatively similar to the aggregate approaches (structural VAR and
local projections) studied in the main paper. The micro-level analysis also finds the old to have
the largest estimated response. The young generally have the second highest response, but not
always.
    In the CEX, households are interviewed quarterly for up to 5 consecutive quarters. There are
at most 4 quarters of consumption observations per household because the first interview is only
to obtain household-level characteristics but not information on consumption. Due to staggering
of interview months, not all observations are based on consumption from all 3 months in the
quarter. We keep only those consumption observations that have data for all 3 months in the
quarter. Most households have 3 or 4 quarters of consumption observations.
    The variable of interest is the percent change in quarterly consumption per household, i, at
time t, ln(ci,t ) = ln(ci,t ) - ln(ci,t-1 ). Real consumption per household is obtained by deflat-
ing the household's consumption in each specific category with the category-specific CPI and
aggregating these together, as described in the main text and Appendix A. By working with
growth rates, we lose one observation to differencing, leaving either 2 or 3 usable observations
per household.
    We further restrict the sample to households reporting non-zero expenditures on food. We
also trim the sample by those consumption growth observations below -2.5 (change in log con-
sumption) and above 2.5. If these criteria are not satisfied for even one household observation,
the household is dropped from the sample. We consider the same four monetary policy shock
series (HFI-TRM, HFI-3MO, HFI-CMO, and NAR-GBK). The regressions include 8 lags of the
shocks to conform with the structural VAR analysis in the text.


D     Stationary Representation of the Model
Because the income process has a unit root, the state space becomes unbounded. To solve the
model, we induce stationarity by normalizing income and utility by last period's permanent
income. We suppress the individual subscript to avoid clutter. Normalization of the income
process follows,
                          Yz,t eut

E        Variations on the Model
In this section, we report results from alternative specifications of the model.
    Panel A of Figure E shows consumption responses when the asset is a short-term (one-period)
bond. Other model features are the same as those in the text,  = 12,  = -1 = 1.4,  = 0.5,
and the bequest motive is present. Size-ordering of the consumption responses goes young > old
> middle, which is inconsistent with our empirical estimates.
    Panel B shows consumption responses when labor supply is fixed, again with  = 12,  =
 -1
 = 1.4 and the bequest motive. When households make only the consumption-saving decision,
size-ordering of consumption responses is young > old middle, which again is inconsistent with
our empirical estimates.
    Panel C shows consumption responses under constant relative risk aversion utility with the
labor decision and bequest motive,  = 12,  = 0.5. Here, consumption from all age groups
respond in the wrong direction.




                                                                  18

    Figure E.2 shows relative consumption responses when the intertemporal eslasticity of sub-
stitution is  = -1 = 0.2 instead of 1.4.

                                 = 12,  = -1 = 0.2,  = 0.5




   While the age-group consumption response ordering is consistent with our estimates, a further
breakdown across high and low wealth young households does not conform to the data. As seen in
Figure E.3, consumption of the wealthy young increases whereas consumption of the poor young
declines initially. Similarly, labor response of the poor young lies above that of the wealthy
young. An intertemporal elasticity of substitution greater than 1 is needed to get the poor
young consumption response to lie above the wealthy young response.
