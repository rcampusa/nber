                        IN THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY*


1.   Introduction

     a) Basic issues. What are the factors determining the rate of technology

diffusion in the host country?    What is the connection between transnational

strategy and technological change in the host country? How do host—country

firms compete against foreign firms that have both cost and proprietory ad-

vantages? This section attempts to use the experience of the semiconductor

industry to examine these important issues.

        The pattern of product innovations is based on the concept of a life

cycle process.' A model is developed for estimating product life cycles in

a way that gives information suitable for assessing induced changes in the

host—country industry.2 The analysis that follows is broken into two parts.

     Thanks are due to Gary Hufbauer and Michael Posner for their helpful sugges-
tions in the early stages of this paper. Anthony Golding, Ed Seibheras, John
Llewellyn, and Bill Finan deserve comment for their ideas; Robert Lipsey, Irving
Kravis, and Gary Hufbauer for their very constructive suggestions. If any errors
exist they are entirely mine.

     Lseverai studies are essential reading in this context. See Poatner (1961),
Hufbauer (1966), Vernon (1966), Hirsch (1967), Gruber, Mehta, and Vernon (1967);
chapters by Steven Toulmin and William Gruber, Gruber and Marquis (1969).

     2The life cycle may be described in several ways: the cycle observed in
adjustments towards equilibrium levels of demand and supply; the cycle in imi-
tative behavior by firms or consimers; and the cycle in the time pattern of
firms bringing an innovation into the market. For an interesting study carried
out from the first viewpoint see the work of Chow (1967), who made use of the
Gompertz function, Mansfield (1968) and (1963). Models similar to Mansfield's
have been estimated for the Canadian tool and die industry and the paper industry,
by Globerman (l973a and 1973b).

Firstly, factors determining the rate of difrzsion of the innovations in the

host country are examined; secondly, factors determining the positions of

individual firms within the life cycle are considered.

     The imitation cycle is modeled on the basis of starting months for the

commercial exploitation of semiconductor innovations by individual firms ser-

vicing the U.K. market. The technological lag between an innovation's first

commercial appearance and its introduction to the United Kingdom is measured

with two aspects in mind: the time lag in years and months and the entry order

of individual market participants.

     b) The Data. Data for this analysis have been collected on over twenty

commercial semiconductor innovations embodying new process or product tech-

nology. These innovations cover three phases of electronic development——discrete

devices, bi—polar integrated circuits, and uni—polar large—scale integration.

To qualify as an innovation, a new commodity must be sold in the host country In

sufficient quantities to be described as a commercial operation. Most, if not

all, efforts of individual firms selling in the U.K. are included,3 but produc-

tion for in—house use is not completely covered.4

     The data were gathered from individual firms, technical publications, adver-

tisements, trade journals, and sellers' lists. Over a period of 25 years, many

changes have taken place in the industry, with firms continuously entering and

leaving. A mail survey was therefore impracticable, but personal visits and



     3
      Cases Involving trial offers, and very limited selling are not included.
For a definition of innovation similar to that used here see Mansfield et al
(1971), pp. 111—2.

     4Production solely for in—house use has not been common in the U.K., but
some manufacture by Newmarket Transistors, English Electric, Standard Telephones
and Cables, and a few other firms has been employed in this way.
                                      —3—

communications proved fruitful. Over 70 firms and more than 30 innovations

came within the scope of the work. A core group of 20 innovations was finally

selected from the original list. Since U.K. sales of some innovations were

quite limited or, as in the case of thyristors, the specific technical data

would not allow sufficient distinction of different underlying process tech-

nologies, data on the American industry were collected to serve as a check

on the U.K. data, and also to provide information concerning the relationships

between company activity in the source and host countries.5


2. A Short History

    a)   Technology, Products, and Corporate    Leaders. During the 1950—60 period,

innovations in   semiconductors were primarily associated with discrete devices,
such   as single transistors,diodes, or rectifiers. The technological impetus

for innovations in discrete semiconductor devices came primarily from America

out of research in firms such as Bell Labs of Western Electric, General Electric,

Texas Instruments, R.C.A., Philco, Hughes, Clevite, Motorola, and Fairchild.

       In addition to the first type of point contact transistor, at least four

classifications of device by method of construction came into existence: grown,

alloyed, diffused, and electrochemical. Improvements to the basic methods of

construction appeared rapidly, and in many cases an improvement In one method

led to improvements In another. The major transistor Innovations of this period

are given   in Table 1   along   with the dates and principal   firms responsible. A

transistor family tree is presented in Figure 1 to illustrate the cross fertili-

zation of technical developments arising from the four main methods of semi-

conductor construction. The creation of other types of active components also




     5lnformation as to which firm was first or earlier to introduce a new pro-
duct was sometimes a matter of controversy because of parallel developments.
Objective sources of Information, outside the innovating firms, were sought
to help resolve disputes. In the course of the study, more than 1,000 observa-
tions were collected.

also involved the new processing techniques. A list of these other components

introduced during the 1950—75 period is given in Table 2.

     The early 1960s were an important period in the history of electronic

systems design. During this time, several techniques to miniaturization were

explored. The development of semiconductor application technology had tradi-

tionally been based on devices representing single discrete active components.

This tended to favor the component manufacturers. However, with the advent of

integrated circuits incorporating large numbers of active and passive elements,

design technologies increasingly necessitated the closer participation of

systems people in the earlier phase of the development cycle. Systems experts

pressed for greater optimization in total circuit composition, especially in

the use of integrated circuits to perform particular systems functions.6

     The development of the planar process at Fairchild in 1959. marked the be-

ginning of the integrated circuit era in electronics, and the evolution of the

industry as shown in Figure 3. At first, the planar process was confined to

the manufacture of single transistors on a single silicon base known as a sub-

strate or "chip." It became apparent that the process could be extended in

several directions, to the manufacture of several transistors in one chip,

and to the inclusion of other active devices, for example, diodes, resistors,

and capacitors. The first commercially available integrated circuits appearing

in 1960 were designed for digital equipment and were based on the need for

large numbers of Identical circuits. The design of chip circuits tended to




     6The change in the physical size of electronic systems has been dramatic.
A device of an earlier period often becomes simply an element within a device
of the following period. Thus, transistors have become elements of integrated
circuits, which, in turn, have become elements of integrated electronic com-
ponents. The actual size of the device for each succeeding period has become
considerably smaller. The newer components are composed of transistors that
can be seen only with the assistance of a powerful microscope.

copy systems already in existence using discrete components. ut manufacturers
quickly realized that integrated circuits required a new concept of systems de-

sign. There followed a succession of circuit families, summarized in Table 3,

for which manufacturers sought to optimize the performance and        economics of

systems, and   to   make them on a single monolithic chip.7

     The planar technique was       initially   limited to bi—polar devices, in which

both positive and     negative   electric carriers are required, but it also led to

the development of uni—polar devices, for which carriers of only one type are

required, at great space saving. The first integrated circuit to be developed

by means of the planar process contained a small number of elements. A larger

system could be built by using more than One chip, and this type of system was

known as the multi—chip system. However, with the extensive development of

uni—polar technology, it became apparent that larger systems could be made on

a single chip.8 Uni—polar technology became the primary basis of what is known

as large—scale integration, LSI,9 while its preceding monolithic competitor,




     7Lathrop (1970), pp. 1—1 to 1—11.

     8There is a continuing debate as to how         far
                                                 the level of integration will
go. The uni—polar technology makes possible extremely complex chips, and some
see electronic equipment systems on a chip, for example, a TV set, a computer
memory, or a spectrum analyzer. They already exist for small calculators,
digital clocks and watches. See "Forum on 14S1/LSI," Electronic Products,
December 1969, pp. 28—38.

     9This category of device may be split into two groups, random and regular
function components. Regular function components are suited          to digital
                                                                        systems
such as for computer memories where the elements are arranged in a regular f ash—
ion. See Lathrop (1970), pp. 1—4.

bi—polar technology has had its major impact      in less complex integrated cir-

cuit termed medium scale integration, MSI.W Table 4 outlines the principal

families associated with    uni—polar   technology.

      Major improvements in semiconductor processing technology had the effect

of pushing semiconductor manufacturers downstream in terms of their end products.

Through each new processing technology the product—market strategy of the semi-

conductor houses has also evolved. The technological requirement in moving

downstream gave rise to diversification into downstream know—how, products,

and   markets.   At the same time, the systems manufacturers, threatened by in-

roads that the upstream firms    were making into their product areas, saw in—
house   semiconductor   facilities as a means of combatting such enroachment.

       Between successive technologies there is a transition period of technologi-

cal overlap. It is during these periods that hybrid technologies emerge.11

The hybrids depend basically on two      techniques   for making passive circuits,

thin film or thick film (Figure 3). They are often a midway solution designed

to meet specific user requirements in terms of cost and volume. A complete

monolithic replacement requires a considerably larger overhead cost than the

monolithic components making up the hybrid.




     0Some leading firms in bi—polar technology such as Texas Instruments,
Transitron, Sylvania, and Motorola had still by the early 1970s to make
significant inroads into large—scale integration. In terms of off—the—shelf
devices, Texas Instruments was the only firm of the four making them and had
only two. Companies that did not invest as heavily in bi—polar technology
such as General Instruments, Philco—Ford, and Hughes Aircraft, had forty large—
scale integration devices between them. See Forum, p. 29. R.C.A. leap—frogged
bi—polar technology from discrete micromodules to uni—polar complementary de-
vices. Finan (1975), p. 37.

(1972), pp. 56—68, 332—56, 381.

     b) The Semiconductor Industry in Britain. The firms primarily responsible

for the technical progress of the U.K. industry over the past 25 years are

listed in Table 5. The performance of the individual companies in introducing

the 21 innovations is also indicated.'2 For example, Motorola participated in

the market by selling products incorporating fourteen of the innovations. The

company was second in introducing one innovation, third in two others, fifth

in one, and so on.

     The story of competition in the U.K. active components industry prior to

the mid—l950s is almost a history of the British Value Association.'3 The U.K.

industry could be characterized as a "tight" oligopoly dominated by Mullard)4

With the decision by Texas Instruments to begin U.K. operations in 1957, several

other American companies soon followed: Philco, Hughes, and International

Rectifier. General Electric and Transitron established export houses. By the

mid—sixties, the trickle of foreign firms marketing in the U.K. turned into a

small flood, as shown in Table 6. In the meantime, host—country firms had been

seeking and making agreements that would give them access to American know—how




     12The list of innovations covered is as follows: point contact transistor
(ge), alloy junction transistor (ge), surface barrier transistor, diffused tran-
sistor (si), diffused mesa transistor (si), planar transistor, epitaxial devices,
junction field—effect transistor, alloy junction diode (si), power rectifier (si),
zener diode (si), (thristor), tunnel diode (ge/si/ga as), unijunction transistor,
varactor diode, light emitting diode, Schottky—barrier diode, RTL (resistor tran-
sistor logic), DTL (diode transistor logic), TTL (transistor transistor logic),
ECL (emitter coupled logic), and p—MOS devices. The thyristor is not included
in the statistics of Table 5.

     13mis was a highly restrictive organization investigated by the British
Monopolies Commission in 1954—55. See Monopolies and Restrictive Practices
Commission (1956).

     14Mullard had over fifty percent of the market, and was rivalled by Asso-
ciated Electrical Industries, 15—20 percent; Standard Telephones and Cables,
8—12 percent; Electrical and Musical Industries, 8—12 percent; General Electric
Company, 3—5 percent; and others, Ferranti, Pye, Rank, Automatic Telephone and
Electric, less than 2 percent.

and manufacturing rights. A list of licensing agreements is given in Table 7.

Considerable amounts had also been spent by them on.reaearch and development,

e.g. by Mullard, A.E.I., English Electric, S.T.C., Lucas, and Ferranti. The

U.K. firms, although not unprepared for the arrival of new American products,

needed to compete with American companies in product cost and variety. The

only way to match these advantages was by expensive R&D to improve methods

of manufacture, and to obtain the economies of increased scale of operation.

     American participation in the British semiconductor market has tended to

come in waves of new firms. The successive waves are associated with both new

processing technology that supersedes its predecessor and new products made

possible 1' the new processes. A visual scenario of the major product life

cycles for discrete semiconductor devices is presented in Figure 4. Among

other things the cycles reflect the switch from germanium to silicon as the pri-

mary base material.

     c) choice of Technology and Market Strategy. Most semiconductor houses,

in particular American firms, pursued an aggressive pricing strategy. Often

they were simultaneously straddling newer and older technologies and frequently

managing to earn only a small return on their investment in the preceding tech-

nology.15 Moreover, most firms wanted to be well positioned with respect to

the growing markets where economies of large scale could be achieved, and to

the newer technologies for the most profitable development of these markets.

Most firms sought the internal economies that could be achieved through im-

proved organization around the new design technologies, for example, computer

aided    design and optimal systems for interf acing with component users.'6

Finally, many firms saw a need for basic research, but the trade—off tended

to favour developmental research. This was especially true in view of the

growing risks involved for firms that created their own proprietary products

and processes.'7 The main gains resulted from five types of economies, namely:

1) miniaturization, 2) improvements to production yields, 3) economies of scale

and associated learning economies, 4) product—market strategy, and 5) vertical

integration economies.

       1) Miniaturization meant that the number of semiconductor elements on a

single chip could be increased. Design technologists initially experimented

with various types of logic and then chip structure to both reduce the space

required per semiconductor element and improve the overall performance of the

chips with respect to speed and power dissipation. As Figure 5 illustrates,

the density and speed of a chip are related. The overall effect of miniaturi-

zation      has been to reduce the cost of the elements on the chips. Element cost
is related to packing density or the number of elements per chip. The progress
in reducing costs this way is illustrated by Figure 6 showing the period 1960
to   1968.

       2)    Production yield is associated with the number of   chips that are even-

tually usable out of a given supply of processed substrate. For any given       chip
substrate     there are likely to exist defects proportional to its area. The

same number of defects in a given substrate meant that the relative yield in

became very difficult, and a new process therefore had to incorporate a secret
that could not be broken. Camenzind (1969), p. 10.

 manufacture of larger bi—polar devices would ,e considerably lower than for

 the manufacture of smaller uni—polar devices.18

     A formula for the derivation of yield can be defined. If we let D repre-

 sent the average number of spot defects per unit of area, and A represent the
                                                                                      *

area of the device, then the probability of producing functioning circuits,

namely, the yield, Y becomes:


                                Y— e-DA

This relationship is shown in Figure 7. By using a method of manufacture that

reduces the circuit size, as in the case of the uni—polar device, the yield is

increased. It is obvious that the concept of yield relates directly to the

costs of manufacture)9 This is illustrated in Figure 8 for which the cost

per function is related to chip size. With the yield concept, a notion of the

optimal economic circuit size was also born. If the optimal size is exceeded,

the yield becomes so small that the cost per circuit rises excessively. It is

easy to understand why innovations designed to increase production yield have

become the object of much research.

     3) Economies of scale and associated learning economies are another im-

portant aspect in the choice of technology and the selection of a product-market

strategy in the semiconductor industry. Figure 9 illustrates economies achieved

under various technologies. The minimum—of—minimums, or lowest average cost




     18lmprovements in yield have followed a trend associated with the introduction
of new processes moving from less than 1%, 1960; 10%, 1965; 40%, 1970; to 80+%,
1975. See Finan (1975), pp. 21—26; Integrated Circuit Engineering (1966), pp. 8,
76—78, 164—65, and Camenzind (1972), pp. 45—56.

     '9it is possible to specify more than one type of defect mechanism operating.
Using an alternative formula, we have yield as follows: Y = l/(1+AD), which ex-
pands with n defect mechanisms to reduce yield accordingly: Y — l/(1+AD
(l+AD). Finan (1975), pp. 20—24.                                         )(l+AD1)

 curve for the production of an individual integrated circuit by a firm is

 Illustrated by the line aa' in Figure 10. It is made up of three portions

 reflecting parts of the cost curves associated with, a) the superseded

 technology, for low volume production, b) the hybrid technology, for inter-

mediate volume production, and c) the new superseding technology, for high

volume production. In the absence thus of learning economies, the choice of

processing technology is a function of the firm's expected throughput. In

the presence of learning economies, the cost will be pushed downwards. The

downward shift may depend on the frequency of production runs at specific

volume levels, and hence may influence the shape of the cost curve   dispropor-
tionately in certain regions.

     4) Product—market strategy in the microelectronics industry generally

involves the selection of design characteristics as well as the selection of

product and market areas. A strategy can include 1) a process mix, with the

choice of the proportions of output made by the various superseded, hybrid,

and superseding technologies, 2) a volume mix, involving, for example, the

numbers of products with low, intermediate or high volume throughputs, and 3)

a design mix, including the choice of products with standard, off—the—shelf,

or custom design.

     An electronic system in theory can be composed either of a very complex

single chip, a system of simple chips, or some combination of these.2° This

has different economic implications for users and producers. The systems

house, or user, would like to have only one unique component so as to minimize

the costs of interconnection.2' The specialist components manufacturer, in




     20Custom components are designed to fill a specific requirement and tend
to be electrically optimized for that requirement only, whereas standard com-
ponents are generally advertized in catalogues as off—the—shelf stock.

contrast,   prefers to manufacture a small numbe'- of unique components at high

volumes. The cost considerations which can affect the choice between the two

approaches are illustrated in Figure 12. The outcome in terms of the size

distribution of components is illustrated by Figure 11.

     5) Vertical integration economies are achieved through an inhouse, as

compared to a buying—in operation. Systems manufacturers have developed in—

house integrated circuit capabilities, especially in hybrid technologies.22

However, these are generally confined to a narrow area of semiconductor tech-

nology since the small value added element of components in total costs usually

justifies only one or two semiconductor technologies.23


3. The Microeconomics of Market Entry

    a) General Considerations. It is generally realized that new knowledge is

not evenly distributed either internationally or between firms. The production

functions of individual companies may thus differ substantially from one another.24

     The uneven distribution of knowledge and skills affects the timing of com-

mercial introductions embodying new technology. Consider Figure 13 which repre-

sents the discounted values of cumulative revenues R(t), cumulative costs C(t),

and cumulative profits P(t) associated with the timing of the commercial intro-

duction of product—innovations. For each timing, a separate set of discounted



     22
       In 1969, approximately 80% of American hybrid integrated circuits were
manufactured in—house. This was three times the value of in—house monolithic
integrated circuit production. See Integrated Circuit Engineering Corporation
(1970).

     23The risks of a systems house pursuing the wrong semiconductor technology
are thought to be high.

     24The study by Rapoport (1971), pp. 135—56, of costs associated with lead
times has been useful in developing concepts discussed here.

values applies. A curvilinear relationship fr cumulative costs and a linear
relationship for cumulative revenues are assumed. Early introduction of a

product—innovation is associated with higher cumulative revenues and costs.25

If the firm begins commercial production at a very late stage, its discounted

costs are lower but its profits may also be lover. Indeed, if the firm intro-

duces the innovation after t, cumulative costs will exceed cumulative revenue,

and a loss will be incurred. To maximize profits, the firm will introduce the

product at time t*. The uneven distribution of knowledge implies that the curves

C(t) and R(t) differ between companies. Differences exist between companies both

in the generation and application of commercial knowledge. Figure 14 represents

the case where two companies a and b have the same know—how and costs associated

with bringing a product innovation to market, but differ in their respective

levels of proprietary marketing ability. Firm b knows how to make good on a

market entry while firm a is less capable. Thus, even when firm b enters the

market at a later date, say tb, its eventual profits are greater. Firm a, on

the other hand, maximizes profits by entering the market earlier, incurring

higher costs, and deriving a lower cumulative profit.

     The decision facing the British based firm has often been a choice of either

being a licensee of an American firm or developing its own in—house capability.

Generally, the American licensor derives returns from its proprietory know—how

in the form of a royalty. Normally, a royalty is expressed as a percentage of

sales, often between 3 and 8 percent, but frequently provision is made for a




     25The values of R(t), C(t), and P(t) may be thought of as the discounted
expectations of the individual firm for introducing the product—innovation at
time t. The expected cumulative discounted profit is as follows:

                         P(t)   R(t) —   C(t)
To maximize cumulative profits, the first—order condition is that dC/dt   dR/dt.
Thus given that the expectations of the firm are correct, the '1optimal" or pro-
fit—maximizing timing of market entry is t.

lump sum payment at the beginning and a minimum payment over the license period.

The royalties usually last for a stipulated period, after which      the   licensee

is independent. It may then shake off the licensor's control, and become a

competitor. However, in many instances, the licensor is so far ahead technically

that the licensee finds it advantageous to arrange a new licensing agreement.26

Consider Figure 15 in which the discounted eventual costs of going—it—alone,

C(t)1, and as a licensee, C(t)L, are represented schematically. The independent

programme is assumed to be more costly. In the illustration, we also assume

that R(t)1 and R(t)L are equal. Because some of the licensor's proprietary

marketing knowledge may form part of the licensing agreement, the curve R(t)L

may, in fact, be drawn above R(t)1. Some appreciation of marketing factors is

furthermore also likely to be contained in the product technology itself. A

proportion of R(t)L is paid to licensor as royalties, indicated in the diagram

as R(t). The licensee ends up with the residual profit P(t)L. The eventual

discounted profits for alternative timings of market entry are represented in

Figure 16. The points t and t represent the times at which the host—country

firm may maximize its profits given the strategy either of licensing or of

going—it—alone. The diagram is drawn to show that as a licensee, the host—

country firm   accelerates   its optimal timing of market entry   from the alternative
strategy of going—it—alone, though that need not always be the case.

     Competition amongst rival American firms and between firms of the source

and host country    has   the effect of pushing forward the period of profitable

market entry. This effect of competition on Introduction behaviour may be

observed in the time pattern for the numbers of firms marketing a new commodity

in the United Kingdom. Figures 17 and 18 portray imitation cycles for selected

major   bi—polar and uni—polar semiconductor devices which display an S shape curve

circuit technologies associated with these devices are presented in Table 8.

     (b) American Firms in the British Market. The uneasy fact of life for

British firms is that the pace of product change in their markets has been set

by foreign competitors. American firms dominate Europe in electronic technology

from computers to semiconductors.27 Even large established British companies

have experienced great difficulty in the struggle to survive.28 The American

challenge has been too great, but why?

     The size of the American market relative to European markets is an important

factor behind the success of American firms. Figures for 1973 are given in

Table 9 demonstrating the comparative sizes of domestic markets. Taken as a

whole, the total European market is less than one third that of the United States.

The U.K. sales seem tiny in comparison to those of America. This difference in

relative sizes of markets plays an important role in explaining the country's

slower pace in a highly technological industry.

     What is the relationship between technology—product innovation or imitation

and the size of market? It can be argued that they are both essential parts of

a circular phenomenon. Since the semiconductor industry is one in which economies

of scale are of fundamental importance, companies selling to the large American

market derive certain economic advantages. The size of the market acts to permit

     28The number of independent wholly owned British manufacturers of semicon-
ductors has dwindled from twelve to three: General Electrtc Co., Plessey, and
Ferranti. Three came under the control of G.E.C.: Associated Electrical Indus-
tries, English Electric, and Maconi—Elliot Microelectronics. Two were taken over
by foreign firms: Pye by Philip's of the Netherlands, and Brush Crystal by Clevite
and then I.T&T. Three remaining firms are sitting, more or less, on the aide—
lines: Westinghouse Brake (licensed by Westinghouse (U.S.A.), Lucas, and Thorn
(which was never very large in semiconductors).

                   The above table defines the relative size of Azerican to
        the European markets. The British market ranks as second largest in
        Europe, nevertheless it is considerably smaller than the American,
        i.e. the American market for discrete devices is 16.3 times that of
        the British. The above comparisons are based on McGraw Hill data of
        180 companies. See Electronics, January 10, 1974.
                                —36—

higher levels of R&D than could be justified y the expected sales and profits

in the U.S. market. In the larger American market not only can more be spent

on more individual projects, but more can be spent to introduce them into the

market at an earlier date. Selling to a large market permits American firms

to offer a more advanced product earlier, or a similar product at the same

time, but with a greater servicing and reliability record, than firms confined

to only the U.K. market.29 The process is circular since a larger market can

promote a faster technological pace, which in turn can produce a larger market

by extending the scope of technological application.

     To derive a comparable "golden circle" firms located in Europe need the

total European market, but this entails its own difficulties. The European

market is a highly complex one: two trading blocs, four major languages, fourteen

currencies, effective nationalism with customs duties, separate taxes, laws, and

non—tariff barriers. The American market is relatively simple: one trading bloc,

one language, one currency, and no trade barriers. The simplicity of the American

market permits firms to conduct certain aspects of business, such as marketing,

without the difficulties experienced in Europe.

     As a small counter—balance to the advantages enjoyed by American firms,

British companies have relied on the relatively lower salaries of British

designers and engineers to reduce the threshold "application area" below levels

for comparable markets in America. However, Japanese competition may in the

future make greater inroads in selling similar components in the U.K.




          justify discrete circuits the sales of systems could have been in the
thousands, but for integrated circuits they need to be in the tens of thousands.
British firms have received less in the way of military/space contracts and
smaller government subsidies than the closest American competitors.

4.   A Lognorma].   Model of the Product Cycle

     a) Features of the Model. The reason for developing a model of market

entries and     imitation   is to provide estimates of the parameters that describe

the way diffusion has occurred. The characteristics of the population over

which diffusion takes place are not initially specified, but the parameters

of the model can be related to these characteristics by means of regression

analysis.

     What models can be used? At least four possible types of imitation model,

derived from the Gompertz, logistic, normal and lognormal distributions, are
                         30
potential candidates.         All four models can be estimated by ordinary least

squares methods or by special formulations. Of the four, the lognormal dis-

tribution has the most intuitive appeal since its parameters are allowed

greater flexibility in relation to the rate and clustering of introductions.

The logistic and Gompertz functions constrain the observations towards a mode

of 50 or 37 percent respectively of the upper asymptote. The lognormal distri-

bution can offer these modes as special cases, but can also exhibit a mode of

less than 37 percent, or between 37 and 50 percent.31

      What does the pattern of imitation based on the lognormal model look like?

In its cumulative form it produces a sigmoid (or S) curve that is skewed towards

the left as observations tend to cluster towards the beginning of the cycle.

The model can be described either in terms of density, as in Figure 19, or in

terms of cumulative density, as in Figures 20 to 22. Unlike the normal model,

the lognormal model assumes that densities of market entry are skewed to the

left. The lognormal model may be represented by the following equation:32

The variable 0 may be defined as appropriate.

N is the number of firma    which have   entered the market up through time t,     and
N* is the eventual number. The model has two parameters, i and a, which may

differ from innovation to innovation. Each parameter represents a characteristic

of the diffusion process. The parameter i       indicates      the average (in natural

logarithms) of the number of years required for all firms to enter the market

(Figure    21). The parameter a represents the clustering of entries; a smaller
a   indicates   a tighter bunching of market entries (Figure 22). Another useful
parameter,   not part of the above lognormal model, is 5, which measures the time

between an innovation's first commercial appearance anywhere and its first

appearance in the U.K. (Figure 20). Our analysis of market development will

use the cross section experience of semiconductor innovations in an attempt

to explain the determinants of N*, 6, ii,     and   a.

      The model is set up by letting observations of the lag time between an

innovation's first commercial appearance anywhere and its introduction by

individual firms to the U.K. market, be defined by MS. The model is then

estimated by ordinary least squares as follows32 with MS as the variable 8:

      The   variable z is defined as normal equ2-,alent deviates; e is the error
term (the expected value of e is zero).

      b) Application of the Model
      What is the pattern of technology—product imitation in the host—country?

Estimates of the rate and timing of technology—product introduction in the

host country have been made using the lognormal model. The pattern of tech-

nology import and imitation via exports, subsidiary production ventures, and

host—country licencing and investment are reflected in the estimated parameters

of the imitation cycles. Examples of the curves derived are presented in

Figures 23 to 27. A statistical summary of the results for the 21 semiconductor

innovations is given in Tables 10 and 11. These are generally favorable to the

hypothesis that market entries form a sigmoid (or S shaped) cummulative pattern

over time. The average        was greater than 0.8 and for more than half the inno-

vations it was greater than 0.9.

      The numbers of firms imitating individual semiconductor innovations has been

quite variable. Of the innovations listed, the planar transistor has attracted

37 firms, the largest number for a single innovation. Six of the cycles esti—

mated have more than twenty imitators. Of the rest there are several where

the number of firms participating has been as small as one or two: for example,

the grown junction transistors (superseded by the alloy process) and germanium

diffused transistors (superseded by Silicon devices using a similar process).

      The pattern of technology imitation has also shown variability over the

semiconductor innovations covered in this study. Consider the values of &,     z,
and    as they are presented in Tables 10 and 11. The range of variation in the

case of t    extends from zero years, indicating innovation in the United Kingdom,

to 6.6 years. The variation in i extends from 1.3 years to 9.2 years. Similarly

a, over the same innovations, has been 1.3 years at its lowest and 5.5 years at

its highest. The "average" imitation cycle for the industry, derived from the

20 selected innovations, has the following ch'racteriatics it takes 1.4 years

after the innovation in America before the product is first made in the United

Kingdom; 50Z of the firms imitate after 3.2 years (reflected in the average u

of 1.17) and the standard deviation around the mean is 1.9 years (reflected

in the average sigma of 0.67).

     In the analysis that follows important determinants of the pattern of

diffusion associated with N*, 6, a, and a are considered in relation to the

changing structure of the U.K. semiconductor industry.


5. Underlying Determinants of the Product Cycle Model

    a) The Population of Firms

    The semiconductor industry, unlike any other, operates on a very compressed

time scale, with some product life cycles evaluated in terms of months rather

than years.33 The scope of application for new products has also been remark-

able. However, the composition of end uses in America differs from the composi-

tion in Britain and Europe. The segment of new semiconductor and integrated

circuit technology applied to military and government end uses is proportionately

smaller in Britain and Europe, while the segment applied to consumer electronics

has been proportionately larger.34

     Market size partly determines the number of firms that can operate profit-

ably, depending on other factors such as scale economies. Since the American

market developed ahead of the British market, it is reasonable to suppose that

expectations concerning the size of the British market would be influenced by



     33
          G. Penisten in Electronics/Management Center (1969).

     34For example, in 1970 products for consumer end use,i.e. in T.V.'s,
appliances, etc., were 20.9% of the total European semiconductor market.
This figure can be compared to the U.S. where it was 15%. See annual McGraw—
Hill surveys in Electronics.
                                   — 49 —


the   experience of the American market. In addition, the number of firms

producing in the source country may influence the number of firms which

enter the British market, since each foreign firm is a potential trans—

national producer or licensor.

       The number of firms that come to market a new product technology (N*) may

depend on the number of firms with previous experience in the host market (Ne),

as can be seen in the following regression:

            N* — —0.95    +   1.44 Ne       2
                (—0.68)       (13.60)           0.9                (3)

            (Number in parentheses are t—values)


The association is sufficiently strong to accept the importance of previous

experience in determining the ultimate number of market participants. But

the number of new market entries tends to be in the order of 40 percent of

the number of experienced firms entering. Thus, the fact that many experienced

firms enter the market does not particularly discourage entries by firms on the

fringe or outside the industry.

       The effect of market size and prior experience on the pattern of technology

introduction in the host country was analyzed by regressing the number of firms

marketing in the U.K., N*, against the current (1973,     mu.) sales in America, ?,

and the number of firms marketing each product in the United States, Na. The

regression was performed for 20 technology products listed except the thyristor.35




     35Several small adjustments were made in the fitures to account for the
fact that market sales of some earlier products are currently nil. This was
done using figures from American trade journals ad sellers lists. The rank
correlation for (N*, S ) was +.72, and for (N*, N ) was +.59.
                                     — 50 —


The results were better when         and Na were n included in the same estimated

equation as follows:

             N* — —2.208 +       .103    Na + 1.313 Ne 2 = 0.93        (4a)
                    (—1.67)    (+2.51)        (+12.41)

and,

                =    11.222   + 0.068 5a•                     — 0.68   (4b)
                                (4.42)


Of the two independent variables, the magnitude of U.S. sales, 5a, appeared

more closely associated with total eventual participation in the U.K. market,

however, Na performed better with Ne.


       b) The United Kingdom Lag

       What has been the record of British—based companies in introducing new

semiconductor technology over the period 1950—75? From an analysis of 12 major

technology—product innovations associated with transistors and integrated cir—
                                                         36
cults, the following general observations were made:

             1) The lag between the innovation's introduction in America
             and the average time of the first three introductions In the
             United Kingdom by British—based firms has remained roughly
             the same over the period, and has been about two years.

             2) The speed of response by the first three U.K. firms alone
             relative to the first three American firms marketing in the
             U.K. has marginally improved, when compared to late 1950s and
             early 1960s. This is true regardless of the form of trans—
             national activity undertaken by the American firms.



       35a     a      e
        Since S and N were not independent of each other they areanotein_
cluded in the same equation. The simple correlation coefficient (S , N ) was
+.78.

     36The twelve technology innovations based on major processing or design
improvements are: the point contact transistor, alloy (si) transistor, diffused
transistor, mesa devices, field effect devices, planar transistors, epitaxial
devices, RTL (or DCTL) logic devices, DTL logic devices, ECL logic devices,
TTL logic devices, and p—Mos devices.

            3)    The follow—through by British based firms in terms of
            thevariety of competitive devices using the product—tech-
           nology has continuously dropped relative to American firms.
           Although British firms are responding sooner to the American
           challenge, their competition in terms of relative numbers of
           products based on the innovations (and in terms of the num-
           bers of firms marketing in the U.K.) has fallen.


     The comparisons in terms of imitation lags are given in Table       12. The
figures   give the average time between the innovation's first commercial

appearance in America and its marketing in the United Kingdom by the first

three U.K.—based and U.S.—based firms respectively.


     c)   The State—of—the—Art Introduction
     The state—of—the—art introduction to the UK market represents the first
entry   there whether innovation occurs in America or elsewhere, e.g. Japan in

the tunnel diode case or the UK in the case of light emitting diodes. The

parameter iS     provides   a measure of the UK innovation lag for state—of—the—art

products. The technical competence required to give this kind of advanced

technology is probably contained within a group of firms rather than any single

firm. It consists not only in the ability to innovate, but also in the capacity

to shorten the lead time from idea to prototype innovation and the       lag   time

between innovation in a foreign market and introduction in the host—country market,

such as reflected in the values of the parameter delta, 6.

     The competitive factors behind state—of—the—art (STA) introduction of new

technology are important to our analysis. Their impact is also described in a

discussion     falling in    section d of competitive pressure and the clustering of

introductions. The study of innovating firms shows that the group of firms

responsible for state—of—the—art technology may differ from that group of firms

responsive to competitive pressure and imitating more than leading. For example,

Txas Instruments, a leading semiconductor firm, was responsible for many STA

introductions with leading technology in the late 50's and early 60's. When

its sales became very sizable the company tended more to respond to rather

than initiate new technology areas. Another leading firm, Fairchild, pulled

out of the UK, relinquishing its STA reputation there. Inevitably, as market

size increases, a single firm cannot hope to be STA in all technologies, nor

are the motivations of the leader of the previous technology necessarily the

same in its participation in successive technologies. With increased competi-

tion a large firm may become more defensive than aggressive in its product strategy.

     Associated with the state—of—the—art product introduction may be competitive

factors, which act to reduce 5. These characteristically tend to push the inno-

vator into a new technology earlier than profit maximization on the superseded

technology would demand. Generally this can be expected to entail increased r

and d outlays for all firms along the lines described in the earlier discussion

of the time—cost trade—of fs of market entry (Section 3a), and come to include

not only the innovator, but also a large proportion of the whole population

of market entrants. As the profitability of deferred or late entry diminishes,

the cost of profitable entry increases, since firms, to make a competitive

entry, need to step up their individual prograes of product research and

market promotion. The STA introduction situation may be in such a way also

reflected in an association between 6 and the factors that influence the

clustering of introductions. As already mentioned, competitive pressure may

influence the timing and participation in STA product introductions in a

different manner from that In imitational or delayed entries. Firms sometimes

prefer not to innovate, but to follow a wait—and—see strategy. A large popula-

tion of such firms produces a tendency for clustering of introductions. Tech-

nology transfer from America increases the pressure on U.K—based firms,

carrying out their own research and development, to enter quickly.
                                      — 54 —


    The study of the competitive factors affecting the timix. of STA product

introductions and the clustering of competitive market entries was based on

six variables describing the population of eventual U.K. market entrants whether

British, American, or other foreign based. The model tests for association

between numbers of entrants and variations in the value of tS over the 20 innova-

tions. It includes the variable N*, the total eventual number of participants,

and a variable giving the number of peripheral or new entrants NE. The other

variables were defined by the size and location of r and d activity RD, previous

host country market experience Ne, the size of market sales either in the source

or host country SS, and the licensing of technology through advanced U.S.—based

companies LT. In defining the groups of firms a cutoff for r and d in the UK of

b200,000 towards the relevant technology was used, I.e. a firm spending more in

the U.K. was included in RD. others not. The cut—off of 5Z of U.S. or U.K.

market sales for SS was applied. Previous market experience meant that firms

had marketed products of an earlier major technology in the U.K. The variable

for licensing of U.S. technology was numbers of UK based licencees, e.g. of Bell

Labs, Fairchild.

     Owing to the fact that five of the variables used in the hypothesis testing

represented subgroups of the firms in N* it was of interest to see whether any

of these variables showed a stronger association with 6. The regression analysis

determined that the number of firms carrying out r and d in the UK tended to

be more strongly related to reductions in 6 than N*:

          6        +3.35 —    0.042 N* —       .216 RD   0.04    (5a)
               (+3.16)       (—.97)        (—1.025)

The best explanatory combination of variables in terms of independence and

significance included RD and NE, the number of new peripheral entrants:
                                               —55—

            6 — +3.29             —    .26 RD —       .10    NE      —   0.05        (Sb)
                                    (—1.28)        (—1.03)

The   association between N* and Ne has already been illustrated through
equation (3). The number of experienced firms was more closely related to
reductions       in 6    than N*:

            (5    — +2.66 —            .816 Ne           —    0.03                   (5c)
                        (+3.22)       (—1.3)


These results (5a,b,c) tended to confirm the existence of competitive pressure

acting to push forward the timing of STA introduction reducing 5. The para-

meters and       correlation      coefficients were of the ,ight sign (—).           The consistency

of the   results,        as judged by the significance of the t          statistic   values, suggests

that the actual coefficients estimated should be treated with caution. A slightly

more consistent pattern of association between parameter values and some competitive

factors is found in the case of the clustering of introductions.


 -     d) The Clustering of Introductions
       Competive pressure, especially amongst larger established firms, may result

in a clustered timing of introductions. Firms that have previously maintained

a leading status within the market may seek to hold and extend that lead. At

the very least, they may try to keep up with the new technologies. The effect

of competitive pressure connected                with activities of larger experienced firms
can be   established by examining the association between numbers of large or

advanced firms          (or   their proportion of the total eventual number of firms)

entering   the technology markets and              the   clustering of introductions, as re—
                                               a
flected   in the parameter sigma star a*, i.e. e transforming a to its antilog

or linear base.

       The greater the competitive pressure between firma,                 as may occur     within

specific groups of rival companies, the smaller would we expect to find the

value of a*. As evidence of intense competition, a negative association
                                        — 56 —


between a* and the group size is important. On the other hind, a positive

association between the numbers of eventual market entrants and a is evidence

of the absence of competitive pressure. An interpretation of competitive

pressure is slightly different when the make—up of the eventual population of

entering firms is examined. Then the intensity of competitive pressure is

proposed to be associated with the proportional representation of companies,

within the total participant group, that have specific characteristics. An

eventual population with a higher proportion of a particular type of firm may

be examined for evidence of more intense competitive entry activity. In the

case of peripheral entry the absence of competition may be an important induce-

ment. We may expect to find a positive association between pheripheral entry

and clustering of introductions. The fact of pheripheral entry of itself

probably means a lengthening of the time—spread of initial participation.

     One result of the analysis was that the variable representing numbers of

firms entering with large market sales, SS, tended to be fractionally mOre

significant than the variables N* and Ne. Also while RD had reflected a stronger

association in the case of S it was less important in determining values of a.

A similar picture emerged for N* and Ne, which although contributing marginally

to increases in the intensity of competition, i.e. negative association with i*,

tended to spread out entry more than SS and LT. Variations in the number of UK

licencees of American technology had greatest effect in reducing * and was

significant at 5%:

          5*        2.838 —     .0033 N* —         .1613 LT    0.14      (6a)
                              (—.134)            (—2.17)


Peripheral entry measured by NE/N* was positively associated with i* with the

following result:

               =    2.833 — .068 SS — .141 LT + .99 NE/N*             0.12 •-(6b)
                         (—.45)          (—1.72)      (+.61)
                                     — 57 —


The licencing of American technology by British firms tended to bring about

a greater clustering of introductions while pheripheral entry was greatest

where competitive pressure of this type had less effect.


       e) The Peak—Entry Time

       Use of the lognormal modal means that we can calculate the peak—entry

or modal times for each imitation cycle. This is done using the two       parameters
u and   a   which are part of the formulation giving modal time:

                           2
              Mode—e                                               ()

In   our analysis up to this point little mention has been made of the parameter p,

the   coefficient average of natural log times of market entry, in MS, of equation

(2). By transforming p from in years to years we create we create a parameter

p* which is suitable for linear regression.37 The parameter 1.1* tells us when

one half the eventual number of firms have participated in the market. The mode

gives us the point at which market entry is most rapid. Both variables describe

important aspects of the imitation cycle.

       The eventual number of market entrants N* was found to have very little

association with u and     even   Ne performed poorly:


                   4.03 — 0.034   Ne 2 —      0.01                 (8a)
                  (4.09) (—.46)




       37
       The variable U*    is      U
                          simply e . This transformation creates a variable
that when used in regression analysis gives a linear relationship based on
years rather than in years. It is also the median of our lognormal distribu-
tion showing the point where 50% of entries have taken place.
                                     — 58 —


                                                                 than others.
However, some of the experienced firms may hav greater re1erance
Can an association be found if only the very active leaders are included? To

obtain such a group those firms that have five or more product introductions

in the first five places, as indicated in Table 5, are selected. The number

of such firms in the market prior to the innovation is represented by Ne*.

Regressing Ne* on p* we find:


              —   +5.87 —   0.47 Ne*               0.12                (8b)
                  (4.616) (—1.876)


While the association is not very consistent, the coefficient of the independent

variable is larger and more significant than for Ne. This suggests that the

number of highly innovative firms entering may have some marginal effect in

reducing i*. A similar result is obtained by taking as independent variable

the proportion of firms   carrying   out r and d in the UK:


              —   +4.62 —    2.85    RD/N* 2 0.09                      (8c)
                  (6.47) (—1.675)

Again the presence of such firms acts to reduce the median time.

     The determination of peak-entry time is only partial given the six inde-

pendent variables of the analysis. The following result was derived:


          Mode      +4.322 —    .322    RD — 0.066     NE 2 —   0.01    (9)
                   (+3.52) (—1.34)            (—.55)


The contribution towards a reduction in the modal time varied most consistently

with RD. New entrants had relatively small association with peak—entry times.

     Combining the results of the study of the STA introduction, the clustering

 of innovations and peak entry timing, it has been observed that competitive

 pressure has had the effect of hastening the commercialization of a new commodity.

All four factors mentioned, licencing, r and d, sales size, and previous experience,

 have a marginal influence on the speed at which market entry takes place.    The
                                 — 59 —


timing   determined by the four factors differs, owing to the different circum-

stances and motivations that characterize the groups of firms to which the

four factors apply, or which make up the final composition of market entries.

    The licensing of new technology hastens market entry, but its principal

effect is in the clustering of introductions. The lead time of product innova-

tion and the lag time between introduction in an American market and then the

UK are not necessarily reduced by licensing which may have had an extending

effect. Potential licensees perhaps have waited for the technology and when

they have received it there has been considerable competition within the

licensee group.

     The size of sales has had a similar effect on product introductions as

licensing. Firms with vested interests in existing large markets and defraying

related investment have perhaps tended not to race into state—of—the—art tech-

nology. Rivalry amongst such firms when it comes, however, has been fierce.

     The effect of location and size of r and d facilities has been to bring

about state—of—the—art introduction in the UK earlier than It would otherwise

have been. Nevertheless, the competition amongst such firms has not meant a

strong clustering of introductions. A similar story is associated with previous

market experience. It would appear that some prior knowledge of the market has

helped firms to be state—of—the—art if they so wished. They could also delay

introduction since size of r and d and market knowledge have been important

factors in a deliberately delayed market entry, i.e. the effect of competitive

pressure being not nearly as great on these groups of firms, e.g. of Mullard

and Texas Instruments, that they could not recover some lost ground.

6.    The Place of Individual Firms   in the Product Cycle
      a)   Introduction Lags and Market Participation

      What factors determine the speed with which   individual firms respond to
new technology products? In the following  analysis the lags and places of
individual firms are examined. Not all firms pursue the same technology or
product-market strategy.38 Nevertheless, it is possible to assess the placing
and lags of broad groups and individual companies in response to new technological

opportunities. We begin with British—based companies and      compare   them with American
competitors.     The latter are then considered and the lags of various forms of f or—

eign   ownership compared. The analysis is primarily based on the results of 41

companies marketing the 20 product innovations in the United Kingdom over the

1950—75 period.39

       A conmion assumption is that highly innovative (or imitative) firms that are

familiar with the local market will tend to have shorter imitation lags. The firm's

average lag time for all products, T (in years measured from the date of first

world appearance of the product) was therefore used as the dependent variable

against which was regressed F, the frequency of imitative activity, measured by

the number of the 20 technology products listed that have been marketed in the

host country by the firm from its own production, and A, the length of time that

the firm has been selling in the United Kingdom. The results show that a firm's

active participation in new technology products and the length of time that it

has operated in the host country are associated with a reduction in its average

lag   time.



     38"Corporate Strategy in the Electronics Industry," (Paper presented at the
WESCON Conference), Vol. 12 (2) 1966.

     39The 20 innovations are listed in footnote 12. The thyrister and the
Schottky—barrier diode are excluded from the present analysis.
                                       — 61   —



       T (in years) — 5.26     —      .13 F —        .03 A       —   0.27             (11)
                                (—2.87)           (—0.69)


While the coefficient of A is not significant at the 5% level, it has the

correct sign. The reduction in lag time, partially determined by these two

factors, is consistent with the "learning by doing" hypothesis.

     An analysis of the fifteen firms with largest sales in the UK semiconductor

industry in 1972 suggests that large sales are associated with individual company

performance in Introducing new technology products. The sales of the companies

in the host—country market, Sh, are regressed against an index W, that represents

an aggregated record of each company's relative timing of product introductions

over the twenty semiconductor technologies. The index.W, as illustrated in

Table 5, is compiled by giving state—of—the—art introductions a value of 12,

and subsequent positions values declining from 11 to 1, with the 12th and

following positions all having the value, 1, aggregated as follows for the

ith company:


          W — w1       + ....      +
                                       w2                                      (12)


The results of the regression are given below:


          Sh — —0.95 + 0.0863 w                   2 — 0.54                     (13)
                             (5.88)


Evidently higher sales are associated with the early introduction of new

product or process   technology.

     b) The Experience of American and British Firms

     All British firms have been dependent, in greater or smaller degree, on

the exchange of know—how from American sources through licensing agreements.

More recently several have attempted to pursue an            independent    approach to tech—

nology development, but as   already     explained, this entails high costs, and
                                  — 62 —


longer    lead times. An argument in favor of home—grown tecbology is based on

the long—term considerations of individual firms in their expectations con-

cerning world markets. Some technology is more easily developed given the

expectations for market size of companies based in Britain.40 Individual com-

panies have had to make trade—of fs between volume (off—the—shelf) or custom

designed production, as well as scale of integration,41 all the time aware of

what potential competition could mean to their future operations.

     How do the lag times of British based companies compare with American?

In analyzing the timing of technology introduction by British based companies,42

the lag times of these companies for the twenty innovations were gathered and

the averages computed for individual companies. The average lag time of all

41 firms (British and American) marketing in the United Kingdom has been 4.07

years. The average lag time for British firms alone has generally been lover.

The firm averaging the lowest lag time of British based firms is Ferranti with

2.65 years. The lag time figures for individual U.K. based firms were as follows:




     40Plessey, Ferranti, and S.T.C. have tried to explore various areas of
semiconductors, independent of American technology: Plessey in consumer elec-
tronics, Ferranti in computers, and STC in microwave ICs. The other British
companies, GEC—Marconi—Elliot, and Associated Semiconductor Manufacturers
(through GEC and Philips'—Mullard connection) have depended more on American
and foreign technology.

          least one firm, Plessey, has specialized in custom designed circuits
in the hope of developing a long—term market. STC has utilized a sophisticated
computer—aided design method for large scale interconnection problems.
     42
       For the purposes of this analysis, both Mullard and STC of IT&T are assumed
to be British based. A good proportion of the sales of Mullard come from Asso-
ciated Semiconductor Manufacturers, which is British based. Although IT&T has
had an American company manufacturing its semiconductors, the company is primarily
based in Europe.

            *peripheral manufacturers excluded from average


In comparison American firms     marketing   in the United Kingdom have averaged

4.2 years. The difference between British and American firms in mean lag

times is nearly one year.

       The implications of these figures for British based firms are not really

so encouraging since many American entries arrive later but with a more sophis-

ticated version. The difficulties tend to run as follows. Firstly, when a

product innovation is introduced into the United Kingdom, those American firms

that license the basic process or product technology may also sell to the

British market and have shorter lag times. The American firms, Texas Instruments,

Fairchild, and R.C.A., are very competitive in their lag times. This is shown

in   the following table that gives   the   lags they have averaged over the twenty

technology products that we have considered:
                               — 64 —

         Texas Instruments                            2.45

         Westinghouse (USA)                           2.85

              Average                                 3.15



Secondly, the leading American firms have advantages of greater product

variety in the technology products they introduce derived from serving a

larger home market. Thirdly, when the leading American firms have extracted

the best from British based companies, their imitators in America arrive with

either bargain basement prices, or sophisticated models, higher priced, but

sufficiently differentiated to be very competitive.

     A serious problem for British companies is that the competition is con-

tinuously growing and changing. The American industry has undergone many

structural alterations that have been largely absent in the U.K. except through

American activity, e.g. large—scale entry by big companies at the periphery of

the industry such as Westinghouse, Corning Glass, Union Carbide. The correla-

tion between introduction performance, i.e., the index, W, in equation (12),

within a group of the seventeen most active American firms in the U.K. for

6 planar (early 1960's) devices and 7 integrated circuit (mid— and late 1960's)

devices was found to be only 0.19. The correlation between the same planar

devices and 7 discrete devices of the previous period was found to be 0.68.

This is a clear indication that entry strategies and company and company com-

position of the industry have changed. Within the potentially profitable and
                               — 65 —


growing U.S. markets there is constant peripheral entry, and entry by small
breakaway groups of the larger companies. British—based firms have to adapt

to this competition.

     Licensing is a way for British—based firms to compete. To be on a par

with American companies they may need to source more of their technology in

America, and sell to the European and world markets. They inevitably require

a larger market if they are to create in time new technology needed to be

competitive.


     c) Imitation Lags, Transnational Activity, and Patterns of Foreign
        Ownership

     What association is there between imitation lags (selling in the host

country) and forms or patterns of transnational activity? There are at least

five methods for American firms to exploit their technology in foreign markets:

(1) exports; (2) licensing of manufacturing and sales rights; (3) Joint ventures

with foreign partners; (4) outright sale of technology; (5) subsidiary manufac-

ture and distribution. In the last the firm may either go in for full produc-

tion or point—of—sale assembly.43

     To ascertain what imitation lags are associated with the various forms of

transnational activity the data of forty-one companies are used over the same

twenty technology products of the previous section. A firm may first export

to the UK and then produce in the UK. For a given innovation only the first

route employed is included in the averages. The results were as follows:




     43Finan (1975] also considers these forms of activity in relation to
the semiconductor industry.

     *Includes the first route used by individual firms per innovation.


Obviously licensees have been successful in reaching the market earlier, but

the crucial relationships are between the licensor and licensee, and the fre-

quency of imitation (and number of firms taking part that are British based).

The average for the major licensors has already been shown to be less than 3.2

years, which is ahead of the licensees.44

     Imitation lags are one measure of imitative activity, but some firms are

more active in developing and imitating technology products. What is the rela-

tionship between the weighted index of performance in introducing new products,

W, and the form and pattern of transnational activity? The following figures

for W were calculated:




     44One method of relating lag times to the form of transnatlonal activity
is through regression analysis using dummy variables. The  dummy variable X1
has the value 1 if the observation is for a British based  licensee and 0 if
not; similarly X2 has the value 1 if the firm -has a manufacturing subsidiary
or POS assembly, and 0 if not. The regression is as follows:

          T (years) =    4.84    —    1.51     X1
                                                    —     1.12 X2   R2    0.28

       6) Licensee (British based)                                  77.88


The weighted index W shows the Important roles played by licensees and wholly

owned   subsidiaries     in the exploitation of technology products in the host

country. The licensing of new            technology   is a means whereby American firms        both
exploit their technology advantages and            assist British   based firms   to   compete

more effectively internationally as well as in the host country.

       d) Company Size and the Rate         of   Imitation. What effect does company size

have on the rate at which individual U.S. companies imitate technology products

in the host country? This question may be answered by examining the experience

of 17 U.S. companies that have sales in the U.K. For each of these an index

of its record, W, in introducing twenty semiconductor technology products has

been calculated as given in Table 5. It is hypothesized that the index value

of the company in the host country is determined by its size, S, and                   the   length

of time it has been selling in the host—country market, A. For a variable re-

flecting company size, the figures for total worldwide sales of the companies

in 1973,       mn., were used.        The results are as follows:

              W        —41.90 +       0.19S + 5.3A            2
                       (2.316)    (4.536)        (4.906)     i — 0.75         (10)

Size    and   length   of time   in   the host country market clearly influence the product—

technology      activity   of American     firms in   the United Kingdom.
                                            — 68 —




        This   paper has examined the factors that affect the pattern of introduc-
tion of semiconductor innovations into the United Kingdom, studying both
differences anon products            and differences among         firms.
        Taking 20 individual innovations as units of observation we found that

tile   spread of a technology in the          U.K.,    in terms of    the   number of firms
eventually      marketing a product, to be greater in those products for which
more producers had previous ezperience marketing in                   the   U.K., more companies
rarketed in the U.S.. and sales were large in                   the U.S.

        The    jag   between   the first introduction of a product anywhere and the
introduction into         the U.K.   has   declined between the       l950s    and the   1960's.
The    earliest      U.S.—based firms in the U.K. in terms of new             product    introductions

have tended to be somewhat ahead of the earliest U.K.—based firms, since the

beginning of the 1960's, although not before that.

        Ue were not very successful in explainiiw differences among                 products in
t'e    delay between first introduction anywhere and introduction in the U.K.

There   were some signs that the           degree    of competitive pressure had some in—

              on this delay because tile number of firms            eventually   participating,

the number of firms with previous marketing experience in the U.K., and the

amount of R. & D. conducted on the product by U.K. firms all were negatively,

although weakly, related to the delay. Once a product was                      introduced    into the

U.K. its rate of diffusion among U.K. producing firms was increased by the

presence       of more   U.K. licensees of      U.S. technology in the product and by the
presence       of large   firms   among    the producers.      Another measure of the speed of

diffusion is the time required for half                of the eventual      participants to enter

the market. The larger            tile number   of    firms   experienced in   the U.S. market and
active    in new product introductions,              and the larger   the proportion of firms
doing    research in      the U.K., the     more rapid was the entrance of         firms into the
                                       — 69 —


market.   Thus, more R. & D., more firms with experience in the U.K., more

licensees of U.S. technology, and larger size of firms all tended to speed

the introduction and diffusion of a product in the U.K. market.

      Looking at differences among firms, we found that larger firms, those

that had been in the U.K. market a long time, and those that marketed many

new products in the U.K., tended to introduce new products earlier. U.K.—

based firms as a group introduced new products into the U.K. somewhat earlier

than the average U.S.—based firm, but those U.S. firms that were licensors

preceded most U.K. firms. To tJ.S.—based firms, Texas Instruments and

Fairchild, had shorter introduction delays than any British—baseY firm.

Even the late imitators from the U.S. were not uncompetitive because they

often entered the market sellinc' at very low prices or with sophisticated,

differentiated products, different enough to provide competition for earlier

producers but not different enough to be listed as major innovations.

      Then   we exariined the   type   of transnational activity involved in product
introductions by each of the 41 companies we found         that   the shortest lays
were for introductions by U.S. licensors and then those by U.K.—based licensees,
followed by wholly—owned sales subsidiaries of U.S.—based firms and by whoily—
owned   manufacturinc     or assembly subsidiaries. In terms of activity      in introducin
new products, which takes account of the        number of new products and the rank in
introducing      them, rather than only the average lag for those products that are

introduced, British—based licensees were the most active, followed by U.S.—

based manufacturing subsidiaries and then by U.S.—based POS assembly subsidiaries.

By both measures, exporting without U.K. sales subsidiaries was the slowest method.

      Product innovation in semiconductors in the U.K. is clearly heavily dependent

on   ties with    U.S.   firms, whether through licensing or through U.S. ownership of
British firms. Licensing does not seem to be a          substitute for direct sales by
