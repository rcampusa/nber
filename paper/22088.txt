Efficient Local Government Service Provision: The Role of Privatization and Public Sector
Unions

                                           ABSTRACT

Local governments spend roughly $1.6 trillion per year to provide a variety of public services
ranging from police and fire protection to public schools and public transit. However, we know
little about public sector’s productivity in delivering key services. To understand the productivity
both over time and across space, we examine public bus service, which represents a standardized
output for benchmarking the cost of local government service provision. There is significant
dispersion across transit agencies in the operating cost per bus mile with the highest being more
than three times as high as the lowest among top 20 largest cities by population. We estimate the
cost savings from privatization and explore the political economy of why privatization rates are
lower in high cost unionized areas. Our analysis finds that the full privatizaton could result in cost
savings of $5.7 billion in 2011 and that the gain in economic efficiency from more closely
aligning bus fares with production costs would be worth at least half a billion dollars.

1. INTRODUCTION

         Over the last several decades, there have been large productivity gains in the private sector. For
example, the U.S manufacturing sector’s average annual productivity growth was 4.7% from 2000 to
2007 and it was 2.1% from 2008 to 2015. 2 Similar productivity gains are unlikely to have occurred for
the public sector because the sector is labor intensive in general and is likely to suffer from Baumol’s
Disease such that the cost of provision rises over time (Baumol 1967). For key local public services
such as public schools, garbage collection, public transit services, fire protection and snow removal, we
know little about local government productivity dynamics in delivering such services. Local public
services represent a major expenditure category ($1.6 trillion dollars were spent in 2012, amounting to
9.2% of total GDP). State and local governments employed 19.3 million people in year 2012, over 13
percent of total employment.
         In the absence of public sector productivity gains, rising costs for public services mean that local
taxpayers face a higher tax burden. But part of these taxpayer expenditures are collected as higher
wages by the public employees who earn more from public sector jobs than their next best alternative
and are shielded from unemployment risk associated with private competitive labor markets. 3 As of
2014, the median hourly wage paid by the Chicago Transit Agency to bus drivers was $32.25 and the
25th percentile was $24.2 per hour. During a time of great concern about income inequality, public
employment offers stable middle-class jobs for less educated and disadvantaged workers (Alesina, et. al
2000, Boustan and Margo 2009).
         A challenge in studying public sector productivity trends arises because key indicators such as
street safety or local school quality is both a function of who chooses to live in an area and the local
government’s ability to deliver quality services. Without a standardized metric of quality, it is quite
challenging to evaluate the public sector’s service efficiency at a point in time across cities or over time
for the same city. In this paper, we argue that the operating cost of moving a bus one mile offers a
standardized metric for ranking local government service efficiency. A distinctive feature of bus travel
is its simple Leontief production function featuring three key inputs; a driver, a bus, and fuel. The bus

 Prior studies document how the public-sector wage premium is even higher when taxpayers respond inelastically to tax
hikes. Brueckner and Neumark (2014) document how public employees are able to extract rents from local taxpayers in areas
with attractive natural amenities. Public sector wages rise in absolute terms relative to private-sector wages in the presence of
such amenities. This relationship is stronger for unionized public-sector workers. Diamond (2016) finds similar results in
areas with inelastic housing supply.


                                                                2
and the fuel needed to move the bus are traded on a national market (Kahn, Li and Nickelsburg 2015).
Labor represents over 80% of the cost.
        An inefficient transit agency can have a high operating cost per mile for two main reasons. It can
overpay bus drivers and mechanics relative to their local opportunity cost or it can hire too many drivers
and mechanics relative to the efficient level of employment. While a for-profit firm in a competitive
industry would have sharp incentives to engage in cost minimization, non-profit public transit agencies
have weaker incentives to do so as they face pressure from unions and local political leaders. 4 We study
the role of public sector unions as a key determinant of public transit operating cost differentials across
space and time.
        Privatization represents one strategy for checking local union power and mitigating Baumol’s
disease. A transit agency that privatizes a fraction of its bus miles is outsourcing a contract to private
sector firms. This action (and even the threat of this action) could discipline public sector unions and is
likely to enhance public sector efficiency (as measured by the cost per bus mile). We provide new
estimates of the effect of privatization on the cost of government service provision. To identify the
causal effect, we address the fact that privatization is an endogenous choice by employing a regression
discontinuity (RD) design based on mayoral elections similar to Ferreira and Gyourko (2009). The
political affiliation of city mayors can play an important role in public service provisions and the
propensity for privatization increases when a Republican wins office.
        The results from the RD design show that bus transit agencies experience substantial cost savings
from privatizing: transit agencies can reduce per-mile operating costs by nearly 70 percent from
privatizing the service provision, holding other factors constant. In addition to testing for the average
effect of privatization, we also document that privatization has larger efficiency-improving effects for a
city’s dominant transit agency and in areas with strong union power. Our findings are consistent with
private enterprises operating at a lower cost and higher efficiency relative to their public counterparts.
Private entities hire fewer laborers and engage in less “featherbedding” relative to public transit
agencies.

  Winston (2010) provides a review of several institutionalized protections that inhibit labor production efficiencies. These
include: powerful transit worker unions; Section 13(C) of the 1964 Federal Transit Act, which obligates a transit employer to
pay extremely costly severance packages to divested employees; excessive administrative staffing in order to fulfill federal
bureaucratic obligations; and large transit subsidies which discourage efficiency improvements. Excessive administrative
staffing mandated by the subsidizing-government institutions are further documented by Lave (1991). Winston (2000)
reviews how policymakers in charge of public entities tend to be responsive to political influences rather than market
influences at the expense of efficiency.


                                                              3
         After estimating the effect of privatization on the cost of bus service provision, we use our
estimates to conduct a welfare analysis. We quantify the deadweight loss from public provision of high-
cost services and provide new estimates of the cost of transferring income to the public sector unions
relative to the deadweight loss. Larger cities with strong union power experience substantial losses in
consumer surplus from costly public transit. Our estimates suggest that fully privatizing all bus transit
would produce cost savings of approximately $5.7 billion, or 30% of total US bus transit operating
expenses. The increased usage of public transit from the corresponding cost reduction would lead to a
gain in social welfare of at last $524 million.
         The paper is organized as follows. Sections 2 describes the relationship between labor unions
and transit operating costs across the U.S. Sections 3 and 4 present our theoretical model of transit
service provision and our empirical identification strategy, respectively. Section 5 describes the context
and the data while Section 6 discusses our empirical results. We provide estimates of social welfare
losses in Section 7, and Section 8 concludes.


2. Spatial and Temporal Variation in Operating Costs of Bus Transit
         The cost of operating a public bus varies greatly across U.S. cities. Table 1 compares the
operating cost of public costs (in cost per mile) across the twenty largest urbanized areas in the U.S. in
2012. The cost per mile is calculated as total annual operating costs divided by total annual vehicle miles
traveled (VMT). (See Appendix 1 for details on the line items of operating costs.) These values range
from $5.57 per mile in Tampa, Florida, to $18.67 in New York City, New York. Much of this variation
is driven by variation in wages paid to drivers and mechanics. In particular, transit agencies operating in
states with strong union power have higher costs per mile. Figure 1 compares the average operating
costs per mile over time for transit agencies in weak bargaining states versus strong bargaining states. 5
Costs per mile are consistently higher in strong bargaining states. Table 2 illustrates how the 90th



5
  State bargaining rights data are sourced from R.G. Valletta and R.B. Freeman (1988), "The NBER Public Sector Collective
Bargaining Law Data Set." Appendix B. The level of a state’s collective bargaining provision are coded as values ranging
from 0 (no state laws relevant to bargaining rights) to 6 (state law dictates employer is obligated to negotiate and come to
written agreement with unionized public employee). We classify states with strong bargaining rights laws are those where
legislative mandate either implicitly or explicitly dictates public employers and union employees must come to an agreement
on contract negotiations (values 5 and 6). States with weak bargaining rights laws either prohibit collective bargaining all
together, or do not mandate that the public employer bargain with unions (values 4 or less). Courts have typically interpreted
an absence of provision for collective bargaining (value of 0) as prohibiting collective bargaining (Freeman and Valletta
(1988)), thus we include states classified as level 0 as weak bargaining rights states.


                                                              4
percentile of costs per mile in weak bargaining states is consistently lower than the 50th percentile
among strong bargaining states.
       In contrast, privatization shares are consistently lower in strong bargaining states. A transit
agency’s privatization share is the ratio of privatized vehicle miles traveled to total vehicle miles
traveled. Table 1 illustrates how the average privatization share for the twenty largest urbanized areas is
negatively correlated with cost per mile. San Diego, CA, for example, was 63% privatized as of 2012,
and had a cost per mile of $7.09. San Jose, CA on the other hand, which has a similar cost-of-living
index, had an average cost per mile nearly 56% higher than that of San Diego at $12.63, and this
agency’s bus transit is operated almost completely in-house (the privatization share is 1.3%).
       Figure 2 displays the growth in privatization shares, comparing strong and weak bargaining
states. Strong bargaining rights states have lower privatization shares across the board. Taken together,
Figures 1 and 2 illustrate a paradox whereby transit agencies with higher costs are less likely to
privatize. Union power appears to simultaneously increase transit agency costs and limit the degree to
which the transit agency can outsource their operations.
       For some major cities including Boston, Chicago, Denver, and Houston, we are able to access
their administrative salary databases listing their universe of bus operators. These data provide the count
of drivers and their salary or hourly wage. In Table 3 we report the empirical distributions of current
hourly wages for these major transit agencies, as well as descriptive summary statistics on employee
utilization, union presence and mean home prices in each city. Boston and Chicago have stronger union
presence relative to Houston or Denver because the share of unionized workers in these urbanized areas
are higher and because Massachusetts and Illinois are non-right-to-work states. Note that cities with a
stronger union presence have more employees per VMT and higher wages paid to transit agency
employees. The employees earning the 25th percentile wage in Boston and Chicago earn more than the
75th percentile employees in Houston or Denver. It is unlikely that housing costs entirely explain this
divergence in pay. Chicago has lower average home prices than Denver.


3. A Model of Transit Service Provision and Privatization

       Each transit agency is required to forecast aggregate demand for its services and then to prepare
to supply these miles by purchasing buses, fuel and hiring drivers and mechanics. We model the
manager’s decision as choosing operating inputs to minimize the total operating cost conditional on



                                                      5
capital and fleet inputs. Managerial decisions on capital and fleet procurement are less frequent relative
to operating input decisions of labor, maintenance, and fuel. While Li, Kahn and Nickelsburg (2015)
study the durable bus investment decision and its implications on energy efficiency for transit agencies,
we focus on the labor input decisions and productivity under the influence of labor union rules.

3.1 Optimization and Input Decisions

         A transit agency provides service (i.e., vehicle miles) using three essential inputs: the physical
input (bus), fuel, and labor. The production function is Leontief:

                                   𝑄 = min �𝑔𝑘 (𝐾, 𝜂𝑘 ), 𝑔𝑙 (𝐿, 𝜂𝑙 )𝑔𝑓 (𝐹, 𝜂 𝑓 )�,                            (1)

where Q denotes the amount of bus service demanded, K the number of buses, L labor input and F fuel
input. 𝜂𝑘 , 𝜂 𝑓 and 𝜂𝑙 are productivity shocks (including both observed and unobserved to researchers)
that affect how efficiently these inputs produce the service. The function 𝑔𝑘 (.) translates buses into
effective capital (i.e., buses in full operation). The function 𝑔𝑙 (.) translates labor inputs (e.g., number of
full-time equivalent employees) into effective labor (e.g., non-idle). The function 𝑔𝑓 (.) translates the fuel
input into energy used to propel the bus and is affected by bus fuel economy, engine type and
unobserved shocks such as driving conditions.

         The transit managers first decide the physical input K through capital investment to meet the
(expected) local demand for bus services. Then they decide the fuel and labor inputs to operate the buses
while observing shocks denoted by 𝜂. We focus on the operation stage where transit agency managers
choose inputs to minimize the operating costs while meeting the demand of the service area.

         The static optimization problem can be defined as:

                                              min 𝑊 ∗ 𝐿 + 𝑃 ∗ 𝐹
                                              {𝐸,𝐿}


                              𝑠. 𝑡. min�𝑔𝑘 (𝐾, 𝜂𝑘 ), 𝑔𝑙 (𝐿, 𝜂𝑙 ), 𝑔𝑓 (𝐹, 𝜂 𝑓 )� = 𝑄� ,

where W is wage and P is fuel price. We assume the following functional forms for 𝑔𝑙 (𝐿, 𝜂𝑙 ) and
𝑔𝑓 (𝐹, 𝜂 𝑓 ):

                                           𝑔𝑙 (𝐿, 𝜂𝑙 ) = 𝐿 ∗ exp(𝜂𝐿 )




                                                         6
                                                𝑔𝑓 (𝐹, 𝜂 𝑓 ) = 𝐹 ∗ exp (𝜂 𝑓 )

The optimal fuel and labor inputs and the total cost function can be written as:

                                                       𝐿∗ = 𝑄� / exp(𝜂𝐿 ),                                                    (2)

                                                       𝐹 ∗ = 𝑄� /exp (𝜂 𝑓 ).                                                  (3)

The total cost function can be expressed as:

                                        𝑇𝐶 ∗ = 𝑄� [𝑊/ exp(𝜂𝐿 ) + 𝑃/exp (𝜂 𝑓 ) ].                                              (4)

         Conditional on the capital investment decision (i.e. the bus type), fuel productivity shocks, 𝜂 𝑓 ,
are mainly dependent upon congestion and other local driving conditions. These forces are arguably out
of the control of transit agency managers and are treated as exogenous to their cost minimization
decision. 6 Labor productivity shocks (𝜂𝐿 ), on the other hand, are dependent upon local labor and
political conditions which the transit agency manager may be able to counteract through the use of
private contractors. Labor input decisions are the major determinant of a transit agency’s cost
minimizing problem.
         Wages for bus transit workers depend upon local prevailing wages, as well as public sector union
strength. There are two main avenues through which unions increase the costs of transit service
provisions. First, the majority of transit union labor contracts place substantial limits on use of part-time
workers. Contracts either stipulate minimum eight-hour shifts, or require a minimum ratio of all runs be
“straight runs” as opposed to “split runs”. 7 These rules work in direct opposition to the heavily peaked
demand of transit service. During midday lulls, workers may be paid even when they are not driving. On
the other hand, if a driver works more than an eight-hour shift - extending between morning and evening
peak demand - the additional hours are compensated as over-time pay. 8 If managers are able to negotiate
for part-time employees, they must pay concessions in the form of wages or benefits that often outweigh
gains from lower labor utilization (Giuliano & Lave 1989). By limiting the use of part-time labor, public
sector union strength enters into the 𝜂𝐿 term in equation (1), and inhibit the translation of employees into

desired quantity, 𝑄� .

  “Split runs” partition driver duties into multiple pieces for a given route, as opposed to a “straight run” where a driver works
a continuous eight-hour day. (MacKechnie (2015); Bloomberg 2013).
8
  In 2010, over time costs paid to New York City’s MTA employees amounted to 13 percent of payroll, or the equivalent of
employing 7,000 additional full-time workers (Bloomberg 2013).


                                                                7
fully-utilized, effective labor. The second avenue through which unions increase the cost of service
provision is pensions and fringe benefits. The costs of union workers’ pensions can amount to 50
percent of their direct wage bill (Black 1991; DiSalvo 2010). Higher unit costs serve to increase 𝑊 in
equation (4).
         A unionized transit agency is likely to pay a higher wage per hour and to have more drivers and
mechanics on payroll than would be predicted by the cost-minimizing decision under competitive labor
markets. The net effect is a higher average cost per mile of bus service. Figure 1 illustrates the positive
correlation between average unit cost of bus service and state union strength. Non-right-to-work states
exhibit consistently higher unit cost over time relative to right-to-work states. Figure 2 illustrates how
privatization of bus transit is consistently higher among right-to-work states, where union presence has a
lower impact on state bargaining laws. 9

         Figure 3 depicts the optimization problem of transit agency managers discussed above. The
technology is represented by the isoquant curve for each level of bus service provision. The vertex point
is the cost minimizing input choice and the line passing through that point is the isocost curve. Here we
assume that the input markets are competitive. For example, the labor market is free of union influence
and the wage rate determined by the competitive labor market. However, the realized total cost for the
same level of output could be higher due to two potential reasons: inefficient input use and higher input
prices. The upper isocost curve in Figure 3 illustrates both channels: it uses more labor for the same
level of bus service while the labor cost is higher (a steeper slope).
         Now that we have modeled the cost of producing bus miles under alternative local rules, we
introduce the privatization decision, which is one strategy transit agency managers can use to counteract
union influence and cut costs.


3.2 The Privatization Decision
         The ultimate goal of privatization by transit agencies is to reduce costs especially in the face of a
tight budget. Many cities use privatization as a way to reduce costs for other types of service
provisions. 10 Local and state level economics conditions affect the revenue base that provides the

9
  In a study on the impacts of state legal environment on county-level privatization of public services, Lopez-de-Silanes,
Shleifer, and Vishny (1997) find prohibition on public employee political activity and low unionization encourage
privatization of public services.
10
   Levin and Tadelis (2010) examine the privatization decision of city services by examining the probability of privatizing
city services as a function of service- and city- specific characteristics. They conclude that services for which it is harder to
measure and monitor performance are less likely to be privatized. In their empirical work, they find that cities which are


                                                                8
majority of the operating funding for bus services. Therefore, sluggish economic growth could provide
the impetus for transit agencies to explore the cost-cutting options such as privatization, especially in
areas more vulnerable to macroeconomic fluctuations such as a weak local housing market. A strong
public sector presence can increase the unit cost of public service provision, but also make it harder to
privatize. The opponents of privatization often argue that the public sector provides steady, well-paying
jobs for middle class minorities and that the service from private contractors are less safe, less reliable
and, ultimately, more expensive. 11

         The decision to privatize transit operations originates either with agency management or with a
governing body of the agency, such as a county board of supervisors. The agency seeks bids from
multiple private competitors. Contract lengths generally span one to three years, after which the transit
agency management again seeks bids from competitors (Iseki et al. 2005). Most often, the transit agency
pays the private firm a negotiated fixed rate per unit of service delivered.

         The privatization of certain service routes includes a wide range of contractual arrangement
between the transit agency and private contractors. Contract specifications can range from managerial or
maintenance assistance alone, to full “turn-key” relationships, where the contractor performs all
essential roles including financial management, procurement, marketing and scheduling. In most
instances, private firms are contracted to manage personnel who operate and maintain the buses for a
sub-set of service routes offered by the public transit agency. In some instances, private firms are
contracted to operate all routes offered by the public agency. The private firm is in charge of hiring,
compensating, and scheduling employees, as well as negotiating labor contracts with union
representatives. Transit agencies retain control over key policy decisions, including service levels, fares,
annual operating plans, and contractual compliance. The transit agency is also in charge of budgeting
and financing operations, and maintains ownership of all equipment, vehicles, and facilities.
         Most private contractors of bus transit are national or multinational firms. 12 While market forces
incentivize private firms to keep costs at competitive levels, private firms further benefit from


larger, newer, or in the western part of the U.S. are more likely to contract out public services to private providers. They also
find a negative correlation between city expenditure per capita and privatization of public service.

economies of scale in ways that public providers cannot. Accumulated experience garnered from
managing several transit agencies at once and negotiating with labor unions enable private firms to
employ labor and other operating inputs in a more cost-efficient way than their public counterparts. For
example, the demand for bus service is highly peaked in the morning and evening commute hours.
Private contractors can hire part-time workers to meet the demand during peak hours while public transit
agencies have more limited ability to negotiate for part-time labor use in the face of public sector unions.


4. The Effects of Privatization and Unions on the Cost of Service Provision

        Whether and to what extent privatization reduces the cost of public service provision are
contentious issues. Using panel data on hundreds of transit agencies’ annual operating costs, we seek to
understand why agencies differ with respect to their cost of service provision and what role privatization
plays in lowering such costs. Since privatization is a choice, we must explicitly model the determinants
of this endogenous variable.


4.1 The Empirical Specification

        To examine the effect of privatization and other factors such as public sector unions on
efficiency and input costs, we specify the productivity shocks to labor (𝜂𝑙 ) in equation (2) as a function
of privatization and other factors:

                                            𝜂𝑙 = −𝑑𝛾 − 𝑥𝛽 − 𝜀,                                           (5)

where d is a variable characterizing the level of privatization from 0 (no privatization) to 1 (full
privatization of all bus service). x are other observed covariates that affect productivity and 𝜀 are
unobserved to researchers.

        With the optimal labor inputs and productivity shocks from equations (2) and (5), we can write
the unit labor cost, 𝑙, as the following:

                          𝑙 = 𝐿∗ ∗ 𝑊/𝑄� = 𝑊/exp (𝜂𝑙 )= 𝑊/exp (−𝑑𝛾 − 𝑥𝛽 − 𝜀).

Performing a log transformation on the input cost equation yields:

                                       ln(𝑙) = ln(𝑊) + 𝑑𝛾 + 𝑥𝛽 + 𝜀.                                      (6)




                                                     10
         Our measure of W is the average weekly wage earned by a full-time worker without any college
education in the urbanized area. The earnings data are sourced from the BLS Current Population Survey.
We use the urbanized-area average wage for two reasons. First, we do not observe wages (and benefits)
that transit agencies pay their employees. Second, the actual wages paid to transit employees are an
endogenous choice made by the agency. The BLS-sourced wage data provide a measure of the
competitive market wage for a low skill employee in a given urbanized area and thus are unlikely to be
correlated with transit agency-specific costs. Therefore, we include a coefficient for ln(𝑊) in the
regression. Denote a transit agency by i and time by t, we rewrite equation (6) as:

                                 ln(𝑙𝑖𝑡 ) = 𝛼ln(𝑊𝑖𝑡 ) + 𝑑𝑖𝑡 𝛾 + 𝑥𝑖𝑡 𝛽 + 𝜏𝑡 + 𝜂𝑠 + 𝜀𝑖𝑡 .                                     (7)

         Equation (7) provides the basis for our empirical analysis. We include variables in x such as
union strength and collective bargaining to control for the difference between the compensation of
transit workers (reflected in the labor cost data) and the wage variable used in our regression (the
average wage of all workers without college degree). We also include a set of time fixed effects 𝜏𝑡 to
control for common time trends across transit agencies and state fixed effects 𝜂𝑠 to control for time-
invariant shocks within a state.


4.2 Identifying the Effect of Privatization

         The decision for a transit agency to privatize some (or all) of their operations is likely to be
influenced by local characteristics as well as expectations about future operations and service demand,
each of which may not be fully captured by 𝑥𝑖𝑡 and may affect agency unit costs, 𝑙𝑖𝑡 . The inability to
control for such factors will render 𝜀𝑖𝑡 to be correlated with the treatment, 𝑑𝑖𝑡 , which will bias estimates
of 𝛾. To address this identification challenge, we employ a regression discontinuity design by using data
on mayoral election and partisanship of the elected mayors. 13 Partisanship impacts public spending and
the propensity to privatize public services (Gerber and Hopkins, 2011; Richmond, 2001). 14 All else


13
   In Appendix 2, we also provide results based on three alternative strategies as robustness checks: the first one uses as the
instrument variable a Bartik measure of state employment growth and a city’s average cost of housing, the second uses labor
contract cycles as an instrument for privatization, and the third compares transit costs between buses and subways (which, by
their nature cannot be privatized) for cities that have both modes of transportation. Although these strategies are based on
different identification assumptions, the empirical findings from these robustness checks are all consistent with those from
the RDD.
14
   Between 1998 and 2014, the Amalgamated Transit Union (the largest transit worker’s union in the nation), allocated an
average of 93% of its political campaign contributions to democratic candidates (see OpenSecrets.org Center for Responsive
Politics).


                                                              11
equal, a republican mayor is more likely to engage in privatizing compared to a democratic mayor. We
exploit the discontinuity in treatment levels generated by narrowly won mayoral elections as a source of
pseudo-random assignment of privatization.

         In an RD framework, whether the winning margin of the democratic candidate (i.e. the running
variable) falls on one side of a fixed cutoff or the other partly determines treatment intensity. The
winning margin is defined as the difference between the percentages of votes received by the winner and
the runner-up. A winning margin of 0% is the fixed cutoff determining the political party of the winner;
a 0% winning margin implies both the republican and the democrat received 50% of the total vote share.
We define the winning margin to be positive if the democratic candidate won, and negative if the
republican candidate won. 15

         The critical assumption underlying our empirical strategy is that transit agencies in cities with
mayoral elections in a narrow window around the 0 winning margin threshold are similar on observable
and unobservable dimensions. 16 We verify in the next section that covariates other than the treatment
level (privatization share) that might affect the outcome of interest (labor costs) do not change
discontinuously at the winning margin threshold for democratic victory. Further, although political party
affiliation does not perfectly determine privatization., the probability of treatment changes sharply at the
winning margin threshold. The discontinuity we use is fuzzy because there is non-compliance to engage
in privatization: some agencies with republican mayors do not privatize and some agencies with
democratic mayors do privatize. However, we show in Figure 5 that agencies in cities where the
republican candidate won are significantly more likely to privatize a portion of their operations. The data
used to generate Figure 5 are explained in greater detail in the next section.

         A second critical assumption for a valid RD design is that transit agencies cannot precisely
manipulate mayoral election voting outcomes, and subsequently select into the treatment (Lee &
Lemieux 2010). While this assumption is not directly testable, we provide evidence in the next section to
obviate concerns about manipulation of the running variable. It is unlikely that for our sample of
election outcomes with voter turnout ranging from 3,000 to 257,000 (in cities with populations ranging




15
   The winning margin ranges from -1 to 1 and it takes value -1 if none of the candidates are democrats and 1 if all the
candidates are democrats.
16
   See Lee and Lemieux (2010) for a comprehensive discussion of regression discontinuity designs.


                                                              12
from 59,000 to 1.8 million), voters were able to precisely manipulate voting outcomes. 17 The evidence
described in the next section suggests that there is no impact of the treatment on sample selection.
Consequently, for transit agencies in UZA’s with close margins of victory, the political affiliation of
republican or democrat is assigned essentially at random. To the extent that political affiliation impacts
public transit operating costs only through its effect on privatization levels, mayoral political affiliation
may act as an instrument for a transit agency’s privatization share.

         Our empirical model of the privatization decision is specified as follows:

                                            𝑑𝑖𝑡 = 𝜆𝐿𝑖𝑡 + 𝑃(𝑀𝑖𝑡 ; 𝜅) + 𝑧𝑖𝑡 𝛿 + 𝜖𝑖𝑡                                           (8)

         where 𝐿𝑖𝑡 is the dummy variable being 1 for a democrat mayor and zero otherwise. 𝑃(𝑀𝑖𝑡 ; 𝜅) is a
flexible polynomial function of the Democrat’s winning margin (𝑀𝑖𝑡 ). 𝑧𝑖𝑡 includes other control
variables including fixed effects. Equation (8) provides the first-stage regression in the analysis of the
cost equation (7). Our preferred specification for the control function 𝑃 is quadratic, however we show
in Figure 5 our results vary little after using cubic or quartic polynomials. For all specifications, we
allow the polynomial coefficients to differ above and below the cutoff. We estimate the treatment effect
using two-stage least squares, following Hahn, Todd, and van der Klaaw (2001).

         Comparing outcomes across UZA’s within a sufficiently narrow window around the winning
margin cutoff permits one to draw causal inferences regarding the effects of privatization on public
transit operating costs. Our fuzzy RD design provides a weighted average of the effects of privatization
for transit agencies in UZA’s with mayoral elections near the winning margin threshold, where weights
reflect the ex ante likelihood that of the agency’s mayoral winning margin being close to the threshold.
We test for heterogeneous treatment effects and find substantial variation in the effect of privatization on
labor costs, depending on whether an agency operates in a state with strong or weak bargaining rights
laws, and depending on the transit agency size.




17
  Near the winning margin threshold, voter turnout is comparable for UZA’s on either side of the threshold. Average voter
turnout is 48,500 for elections where the winner won by less than 20% of the vote share. Voter turnout is negatively
correlated with winning margin. DiNardo and Lee (2004) observe this same trend in their analysis of union elections. The
smallest voter turnout in their sample is 20, substantially smaller than the voter turnout observed in our mayoral elections.


                                                              13
5. Data Source and Description
5.1 Data Sources
           Our primary data source is the government-sponsored National Transit Database (NTD). Any
transit agency that receives grants or financing from the Federal Transit Administration must report data
to the NTD. Our analysis focuses on transit agencies providing fixed-route, public bus transit. We
obtained information on annual vehicle miles traveled (VMT), passenger miles traveled (PMT),
operating costs, fuel use, fleet characteristics, and number of accidents and fatalities per year for 328
transit agencies from 1998 to 2011, for a total of 3,706 transit agency-year observations. Our sample of
transit agencies includes all 50 of the largest public agencies that operate buses, as ranked by passenger
trips as of 2011. 18 These data cover 236 distinct urbanized areas (UZA’s) across the U.S. Agencies are
required to partition their reported operating cost and service information between services that were
directly operated and those that were outsourced to a private contractor. We construct the privatization
share by dividing the reported privatized VMT by total annual VMT. As of 2011, approximately 43
percent of transit agencies outsourced their operations to some degree between 1998 and 2011. Of those
transit agencies, roughly half privatized 100 percent of their VMT for at least one year between 1998
and 2011. Fleet characteristics sourced from NTD include the size and average age of the bus fleet, the
share of the fleet that is hybrid or operating on compressed natural gas (CNG), and the organizational
type. We codify transit agencies as: an independent agency, a city agency, or “other” which includes
agencies operated by the state DOT or planning agency subsidiaries. 19
           NTD reports operating costs which includes labor costs (salaries, wages, benefits, and pensions),
costs of fuel, materials and supplies, utility costs, taxes, and liability costs. They do not report these
individual components separately. They do report fuel usage data and based on fuel prices from the U.S.
Energy Information Administration, we can construct the fuel costs. Based on reported operating costs
and fuel costs estimates, we calculate the operating costs net of fuel costs. The labor cost is the major
component and in our analysis below, and are calculated as operating costs net of fuel costs. Appendix 1
provides a discussion of the calculation of these cost measures.
           The UZA-level data used in our empirical analysis consists of wages, unionization shares,
average housing prices, a road congestion index, and population density. Because employee wages are
not observed through the NTD data, we used earnings data from 1998 to 2011 from the Bureau of Labor

Statistics Current Population Survey (CPS) to approximate transit agency labor costs. 20 Unionization
share is the ratio of union-represented full time-equivalent (FTE) workers to all FTE workers, also
sourced from CPS. Population density is sourced from NTD, and covers years 2000 and 2010. Annual
average housing price data are sourced from ACCRA Cost of Living Index.
         State collective bargaining rights strength and right -to-work data are sourced from Valletta and
Freeman (1988). We use the 1996 updated values extended by Kim Rueben in our analysis. While the
timing of the state collective bargaining data does not overlap with our analysis, year-to-year variation
of a state’s collective bargaining right strength is minimal. See footnote 6 for further explanation on the
construction of this variable.
         Part of the mayoral election data comes from Ferreira and Gyourko (2009). These data include
the names, political affiliation, and winning margin for elections across 128 urbanized areas. Their data
are limited to cities with populations over 25,000 with direct mayoral elections, covering years 1998
through 2008. We extended their data up through 2011. The Ferreira and Gyourko sample is
observationally similar to the population of U.S. cities that met their criteria, but did not respond to their
survey. Our own sample comprises the subset of urbanized areas from Ferreira and Gyourko’s dataset
that have public bus transit systems reporting to NTD.


5.2 RD Validity Tests
         The sample we use in our RD estimation includes only the dominant transit agencies in a given
UZA. We define “dominant” transit agencies as the largest transit agency in the UZA, based on average
annual vehicle miles traveled. Using only the dominant transit agencies effectively creates a one-to-one
match within our sample between a city and a transit agency. 21
         The critical identifying assumption underlying the RD design is that unobservable determinants
of transit agency labor costs 𝑙𝑖𝑡 do not differ among agencies within a narrow window of the 0-winning
margin threshold. We provide descriptive evidence as well as a formal test that there is no discontinuity
in the distribution of the running variable at the cutoff. Any evidence of a jump in the density of the
20
   Our wage data consists of weekly earnings for full-time equivalent (FTE) workers who have earned a high school diploma,
or less. We removed observations of earners below the 5th and above the 95th percentile.
21
   We focus on the dominant transit agencies for the RD approach for the following reasons. First, the privatization decision
of these agencies have more significant implications on the local budget than non-dominant agencies. The bottom panel of
Appendix Figure 2 plots the privatization share in non-dominant agencies against the winning margin and there does not
appear to be a discontinuity in the privatization share by the mayor party among close elections. Second, the non-dominant
transit agencies tend to be those that serve suburban areas and their service area may overlap with multiple municipalities.
Thus, the connection between a city mayor’s political decisions and the city’s public services is less clearly defined for such
non-centralized transit services. For these two reasons, we focus on dominant transit agencies in our RD analysis below.


                                                              15
running variable at the cutoff would suggest a degree of sorting into the treatment and would invalidate
the quasi-experimental RD design.

         In Figure 4, we plot the density of observations in several bins of the winning margin over a 60-
percentage point window around the 0-winning margin cutoff. There is no indication of discontinuity in
the density of the forcing variable at the cutoff. A McCrary (2008) test confirms that there is no
statistically significant jump in the running variable density function at 0. 22 This is consistent with a lack
of any manipulation in the margin of victory that may undermine the RD design.

         We provide further evidence that the observable baseline covariates evolve smoothly over the
threshold. Table 4 presents the descriptive statistics for the transit agencies in our sample. Average
values for UZA-level and transit agency-level characteristics are shown in 30-percentage-point bins
around the winning margin threshold. Tests of the null hypothesis of continuity of each covariate against
the alternative of a jump suggest that there is no sorting around the threshold. The last column of Table 4
shows the p-value of discontinuity estimates from second-order polynomial regression in democrat
winning margin. 23 We fail to reject continuity across the winning margin threshold for each covariate
listed in Panels A and B. These results are consistent with the smooth density of the running variable
(Figure 4), supporting that there is no sorting of transit agencies around the threshold. 24 In contrast to the
covariates, Panels C and D show clear evidence of greater privatization levels and lower labor costs for
transit agencies where the republican candidate won an election.

         Next, we present graphical evidence on the effects of democratic mayoral victories on a transit
agency’s level of privatized bus miles. Panel A of Figure 5 plots predicted values of privatization share
using various control functions as well as mean values of privatization share within half-percentage
point bins of the winning margin. There are noticeable discontinuities at the cutoff, with conspicuous
drops in privatization levels within each bin for democratic winning margins greater than 0.
Privatization levels, while significantly lower, are not zero for democratic victories; however it is clear

22
   The McCrary test is based on an estimator for the discontinuity at the cutoff in the density function of the running variable.
The test involves, first obtaining a finely-gridded histogram of the running variable; and second, smoothing the histogram
using local linear regression on either side of the cutoff. The parameter of interest is the log difference in histogram height to
the right and left of the threshold. See McCrary (2008). The point estimate of a discontinuity in the density function is -0.41
with a standard error of 0.25, consequently we can reject the null hypothesis that the running variable density function is
discontinuous at the threshold.
23
   Specifically, we run regressions of the form: 𝑦𝑖𝑡 = 𝛽0 + 𝜏𝐷𝑖 + 𝛽1 𝑀𝑖𝑡 + 𝛽2 𝑀𝑖𝑡2 + 𝜀𝑖𝑡 for ( |𝑀| ≤ 0.6). The P-value
associated with the estimate of 𝜏 is listed in Table 4. 𝑦 is each covariate listed in Panels A and B, 𝑀 is the winning margin,
and 𝐷 = 1 if the winning mayor is a democrat. Standard errors were clustered at the UZA level.
24
   Graphical evidence that baseline covariates evolve smoothly through the threshold is presented in the Appendix Figure 1.


                                                               16
that there is a discrete increase in the probability of privatizing public bus transit operations in urbanized
areas where a Republican won a mayoral election.

       The likelihood of privatization differs across states with either strong or weak collective
bargaining rights. Panel B of Figure 5 shows that most of the jump generated in the full sample shown in
Panel A is driven by republican victories in states with strong collective bargaining rights. Agencies in
weak bargaining rights states show very little difference in privatization levels regardless of whether the
republican or democratic mayoral candidate won an election (Panel C).

       Figure 5 may seem at odds with Figure 2, which shows how weighted average privatization
levels are higher for weak bargaining rights states. However, the graphs are consistent when we consider
the opportunity cost of privatizing: for weak bargaining rights states, the opportunity cost is lower due to
the fact that these states tend to have lower wages, less union power, smaller city sizes, and lower urban
density. In contrast, the potential cost savings is greater in strong bargaining rights states. Consequently,
the republican winner is more likely to capitalize on such potential cost savings and privatize; whereas
the probability of privatizing is very low for cities with democratic mayors in strong bargaining rights
states relative to weak bargaining rights states. Our analysis below will account for this heterogeneous
treatment effect across strong versus weak bargaining rights states.

       To improve estimation efficiency, we utilize the full sample of 1,444 transit agency-years in our
main RD results. However, our estimates are robust to restricting observations to elections with margins
of victory closer to the winning threshold. Appendix Figure 3 shows the discontinuity zoomed into
elections with winning margins within 60% of the cut-off. The jump in privatization levels for
republican mayors is even more evident within a narrow window of the winning margin threshold, and
the difference in privatization levels persists across strong relative to weak bargaining rights states. In
Section 6, we document how the regression discontinuity estimate in privatization levels is robust to
different windows around the threshold.
       Given the substantial discontinuity in privatization levels across the winning margin threshold,
and given that other covariates are distributed smoothly across the threshold, one can interpret any
discontinuity in the conditional distribution of unit labor costs as a causal effect of the privatization.




                                                      17
6. Empirical Results

       The analysis of bus transit labor costs suggests that the private provision of public bus transit is
more cost-effective than public provision of public bus transit. Public sector unions are a significant
driver of the cost differentials between the private and public operations. The public sector unions
appear to extract higher rents when associated with larger transit agencies, when state-level collective
bargaining rights are stronger, and when local political leaders are democrats.

6.1 The Determinants of Privatization

       Regression estimates of the discontinuities in privatization share are shown in Table 5A. Each
cell in the first row reports an estimate of the effect of democratic major on privatization (λ) across
various specifications of equation (8). All specifications include quadratic control functions and their
interactions with the mayor party dummy. Standard errors are clustered at the UZA level, thus allowing
for arbitrary correlation in errors for transit agencies within the same UZA. As we would predict from
the discontinuity gaps found in Figure 5, regression results demonstrate that a Democratic mayoral
victory reduces the likelihood of privatizing bus miles. Results are robust to the specification of the
control function or the inclusion of covariates. All estimates are significant at the 10% level.

       In Column (3), we allow the discontinuity estimate to differ for states with strong vs. weak
collective bargaining rights laws by including an interaction of the democrat mayor indicator with strong
bargaining rights indicator (“Democrat * Strong Barg”). This variable is equal to 1 for a transit agency
operating in a strong bargaining rights state in a year where a Democrat mayor was elected, 0 otherwise.
The negative coefficient on “Democrat * Strong Barg” implies that democrat mayors in cities with
strong bargaining rights are even less likely to engage in privatization than their weak bargaining rights
mayoral counterparts. The estimates in column (3) are jointly significant with 95% confidence level.

       Column (4) uses local polynomial regression estimation with a robust confidence interval
developed by Calonico, Cattaneo, and Titiunik (2014, henceforth CCT). The performance of available
local polynomial confidence intervals are sensitive to the chosen bandwidth, and can produce biased
intervals with low empirical coverage in finite samples. The confidence interval proposed by CCT
corrects for this bias by rescaling the conventional bias-corrected t-statistic with a standard error formula
that accounts for the additional variation introduced by the estimate bias. The resulting confidence




                                                     18
interval allows for mean squared optimal bandwidth selectors, and improved coverage rates. 25 Column
(4) local polynomial regression estimate employs a triangular kernel density and bandwidths following
the selection procedure of CCT (2014). Collectively, results of Table 5A suggest that a democratic
mayor reduces privatization levels by between 6 and 10 percent.

         We verify that the observed jump in privatization levels is, in fact, driven by the republican
winning margin threshold by carrying out a placebo test. Our test employs a series of alternate, false,
thresholds. In Figure 6, we plot the discontinuity estimates from a series of regressions run using 10
percentage-point windows around the 0 winning margin cutoff. For expository purposes, we show
estimation results over the range -0.4 to 0.4. Estimates are from local polynomial regressions around the
false thresholds. Each regression includes a quadratic polynomial in the winning margin. Estimates
were noisier for thresholds below 0 due to smaller sample sizes. However, only at the true cutoff of 0 is
the discontinuity estimate statistically significant.


6.2 Regression Discontinuity Estimates

         We now investigate whether privatization reduces transit agency labor costs. Table 5B reports
estimates of 𝑑 in equation (7) under three types of estimators: OLS, GMM - or the “fuzzy” RD - and the
local polynomial estimator. We show results with and without UZA and agency control variables. All
regressions include year and state dummies, so that the relationships between privatization levels and
labor costs are identified off of variation across agencies within the same state. Standard errors are
clustered at the UZA level. OLS estimates in columns (1) and (2) suggest that a 1% increase in a transit
agency’s privatization share reduces their per-mile labor costs by between 0.16 and 0.37 percent. For a
transit agency with no privatization, the per-mile labor cost-saving effect from fully privatizing transit
operations is between 15.0 and 30.9 percent. 26

         However, the OLS estimates are likely to be biased by unobserved factors that are correlated
with a transit agency’s level of privatization and which also affects labor costs. Columns (3) – (4)
present analogous results under a GMM fuzzy RD approach in which we instrument the privatization

25
   See Calonico, Cattaneo, and Titiunik (2015) for a detailed discussion on the construction of their bias-corrected confidence
intervals.
26
   Because equation (7) takes the semi-logarithmic functional form and the privatization rate ranges from 0 to 1, a consistent
estimator for the percentage impact from full privatization (e.g., privatization rate going from 0 to 1) on the labor cost is
                       �)

                                                              19
share with an indicator equal to 1 if a democrat won a mayoral election. The identifying assumption is
that, conditional on observable UZA and agency controls (listed in Table 4), mayoral political party
affiliation only affects transit agency labor costs through its effect on privatization levels. We have
demonstrated in the previous section that mayoral political affiliation is strongly correlated with
privatization levels.

       The GMM estimates in columns (3) and (4) are larger in magnitude relative to the naïve
specifications in columns (1) and (2). Thus, omitted variables produce a downward bias on the
privatization effect. This is consistent with paradox described above whereby large cities with strong
union have more to gain from privatization but are less likely to privatize. The fuzzy RD estimates
suggest a 1 percent increase in privatization reduces unit labor costs between 0.4 and 1.9 percent for
those transit agencies near the 50-50 margin of victory.

       Columns (5) and (6) allow for heterogeneous treatment effects across strong vs. weak bargaining
rights states. Again, the results show that outsourcing public transit to private entities by 1 percent will
decrease labor costs per mile by between 1.0 percent and 2.1 percent. The full effect of privatization is a
unit labor cost reduction ranging from 46.4 to 68.1 percent after controlling for observables. Finally, the
local polynomial estimate in column (7) is a similar magnitude to the GMM estimates. Each estimate
shown in Table 5B falls into the CCT robust confidence interval of [-4.145; -0.110].

       Inclusion of UZA and transit agency control variables reduces the magnitude of the GMM
estimates substantially. This highlights the importance for controlling for observables in our case.
Higher cost transit agencies tend to be those located in larger cities, with higher cost of living, and high
unionization rates. Ignoring such factors inflates the correlation between privatization and cost savings.

       This magnitude of cost savings suggested by privatizing is immense. There are two probable
causes for the substantial downward bias suggested by the OLS results. First, those transit agencies that
have the greatest cost-saving potential are not engaging in privatization. Because the sample for the
regression discontinuity analysis consists only of dominant transit agencies, the predicted cost savings
are likely to be inflated. We investigate the particular relationships between transit agency size and labor
costs in subsequent analyses and find dominant transit agencies have approximately 20 percent higher
labor costs per mile relative to non-dominant transit agencies, ceteris paribus. Second, it is possible that
public transit cost minimization is not the only objective of these larger agencies. For example, other



                                                      20
political or social welfare objectives may render privatizing public transit suboptimal, even if it means
leaving large sums of money on the table.

        To further test the robustness of results to the identifying assumption, we estimate the effect of
privatization based on three alternative strategies in Appendix 2. The first is an IV strategy where the IV
is a Bartik measure of state employment growth interacting with a city’s average cost of housing. The
second strategy uses labor contract cycles as an instrument for privatization, and the third strategy
compares the operating costs per mile between buses and subways (which, by their nature cannot be
privatized) for cities that have both modes of transportation. Although these strategies are based on
different identification assumptions, the empirical findings from these robustness checks are all
consistent with those from the RD estimates.


6.3 Effects of Privatization on Service, Quality and Ridership
        Critics of privatization often point to worsening service quality as a drawback of outsourcing.
Hart, Shleifer, and Vishny (1997) theorize that in-house service provision (in the context of prisons) is
optimal if cost reductions from privatizing have substantial impacts on noncontractible quality.
However, if quality reductions from cost reductions can be controlled through contracts or competition,
then privatization is optimal. Therefore, the ability to measure and monitor service quality and its
externalities are important factors that determine whether a public service can or should be privatized.

        To test whether privatization impacts service quality on average, we estimate the effects of
privatization on the number of non-fatal and fatal incidents reported by the transit agencies. Non-fatal
incidents include collisions, vehicles leaving the roadway, fires, electric shocks, or security incidents.
Fatal incidents include fatal collisions with pedestrians, cyclists, suicides, or operator deaths. These data
were available from NTD from 2002 through 2011. Because both of these safety measures are count
data with several zeros, we employ a negative binomial regression. Appendix Table 3 reports results
from basic negative binomial regressions as well as RD and instrument variable specifications where
negative binomial is employed in the second stage. In three of the four specifications, privatization share
is negatively correlated with the number of reported incidents per year. None of the specifications
produce a statistically significant relationship. These results fail to show that privatization alters the
safety and security of bus transit at least, and prevents accidents and fatalities, at best.




                                                       21
           We further test whether transit agencies that outsource are more likely to reduce transit services
or if unobservable factors cause ridership to decline when operations are managed by a private entity.
Evidence of the former would confound the cost-saving effects identified in the prior analyses.
Specifically, privatizing might reduce costs not through efficient management, but through reducing the
services rendered to the public. We test for these confounding factors directly by estimating equation (7)
where vehicle miles traveled and ridership are the dependent variable. Appendix Table 4 shows the
results of these VMT and ridership regressions estimated using OLS, fuzzy RD, and the IV approaches.
Privatizing bus transit is positively correlated with vehicle miles traveled (columns 1-3). The
relationship is only significant in the OLS specification. These results suggest privatizing does not
significantly alter the services rendered by transit agencies, thus the observed cost savings are not
generated by service-cutting.

           Finally, we test whether privatizing affects overall bus ridership. We measure ridership as the
ratio of annual passenger miles traveled to annual vehicle miles traveled. It is possible that privatizing
firms alter services in such a way that less people prefer to take public bus transit. Such a result would
confound the cost-savings effect but would more importantly suggest that privatizing has welfare-
diminishing effects by pushing people away from public transit. Columns (4)-(6) show that privatization
does not significantly affect ridership.

           These analyses suggest that private firms provide public bus transit at a lower cost than public
operators, and these cost savings do not come at the expense of reduced miles of service or reduced
quality. Appendix 3 examines the heterogeneous treatment effect of privatization across transit agencies.
The analysis shows that the effect of privatization on labor costs are stronger for larger transit agencies
as well as for transit agencies in strong collective bargaining states.

6.4 The Cost-Saving Mechanisms Induced by Privatization
           Our research suggests that the two main avenues through which non-privatized, unionized labor
increases costs are through limiting the transit agency’s use of part-time employees, and through
negotiating increased pensions and fringe benefits. 27 We test whether publicly operated transit services
exhibit underutilization of employees or “featherbedding” of employee headcount within our NTD
dataset. Due to the limitations of NTD data, we observe employee headcount only for the publicly
operated transit services, thus we are not able to compare employee headcount for public and private
27
     See Giuliano and Lave (1989), Black (1991), DiSalvo (2010), and Winston (2010).


                                                             22
operations directly. However, we are able to test the effect of state-level union strength on full-time
employee headcount, holding all other factors constant, for publicly operated transit services. Table 6
shows results of regressing state-level bargaining rights and a right-to-work state indicator on the log of
number of full time employees per publicly operated VMT. Stronger state bargaining rights are
correlated with higher full-time employee headcount per VMT. Conversely, transit agencies operating
in right-to-work states have lower full-time employee headcount per VMT. The negative correlation
between right-to-work laws and employee headcount per VMT persists even for transit agencies
operating in states with strong collective bargaining rights.

        Results of these headcount regressions are informative, but may suffer from omitted variable bias
if factors we have not accounted for impact both the headcount intensity of a transit as well as the legal
rights of unions (i.e., public demand for bus services). To control for the existence of omitted variables,
we look at transit agencies in counties that share a state border, where right-to-work laws differ on either
side of the state border. For instance, Kansas – a right-to-work state, and Missouri – a non-right-to-work
state - share a border. We compare the transit labor costs between transit agencies in two counties that
share the Kansas-Missouri border. These counties are arguably comparable on unobservables due to
their close geographic proximity. After controlling for city and agency-specific observables like average
wage, union strength, density, and cost of living, any variation in labor costs between these two agencies
is due to their differing right-to-work status. The NTD data consists of 17 such border-county pairs
comprising 21 transit agencies. Table 7 shows the results of fixed effect regressions. Each specification
includes the 17 border-pair fixed effects. The sample size is small, however the right-to-work estimate is
precisely estimated, and is robust to the inclusion of various fixed effects and UZA and agency controls.
The evidence in Tables 6 and 7 suggest that right-to-work states have lower labor costs, all else equal,
and leaner use of staff is at least partially responsible for these lower labor costs.

        As a final piece of evidence demonstrating the role that unions play in lobbying large liberal city
transit agencies, in Table 8 we report regressions in which the dependent variable is the log of operating
cost per mile and the independent variables are dominant agency indicators and their interactions with
right-to-work status and union strength. These regressions include UZA-by-year fixed effects, which
serve to control for all local trends that can impact operating costs. The remaining variation is within-
city transit agency variation. Since major UZAs such as Chicago have multiple transit agencies, we
compare the within UZA cost per bus mile for dominant transit agencies and suburban agencies. In



                                                      23
addition, we stratify these estimates by the state’s right-to-work status. In pro-union, non-right-to-work
states, operating costs are 36 percent higher in the dominant agency relative to the suburban agencies but
in right-to-work states such as Texas, operating costs are only 3 percent higher in the dominant agency
relative to the suburban agencies (see Table 8 column 2). Again, these results include UZA-by-year
fixed effects and thus highlight the central role that unions play in liberal areas.

        An important dimension of the privatizing process is that the employees operating and
maintaining buses are often the same people whether the bus is operated by the private or public entity.
The majority of these employees are unionized, even if they are on payroll of the private entity. Thus,
the impact of unions on transit operating costs is not absent when operations are outsourced to private
firms. Rather, private firms are better equipped to negotiate labor contracts with union representatives.
        Several private operators are large multinational firms that can draw upon best practices in
contract negotiations and employee management. More importantly, private firms serve to create a
disconnect between unionized transit employees and the transit authority responsible for budgeting and
planning. Because of their affiliations with a political organization, public unions have the power to
increase and sustain levels of public employment as well as impact local finance policy to increase taxes
and salaries (DiSalvo (2010)). Severing the tie between the policy-making institution and the employees
is one of the most important mechanisms by which private firms reduce costs of public services. 28


7. A Counterfactual Welfare Analysis of the Effects of Privatization
        We estimate the welfare loss from overpaying for public bus transit. To calculate, this we
estimate the difference between societal costs at current privatization levels and counterfactual societal
costs where all bus transit is privatized. We then compare the welfare loss from over-paying for transit
services with the current societal benefit of transferring income to low-skill public sector employees.
        Total passenger trips on fixed-route bus transit as of 2011 were approximately 5.2 billion. 29 We
use prior studies on transportation demand for our measure of bus ridership elasticity with respect to
fare. 30 Using the estimates for total operating costs per mile from the regression discontinuity design

28
   DiSalvo (2015) discusses important advantages that public sector unions exercise over private sector unions at the
negotiations table including: protection from business cycles due to the ease with which governments can borrow money,
influence on employers through political contributions, and absence of direct mechanisms to control management because
voters are generally uninformed of local government spending.

30
   Gagnepain and Ivalid (2002) estimate an elasticity of bus ridership with respect to fare of approximately -0.441. Oum,
Waters, & Young (1992) estimate elasticities between -0.3 and -0.7. TRCP Report 95 (2004) estimates an elasticity of -0.40.


                                                            24
described in Section 6.3, we calculate the average predicted bus fare for a transit agency as of 2011
under current levels of privatization as 𝛼1 = $3.00. If all transit agencies privatized their operations
completely, the average predicted bus fare as of 2011 would be 𝑝1= $1.87. Using the base bus fare 𝛼1 ,
counterfactual bus fare 𝑝1, the elasticity of bus ridership, and the aggregate number of passenger trips,
we calculate the aggregate demand curve for bus passenger trips. (See Appendix 4 for further detail on
calculations).
        Figure 7 shows the predicted change in consumer welfare if all bus transportation were
privatized and operated by private companies. The shaded area is the change in consumer surplus
associated with privatization. Part of the change in consumer surplus is the result of a wealth transfer
from consumers to public employees of transit agencies. Specifically, at least part of the differential
between 𝛼1 and 𝑝1 is a wealth transfer from consumers of transit to the employees of public transit in the
form of higher wages. This portion of the welfare change is not necessarily inefficient. Area D in Figure
7 is pure deadweight loss associated with this transfer (or the net gain from fully privatizing). While
there are benefits to society from employing individuals who might otherwise receive lower pay, the
transfer is not costless. Since this transfer makes the public provision of transportation more expensive
than it would be without the distortion, demand for passenger trips is pushed to lower levels than it
would be if the cost of public transit were at the privatized level, indicated by the lower dashed line.
Under efficient privatized operations, aggregate ridership would increase from 5.2 billion to
approximately 6.2 billion passenger trips.
        The national change in consumer surplus under the average impact of privatization on operating
costs amounts to approximately $6.3 billion. Pure deadweight loss from this welfare was approximately
$524.3 million. This means that of the wealth transfer generated for public transit operations - from
consumers to public sector transit employees - $524.3 million neither serves wealth redistributive
purposes, nor is it compensated to transit riders for the inability to use transit at an efficient cost. Thus,
under 2011 conditions, US taxpayers lost $524.3 million in aggregate from over-paying for bus transit.
These welfare measures capture losses in one year, 2011. Losses of similar magnitude exist for
subsequent years.
        An increase in ridership under lower-cost privatized operations means that privatization creates
new jobs for bus operators. In 2011, public bus transit employed over 130,000 individuals in operations
roles. These drivers served 5.2 billion passenger trips. Letting the ratio of drivers to trips hold constant,
an increase in ridership demand to 6.2 billion trips translates into over 26,000 new bus operator jobs


                                                       25
alone (not including new maintenance and managerial jobs that would also be necessary). In the case
that workers occupying these new jobs value them more than their second best alternative, the 2011
$524.3 million deadweight loss is a lower bound because it does not account for the welfare gain from
employment and job creation.
         City-specific welfare losses depend on the size of the city’s transit agencies and the strength of
their public sector unions. Urbanized areas with larger transit agencies or stronger unions experience
greater cost savings from privatization. Thus, welfare losses from not privatizing are greater for such
urbanized areas. We estimated heterogeneous impacts of privatization by interacting a transit agency’s
privatization share with their fleet size as well as the strength of their state’s collective bargaining laws.
Table 7 shows the results of the heterogeneous effects regression. Larger transit agencies as well as
agencies in states with strong collective bargaining laws experience even greater cost savings from
privatization relative to smaller agencies in weak collective bargaining law states. This finding suggests
that several of the nation’s largest transit agencies would reduce costs significantly by privatizing.
         Table 9 shows the estimated change in consumer surplus and the corresponding deadweight loss
in 2011 for three major transit agencies: Boston’s MBTA, Chicago’s CTA, and San Antonio’s VIA.
Boston’s deadweight loss from inefficiently high transit costs for the MBTA amounts to approximately
$14.8 million, while Chicago’s CTA has estimated deadweight losses of approximately $26.3 million. In
this same year, Boston and Chicago received $846 million and $705 million, respectively, in public
funding for operations. The deadweight loss from inefficiently high operating costs accounted for 1.7
and 3.7 percent, respectively, of local, state, and federal funding sources for these two agencies in 2011
alone.
         Both Chicago and Boston operate in collective bargaining rights states, whereas collective
bargaining is outlawed in Texas. Notice that deadweight losses for San Antonio’s VIA are estimated to
be substantially lower at approximately $4.2 million. San Antonio’s fleet is half the size of Boston,
however their estimated deadweight loss is less than one third that of Boston.


8. Conclusion
         Our analysis of public sector efficiency in the provision of public bus transit suggests three
important findings: First, the private sector provides a unit of bus transit service at a lower cost than the
public sector. Second, such public sector cost premiums are higher for larger transit agencies, when
state-level collective bargaining rights are stronger, and when local political leaders are democrats.


                                                      26
Third, privately operated firms are able to curb labor costs per mile through efficient allocation of labor
and through limiting instances of featherbedding. Strong union bargaining power in non-right-to-work
states appears to increase the number of full time employees on pay roll, holding the service area
constant. These effects are most pronounced for a city’s largest transit agency, which suggests public
sector unions shift their bargaining pressure toward the dominant transit agencies such as Chicago’s
CTA, New York’s MTA, or Boston’s MBTA. The operating cost per bus mile in Chicago’s major
transit agency in 2012 was $13.18, or 175 percent that of the operating cost per bus mile in Houston’s
major transit agency.

        In aggregate, the potential cost savings from privatizing all public bus transit is on the order of
$5.7 billion per year. Using RD estimation to identify the effect of privatization on total operating costs,
we find that the difference in operating costs per mile between mean privatization levels as of 2011 and
the counterfactual scenario when all bus miles are privatized is a decrease from $6.63 to $4.16 per mile.
Holding total service mileage (2.3 billion VMT in 2011) constant, this per unit cost savings translates
into an aggregate cost savings of approximately $5.7 billion, or 30% of aggregate operating expenses.

        The documented potential for total government cost savings from outsourcing bus operations is
likely to be an underestimate. Transit unions are crucial political engines in major cities (Koch 1984).
Thus, concessions from public employers to the transit unions are very likely to spread across to other
unions within a city and positively impact their negotiation power. Known as the “me-too” bargaining
strategy, the practice of negotiating salaries and benefits based on that of other public employees has
been attributed to state and local government budget deficits for example in California, New York, and
Vancouver, BC. 31 Future research should study the timing of public sector union contracts and the
sequential game played by a big city mayor with the major public sector unions. Republican mayors
may enjoy cost savings across the board after creating an early reputation for being tough negotiators.

  In regards to public union labor arbitration, Governing Magazine states: “That [“me-too” bargaining strategies]
immediately rigs the game in favor of organized labor, because the unions can then game one public employer against
another.” (Miller 2010)

divided by the total annual VMT. Privatization shares averages for strong and weak bargaining rights states are

Note: The figure depicts the Leontief production of bus service based on energy and labor inputs. The
steeper isocost curve reflects the higher wage paid to unionized workers as well as overutilization of
labor from union work rules. Both a higher labor input and a higher wage lead to a higher cost of
production for the same of amount of bus service provided.

        Figure 7: Loss in US Aggregate Consumer Welfare from Inefficient Bus Transit




Note: The horizontal dotted line is the supply of passenger trips under 2011 levels of
privatization, where 𝑔(𝛼1 , 𝑝̂ , 𝑢) = $3.00. At this current level of privatization, total passenger
trips in 2011 were 5.2 billion. The horizontal dashed line is the supply of passenger trips under
the counterfactual scenario of complete privatization, where 𝑔(𝑝1 , 𝑝̂ , 𝑢) = $1.87. Under the
hypothetical scenario, annual passenger trips totals 6.2 billion. The solid black curved line is
consumer demand for passenger trips. The shaded area represents the change in consumer
welfare when the price of bus transit is at its current inefficiently high level of $3.00 per trip. The
shaded area corresponds to 𝐴 in equation (1A) of Appendix 4. Change in US aggregate consumer
surplus amounts to $6.3 billion. Area D represents the deadweight loss. Aggregate deadweight
loss amounts to approximately $524.3 million.

We calculated fuel costs using reported fuel-use data from NTD and estimates of retail fuel
prices for each of the reported fuel inputs. Fuel prices were sourced from the U.S. Energy
Information Administration. Most of our fuel price data vary by state and year. NTD does not
report employee headcount outsourced operations. Thus, we infer labor costs as the residual
operating costs net of our calculated energy costs. The following figure shows the breakdown of
line items included in operating expenses as reported by transit agencies to NTD. Vehicle
operating costs include: labor costs (including salaries, wages, benefits, and pensions), costs of
fuel, materials and supplies, utility costs, taxes, and liability costs. With the exception of fuel
inputs, we cannot separately identify these costs from total operating costs. Thus, our estimate of
labor costs is an upward bound, and includes expenses for materials and miscellaneous expenses.

           Web APPENDIX 2: Alternative Empirical Strategies as Robustness Checks

         In this section, we present three alternative empirical strategies based on different
identifications from that in the RD analysis. The analysis all provides similar results to those
from the RD analysis..


1. An Instrumental Variables Approach
         We use the IV approach as an alternative to the RD analysis in identifying the causal
effect of privatization. We seek instruments that are correlated with a transit agency’s share of
privatized bus miles but are uncorrelated with the unobserved determinants of bus operating
costs. A plausible variable that satisfies these conditions is the interaction between a Bartik
measure of state employment growth and a city’s average cost of housing. Following Bartik
(1991), we create a state-level employment growth instrument by calculating the annual national
employment growth rate for each 6-digit NAICS industry and then weighting this by each state’s
share of each industry’s employment in 1998. 32 The Bartik employment variable is constructed
at the state level rather than at the local level because local economic indicators are more likely
to be endogenous to transit agency’s operating costs. It captures the heterogeneous effect of
national employment shocks (e.g., due to trade) across different states due to their pre-existing
conditions (e.g., industry structure). This is unlikely to be correlated with shocks that affect bus
operation in a transit agency.
         In our regressions, we include the home price as an explanatory variable to control for
differences in cost-of-living, which could affect labor cost. We interact the Bartik variable with
the city average housing price to introduce cross-city variation. In addition, this interaction
captures how a state’s economic condition affects privatization decisions differently across cities
with different housing prices, and hence different local tax bases. We conjecture that lower
employment growth (i.e., a tight state budget) would impact cities with a low home price (less
robust local tax base) more severely, and hence induce more privatization. This conjecture is
confirmed in our first stage regressions in the Appendix Table 2A. In the regression analyses,
standard errors are clustered at the UZA level to account for autocorrelation across transit
agencies operating within the city.

32
  1998 is selected as the base year because it is the first year in our study and because 1998 was the first year that
the NAICS codes were introduced.
                                                           47
       The first stage results of the IV regression are shown in Appendix Table 2A. The
excluded instrument is the state-level Bartik labor shock measure interacted with UZA-average
housing prices, (Bartik IV *Home Price). The instrument has a negative and significant
correlation with privatization share, which is robust to the inclusion of observables. Column (3)
uses the sample of dominant transit agencies used in the RD analysis. The effect of the Bartik
home price instrument on privatization levels is a similar magnitude to that of the full sample
estimates. Transit agencies that experience exogenous negative (positive) labor demand shocks
in cities with lower (higher) housing prices are more (less) likely to privatize their bus mile
operations. This result is consistent with our prediction that agencies in cities with a lower tax
base, particularly those in states that are exogenously budget constrained due to poor economic
climate, are more likely to seek out public-private partnerships as a means to cut costs.

       Labor cost estimates are shown in Appendix Table 2B. The OLS specifications in
columns (1) - (2) indicate a 1 percent increase in an agency’s share of privatized miles are
correlated with a decrease in labor costs per mile ranging from 0.22 to 0.31 percent. Columns (3)
- (5) instrument for the privatization share using the state-level Bartik labor shock measure
interacted with UZA-average housing prices. Column (5) uses the regression discontinuity
sample of only dominant transit agencies. The estimated effect of increasing the privatization
share by 1 percent ranges from 0.46 to 1.2 percent reduction in labor costs per mile. The
coefficients listed in Appendix Table 2B are close in magnitude to that of the regression
discontinuity estimates in Table 5B, and all fall into the CCT robust confidence interval (Table
5B, column 7). The overall reduction in per-mile labor costs induced by an agency going from no
privatization to 100 percent ranges from 38 to 77 percent under the GMM estimators. While the
RD sample estimate is less precisely estimated than that of the full sample, the larger anticipated
cost savings from the RD sample reflect that dominant transit agencies are large agencies by
definition, so the potential gains from privatizing are more substantial for these large urban
agencies, relative to smaller agencies operating in more remote locations. These large cost-
saving estimates also reflect the fact that the dominant agencies are less likely to privatize, even
though the payoffs to doing so are large. In Appendix Table 2A column 2, the dominant transit
agency indicator is negatively correlated with privatization levels. At least part of the reason for
this tendency for dominant agencies to avoid privatizing is due to strategic actions on the part of


                                                 48
unions. In section 6.4, we discuss evidence that unions focus their bargaining power on the
dominant agencies in a given UZA.


2. Union Contract Cycle as Instrument
       We carry out estimation of equation (7) and instrument for the privatization share using
union contract cycle schedules for 10 transit agencies. When a union’s labor contract is over and
up for negotiation, the transit agency manager may find it easier to privatize a portion of their
operations to private contractors. However, the status of the labor contract (whether it is active or
not) should not be correlated with a transit agency’s unit labor costs. Appendix Table 5A shows
the first stage results. The end of a labor contract cycle is positively correlated with privatization
share, as we would expect. Appendix Table 5B shows the impact of privatization on labor costs
under OLS and GMM employing the contract cycle instrument. The cost saving estimates are
very similar in magnitude to the RD and IV methods discussed in Section 6; a 1% increase in the
share of bus miles that are privatized reduces labor costs per mile by between 0.6 and 0.9%.

3. Using Subway Cities as Controls
       Due to data limitations, we are unable to employ city-level fixed effects in our main
specifications discussed in Section 6. Thus, our identification comes from variation in transit
agencies within the same state with differing levels of privatized bus miles. The analyses in
Section 6 include various controls for transit agency characteristics, such as fleet size, type, and
the share of buses that use alternative fuel. However, it is possible that certain unobservable city-
specific factors affect both privatization decisions and unit labor costs, and these unobservables
generate the differences we observe across agencies within the same state.
       To address this endogeneity concern, we look at the subset of agencies in our NTD data
who’s UZA also has a subway system. Subway systems, by their nature as massive public works
projects, are public entities and cannot be privatized. Comparing the operating costs of bus
transit to the operating costs of subway transit in the same city will fully control for any city-
wide unobserved effects that impact transit costs, which may confound our main cross-city
identification. We carry out two specifications: in column (1) of Appendix Table 6 the dependent
variable is the log of bus operating costs per VMT, and the regression controls for subway
operating costs per VMT. In column (2), the dependent variable is the log of the ratio of bus to
subway operating costs. Under both specifications, privatization is associated with a 1 percent
                                                  49
decrease in operating costs per VMT. These results are again, consistent with those found in
Section 6 under the RD and IV methods.


            Web APPENDIX 3. Heterogeneous Treatment Effects of Privatization

       We examine the heterogeneous treatment effect of privatization. Appendix Table 7 shows
estimation results of the effect of privatization share on per-mile labor costs, accounting for the
interaction of the privatization share and state bargaining strength, and the interaction of
privatization share and transit agency size. We use the size of a transit agency’s fleet (number of
buses) to measure their size. The first column employs OLS. Each interaction term is negative
and statistically significant, implying that privatization reduces labor costs to a larger degree if
the transit agency operates in a UZA where unions have stronger legal bargaining power, or if
the transit agency serves a larger population. The magnitudes on the privatization share estimate
relative to the heterogeneous effect estimates suggest that cost savings realized from privatizing
may be washed out by the effects of strong collective bargaining rights for a large transit agency.

       The second column in Appendix Table 7 employs the instrumental variable approach
discussed in Appendix 2. After instrumenting for privatization share with the Bartik-home price
instrument, the effect of privatization on cost savings increases in magnitude for states with
strong bargaining rights, and for larger transit agencies. These results are consistent with the
discontinuity graphs shown in Figure 5: the difference across agencies with democrat versus a
republican mayoral winner in their likelihood of privatizing transit operations is larger for two
such agencies in a strong bargaining rights state relative to a weak bargaining rights state.
Because of this differential in the propensity to privatize, agencies in strong bargaining rights
states observe larger cost savings from privatizing their operations relative to those in weak
bargaining rights states, where the opportunity costs are lower.

              Web APPENDIX 4: Details About the Welfare Analysis Calculations

        The procedure we use to estimate welfare loss from high public transit cost is as follows:
We begin by specifying the consumer compensating variation obtained from reducing bus transit
operating costs by privatizing.

        Consider the consumer’s minimum cost of achieving a utility level, 𝑢, given prices 𝑝:

                                           𝑔(𝑝, 𝑢) = min{𝑝. 𝑥|𝑢(𝑥) ≥ 𝑢}
                                                       {𝑥}


The compensated demand function for good 𝑥𝑖 ∈ 𝑥 is given by 33:

                                                    𝜕𝑔(𝑝, 𝑢)
                                             𝑥𝑖 =            = 𝑔𝑖 (𝑝, 𝑢)
                                                      𝜕𝑝𝑖

(Glaister (1974)). Let 𝛼1 and 𝑝1 be the price of bus fare under current privatization levels (where
majority of bus transit is publicly operated), and under the counterfactual scenario of complete
privatization, respectively. Let all other prices faced by the consumer, 𝑝̂ , be held constant. The
loss to the consumer from purchasing bus fare, 𝑥1 , at 𝛼1 instead of the lower efficient price 𝑝1
can be expressed by:
                                  𝛼
                          𝐴 = ∫𝑝 1 𝑔1 (𝑧, 𝑝̂ , 𝑢)𝑑𝑧 = 𝑔(𝛼1 , 𝑝̂ , 𝑢) − 𝑔(𝑝1 , 𝑝̂ , 𝑢)34         (1A)
                                   1


The area 𝐴 is the change in consumer surplus due to the change in transit operating costs.

        To apply this theoretical framework to our empirical analysis, we specify 𝑔(. ) as the
transit agency supply curve. We have posited a Leontief production function whereby transit
agencies employ inputs in fixed proportions to produce a bus mile. Thus, marginal costs are
                                       𝐶
equal to unit operating costs, 𝑉𝑀𝑇. Let the transit agency supply curve equal their marginal costs,
                𝐶
thus 𝑔(. ) = 𝑉𝑀𝑇. The consumer’s expenditure for bus transit is proportional to the transit

agency’s marginal costs of providing bus service.



33
   The difference between the compensated and Marshallian demand function is the income effect. Deaton (1974)
shows that if the utility function is additively separable, and the expenditure on the good is a small fraction of
income, then the compensated and uncompensated elasticities will be close. For purposes of this exercise, we posit
that bus transit is additively separable to all other consumption goods and services.
34
   Rosen and Small (1981) provide a detailed outline for the theoretical justification for measuring price-induced
utility changes as areas to the left of the relevant compensated demand curves.

                                                             51
            In addition to a supply curve, the other inputs necessary to calculate welfare loss include
a demand curve for bus transit, a base unit cost of transit, and the counterfactual unit cost of
transit under complete privatization. Our base unit cost of transit is the operating costs per VMT,
     𝐶                                                                                                       𝐶
𝑉𝑀𝑇
         , predicted by our model under privatization levels observed as of 2011. We predict 𝑉𝑀𝑇

under current privatization using the regression discontinuity design specification discussed in
Section 6.3. To generate the estimates, we regress the log of total operating costs per VMT on
predicted privatization share (city mayoral party affiliation instruments for privatization share in
the fuzzy RD design), following the right-hand-side of equation (7). Since we are interested in
predicting total operating costs, rather than labor operating costs, we control for energy input
prices in addition to each of the covariates impacting labor unit costs presented in Table 4. Under
                                                                        𝐶                                        𝐶
2011 observed privatization levels, the predicted average 𝑉𝑀𝑇 is $6.74. The counterfactual 𝑉𝑀𝑇

predicted by our model if all transit agency operations are completely privatized is
approximately $3.09. 35

            We calculate a demand curve for bus transit using an elasticity measure of bus ridership,
or passenger trips, with respect to bus fare. According to Gagnepain & Ivaldi (2002), Oum,
Waters, & Young (1992), and TRCP Report 95 (2004)) this elasticity measure is approximately
                                        %∆𝑅𝑖𝑑𝑒𝑟𝑠ℎ𝑖𝑝
-0.4. Specifically, 𝐸𝑅 = −0.4 =           %∆𝐹𝑎𝑟𝑒
                                                      . Given the aggregate ridership of bus transit in 2011

was approximately 5.1 billion, we can solve for the change in ridership given an incremental
change in bus transit fare. This requires that we specify a transformation from our predicted unit
operating costs to bus passenger fare. 36
                                                                                   𝐶
             To perform this transformation, we multiply the predicted 𝑉𝑀𝑇 = $6.74 by the average

VMT per passenger trip observed in 2011, 0.28, to calculate predicted unit cost per passenger

35
   As our dependent variable is in log form, we calculate the predicted unit cost values using a smearing adjustment
                                             𝜎
following Greene (1951): 𝑦� = exp (𝑋′𝛽̂ + )
                                             2
36
   We have characterized transit agency supply in terms of VMT, while consumer demand is in terms of passenger
trips. Transit agency costs and revenues are driven by two different output variables that are closely related. Outputs
from the perspective of the transit agency are VMT, whereas the passenger uses VMT as inputs in the “production”
of their final consumption good, which is passenger miles or passenger-trips. (“This characterization of transit
output is quite useful if we construct a general equilibrium model of transit, in which transit firms supply
intermediate-type outputs while passengers, who demand them, generate final-type outputs.” Berechman (1993)).
Prior literature has frequently employed similar transformations as those discussed here, recognizing the difference
between VMT as intermediate output and passenger trips as final output in transit systems (Gagnepain & Ivaldi
(2002).

                                                          52
      𝐶
trip, 𝑇𝑟𝑖𝑝. This implies bus passengers traveled an average of 3.5 miles per trip in 2011. By
                               𝐶
employing a constant term, 𝑇𝑟𝑖𝑝, for the transformation of predicted unit costs, we assume the

number of passenger trips per VMT is unaffected by privatization levels. This static assumption
is consistent with Gagenpain and Ivaldi (2002) who modeled the relationship between VMT and
passenger trips as a reduced form function of population characteristics, density, and road
congestion in a particular year. Since our welfare analysis is particular to the year 2011, our
methodology is consistent with Gagenpain and Ivaldi (2002) in assuming that the relationship
between capacity and demand is static in a particular year. Our empirical analyses on the impacts
of privatization on transit agency VMT and ridership (passenger miles/VMT) further support this
simplification. Appendix Table 3 shows that privatization does not have a deterministically
significant impact on either VMT or occupancy rate.

          Our transformation further assumes transit agencies price at marginal cost. In this way we
can interpret unit cost per passenger trip as an approximation to the predicted bus fare per
passenger trip. We acknowledge that marginal cost pricing is not representative of public transit
pricing schemes. Public transit pricing is, in general, heavily subsidized to make up for the large
fixed costs of infrastructure. Mohring (1972) gives a detailed discussion of dynamic optimal
pricing schemes. We abstract away from identifying the pricing scheme of transit agencies in
order to highlight general welfare effects from inefficient public transit. In summary:

                                   𝑔(𝛼1 , 𝑝̂ , 𝑢) = $6.74 * 0.28 = $1.89 per trip

                                   𝑔(𝑝1 , 𝑝̂ , 𝑢) = $3.09 * 0.28 = $0.87 per trip

                                   %∆𝑅𝑖𝑑𝑒𝑟𝑠ℎ𝑖𝑝 = %∆𝐶𝑜𝑠𝑡 𝑝𝑒𝑟 𝑇𝑟𝑖𝑝*𝐸𝑅

where %∆𝐶𝑜𝑠𝑡 𝑝𝑒𝑟 𝑇𝑟𝑖𝑝 are based on incremental value changes between $0.87 and $1.89. We
calculate the area 𝐴 in equation (1A) using the trapezoidal method. 𝐴 in equation (1A)
corresponds to the shaded area in Figure 7.

          The procedure for calculating welfare loss specific to Boston, Chicago, and San Antonio
mimic the above discussion with the following exceptions. First, rather than using an aggregate
ridership value of 5.1 billion, the base ridership value is based on city-specific estimates. Second,
the transformation calculations employ the city-specific average VMT per passenger trip
observed in 2011. These values and their sources are shown in the following table:

Note: The dependent variable is log(energy cost per VMT). Includes dominant transit agencies. (d) denotes a binary variable. All regressions control for quadratic polynomial of winning
margin and their interaction with democrat mayor indicator. “LPoly” employs local polynomial Fuzzy RD estimation with robust confidence intervals developed by Calonico, Cattaneo
and Titiunik (“CCT”) (2014). LPoly estimate uses a triangular kernel and CCT bandwidth selector. See Table 5A for First Stage results. Standard errors clustered at UZA level. * p < 0.10,

  The sample sizes differ from the main fuzzy RD analyses due to NTD data limitations on energy inputs. Our main results do not change substantially when we remove these agencies.
