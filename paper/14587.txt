Banking Crises: An Equal Opportunity Menace

                                             ABSTRACT

The historical frequency of banking crises is quite similar in high- and middle-to-low-income countries,
with quantitative and qualitative parallels in both the run-ups and the aftermath. We establish these
regularities using a unique dataset spanning from Denmark's financial panic during the Napoleonic
War to the ongoing global financial crisis sparked by subprime mortgage defaults in the United States.

Banking crises dramatically weaken fiscal positions in both groups, with government revenues invariably
contracting, and fiscal expenditures often expanding sharply. Three years after a financial crisis central
government debt increases, on average, by about 86 percent. Thus the fiscal burden of banking crisis
extends far beyond the commonly cited cost of the bailouts. Our new dataset includes housing price
data for emerging markets; these allow us to show that the real estate price cycles around banking
crises are similar in duration and amplitude to those in advanced economies, with the busts averaging
four to six years. Corroborating earlier work, we find that systemic banking crises are typically preceded
by asset price bubbles, large capital inflows and credit booms, in rich and poor countries alike.

        Until very recently, the study of banking crises has typically focused either on earlier

historical experiences in advanced countries, mainly the banking panics before World War II, or

else has focused on modern-day emerging market experiences.1 This dichotomy is perhaps

shaped by the belief that for advanced economies, destabilizing, systemic, multi-country

financial crises were a relic of the past.2 Of course, the recent global financial crisis emanating

out of the United States and Europe has dashed this misconception, albeit at great social cost.

        As this paper will demonstrate, banking crises have long been an equal opportunity

menace. We develop this finding using a core sample of sixty-six countries (plus a broader

extended sample for some exercises). 3 We examine banking crises ranging from Denmark’s

financial panic during the Napoleonic War to the current “first global financial crisis of the 21st

century.” The incidence of banking crises proves to be remarkably similar in the high- and

middle-to-low-income countries. Indeed, the tally of crises is particularly high for the world’s

financial centers: the United Kingdom, the United States, and France. Perhaps more surprising

still are the qualitative and quantitative parallels across disparate income groups. These parallels

arise despite the relatively pristine modern sovereign default records of the rich countries.


        Three features of our expansive dataset are of particular note. First, our data on global

banking crises go back to 1800, extending the careful study of Bordo, et al. (2001) that covers

(1991) for several emerging market case studies; Jácome (2008) on banking crises in Latin America.

  Studies that encompass episodes in both advanced and emerging economies include Bordo et al. (2001),
Demirgüç-Kunt and Detragiache (1998) and Kaminsky and Reinhart (1999).

 The core sample spans 66 advanced and emerging market economies in Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin and North
America and Oceania; see Appendix Table A1. The extended sample includes all countries, see Table A3.

back to 1880. Second, to our knowledge, we are the first to examine the patterns of housing

prices around major banking crises in emerging markets, including Asia, Europe and Latin

America. Our emerging market data set facilitates comparisons, across both duration and

magnitude, with the better-documented housing price cycles in the advanced economies, which

have long been known to play a central role in financial crises.4 We find that real estate price

cycles around banking crises are similar in duration and amplitude across the two groups of

countries. This result is surprising given that almost all other macroeconomic and financial time

series (income, consumption, government spending, interest rates, etc.) exhibit higher volatility

in emerging markets.5

         Third, our analysis employs the comprehensive historical data on central government tax

revenues and debt compiled in Reinhart and Rogoff (2008a,c). These new data afford a new

perspective on the tax and debt consequences of the banking crises (Previously, the kind of

historical data on debt necessary to analyze the aftermath of banking crises across countries was

virtually non-existent for years prior to 1990.6)

         We find that banking crises almost invariably lead to sharp declines in tax revenues as

well significant increases in government spending (a share of which is presumably dissipative).

On average, government debt rises by 86 percent during the three years following a banking

crisis. These indirect fiscal consequences are thus an order of magnitude larger than the usual

bank bailout costs that are the centerpiece of most previous studies. That fact that the

magnitudes are comparable in advanced and emerging market economies is also quite

remarkable. Obviously, both the bailout costs and the fiscal costs depend on a host of political

  Bordo and Meissner (2006) offer domestic debt data for selected years across 30 countries for 1880–1913, while
Jeanne and Guscina (2006) provide domestic debt for 19 countries for 1980–2005. The Reinhart and Rogoff
(2008c) time series for sixty-six countries spans 1913–2007, and much earlier for a large subset of these countries.

and economic factors, including especially the policy response as well as the severity of the real

shock which, typically, triggers the crisis.7

           The paper proceeds as follows. Section II provides an overview of the history of

banking crises, with particular emphasis on the post-1900 experience. We also document the

incidence and frequency of banking crises by country and by region. We discuss the links

between banking crises, financial liberalization, the degree of capital mobility, and sovereign

debt crises and discuss international financial contagion.

           Section III examines some of the common features in the run-up to banking crises

across countries and regions over time. The focus is on the systematic links between cycles in

international capital flows, credit, and asset prices—specifically, home and equity prices. The

next section examines some of the common features of the aftermath of banking crises. We

document the toll that the crisis takes on output and government revenues, as well as the

typically profound effect on the evolution of government debt during the years following the

crisis. The concluding section takes up the question of “graduation.” Specifically, to what

extent do countries ever “graduate” from (stop experiencing) serial major financial crises as they

seem to graduate from serial sovereign debt crises?8




7
 Reinhart and Rogoff 2008a,c show that output growth typically decelerates in advance of a crisis.
8
 An example of graduate from serial default is France, which defaulted 8 times on its external debt between 1500
and 1800, but has not defaulted since.

                               II.     Banking Crises in Historical Perspective

        We begin this section by providing an overview of the evolution of banking crises

through history. To do so, it is necessary to first identify and date banking crisis episodes. Our

approach, which follows the standard methodology in the literature (e.g., Kaminsky and

Reinhart, 1999, Bordo, et al., 2001, and Caprio and Klingebiel, 2005, among others), is

documented in detail in the appendix, along with our principal bibliographical sources. 9

        One dimension that distinguishes this study from previous efforts is that our dating of

crises extends far before the much-studied modern post–World War II era. Specifically, we start

in 1800. Our work was greatly simplified back to 1880 by the careful study of Bordo, et al.

(2001), but for the earlier period we had to resort to old and often obscure works. The earliest

advanced-economy banking crisis in our sample is France 1802; early crises in emerging markets

befell India, 1863, China (several episodes during the 1860s–1870s), and Peru in 1873. 10

        It may come as a surprise to the reader that previous attempts to document banking crises

for the pre–World War II period are so limited. The problem is that because domestic banking

crises do not typically impinge on large powerful creditors in the international financial centers,

they do not leave the same imprint on the global press as, say, sovereign external defaults. For

this reason, we acknowledge that despite our best efforts, our chronology may be missing a

number of banking crises in emerging markets prior to World War II. 11 Fortunately, banking

crisis episodes in the developed world tend to be better documented even throughout the 19th

century.

   The work of Andrea McElderry (1976) and Cheng (2003) was invaluable in developing the timeline for China.
The Peruvian case comes from a little-known 1957 book published in Lima by Carlos Camprubí Alcázar.

   The challenges encountered in dating banking crises are along similar lines as those faced when trying to
construct a chronology of sovereign default on domestic debt, see Reinhart and Rogoff (2008c).

The Big Picture: Banking and Sovereign Debt Crises

       Figure 1 plots the incidence of banking crises among the countries in our sample (which

account for about 90 percent of world GDP). Specifically, the figure shows the percentage of all

independent countries during 1900–2008 having a banking crisis in any given year. The tally

weighs countries by their share of global GDP. This weighted aggregate is meant to provide a

measure of the “global” impact of individual banking crises. As such, a crisis in the United

States or Germany is accorded a much higher weight than a crisis in Angola or Honduras, all of

which are part of our 66-country sample.

2003 weights for the period 1991–2006. The entries for 2007–2008 list crises in Austria, Belgium, Germany,
Hungary, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The figure shows a three-year
moving average.

                            It is no surprise that the worldwide Great Depression of the 1930s posts the highest

readings of banking crises during this 109-year stretch. Earlier, less widespread, “waves” of

global financial stress are evident during and around the Panic of 1907 that originated in New

York, as well as the crises accompanying the outbreak of the First World War. Another striking

feature of Figure 1 is the relative calm during the late 1940s to the early 1970s. This calm may

be partly explained by booming world growth, but perhaps more so by the repression of the

domestic financial markets (in varying degrees) and the heavy-handed use of capital controls that

followed for many years after World War II. (We are not necessarily implying that such

repression and controls are the right approach to dealing with the risk of financial crises.)


                                                                                                                                                         6
         Since the early 1970s, financial and international capital account liberalization took

root worldwide. So, too, have banking crises. After a long hiatus, the share of countries having

banking difficulties first began to expand in the 1970s. The break-up of the Bretton Woods

system of fixed exchange rates together with the sharp spike in oil prices catalyzed a prolonged

global recession, resulting in financial sector difficulties in a number of advanced economies. In

the early 1980s, a collapse in global commodity prices combined with high and volatile interest

rates in the United States contributed to a spate of banking and sovereign debt crises in emerging

economies, most famously in Latin America and then Africa.

         The United States had its savings and loan crisis beginning in 1984. During the late

1980s and early 1990s, the Nordic countries experienced some of the worst banking crises the

wealthy economies had known in post–WWII following a surge in capital inflows and real estate

prices. In 1992, Japan’s asset price bubble burst and ushered in a decade-long banking crisis.

Around the same time, with the collapse of the Soviet bloc, several formerly communist

countries in Eastern Europe soon joined the ranks of nations facing banking sector problems. As

the second half of the 1990s approached, emerging markets quickly faced a fresh round of

banking crisis. Problems in Mexico and Argentina (1994–1995) were followed by the famous

Asian crisis of 1997–1998, and then the troubles of Russia and Colombia, among others.12

Argentina in 2001 and Uruguay in 2002 closed that upswing in the banking crisis cycle.

         A brief tranquil period came to an abrupt halt in the summer of 2007 when the subprime

crisis in the United States began in earnest, soon morphing into a global financial crisis.13



12
   While China’s heavy-handed capital controls shielded it from contagious currency crashes during Asia’s turmoil,
it did not protect it from a systemic and costly banking crisis emanating primarily from large-scale lending to
inefficient and bankrupt state-owned enterprises.

   Figure 1 does not fully capture the extent of the present upsurge in financial crises, as Ireland and Iceland (both
having banking crises at the time of this writing) are not part of our core 66-country sample.

         A high incidence of global banking crises has historically been associated with a high

incidence of sovereign defaults of external debt. Figure 2 plots the (GDP-weighted) share of

countries experiencing a banking crisis, as shown in Figure 1 and described above, against the

comparably calculated share of countries experiencing a default or restructuring in their external

debt. Sovereign defaults begin to climb with the onset of WWI (as do banking crises) and

continue to escalate during the Great Depression and World War II. The decades that follow are

relatively quiet, until debt crises sweep emerging markets beginning in the 1980s.14 It remains to

be seen whether the recent global surge in financial sector turbulence will lead to a similar

outcome in the sovereign default cycle. Figure 2 suggests that a sharp rise in sovereign defaults

would hardly be surprising.




14
  Note that in Figure 2 the debt crises of the 1980s do not loom as large as the previous cycle of defaults, as only
middle- and low-income countries faced default, while in addition to emerging market economies several advanced
economies defaulted during the Great Depression and several more defaulted during WWII.

Notes: Sample size includes all countries, out of a total of sixty-six listed in Table 1 that were independent states in
the given year. Three sets of GDP weights are used, 1913 weights for the period 1800–1913, 1990 for the period
1914–1990, and finally 2003 weights for the period 1991–2006. The entries for 2007–2008 list crises in Austria,
Belgium, Germany, Hungary, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The figure
shows a three-year moving average.

Banking Crises: An Equal Opportunity Menace

        In earlier papers, we have shown that the frequency of a default (or restructuring) on

external debt is significantly lower for advanced economies than for emerging markets. For

many high-income countries, that frequency has effectively been zero since 1800.15 Even

countries with a long history of multiple defaults prior to 1800, countries such as France and

Spain, present evidence of having “graduated” from serial default on external debt.

        The second column in Tables 1 and 2 highlights the vast differences between emerging

markets (notably in Africa and in Latin America—but even in several countries in Asia) and

high-income Western Europe, North America and Oceania. The third column of Tables 1 and 2

present the analogous calculation for each country for banking crises (i.e., number of years in

banking crises, according to the extended dataset developed here, divided by the number of years

since independence or since 1800—if independence was earlier). One striking observation from

Tables 1 and 2 is that the average length of time spent in a state of sovereign default is far above

the average amount of time spent in a financial crisis. A country can circumvent its external

creditors for an extended period. It is far more costly to leave a domestic banking crisis hanging,

due to the crippling effects on trade and investment.




15
  We do recognize, however, that the wide-spread abrogation of gold clauses—on domestic debt—during the
1930s’ Great Depression by the United States and other developed economies were de facto sovereign defaults

        Tables 3 and 4 present a different perspective on the prevalence of banking crises. The

second column tallies the number of banking crises (rather than the number of years in crisis)

since independence or 1800; while the third narrows the window to the post–WWII period.

Several features are worth noting. For the advanced economies during the full sample, the

picture that emerges is one of serial banking crises. The world’s financial centers, the United

Kingdom, the United States and France stand out in this regard, with 12, 13, and 15 banking

crisis episodes, respectively. The frequency of banking crises drops off markedly for the

advanced economies and the larger emerging markets alike during post–WWII. However, all

except Portugal experienced at least one post-War crisis prior to the current episode. When the

present wave of crises is fully factored in, the apparent drop will likely be even less pronounced.

Thus, while many now-advanced economies have graduated from a history of serial default on

sovereign debt, or very high inflation (above 20 percent), graduation from banking crises has

proven, so far, virtually impossible. Indeed, Tables 1–4 illustrate that despite dramatic

differences in recent sovereign default performance, the incidence of banking crises is about the

same for advanced economies as for emerging markets. It also should be noted that as financial

markets have developed in the smaller, poorer economies, the frequency of banking crises has

increased.16

  As we have already acknowledged, our accounting of financial crises in poorer countries may be incomplete,
especially for earlier periods, despite our best efforts.

Summary Tables by Region of Frequency of Banking Crises, 1800-2007, and 1945-2007


        Tables 5a and 5b summarize, by region, the evidence on the number of banking crises

and share of years in banking crisis. Table 5a starts in 1800. (The table only includes post

independence crises, which explains why emerging markets have lower cumulative totals since

1800.) Table 5b gives the evidence for post-1945.

Whether the calculations are done from 1800 (Table 5a) or from 1945 (Table 5b), on average

there are no significant differences in either the incidence or number of banking crises

between advanced and emerging economies—banking crises are an equal opportunity

menace. In fact, prior to WWII the advanced economies with their more developed financial

systems were more prone to banking crises than many of the smaller low income counterparts. 17

The Bunching of Banking Crises: Contagion or Common Fundamentals?

         In this section, we discuss the bunching of banking crises across countries that is so

evident in the late-2000s case, where both common shocks (the bursting of the global housing

bubble) and cross-country linkages (for example, because many countries bought U.S. subprime

mortgage debt) are evident.

         Bordo and Murshid (2001) and Neal and Weidenmier (2003) have pointed out that cross-

country correlations in banking crises were also common during 1880–1913, a period of

relatively high international capital mobility under the gold standard. 18 Table 6 looks at a

broader time span including the twentieth century; the table lists the years during which banking

crises are bunched; greater detail on individual country dates is provided in Appendix A3.19 The

famous Baring crisis of 1890 (which involved Argentina and the U.K. before spreading

elsewhere) appears to be the first episode of international bunching of banking crises; this was

followed by the panic of 1907, which began in the United States and quickly spread to other




17
   On average, 7.2 crises for the advanced versus 2.8 for the emerging market countries (Table 5a).
18
   Bordo and Murshid (2001) look at the period 1880–1913. Neal and Weidenmier (2003) emphasize that periods of
apparent contagion can be more readily interpreted as responses to common shocks, an issue we return to in the
context of the present crisis. But, perhaps, the bottom line as regards a historical perspective on financial contagion
is best summarized by Bordo and Murshid (2001), who conclude that “there is little evidence to suggest that cross-
country linkages are tighter in the aftermath of a financial crisis for the recent period” (as opposed to 1880–1913, the
earlier heyday of globalization in financial markets that they study).
19
   Table 6 does not include the bunching of other “types” of crises, such as the wave of sovereign defaults during
1825 or the currency crashes/debasements of the Napoleonic Wars.

advanced economies (particularly, Denmark, France, Italy, Japan, and Sweden). These episodes

are reasonable benchmarks for modern-day financial contagion. 20

           Of course, other pre–World War II episodes of banking crisis contagion pale when

confronted with the Great Depression (which also saw a large bunching in sovereign debt

defaults, as seen earlier in Figure 2).

The Late 2000s Global Financial Crisis

         The current conjuncture is illustrative of the two channels of contagion, linkages and

common shocks. There is little doubt that the U.S. crisis has spilled over into other markets

through direct linkages. For example, German and Japanese financial institutions (and others

ranging as far as Kazakhstan) sought more attractive returns in the U.S. subprime market,

perhaps owing to the fact that profit opportunities in domestic real estate were limited at best and

dismal at worst (Figure 3). Indeed, after the fact, it has become evident that many financial

institutions outside the United States had nontrivial exposure to the U.S. subprime market.21

This is a classic channel of transmission or contagion, through which a crisis in one country

spreads across international borders. In the present context, however, contagion or spillovers are

only part of the story.

         That many other countries are experiencing economic difficulties at the same time as the

United States also owes importantly to the fact that many of the features that characterized the

run-up to the subprime crisis in the United States were present in many other advanced

economies. Specifically, many countries in Europe and elsewhere (New Zealand, for example)

were having their own home-grown real estate bubbles (Figure 3). This, in and of itself, makes

these countries vulnerable to the usual nasty consequences of asset market crashes—irrespective

of what may be happening in the United States.




21
  Owing to the opaqueness of balance sheets in many financial institutions in these countries, the full extent of
exposure is, as yet, unknown.

Banking Crises, Capital Mobility, And Financial Liberalization

         Also consonant with the modern theory of crises is the striking correlation between freer

capital mobility and the incidence of banking crises, as shown in Figure 4. Periods of high

international capital mobility have repeatedly produced international banking crises, not only

famously as they did in the 1990s, but historically. The figure plots a three-year moving

average of the share of all countries experiencing banking crises on the right scale. On the left

scale, we graph the index of capital mobility, due to Obstfeld and Taylor (2004), updated and

back cast using their same design principle, to cover our full sample period. While the Obstfeld–

Taylor index may have its limitations, we feel it nevertheless provides a concise summary of

complicated forces by emphasizing de facto capital mobility based on actual flows.

         For the post-1970 period, Kaminsky and Reinhart (1999) present formal evidence on the

links of crises with financial liberalization. In 18 of the 26 banking crises they study, the

financial sector had been liberalized within the preceding five years, usually less. In the 1980s

and 1990s most liberalization episodes were associated with financial crises of varying severity.

Only in a handful of countries (for instance, Canada) did financial sector liberalization proceed

smoothly. Specifically, the paper presents evidence that the probability of a banking crisis

conditional on financial liberalization having taken place is higher than the unconditional

probability of a banking crisis; probit analysis confirmed these results. Using a 53-country

sample for the period 1980–1995 Demirgüç-Kunt and Detragiache (1998) also show, in the

context of a multivariate logit model, that financial liberalization has an independent negative

effect on banking sector stability and that this result is robust across numerous specifications. 22



22
   See also, Drees and Pazarbasioglu (1998) for an insightful discussion of the Nordic experience with financial
liberalization.


                                                         22
                  The stylized evidence presented in Caprio and Klingebiel (1996) suggests that inadequate

regulation and lack of supervision at the time of the liberalization may play a key role in

explaining why deregulation and banking crises are so closely entwined. Again, this is a theme

across developed countries and emerging markets alike.

                                                                      Figure 4

                     III. Capital Flow Bonanzas, Credit Cycles and Asset Prices

         This section examines some of the common features of banking crises across countries,

regions and time. The focus is on the regularities among cycles in international capital flows,

credit, and asset prices (specifically, housing and equity prices).

Capital flow bonanzas and crisis vulnerability

         One common characteristic of the run-up to banking crises is a sustained surge in capital

inflows. Reinhart and Reinhart (2008) delineate a criterion to define a capital flow bonanza,

catalogue (country-by-country) “bonanza” 23 episodes for 1960–2006, and examined the links

between bonanza spells and banking crises, employing the crisis dates defined and dated in the

Appendix to the present paper. 24

         From the Appendix crises dates and the bonanza dates, two country-specific probabilities

were calculated. The unconditional probability of a banking crisis, along the lines of those

shown in Tables 1 and 2 (except for 1960–2007), and the probability of a banking crisis within a

window of three years before and after the bonanza year or years—that is, as the conditional

probability of a crisis. If capital flow bonanzas make countries more crises prone, the

conditional probability, P(Crisis│Bonanza) should be greater than the unconditional probability

of a crisis, P(Crisis).




23
   Reinhart an Reinhart define a capital flow bonanza as follows They settled on an algorithm that provided uniform
treatment across countries but was flexible enough to allow for significant cross-country variation in the current
account. As in Kaminsky and Reinhart (1999), we select a threshold to define bonanzas that is common across
countries (in this case the 20th percentile).23 This threshold included most of the better known episodes in the
literature but was not so inclusive as to label a bonanza more “routine” deteriorations in the current account.
Because the underlying frequency distributions vary widely across countries, the common threshold produces quite
disperse country-specific cutoffs. For instance, in the case of relatively closed India, the cutoff to define a bonanza
is a current account deficit/GDP in excess of 1.8 percent, while for trade-oriented Malaysia the comparable cutoff is
a deficit/GDP ratio of 6.6 percent. 23. 23
24
   They performed a comparable exercise for currency, debt, and inflation crises.


                                                          24
        Table 7 reproduces a subset of the results a Reinhart and Reinhart for banking crises. It

presents aggregates of the country-specific conditional and unconditional probabilities for three

groups (all countries, high income, and middle and low income).

The probability of a banking crisis conditional on a capital flow bonanza is higher than the

unconditional probability. The bottom row of Table 6 provides the share of countries for which

P(Crisis│Bonanza) ≥ P(Crisis) as an additional indication of how common place is it across

countries to see bonanzas associated with a more crisis-prone environment. For banking crises,

the majority of countries (61 percent) register a higher propensity to banking crises around

bonanza periods.

        We conjecture that the 61 percent figure would be higher if one were to include post-

2007 data in Table 7. Many countries experiencing the most severe banking crises have also run

large sustained current account deficits. These include many developed countries, such as the

United States, the United Kingdom, Spain, Iceland and Ireland.

        The findings on capital flow bonanzas in Reinhart and Reinhart (2008) are also consistent

with empirical regularities surrounding credit cycles. Mendoza and Terrones (2008), who

examine cycles in credit in both advanced and emerging market economies using a very different



                                                       25
approach from that just discussed, find that credit booms in emerging market economies are

often preceded by surges in capital inflows. They also conclude that while not all credit booms

end in financial crises, most emerging market crises were preceded by credit booms. They link

credit booms to rising asset prices, an issue we turn to next. 25

Equity and housing price cycles and banking crises

          In this section, we summarize the literature on asset price bubbles and banking crises,

extending it to incorporate new data on housing prices in emerging markets, as well as data on

the unfolding crises in the advanced economies.

          The now-infamous real estate bubble in the United States that began to deflate at the end

of 2005 occupies center stage as a culprit of the present financial crisis. But the subprime

episode is far from unique in that regard. In Reinhart and Rogoff (2008b), we document the

trajectory in real housing prices around all the post–WWII banking crises in advanced

economies, with particular emphasis on the “Big 5” crises (Spain, 1977, Norway, 1987, Finland

and Sweden, 1991 and Japan, 1992).26 The pattern that emerges is clear: a boom in real housing

prices in the run-up to the crisis is followed by a marked decline the year of the crisis and in

subsequent years. Bordo and Jeanne (2002), also studying the advanced economies during

1970–2001, find that banking crises tend to occur either at the peak of the boom in real housing

prices, or right after the bust. Gerdrup (2003) presents a compelling narrative of the links

between Norway’s three banking crises during 1890s–1993 and the booms and busts in housing

prices.

          Table 8 illustrates the magnitude and duration of the downturn in housing prices that has

historically accompanied major banking crises in both advanced and emerging economies.

25
   See also Kaminsky and Reinhart (1999), who also examine the growth in real credit to the private sector around
both banking and currency crises.

   The years refer to the beginning of the crisis.

While the links between banking crises and the housing price cycle have been examined in both

our earlier work and numerous other papers (most frequently case studies), this is the first paper

to provide systematic evidence on the behavior of housing prices for emerging market economies

around some of their major banking crises. The crisis episodes include the “Big 6” Asian crises

of 1997–1998, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and the much buffeted

Hong Kong.

          Other emerging market episodes include Argentina’s mega-crisis in 2001–2002, and

Colombia’s 1998 crisis, which produced the worst recession since the national income accounts

were tabulated in the early 1920s. In the current conjuncture of unfolding crises, we include




                                                        28
Hungary, in addition to the advanced economies that have had recent housing market bubbles

(Iceland, Ireland, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States).27

         Two features stand out from the summary statistics presented in Table 8. First is the

persistence of the cycle in real housing prices in both advanced economies and emerging

markets, typically four to six years.28 The second feature that stands out from Table 8 is that the

magnitudes of the declines in real housing prices around banking crises from peak to trough

are not appreciably different in emerging and advanced economies. This comparability is quite

surprising given that most macroeconomic time series exhibit drastically greater volatility in

emerging markets, and thus it merits further attention.29 Certainly, the first results presented

here on comparing housing price booms and busts around banking crisis dates appears to

strongly support the contention that banking crises are an equal opportunity menace.



         The prolonged housing price downturns following financial crises are in stark contrast to

the behavior of real equity prices, as illustrated in Figures 5a and 5b in which the pattern of

decline and recovery is more v-shaped.




27
   Historical comparisons are hard to come by, as most real housing price series are of recent vintage. We do
include in this category two episodes: the United States during the Great Depression and Norway’s crisis at the turn
of the century (1898).
28
   See Ceron and Suarez (2006), who estimate its average duration at six years
29
   For example, Agenor, McDermott, and Prasad (2000) provide evidence that output and real consumption are far
more volatile in emerging markets; Kaminsky, Reinhart and Vegh (2003) present evidence that the amplitude of the
cycle in real government spending is orders of magnitude greater in emerging markets.

            These figures show the evolution of real equity prices from four years prior to the crisis

to three years afterwards for emerging and advanced economies separately. As the figures make

plain, equity prices typically peak before the year of the banking crisis and decline for 2–3 years

as the crisis approaches and, in the case of emerging markets in the year following the crisis.

However, the pattern tends to be v-shaped and the recovery complete, in the sense that three

years after the crisis real equity prices are on average higher than the pre-crisis peak.

            One can conjecture that one reason why major banking crises are such protracted affairs

is that these episodes involve the real estate market’s persistent cycle in a way that “pure stock

market crashes” (for instance, Black Monday in October 1987 or the burst of the IT bubble in

2001) do not. 30



Financial Sector Expansion and Financial Crisis

            Philippon (2007) analyzes the expansion of the financial services sector (including

insurance) in the United States, which averaged 4.9 percent of GDP during 1976–85, rising to

7.5 percent 1996–2005. His paper argues that this gain was not sustainable and a decline of at

least 1 percent of GDP was probable. In the wake of the subprime crisis, the shrinkage of the

financial sector during 2008 and 2009 is likely to be significantly larger. The pre-crisis

explosion and post-collapse implosion of the financial sector surrounding a banking crisis is also

not new or unique to the United States.

            Figure 6 plots the number of banks in the United States in the run-up and aftermath of the

Great Depression. Perhaps, the bubble in equity and real estate prices also extended to the

number of financial institutions. This expansion in the run-up and contraction in the aftermath in

     This is consistent with the regularity that house prices are far more predictable (i.e., inertial) than equity prices.

the number of financial institutions is evident during other banking crises—especially in those

                    IV. The Fiscal and Growth Consequences of Banking Crises

        Looking at the fiscal and growth consequences of banking crises, we again find some

surprising parallels between developed countries and emerging markets. Our analysis of the

fiscal consequences, in particular, is a sharp departure from the previous literature, which has

focused almost entirely on imputed “bailout costs” to the government which, as we shall argue,

are extremely difficult to measure. Instead, we will focus on the fiscal costs to the government,

particularly the huge build-ups in debt that follow banking crises. We are able to do so by

tapping the extensive new cross-country annual dataset on domestic debt compiled in Reinhart

and Rogoff (2008c). This data allow us to show the remarkable surge in debt that occurs in the

wake of crises.

That elusive concept of bailout costs

        As we have noted, much of the literature that studies banking crisis episodes is fixated on

providing estimates of the fiscal or bailout costs of these crises (see, for example, an excellent

discussion in Frydl, 1999, and various papers in Norges Bank, 2006).31 At the time of this

writing, the International Monetary Fund estimates that the fiscal costs of the U.S. subprime

crisis will tally about $1.4 trillion, or around 11 percent of GDP.32 However, estimates of bailout

costs vary markedly across studies, depending on the methodology and vary even more across

time, depending on the length of horizon used to calculate the fiscal impact of the crisis, a point

stressed in Frydl (1999). 33 Table 9 presents the upper and lower bounds of estimates of the

bailout costs for some of the better-known banking crises in both advanced and emerging

economies in nearly all regions. The discrepancies across estimates are large and, in some cases,

   A similar problem plagues work on determining the effectiveness of foreign exchange intervention by measuring
the profitability of such market purchases or sales. The results depend importantly on the width of the time window
and implicit assumptions of the cost of financing. See Neely (1995).

staggering. Among the ”Big 5” post–WWII crises in advanced economies, the differences in

estimated bailout costs for Japan and Spain are 16 and 11 percent of GDP, respectively. Even

for Norway, where the difference between the upper and lower bounds of the estimates is 2

percent of GDP, a different way of looking at the discrepancy is to note that the upper end of the

estimates (4 percent of GDP) is twice as large as the lower bound estimates of the costs of the

bailout. Furthermore, as noted in Vale (2006), if the costs are calculated over a longer time

horizon after the crisis, the picture that emerges is even more at odds with the higher-end

estimates; it shows that the Norwegian government actually made a small profit on the banking

resolution, due to the later sale of shares in the nationalized banks.

  In Norges Bank (2006) it is argued that the Norwegian government actually made a small profit on the banking
resolution.



        In what follows, we argue that this nearly universal focus on providing opaque

calculations of bailout costs is both misguided and incomplete. It is misguided because there are

no widely agreed upon guidelines to calculate these estimates. It is incomplete because the fiscal

consequences of banking crises reach far beyond the more immediate bailout costs. These

consequences mainly result from the significant adverse impact that the crisis has on government




                                                       35
revenues (in nearly all cases) and the fact that in several episodes the fiscal policy reaction to the

crisis has also involved substantial fiscal stimulus packages.

Growth in the Aftermath of Crises

         The fact that most banking crises, especially systemic ones, are associated with economic

downturns is well established in the empirical literature and we offer no new compelling

evidence on that score. 34 Reinhart and Rogoff (2008b) recently summarized the evolution of

output before, during, and after all the banking crises (systemic or not) in post–WWII. Figure 7

shows the advanced economies as a group, as well as the “big five” (Japan, Nordics and Spain),

while Figure 7b augments this analysis with a comparable summary for the post-war banking

crises in emerging markets. As before, time t denotes the year of the crisis. It is interesting to

note that the figures show a steeper decline but a somewhat faster comeback in growth for

emerging markets than in the advanced economies. 35 It is beyond the scope of this paper to

ascertain the longer run growth consequences of banking crises, but we wish to note this post-

crises pattern because growth (important in its own right) has nontrivial implications for fiscal

balances, government debts, and the broader cost and consequences of any financial crisis.




34
   See, for instance, Frydl (1999), and Kaminsky and Reinhart (1999), and especially Rajan, Detragiache and
Dell’Ariccia (2008), who examine the output consequences of the credit channel following banking crises using
micro data. We note that the cases of output collapses studied in Barro and Ursua (2008) virtually all are associated
with banking crises.
35
   It is important to note that the v-shaped pattern of recovery is importantly influenced by the sharp comebacks of
the Asian economies from the severe 1997–1998 crisis. Excluding these countries considerably worsens the average
performance two and three years after the banking crisis, making the pattern look more u-shaped.

Beyond Bailout Costs: The Impact Of The Crisis On Revenues And Debt

           Since WWII the most common policy response to a systemic banking crisis (in both

emerging and advanced economies) has been to engineer (with varying degrees of success) a

bailout of the banking sector, whether through purchases of bad assets, directed mergers of bad

banks with relatively sound institutions, direct government takeovers, or some combination of

these. Such actions have had in many cases major fiscal consequences, typically early on in the

crisis. However, as noted earlier, banking crises are protracted affairs with lingering

consequences in asset markets—notably real estate prices and the real economy. As such it is

not surprising that government revenues are adversely and significantly impacted by the crisis.

           As noted, several studies have traced out the adverse impacts of banking crises on

economic activity; what these studies have left unexplored is the direct consequences of the

recession on government finances—specifically, tax revenues. Figure 8a plots the average

pattern in annual real revenue growth three years before, during, and three years after banking

crises for a total of 86 banking crises during 1800–1944 for which we have complete revenue

data. 36

           The comparable exercise is shown for all 138 post–WWII banking crises in

Figure 8b. The patterns for the pre- and post-war samples are not identical but strikingly similar.

Annual revenue growth is robust in the years leading up to the banking crisis; growth weakens

significantly the year of the crisis and subsequently posts declines in the years immediately

following the onset of the crisis. For the pre-war episodes revenues decline, on average for two

years, while for the post-war the revenue slump extends to the third year.



36
  Revenues (from Mitchell, 2003a, b, and c ) are deflated by consumer price indices; the numerous sources for these
data are given on a country-by-country and period-by-period basis in the data appendix to Reinhart and Rogoff
(2008a).

Parallels in Revenue Losses between Emerging Markets and Developed Economies


           Again, the parallels between developed countries and emerging markets is striking.

Figure 8c shows the revenue declines surrounding banking crises for the advanced countries

across the entire sample, with the “big five” post-war crises also listed separately. Revenue

growth resumes (from a lower base) starting in the third year after the crisis. Advanced

economies exhibit a strong inclination to resort to stimulus measures to cushion economic

activity, seen most spectacularly in the aggressive use of infrastructure spending in Japan during

the 1990s. Emerging markets are far less well poised to engage in countercyclical fiscal policy.

Nevertheless, the effect of the crisis on the trajectory of taxes is broadly similar. Figure 8d gives

revenue declines around banking crises for emerging markets for the entire sample. The average

revenue drop is actually quite similar to the “big five,” although the recovery is faster—in line

with a more swift recovery in growth, as discussed in the preceding section.

Government debt buildup in the aftermath of banking crises

          To get a rough approximation of the impact of a crisis on government finances, we use

the historical central government debt data compiled in Reinhart and Rogoff (2008c). It is

important to note that this is a partial picture, since the general (not just central government) is

affected by the crisis. Also, there is typically during these episodes a marked expansion in

government-guaranteed debt, which does not show up in the central government figures.



                                                            43
        With these caveats in mind, Figure 9 presents a summary of the evolution of debt in the

aftermath of some of the major post-war crises in both advanced and emerging markets.

        Not surprisingly, taken together, the bailout of the banking sector, the shortfall in

revenue, and the fiscal stimulus packages that have accompanied some of these crises imply

widening fiscal deficits adding to the existing stock of government debt. What is perhaps

surprising is how dramatic the rise in debt is. If the stock of debt is indexed to equal 100 at the

time of the crisis (T), the average experience is one in which the real stock of debt rises to 186

three years after the crisis. That is to say, the real stock of debt nearly doubles.37 Such

increases in government indebtedness are evident in emerging and advanced economies alike,


37
  Indeed, there are some important cases such as Japan where the accelerated debt build-up goes on for over a
decade, so the three-year cutoff grossly understates the longer term consequences.


                                                        44
and extremely high in both. Arguably, the true legacy of banking crises is higher public

indebtedness—far over and beyond the direct headline costs of big bailout packages.38

(Obviously, as we noted earlier, the rise in public debt depends on a whole range of political and

economic factors, including the effectiveness of the policy response and the severity of the initial

real economic shock that produced the crisis. Nevertheless, the universality of the large debt rise

is stunning.)



                                               V. Concluding Remarks

        Countries may “graduate” from serial default on sovereign debt and recurrent episodes of

very high inflation, as the cases of France, Austria, Spain and others illustrate. History tells us,

however, that graduation from recurrent banking and financial crises is much more elusive. And

it should not have taken the 2007–2009 financial crisis to remind us. Out of the 66 countries in

our sample, only Portugal, Austria, the Netherlands and Belgium had managed to escape from

banking crises from 1945–2007. During 2008, however, even three of these four countries were

among those engaged in massive bailouts as the current global financial crisis evolves.

        Indeed, the wave of financial crises that began with the onset of the subprime crisis in the

United States in 2007 has dispelled any prior notion among academics, market participants, or

policymakers that acute financial crises are either a thing of the past or relegated to the “volatile”

emerging markets. The “this time is different syndrome” has been alive and well in the United

States, where it first took the form of a widespread belief that sharp productivity gains stemming

from the information technology industry justified price–earning ratios in the equity market that



38
  We note that Figure 9 gives percentage change in debt, rather than debt to GDP, in order not to distort numbers by
the large falls in GDP that sometimes accompany crises. However, the same basic message comes across looking at
debt to GDP instead. Note that the calculations are based on total central government debt.


                                                        45
far exceeded any historical norm. 39 That delusion ended with the burst of the IT bubble in 2001.

But the excesses quickly reemerged, morphing into a different shape in a different market. The

securitization of subprime mortgages combined with a heavy appetite for these instruments from

countries like Germany, Japan, and major emerging markets like China fueled perceptions that

housing prices would continue to climb forever. “This time it was different” because there were

new markets, new instruments, and new lenders. In particular, financial engineering was thought

to have tamed risk by better tailoring exposures to investors’ appetites. Derivatives contracts,

meanwhile, offered all manner of hedging opportunities. We now know how that popular

delusion ended.

        Historical experience already shows that rich countries are not as “special” as some

cheerleaders had been arguing, both when it comes to managing capital inflows and especially

when it comes to banking crises. This paper has used an extensive new dataset that includes data

on housing prices in some key emerging markets as well as revenue and domestic debt data that

dates back almost a century for most countries and more for many. Surprisingly, not only is the

frequency and duration of banking crises similar across developed countries and middle-income

countries, so too are quantitative measures of both the run-up and the fall-out. Notably, the

duration of real housing price declines following financial crises in both groups are often four

years or more, while the magnitudes of the crash are comparable. One striking finding is the

huge surge in debt most countries experience in the wake of a financial crisis, with real central

government debt typically increasing by about 86 percent on average (in real terms) during the

three years following the crisis.




39
  An important question is how rare banking crises, through sudden changes in market liquidity, might amplify the
effects on asset prices analyzed by Barro (2009).

                   Appendix I. Country sample, crisis definition and dates


       In this section, we list the countries in the core sample (Table A1), and describe the

criteria used in this study to date banking crises.

       With regard to banking crises, our analysis stresses events. The main reason for

following this approach has to do with the lack of long time-series data that would allow us to

date banking or financial crises quantitatively along the lines of inflation or currency crashes.

For example, the relative price of bank stocks (or financial institutions relative to the market)

would be a logical indicator to examine. However, this is problematic, particularly for the earlier

part of our sample as well as for developing countries (where many domestic banks do not have

publicly traded equity).

        If the beginning of a banking crisis is marked by bank runs and withdrawals, then

changes in bank deposits could be used to date the crises. This indicator would have certainly

done well in dating the numerous banking panics of the 1800s. Often, however, the banking

problems do not arise from the liability side, but from a protracted deterioration in asset quality,

be it from a collapse in real estate prices or increased bankruptcies in the nonfinancial sector. In

this case, a large increase in bankruptcies or nonperforming loans could be used to mark the

onset of the crisis. Indicators of business failures and nonperforming loans are also usually

available only sporadically, if at all; the latter are also made less informative by the banks’ desire

to hide their problems for as long as possible.

Given these data limitations, we mark a banking crisis by two types of events: (1) bank runs that

lead to the closure, merging, or takeover by the public sector of one or more financial institutions

(as in Venezuela in 1993 or Argentina in 2001); and (2) if there are no runs, the closure,

merging, takeover, or large-scale government assistance of an important financial institution (or

group of institutions) that marks the start of a string of similar outcomes for other financial

institutions (as in Thailand 1996–97). We rely on existing studies of banking crises and on the

financial press; according to these studies the fragility of the banking sector was widespread

during these periods.

       Many country-specific studies (such as Camprubi, 1957, for Peru; Cheng, 2003,

McElderry, 1976, for China; and Noel, 2002, for Mexico) pick up banking crisis episodes not

covered by the multicountry literature and contribute importantly to this chronology, but the

main sources for cross-country dating of crises are as follows: For post-1970, the comprehensive

and well-known study by Caprio and Klingebiel—which the authors updated through 2003—is

authoritative, especially when it comes to classifying banking crises into systemic or more

benign categories; Kaminsky and Reinhart (1999), and Jácome (2008) for Latin America round

out the sources. For pre–World War II, Kindleberger (1989), Bordo et al. (2001), and Willis and

Beckhart (1929) provide multicountry coverage on banking crises.

       We relegate a summary discussion of the limitations of this event-based dating approach

to Table A2, while the years in which the banking crises began are listed in Table A3—

unfortunately, for many of the early episodes it is difficult to ascertain how long the crisis lasted.

                   We mark a banking crisis by two types         This approach to dating the beginning of a
Banking crisis     of events: (1) bank runs that lead to the     banking crisis is not without drawbacks. It
                   closure, merging, or takeover by the          could date a crisis too late, because the
Type I:            public sector of one or more financial        financial problems usually begin well before
