                                           ABSTRACT


The costs of government assistance to banks depend on the way rescues are managed. The central
questions of policy reference do not revolve around whether to bail out banks, but rather around the

choice of which banks to rescue and the means for doing so. If a rescue is handled skillfully, the
cost can be greatly reduced. The history of assistance to U.S. banks during the Great Depression
illustrates these themes well, and can provide useful lessons for Asia today. This paper reviews the

history of bank distress and assistance in the United States during the 1930's and examines in detail
the role of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation - how it targeted banks, the effect of its
assistance, the cost of providing assistance, and the way that it tried to align bank incentives to
protect against abuse of government protection. Then, the paper contrasts that experience with the

recent government loans and preferred stock purchases for Japanese banks. We argue that
combining subsidized preferred stock purchases with mandatory matching contributions of common
stock, limits on bank dividend payments, and reforms on bank capital regulation that credibly

incorporate market discipline into the regulatory process would increase the benefits and reduce the
costs of government support for banks.

I. Introduction

       When banking systems are in distress, should they be rescued? If so, in what form

and on what terms should resources be transferred to banks? Is it possible to derive

lessons from relatively successful bank rescue efforts of the past that would be useful to

Japanese and other would-be bank rescuers? These three questions motivate our attempt

to come to grips with the lessons that U.S. bank rescue efforts during the Depression hold

for banking policy in Asia today. The key challenge in any bank rescue policy is to

design a balanced approach that accomplishes the main objectives of bank rescues –

salvaging local information capital about borrowers in the long run and increasing credit

flows to worthwhile investments in the short run – while minimizing the damage to

market discipline and bank incentives toward risk that comes with government bailouts.



Should Banks Be Helped?

       To the first question we posed – whether banks should be rescued – we offer a

brief and informal reply. There is certainly a respectable argument in favor of rescuing

banking systems from insolvency. Bank finance is crucial to the process of capital

allocation, particularly for investment by small and medium-sized firms for which there

are no alternative sources of funding. Smaller firms can be a key source of recovery from

recession. That is especially true under current circumstances in Japan, Korea, and

elsewhere in Asia. In Japan and Korea, the growth of small firms is needed as part of

long-run structural adjustment away from excessive reliance on large firm conglomerates.

Part of that adjustment requires that the financial sector finance the growth of small
                                                                                             2


firms. Thus, in Asia, there may be a particularly strong argument in favor of preserving a

viable banking system that can act as a source of finance for smaller firms.

       To a large extent the argument in favor of assisting banks relies on attendant

reforms in bank lending practices that will ensure that bank credit is channeled to firms

on the basis of the merit of their investments. Those incentives are part and parcel of a

proper regulatory structure that encourages market discipline, which rewards value

creation and prudent risk management by banks. Banks operating under skewed

incentives will often make unwarranted, value-destroying loans to insiders or to

politically influential borrowers. For example, Krueger and Yoo (2001) show that in

Korea resources have been channeled in large part to value-destroying large firms. Thus,

bank recapitalization must be combined with effective reforms of lending practices.

       To what extent can one argue that bank assistance is unnecessary in a world of

free foreign entry by banks? Foreign bank entry is a potential alternative source of funds

for small firms, and one that is less likely to be diverted to value-destroying investments.

And foreign entrants into distressed banking systems tend to enjoy a relatively low cost

of capital, for two reasons: first, they have not suffered capital destroying loan losses, and

second, they are better able to raise new capital because the absence of loan losses also

means that markets will impose lower adverse-selection (“lemons”) discounts on any new

bank capital offerings (Calomiris and Wilson 2003).

       While there is substantial evidence that foreign entry enhances the efficiency of

banking systems (Demirguc-Kunt and Levine 1998, Kane 1998), it takes time for foreign

entrants to establish information about borrowers and familiarity with local legal and

institutional arrangements. Calomiris and Carey (1994) found that foreign bank entrants
                                                                                             3


into the United States during the U.S. bank “capital crunch” of the 1980s tended to lend

disproportionately to lower-risk borrowers, tended to purchase rather than originate

loans, and tended to act as syndicate participants rather than lead managers. Furthermore,

despite their conservative loan purchases and originations, foreign banks tended to suffer

worse loan losses than domestic U.S. banks in the early 1990s, which further suggests an

information cost disadvantage. Although relaxing barriers to foreign entry is clearly a

crucial part of resolving a credit crunch and reforming long-term lending practices,

foreign bank lending may not be a perfect substitute for domestic bank lending in the

short run. Thus, it is still potentially beneficial to provide some assistance to the most

capable existing domestic banks.

       There is, of course, another reason governments wish to protect banks – call it the

“dark side” of bank bailouts. Banks are repositories of economic and political power – a

source not only of funds but also of substantial discretionary power over the economy. In

Asia, as elsewhere, banks have been used as tools of economic planning and also as a

primary means of channeling favors to influential parties (so-called crony capitalism).

The idea that the banking system should be turned into an efficient, competitive

mechanism for attracting and distributing funds may make for a good speech, but it still

cannot realistically be described as the sole or overriding purpose of banking policy in

most countries. Never mind that the banking crises that gave rise to the losses that now

plague virtually every economy in East Asia were the direct result of the perverse

incentives of government protection (the so-called “moral hazard problem”); too many

influential people simply have too much at stake to allow banking to be reorganized

efficiently. Banks are only able to channel such favors if they themselves are recipients
                                                                                             4


of subsidies from the government, hence the need to preserve banks’ (and their related

firms’) exclusive rights, and the need to offer banks subsidized deposit insurance,

subsidized purchases of bad loans, or subsidized capital injections.

       Crony capitalists will appeal for bank assistance on the basis of the “capital-

crunch” motive, while in fact hoping to channel government assistance for banks into

their own coffers (indeed, there is much anecdotal evidence that aid to Korean banks in

1997-1998 ended up being channeled to distressed chaebol). Thus, the central goal of

bank bailout policy is to design bank assistance to meet the legitimate goals of mitigating

credit supply contraction for value-creating bank-dependent borrowers, while minimizing

the potential abuse of assistance.

       In this paper, we take it for granted that domestic banking systems will be helped,

even if, from the narrow economic standpoint, the likely costs of such assistance exceed

the likely benefits. To emphasize the importance of combining aid with proper incentives

for banks, however, it is worth pausing a moment to consider how costly assistance to

banks can be.

       There have been over one hundred cases of banking system crises worldwide over

the past two decades (where a crisis is defined as losses to insolvent banks that exceed

one percent of GDP – see Beim and Calomiris 2001, Chapter 7). The direct costs of bank

bailouts are often above 20% of GDP and above 30% of GDP in the recent Asian crises

countries of Thailand, Korea, and Indonesia. Estimated resolution costs in Japan are

harder to estimate, but likely will exceed 20% of GDP. While that cost represents a

transfer of resources from taxpayers to bank claimants, rather than a loss to society as a

whole, there are significant social losses associated with such an enormous transfer. First,
                                                                                              5


the fiscal consequences of having to finance that transfer are disastrous, and often result

in substantial tax increases and severe currency depreciation, both of which are highly

distortionary. Furthermore, there are additional economic costs from foregone output in

the wake of the economic collapse that accompanies financial crises, and there are

additional deadweight costs from continuing to support inefficient, value-destroying

firms via the lifelines that distressed banks provide to distressed borrowers.

       The magnitude of the transfers that accompany current day bailouts is staggering

in comparison to historical experience. Waves of bank insolvency used to be far less

frequent and far less costly to resolve. The cost of bailing out all the insolvent U.S. banks

during the Great Depression would have been roughly 3% of GDP. From 1870-1913,

there were seven major episodes of banking system insolvency worldwide (defining

major episodes as producing negative bank net worth in excess of 1% of GDP), and only

two of those produced situations where the negative net worth of insolvent banks

exceeded 5% of GDP; in both of those cases, bank losses did not exceed 10% of GDP

(Calomiris 2001).

       The implication is clear: safety nets themselves, through their effects on bank

behavior have been a significant contributor to the cost of resolving bank distress

(Demirguc-Kunt and Detragiache 2000, Demirguc-Kunt and Huizinga 2000, Barth,

Caprio, and Levine 2001). And it is worth reiterating that one of the supposed benefits of

safety net assistance – limiting the reduction in bank credit supply in the wake of

macroeconomic shocks – is usually illusory: Financial crises produce the worst credit

crunches because “resurrection strategies” by banks magnify initial bank losses from

macroeconomic shocks and ultimately reduce credit supply accordingly. Once banking
                                                                                                6


systems collapse under the weight of safety net-induced risk taking, the ultimate credit

crunch is deeper and lasts longer (Caprio and Klingabiel 1996a, 1996b, Cull, Senbet and

Sorge 2000, Honahan and Klingabiel 2000, Boyd, Gomis, Kwak, and Smith 2000).



Important Policy Choices

        The costs of government assistance to banks depend on the way rescues are

managed. The central questions of policy relevance do not revolve around whether to bail

out banks, but rather around the choice of which banks to rescue and the means for doing

so. If a rescue is handled skillfully, the cost can be much reduced.

        First, bank rescues need not involve all banks. While new foreign entrants may

not be a perfect substitute for existing domestic franchises from the standpoint of

allocating loans to small and medium-sized businesses, that does not imply that all, or

even most, domestic banks are worth saving. If government can find a way to identify

and target relatively solvent banks with relatively high franchise values (a task made

easier by the fact that relatively healthy banks also tend to be the ones with higher

franchise values), and if it is politically feasible to limit assistance to those banks, then

the costs of a partial bailout could be much less than that of a system-wide bailout.

        Second, to the extent that the rescue mechanism chosen to assist the designated

banks can be designed to minimize moral-hazard, the risk of continuing bank weakness

(and future government expenses on bailouts) can also be reduced substantially. For

example, conditions that limit the ability or incentive of banks to channel credit

inefficiently or to take on high risk after receiving infusions of government capital can

make assistance much more cost-effective.
                                                                                              7


       The history of assistance to U.S. banks during the Great Depression illustrates

these themes well, and can provide useful lessons for Asia today. Section II reviews the

history of bank distress and assistance in the United States during the 1930s and

examines in detail the role of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation – how it targeted

banks, the effects of its assistance, the cost of providing assistance, and the way that it

tried to align bank incentives to protect against abuse of government protection. Section

III contrasts that experience with the recent government loans and preferred stock

purchases for Japanese banks. Section IV concludes with some specific policy

recommendations. We argue that combining subsidized preferred stock purchases with

mandatory matching contributions of common stock, limits on bank dividend payments,

and reforms of bank capital regulation that credibly incorporate market discipline into the

regulatory process would increase the benefits and reduce the costs of government

support for banks.



II. U.S. Bank Distress During the Great Depression

       The banking crisis in the United States during the Great Depression provides a

useful historical example of how policy makers can balance the opposing needs of

protecting banks and maintaining market discipline over banks. The authorities managed

to mitigate the loss of capital in the banking system and its effects on credit supply, while

retaining market forces that continued to reward relatively prudent banks.

       In this section, we begin with a review of the severity of the shocks banks faced

and the extent of bank distress. We show how market discipline transformed the

contraction in bank capital into a contraction in credit supply. At the same time, there
                                                                                              8


was an increase in the illiquidity of risky assets as the result of protracted bank asset

liquidation.

       We then consider the response of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to

banking system distress. Specifically, we present evidence on how the RFC combined

assistance with conditions for receiving assistance in a way that preserved market

discipline and protected the government from excessive exposure to loss.



The Severity of Bank Distress During the Depression

       Measured by bank failure rates, depositor loss rates, or the extent of bank credit

contraction, the Great Depression was, and remains, the largest and most persistent shock

suffered by the U.S. banking system since (at least) the 1830s. Figure 1 presents data on

bank suspensions, monthly, from 1921-1936, and Figure 2 reports corresponding data on

the deposits of suspended banks. As these figures show, banking collapse during the

Great Depression was not a single event, but rather several waves of bank distress. As

Wicker (1996) and Calomiris and Mason (2003) show, these waves of bank failures

reflected fundamental shocks that were often region- and bank-specific – reflecting

region-specific shocks to income and bank-specific investment and risk management

choices. Contrary to the view espoused by Friedman and Schwartz (1963), which saw the

waves of bank failures as the result of autonomous waves of panic in the financial system

unrelated to prior fundamental disturbances, Calomiris and Mason (2003) find that when

one disaggregates by region and bank, it is possible to link prior local and national

shocks to subsequent bank failures. Calomiris and Mason (2003) find that autonomous

sources of bank failure (resulting either from “illiquidity crises” or failure “contagion”)
                                                                                            9


were not important prior to January-March 1933 (at the trough of the Depression); thus,

bank failures for most of the Depression period (1929-1932) reflected a similar process to

that of bank failure during previous economic downturns.

       As during previous periods of national depression or regional agricultural distress

(e.g., the 1890s and the 1920s), the United States suffered larger numbers of bank failures

than countries experiencing comparable shocks. For example, Canada experienced few

bank failures in the 1930s (Haubrich 1990). The primary reason that the United States

suffered unusual rates of bank failure in response to shocks was the peculiar U.S. “unit

banking” system – that is, regulatory limits on bank branching that limited bank

opportunities to diversify their loan portfolios across locations (Calomiris 2000).

       The consequences of bank distress for credit supply were large and protracted,

lasting several years beyond the March 1933 trough of the Depression, as noted by Fisher

(1933) and Bernanke (1983). Figures 3 and 4 shows the synchronous contraction in bank

capital and bank lending, expressed either as aggregates or as ratios to total assets.

       Table 1 measures the extent of depositor losses during the period 1921-1942.

During the pre-Depression era, losses to depositors in failed banks during the pre-

Depression era averaged roughly 5%. In contrast, losses suffered by depositors during the

Depression were several times larger. Since the 1860s (the period for which data are

available), the ratio of negative net worth of banks relative to GDP never exceeded one

tenth of one percent of GDP (which it reached in 1893). The combination of the high

failure rate and high depositor loss rate during the Depression produced a loss rate on

total deposits in excess of 2% in 1933, and a loss rate relative to GDP of roughly 3% for
                                                                                                 10


the period 1929-1933 (measured as the ratio of total depositor losses relative to average

GDP, for the period 1930-1933).



The Role of Market Discipline in Limiting Bank Distress

        Although these losses were large relative to previous U.S. experience, as we

noted above, they are quite small relative to the experiences of many countries today,

including many cases of countries experiencing much milder shocks than the economic

collapse of the Great Depression. The low loss rates of historical banking systems,

including that of the United States in the 1930s, reflected the presence of market

discipline. Calomiris and Wilson (2003) show that depositors of banks (and to a lesser

extent, their minority stockholders) required banks to hold capital commensurate with

their portfolio risk, effectively requiring banks to target low levels of default risk. Banks

that suffered losses on their investments were required to find ways to either curtail their

asset risk (cut credit) or increase capital (cut dividends) to restore their prior low risk of

default. Those that failed to do so suffered deposit withdrawals, as funds flowed to lower

risk banks and postal savings. When losses on investments were sufficiently sudden or

large, banks that failed to restore market confidence were forced to close.

        The existence of deposit market discipline does not imply that all or even most

depositors were capable of judging bank balance sheet condition. Rather, as Calomiris

and Kahn (1991) suggest, discipline was concentrated in the hands of a few depositors

(often large depositors or interbank depositors) who had the wherewithal and the

incentive to monitor bank condition and react to deterioration in that condition. Passive

depositors could, of course, magnify the effects of withdrawals from monitoring
                                                                                           11


depositors by reacting with a lag to monitors’ withdrawals or other publicly available

signals of bank weakness (e.g., stock price declines, or newspaper accounts of bank

condition, which were widely available).

        This process of market discipline is visible in a variety of facts about bank failure

and risk management. Table 2 reports the results of the “basic” bank survival model from

Calomiris and Mason (2003). The coefficients in Table 2 – derived from a model of bank

survival during the period 1930-1932 – show the effects of variation in bank or county

characteristics (which are observed periodically) on the predicted survival duration of

banks. As Table 2 shows, banks with lower net worth relative to assets, or with higher

portfolio risk tended to be less likely to survive, ceteris paribus. Portfolio risk is

measured here by bank size (smaller banks tend to be less diversified), and by asset

composition (riskier banks have higher proportions of non-cash assets, higher proportions

of risky “ineligible” loans, and higher holdings of dispossessed real estate). Other

variables related to the location of the bank (including county unemployment or reliance

on crop income) are also important determinants of bank distress.

        Interestingly, Table 2 shows that liability mix is also important for predicting

bank survival, a result that echoes similar findings from many other studies of U.S. bank

failures in the 1920s and 1930s (Calomiris and Mason 1997). Calomiris and Mason

(2003) interpret the predictive power of liability mix as reflecting the fact that banks that

relied heavily on interbank deposits and bills payable for their funding had been rationed

from the consumer deposit market because of their higher than average probability of

default.
                                                                                           12


       Calomiris and Wilson (2003) model the “capital crunch” phenomenon – the

tendency of falling bank capital (due to loan losses) to produce declines in subsequent

bank loan supply – and connect that phenomenon to market discipline by depositors.

They argue that a bank credit crunch requires two key assumptions: “risk-intolerant”

deposits and adverse-selection costs of raising new equity, both of which are the natural

result of bank specialization in creating private information about borrowers. Depositor

risk intolerance (a form of credit rationing in which depositors withdraw funds in

reaction to increased default risk) depends on asymmetric information about the quality

of the bank loan portfolio. Asymmetric information can motivate deposit rationing for

two reasons: agency costs, as in Calomiris and Kahn 1991, or depositors’ preferences for

claims that are easily accepted in secondary markets, as in Gorton and Pennacchi 1990.

Adverse-selection costs of raising equity are also a necessary ingredient to any market-

driven capital crunch; without adverse-selection costs of raising equity, banks would

typically prefer to respond to capital losses with new stock issues rather than with

shrinking credit supply.

       Tables 3-5 provide more direct evidence on the relationships among bank capital,

loan losses, depositor discipline, and credit contraction from Calomiris and Wilson

(2003) using a sample of publicly traded New York City banks for the period 1920-1940.

As Table 3 shows, during the 1920s, as lending opportunities expanded and the economy

remained relatively healthy, bank asset risk expanded alongside the market capital ratio.

The growth in asset risk and capital ratios reflected substantial increases in banks’ loan-

to-asset ratios, and frequent bank stock offerings. With the exception of the post-

recession year (1922), banks maintained constant and very low default risk during the
                                                                                             13


1920s, as measured by implied default premia on bank debt (derived from equity returns

and balance sheet data, using the Black-Scholes model). In the wake of the loan losses of

1929-1933, bank default risk rose substantially. In order to reestablish low default risk in

the face of declining capital, banks cut loans and accumulated cash to keep asset risk

from rising. They also cut dividends to mitigate the decline in their capital ratios. As

Table 3 shows, even as late as 1936 banks had not fully returned to their pre-1929 level

of default risk. The recession of 1937-1938 again produced loan losses and further

encouraged cuts in lending and dividends.

       Table 4 reports the findings from an annual panel regression that examines the

role of deposit rationing in encouraging banks to adopt this strategy. The dependent

variable is individual bank deposit growth. Table 4 shows that banks with high default

premia lost more deposits than other banks. Table 5 in an annual panel regression shows

how banks cut dividends in response to capital scarcity. Banks with higher default risk

tended to cut dividends more. Banks with higher bid-ask spreads (where the bid-ask

spread is expressed as a percentage of stock value) also tended to cut dividends by more.

Calomiris and Wilson (2003) use the bid-ask spread as a proxy for high adverse-selection

costs of raising capital. They interpret the negative coefficient on the bid-ask spread in

Table 5 as indicating a precautionary demand for preserving capital by banks that knew

they faced high costs of raising capital if they were forced to do so.

       The evidence in Tables 2-5 indicates that during the Great Depression U.S. banks

were subject to market discipline, which required them to respond to loan losses with

reduced lending and dividends. Market discipline was able to operate on banks in the

1930s because government assistance to banks was limited, and thus insolvent banks
                                                                                              14


were not protected from market discipline by the various forms of government assistance

that banks received. Assistance during the 1930s included loans from the Fed, loans and

preferred stock purchases from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC), and

federal deposit insurance on small deposits. Deposit insurance was limited to small

deposits (see Calomiris and White 1994), and banks that were insolvent in 1933 were not

permitted to qualify for deposit insurance in 1934. And, as we will discuss in detail

below, loans and preferred stock were supplied in a way that limited the potential abuse

of such assistance.

        In today’s world of expanded safety nets and generous bailouts – as, for example,

in Japan – credit crunches can (and should) still occur, but typically depend on

regulatory, rather than market, discipline to link bank losses to contractions in risk. The

creation of a bank safety net makes it necessary to impose risk-based capital regulation to

protect against abuse of government protection. Risk-based capital regulation seeks to

mimic market discipline by measuring asset risk (e.g., loan default risk and interest rate

risk) and linking capital requirements to the level of bank risk.

       Although this approach is generally not fully effective, and has been the subject

of much critical examination (Calomiris 1997, Shadow Financial Regulatory Committee

2000, Barth, Caprio and Levine 2001), it can serve to limit at least some means of bank

risk taking. For example, Baer and McElravey (1993) examined U.S. bank asset growth

in the 1980s (under the new regime of capital regulation and enforcement that was

enacted following the loan losses of the post-1986 period). They and others have found

that bank asset growth was closely related to the adequacy of regulatory capital. Banks

with low capital tended to grow the slowest.
                                                                                           15


       Asset or loan growth, however, do not measure overall bank risk. Others have

found substantial evidence that true default risk may be high even when banks reduce

their loans to comply with risk-based capital standards. Thus, unlike market discipline

(which evaluates the overall riskiness of the bank), regulatory discipline based on rules of

thumb that measure bank risk will tend to invite “risk arbitrage” by regulated banks (the

search for asset positions whose risks are underestimated by regulatory capital standards).

We return to this problem in our discussion of Japan in Section III below, and in Section

IV’s discussion of policy options.



The Cumulative Effects of Banking Distress on Illiquid Asset Markets

       Although market discipline was present in the 1930s, and insolvent banks were

allowed to fail, the removal of bank assets from bankers’ control did not imply the

speedy resolution of borrowers’ distress. Non-performing loans of insolvent banks were

not liquidated quickly during the Depression. As in many Asian countries today, as the

stock of failed banks’ loans accumulated, the speed of loan resolution slowed. This loan

resolution backlog effect is analyzed by Anari, Kolari, and Mason (2002). They find that

this measure of financial sector distress is a better forecaster of economic activity, and a

better explanatory variable for the persistence of output decline during the Depression,

than previously used measures of financial sector distress.

       Figure 5 plots the cumulative “stock” of outstanding (unpaid) deposits in failed

national banks over time, their measure of the stock of unresolved bank assets. The

authors estimate this quantity using data on the speed of liquidations by receivers and

conservators of failed banks. Uninsured depositors were paid on a pro rata basis as the
                                                                                               16


asset liquidation of their failed bank proceeded. The average liquidation time for national

banks ran a little more than six years.

         Anari, Kolari, and Mason cite numerous qualitative sources that saw the slow

pace of asset liquidation as a source of depositor illiquidity and reduced consumption.

Mason (2002) suggests that low liquidation speed was the result of concerns about the

real option forgone by selling into a liquidity-depressed market. Observers saw the

backlog of unsold assets as depressing investment; the vast supply of property put up for

sale depressed property values – which contributed to the unprecedented losses suffered

by depositors – and produced a form of gridlock in local markets. Buyers lacked liquidity

and sellers trying to realize the full value of assets were reluctant to sell at prices that

were perceived as containing a hefty illiquidity discount.

         The important implication of this research is that system-wide bank failures pose

special costs to society, not just because of the loss of lending capacity by banks that

have lost capital, but additionally, because of the effects of bank asset liquidation on

consumer liquidity and the accentuated liquidity premium in property markets. It follows

that an additional benefit of assistance to banks, and counter-cyclical macroeconomic

policy, during a Depression is their positive effect on the liquidity of bank assets and

liabilities.



The Policy Response to Financial Sector Distress During the Depression

         To understand the way central bankers and government officials responded to the

Depression one must be familiar with the histories of previous business cycles, which had

produced certain policy rules, and with the ways in which the shocks of the 1930s
                                                                                           17


differed from those of earlier business cycles. Of central relevance was the fact that, prior

to the interwar period, the price process under the classical gold standard tended to be

mean-reverting. As Eichengreen (1992) and Temin (1989) have noted, the establishment

of the interwar gold exchange standard suffered from a long-run deflationary bias which

was aggravated by the failure of coordination among central banks in response to shocks

to global liquidity.

        As more and more countries began to return to gold in the mid-1920s, and as

income growth further increased the demand for gold, international imbalances produced

contractionary monetary policy in some countries (in keeping with the so-called “rules of

the game” for central banks under the gold standard), but that contraction was not offset

by appropriate expansion in other countries. World War I had undermined the ability of

the major countries to coordinate policy in response to this global deflationary shock.

Instead of working together to expand the global supply of money, central banks

scrambled for gold and shrank the world money supply, thus driving the price level down

and producing a global debt deflation.

        The Fed was a relatively new institution as of 1929. It developed an approach to

counter-cyclical monetary policy during the 1920s that reacted to interest rates, free

reserves, and gold flows. Those policy reaction rules of thumb worked reasonably well in

the 1920s, but aggravated the contraction in monetary policy in the 1930s (Wheelock

1991, Calomiris and Wheelock 1998). In that deflationary environment, contrary to the

Fed’s interpretation, low nominal interest rates and high reserve holdings did not imply

loose monetary conditions.
                                                                                             18


       The Fed’s role as a lender of last resort was ill-defined. The Federal Reserve Act

contemplated the role of the Fed as primarily influencing the seasonal availability of

reserves, not giving assistance to improve individual banks’ chances of survival, and

certainly not bailing out insolvent banks. And because the previous macroeconomic

environment had never witnessed the like of the monetary policy-induced collapse of the

1930s, the American experience with banking crises had never provided any motive for

interventionist policies to prop up banks. Banking panics in 1857, 1873, 1884, 1890,

1893, 1896, and 1907 were short-lived moments of confusion about the incidence of loss,

and resulted in few bank failures (Calomiris and Gorton 1991). They were very mild

affairs compared to the bank failure waves of the 1930s. Moreover, bank failures in

agricultural areas and nationwide bank panics were understood to be closely linked to the

fragmented unit banking system; rapid bank industry consolidation during the 1920s

seemed to point toward a more stable future.

       The bank failures of the 1920s were severe in some agricultural areas, but were

directly linked to the post-World War I collapse of prices. That, along with the fact that

agricultural states that had enacted deposit insurance in the 1910s and 1920s experienced

the worst bank failure waves in the 1920s, led policy makers to view efforts to prop up

banks as counter-productive. Deposit insurance had been a disastrous policy when tried

at the state level, and the experience was fresh in the minds of policy makers in the late

1920s. The eight state deposit insurance systems lay in ruins at that time, and were

clearly and properly understood by observers (including President Roosevelt, who

opposed deposit insurance) as examples of what happens to banking systems that relax

the discipline of the marketplace (Calomiris 1989, 1990, Calomiris and White 1994).
                                                                                             19


       The banking collapse of the 1930s, however, was simply too severe and too

widespread to be ignored, and politicians found in the severity of banking collapse new

opportunities. For Henry Steagall, the Depression offered the chance to pass a long-

dormant proposal for federal deposit insurance (which had been understood for fifty

years to be special interest legislation for small agricultural banks). For Carter Glass, the

Depression provided the opportunity to push through his decades-long quest to separate

commercial banks from capital markets by fostering the now discredited view that the

mixing of commercial and investment banking had caused banks to collapse during the

Depression (White 1986, Calomiris and White 1994).

       Political opportunism was not the only reason for intervention in the landmark

Banking Act of 1933. Banks were collapsing as never before, and even surviving banks

were slashing credit. President Hoover’s initial reaction to bank collapse in 1930-1932

was understandably reluctant and cautious about federal assistance to distressed banks.

By January 1933, however, the financial system was in free fall. February and March saw

most states declaring banking holidays to avoid the runs that were bringing so many

banks down so quickly. The Fed, and the RFC, both of which had been making

collateralized loans to banks, were criticized for failing to provide adequate assistance.

       And so, in March 1933, there was a sudden shift: a national bank holiday was

enacted, federal deposit insurance (for small deposit accounts) was passed, and the RFC

was authorized to purchase preferred stock in banks and other enterprises. Suspended

banks would be examined; those that were solvent would be permitted to reopen and join

the FDIC. Some would be nudged to solvency by the RFC, if necessary. Deeply insolvent

banks would be shut down. Perhaps even more importantly, President Roosevelt took the
                                                                                          20


country off of the gold standard. Deflation, and deflationary expectations, came to a halt.

Industrial production immediately began to recover. That same pattern of immediate

recovery was enjoyed by other countries that abandoned the gold standard in 1931, as

Eichengreen and Sachs (1985) show.



The Operation of the RFC

       Initially (from its founding in February 1932 until July 21, 1932) the RFC

operated under the same conservative lending rules as the Fed. After the ouster of its

Chairman (who also served as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board) in July, RFC

collateral standards were relaxed. Lending to banks and other firms grew thereafter.

Beginning in March 1933, the RFC’s preferred stock purchase program dominated its

assistance to banks, as shown in Table 6, and Figures 6 and 7.

       Part of the shift to preferred stock reflected the widespread view that secured

loans did not stabilize weak banks (James 1938, p. 1044). Secured loans represented a

senior claim on bank assets relative to deposits, and thus effectively worsened the default

risk faced by junior depositors. Olson (1977, p. 154) writes that: “High collateral

requirements forced [banks] to isolate their most liquid assets as security for RFC loans.

In April 1932, for example, the Reconstruction Finance Corporation loaned the Reno

National Bank over $1,100,000, but in the process took as collateral over $3,000,000 of

the bank’s best securities. This in itself left the bank unable to meet any future emergency

demands for funds by depositors.” In Olson’s (1972, p. 177) view, loans from “…the

RFC helped only those basically sound enterprises which needed temporary liquidity.” It
                                                                                           21


was not a means of reducing default risk for a capital-impaired bank; thus, it provided

little relief to banks from default risk-intolerant market discipline.

       Preferred stock, in contrast, was junior to bank deposits, and was not secured by

high-quality bank assets. Thus, it offered a means of lowering deposit default risk and

thus insulating risky banks from the threat of deposit withdrawal. By March 1934 the

RFC had purchased preferred stock in nearly half the commercial banks in the United

States. By June 1935, these RFC investments made up more than one third of the

outstanding capital of the banking system (Olson 1988, p. 82).

       Mason (1996, 2001a) examines the relative effectiveness of loans and preferred

stock purchases by the RFC, after controlling for differences in the characteristics of

banks receiving both kinds of assistance. As Table 7 and Figure 8 show, using a model of

bank failure risk to compute exogenous probabilities of default, Mason found little

difference in the exogenous default risk of banks receiving loans vs. those receiving

preferred stock assistance. Table 8 examines the effects of the two types of assistance on

the probability of bank failure, after controlling for differences in exogenous

characteristics using a Heckman correction. According to these results, receiving a loan

from the RFC actually raised the probability of bank failure, while receiving preferred

stock assistance reduced the probability of failure.

       Although this evidence indicates that preferred stock purchases were effective in

insulating banks from deposit withdrawal, it is important to emphasize that the RFC

preferred stock program was successful because it was neither too conservative nor too

liberal with its assistance. The RFC would have made little difference if it had only

targeted the lowest risk banks for its subsidies. As Figure 8 and Table 7 show, that was
                                                                                              22


not the case. At the same time, the RFC did not provide assistance to deeply insolvent

banks, nor would its assistance have been a sufficient subsidy to bail out such banks.

Moreover, the conditions attached to RFC preferred stock purchases served to limit bank

risk transference to the RFC, which ensured that preferred stock issuers had incentives to

limit risk. Thus capital-impaired (but not deeply insolvent) banks were offered protection

from market discipline essentially on condition that they did not abuse such protection by

transferring too much risk to the government.

         How did RFC conditionality ensure this “happy medium” of controlled risk?

First, it offered limited subsidies to banks, and avoided trying to save “basket cases” (see

RFC Circular #1, 1932). The RFC required banks to submit their regulatory examinations

for RFC inspection, and banks that were judged as hopelessly insolvent were rejected.

Further evidence of the selective nature of assistance is provided in Table 9, which shows

that dividend rates on RFC preferred stock were typically less than one percent below

those earned in the marketplace, and were above market rates on short-term business

loans.

         In part, the limited subsidy offered by the RFC reflected its independent corporate

status. The RFC was a separately capitalized institution – essentially, a government-

sponsored enterprise, not a budget line for the executive branch. Table 10 reviews the

financing structure of the RFC from its inception through the end of 1937. Its financial

independence led its chief executive, Jesse Jones, to see a need to make the RFC

profitable on a cash flow basis, and he proudly proclaimed that it never saw a year of

negative profit under his direction. That constraint, obviously, also limited the potential

size of the subsidy the RFC could offer. For this very limited subsidy to have made a
                                                                                             23


difference for bank failure risk (as Table 8 shows it did), recipients could not have been

deeply insolvent.

       Second, many restrictions on recipients of RFC assistance ensured that banks

would not take advantage of RFC aid by increasing their default risk. The RFC was

intended to protect banks from a dramatic decline in their capital, but not to encourage

capital-impaired banks from imprudently expanding their portfolio risk. Indeed, the RFC

went to great pains to impose conditions that substituted for depositor discipline on bank

risk taking.

       Those conditions included seniority of RFC dividends to all other stock dividends

and voting rights that effectively gave the RFC the ability to direct institutions toward

solvency and profitability and limit excessive risk. In many instances, the RFC used its

control rights to replace bank officers and significantly alter business practices (Upham

and Lamke 1934, p. 234, Cho 1953, pp. 29-34, Commercial and Financial Chronicle

1933, pp. 1625-6.).

       The RFC preserved its seniority of claim on bank earnings by limiting common

stock dividend payments. Common stock dividends were strictly limited to a specified

maximum and remaining earnings were devoted to a preferred stock retirement fund.

Some firms avoided applying for RFC preferred stock purchases out of reluctance to

submit themselves to RFC authority.

       Finally, although there were numerous attempts by politicians to influence RFC

decisions, Mason (2001b) suggests that the budgetary structure of the RFC and its

decentralized process of decision making insulated the RFC from political manipulation.

Field offices were given a large degree of autonomy over valuation of collateral and other
                                                                                            24


judgmental decisions, but were held accountable to the central office for having made

errors that impacted RFC earnings (Delaney 1954, pp. 47-8). Mason (1996) shows that

objective characteristics of recipients, including their financial condition, their economic

importance within their regions, and other reasonable economic criteria influenced the

RFC’s choice of recipients; purely political variables (e.g., locations connected to

prominent politicians) did not add explanatory power to models explaining the allocation

of RFC assistance.

        As Figure 9 and Table 11 show, bank dividends fell dramatically from 1929 to

1934. To what extent was this decline in dividends, and other measures to limit bank

default risk, the result of RFC conditionality? Tables 12 and 13 examine the extent to

which the conditions attached to RFC assistance made a difference for the risk choices of

recipient banks. Table 12 divides banks into those that received RFC preferred stock

assistance between March 1933 and December 1934 and those that did not. Most of this

assistance was provided in late 1933. Table 12 compares mean bank characteristics of

recipients and non-recipients prior to, and subsequent to, preferred stock purchases.

Clearly, preferred stock recipients (with average failure probabilities of 0.056) were

much more at risk of failure as of 1933 than non-recipients (with average failure

probabilities of 0.021). Recipients’ probabilities of failure fell faster than non-recipients

from 1933 to 1934, and that relative decline in risk reflected much greater reductions in

dividend payout, much greater contraction of total assets in 1934, and less of a decline in

capital-to-asset ratios.

        Table 13 examines the role of preferred stock conditionality on bank choice of

capital ratios and dividend payout more formally. Table 13A is a first-stage regression
                                                                                             25


predicting preferred stock assistance. Table 13B is the second-stage regression analyzing

the effect of preferred stock assistance on banks’ choices of dividends and capital ratios

(using a Heckman correction to control for the endogeneity of the preferred stock

assistance). The last two columns of Table 13B show that receiving preferred stock

assistance significantly increases banks’ capital ratios and reduces their dividend payout.

These results confirm that banks that received preferred stock assistance were effectively

constrained in the extent to which their stockholders could transfer risk to the RFC.

       RFC preferred stock assistance was a way to help banks smooth the adjustment

process toward low default risk. It insulated banks from the threat of sudden deposit

withdrawal by reducing deposit default risk, but substituted RFC discipline for market

discipline to ensure that banks adopted prudent long-run risk management and capital

accumulation policies.



III. Recent Japanese Experience

       The Japanese banking collapse of the 1990s occurred in a very different

institutional context from that of the U.S. banking collapse of the Great Depression. The

existence of implicit deposit insurance protection (which was made explicit in the 1990s)

meant that Japanese bank depositors were little concerned about the potential loss of

deposits placed in Japanese banks, and therefore, had scant incentive to exercise

discipline on banks.

       Additionally, Japanese banks have much closer relationships with affiliated firms

than American banks have had traditionally, and Japanese banks own substantial equity

positions in those firms. That complicates the valuation of Japanese bank loan holdings,
                                                                                             26


since banks may have special obligations or incentives to absorb loan losses in ways that

are not transparent from an examination of balance sheet data. For example, Sheard

(1989) argues that main banks provide implicit insurance to other creditors that

participate in loans to their client firms. And there have been some recent claims that

equity investments in Japanese banks by client firms may represent “fictitious capital” in

the sense that bank borrowers may be encouraged to buy capital in exchange for

continuing credit access (which amounts to banks lending money for the purpose of

financing the purchase of bank stock).

       Furthermore, reflecting the absence of market pressures on banks to provide

informative signals to private debtholders, Japanese accounting practices today are quite

different from American banks’ accounting practices in the 1930s, and much less

informative of actual bank condition. For all these reasons, the value of Japanese bank

investments (loans, stocks, and other assets) reported on balance sheets provides a poorer

indication of true value than do American bank accounts of the 1930s.

       Indeed, the broad range of recent estimates of the amount of bad Japanese bank

loans and the likely recovery rates on those loans illustrate how difficult it is to glean

reality from reported statistics. As of the end of May 2001, the official estimate of

outstanding financial sector non-performing loans was Y34,000bn, but Goldman Sachs

calculates that in the “worst-case scenario” non-performing loans could be as high as

Y63,000. Bank insolvency and the extent of negative bank net worth in the U.S. during

the 1930s were relatively easy to observe because market discipline forced insolvent

banks to fail. In Japan, however, “zombie” banks (to use the expression coined by Ed

Kane) can continue almost indefinitely, and it is very hard to measure their insolvency.
                                                                                           27


       Another important difference between the U.S. Depression experience and the

current Japanese context is the duration of bank distress, the seemingly endless waves of

increasing bank loan losses that plague Japanese banks. By most accounts, Japanese

banks have been inadequately capitalized for a decade, and many have been insolvent for

more than five years.

       Japanese bank loan write downs totaled Y10 trillion a year in both 1997 and

1998, when Japanese banks began to write down loan losses in earnest. In 1999, two of

the most informed authorities on Japanese bank accounts and solvency, Takeo Hoshi and

Hugh Patrick (2000, p. 20), thought that Japanese banks had turned a corner: “Late 1998

and early 1999 was a significant turning point. The ‘crisis’ in the banking system is

finally over, though most banks still have substantial restructuring problems. Japan is

now in the process of building a new financial system.” Yet loan write downs in 1999

and 2000 were roughly Y4.5 trillion in each year. And despite these formidable write

downs, Japanese bank losses have continued to grow, as new non-performing loans

replace those that were previously written down.

       This continuing growth in non-performing loans reflects new deterioration in

asset values and deflationary monetary policy, as well as previously unrecognized earlier

losses. After a decade of flat growth and shrinking asset prices, Japan is now seen by

many observers as poised at the precipice of economic collapse. Japan, like the U.S. in

the early 1930s, has been caught in a deflationary trap, albeit a much longer-lived one.

Deflation weakens firms’ and banks’ balance sheets, producing further weakening of

aggregate demand, and further deflation (Irving Fisher’s debt-deflation cycle).
                                                                                          28


       The combination of government protection and a deflationary environment also

affects bank strategies toward loan liquidation. In the current environment, the backlog of

unresolved loans and weak corporate and bank balance sheets have created a massive

liquidity premium in asset pricing. Ten-year bonds yield 1.2% while stock prices and real

estate prices continue to slip. Banks, particularly in a regime of government deposit

insurance, have little incentive to hurry to liquidate the assets of their distressed

borrowers, especially since banks are shareholders in many of these firms. Making

matters worse is the historical absence of bankruptcy or liquidation procedures, which

makes orderly liquidation even more challenging. Thus the backlog continues alongside

continuing deflation and deepening loan losses.

       Banks have received substantial assistance from the government. In addition to

anemic early programs to purchase bad loans from banks – an initiative that has so far not

produced much incentive for rational disposal of bad loans (see Packer 2000) – the

government has offered financial assistance to banks twice, in March 1998 and March

1999. Table 14 summarizes the amounts and types of assistance, and the terms and

conditions of that assistance. Like the RFC, the Japanese government began to offer

assistance primarily in the form of loans and debt purchases, and subsequently came to

rely almost exclusively on preferred stock purchases.

       The new Prime Minister, Mr. Koizumi, promises painful structural reform of

government expenditure policy, and talks of the need to accelerate bank loan write

downs, which he says are the keys to rebuilding the Japanese economy. Some speculate

that more preferred stock assistance will be forthcoming to help spur debt write downs.

But nowhere in sight (given the current Bank of Japan leadership) is there a credible
                                                                                           29


commitment to ending deflationary monetary policy. Without that change, bank balance

sheets will continue to deteriorate and banks will continue to postpone liquidation in the

hope that they can profit from future improvements in macroeconomic circumstances (the

“real option” incentive problem described in Mason 2002).



Regulatory Discipline a Substitute for Market Discipline?

       Figures 10-11 provide a picture of bank capital and lending behavior that differs

greatly from the patterns shown in Figures 3 and 4. The differences between Japanese

lending behavior and that of the 1930s is even greater when one takes into account the

understatement of Japanese capital losses during the early and mid-1990s. Japanese bank

lending ratios grew substantially from 1995-1997 as Japanese bank capital ratios

plummeted. The mid-1990s saw substantial increases in Japanese lending elsewhere in

Asia, which some observers have characterized as a search for ways to increase loan risk

in order to take full advantage of the implicit put option value of government protection.

After 1997, bank losses were too large and too visible to continue the masquerade of

denial, and international and domestic pressures came to bear on the Japanese

government to recognize loan losses and to restrict bank lending accordingly.

       Figure 12 tells a somewhat similar story through the window of the bank market-

to-book value of equity ratio, weighted by bank asset size. The expansion of asset risk in

1996 boosted the value of bank capital (which incorporates the value of the implicit put

option). Since 1997, the combination of loan losses and restrictions on bank lending have

caused the ratio of the market-to-book value of equity to plummet.
                                                                                             30


       That is not to say that banks have been effectively constrained by regulators in

their pursuit of increased asset risk. In his forthcoming Columbia Business School

dissertation, Nobu Hibara (2001) finds that regulatory capital standards have effectively

linked bank loans to the total amount of book capital. Nevertheless, banks in the weakest

condition (for whom the put option of government protection is most valuable) gravitate

toward the lowest quality loans, and boost asset risk by increasing the riskiness of their

loan portfolio (Cargill, Hutchison, and Ito 1998).

       To what extent has government assistance in March 1998 and March 1999 been

targeted to banks with the best franchises, and to what extent has it been linked to

effective conditionality that limits banks’ ability to transfer risk to the government? The

evidence in Table 14 indicates that the Japanese government did not try to target

assistance selectively. Virtually every bank of any significant size received preferred

stock assistance. If anything, it appears that the weakest Japanese banks (Nippon Credit

and LTCB) were the earliest (1998) recipients of preferred stock purchases. Due to the

small sample of banks and the uncertain quality of the balance sheet data, we were not

able to perform a satisfactory analysis of the differences in condition between banks that

received preferred stock assistance and those that did not.

       Figure 13 plots dividend payments by banks from 1993 to 2001. Interestingly,

dividend payments fell dramatically in 1999, but then more than rebounded. Thus, as

Japanese banks continued to experience rising loan losses and declines in capital, they

kept sending much of the cash inflow that they received from the government in 1998

and 1999 to their shareholders. Clearly, this is at odds with the purpose of a preferred

stock purchase program.

IV. Policy Implications

       The essential point of our comparison of U.S. banks in the 1930s and Japanese

banks in the 1990s is that, in the historical case, assistance to banks occurred within a

context of market discipline, and the conditions attached to government assistance helped

to strengthen market discipline. In the current Japanese case, in contrast, assistance was

offered within the context of an absence of market discipline, and there is little evidence

that conditions attached to assistance have encouraged banks to move toward effective

long-run risk management. In part that failure reflects the relative extremity of Japanese

bank distress, and in part, the lack of incentives of Japanese banks to limit the

transference of risk to the government.

       Is it possible, in the current protected environment, for government to find a way

of providing a credible combination of financial assistance to banks and conditionality

that limits the abuse of that assistance? We think it is possible to apply the lessons of the

RFC to contemporary assistance programs.

       Doing so requires the adoption of three related and mutually reinforcing means of

limiting bank abuse of protection: (1) designing programs of assistance that are selective,

and thus able to target financial assistance to banks that are worth preserving, (2)

specifying clear quantifiable rules that limit access to preferred stock assistance, and tie

assistance to effective risk management by recipient banks, and (3) enacting new ongoing

capital regulation that establishes meaningful standards for risk-based capital.

       With respect to selectivity, Calomiris (1998, 1999) suggests using a common

stock issuance matching requirement to encourage the best banks to “self-select” to
                                                                                           32


participate in subsidized preferred stock purchases. That approach would attract capital-

impaired but relatively healthy banks with high franchise values, but discourage deeply

insolvent banks from applying for government subsidies. Those banks’ stockholders

would be unable to qualify for subsidized preferred stock purchases because they would

be unable to find willing purchasers of new matching common stock offerings. The

beauty of this self-selection mechanism is that it brings market judgements to bear on the

allocation of scarce government funds. It does not require the government to pick and

choose; the same preferred stock purchase program would be available to all banks, but

not all would be able to participate.

       Limits on common stock dividend payments, among other conditions attached to

preferred stock purchases, are an obvious way to encourage banks to use the new lease on

life granted by government protection to rebuild their capital, rather than to engage in

strategies that maximize the option value of deposit insurance.

       Emergency assistance to banks should be linked to a phasing in of credible capital

regulation. Effective risk-based capital regulation would protect taxpayers’ investments

in bank preferred stock and limit taxpayer liability for insured deposits in rescued banks.

It would also restore effective discipline on bank risk management in the future by

eliminating incentives for risk arbitrage.

       Effective capital regulation must provide a credible and flexible means to measure

the riskiness of bank positions and the adequacy of bank capital. Thus, bank capital

regulation must focus on ways to incorporate market signals about underlying bank risk

into the regulatory process. Calomiris (1997, 1999) and Shadow Financial Regulatory

Committee (2000) have argued that a subordinated debt requirement (which can be
                                                                                             33


structured to take account of the particular types of debt instruments that are available in

each country) is an essential part of an effective capital requirement (see also Calomiris

and Powell 2000). A minimum ratio of subordinated debt relative to bank assets would

ensure that, on the margin, someone bears the default risk of bank debt. That would make

banks care about limiting their default risk in order to maintain the requisite outstanding

issues of subordinated debt. Furthermore, the observed market yield on subordinated debt

would be of great value to regulators for measuring and enforcing capital adequacy

standards. A visible public signal of bank health would provide supervisors with new

information. Even more important, by making bank weakness publicly observable, it

would promote greater accountability of supervisors and regulators and undermine the

destructive phenomenon of regulatory “forbearance.”

       Of course, effective bank regulatory policy by itself cannot make a healthy

banking system (see Cargill, Hutchison, and Ito 1997). Stable monetary and fiscal policy

are necessary preconditions for healthy banks. In some countries, a lack of fiscal

discipline makes banks prey to attacks on currency pegs. In other cases, including the

United States in the early 1930s and Japan today, banking system recovery is dependent

on bringing deflationary monetary policy to an end.

Notes: P is the (end-of-year) deposit default premium, derived from the Black Scholes model, using
stock returns and balance sheet data over the last six months of the year. Nat. Bank and Trust Co. are
indicator variables for national banks and state trust companies. In the two-stage-least squares (2SLS)
regressions, P is treated as an endogenous variable, and the list of instruments includes lagged values of
the following variables: the market capital-to-asset ratio, the implied standard deviation of returns to
assets, and growth in industrial production.

Table 8: Accelerated Failure Time Models with RFC Loans and
Preferred Stock Purchases

The model measures the determinants of log survival time, measured in days, from
December, 31, 1931 to December 31, 1935. Both survival models use a Weibull
parameterization. Bank financial data are from Federal Reserve Reports of Condition
and Income . RFC loan and preferred stock data are from monthly Reports of Activity
of the RFC . The RFC variable in the first column pertains to loans, while that in the
second column pertains to preferred stock purchases. Standard errors are in
parentheses.
