                    Open Economy Macroeconomics:

                           New Directions




                              ABSTRACT



        The paper reviews the directions of research that offer
important insights into open economy macroeconomic policy: pricing,
waiting and expectations.
        The pricing discussion centers on the recognition that firms
are price setters. This implies that industry shocks such as exchange
rate movements or changes in commercial policy have effects on output
and prices different from the standard model of a small country under
perfect competition. Industrial organization considerations including
market structure and product differentiation determine the impact of
shocks on output and prices.
        xtensions of work on irreversible investment, drawing on the
option literature, shows the value of waiting. In open economy
macroeconomics this theory can be applied not only to questions of
employment but also to such topics as the return of capital flight.
        The expectations literature is being extended to more
ambitious stochastic models of policy. If agents extrapolate current
disturbances, say in money, and expect a cumulative deviation of money
from and initial path there will be large immediate effects of money
innovations on exchange rates. These new models extend the I1undell-
Fleming models by showing that even small changes in the growth rate
of money can bring about large changes, and volatility, in exchange
rates.

        In the 1960s Robert Mundell and Marcus Flemining worked out the formal

framework for open economy macroeconomics that would reign for more than a

quarter of a century. The Mundell—Flemming model, built on the assumption that

prices move slowly relative to exchange rates and that international mobility

is a central factor in the transmission of business cycles, continues

virtually unchallenged today. Of course, the models we user today have gone

further in separating shortrun and lorzgrun, in allowing a role for

expectations, and in taking into account the consequences of trade imbalances

for asset accumulation. Even the stock markets has now become part of the

wider model. But the conclusions remain close to the Mundell—Flemming model.

When we ask what is the impact of monetary expansion on the exchange rate and

the balance of trade the answer continues to be that increased money induces a

real depreciation and hence an improvement in the external balance. Where then

is the fruit of research in the past ten or fifteen years? These recent

advances,and even though they are only starting to show all their

implications, will significantly advance our understanding of open economy

macroeconomics.

        I want to highlight here three separate directions of research. The

first is models of imperfect competition with their implications for price
                                   2



adjustment to exchange rate or commercial policy disturbances. The second

direction of research is concerned with models of adjustment built around the

notion of irreversible investments and the value of waiting. The third

research program deals with apparently excessive movements in exchange rates

in response to disturbances. I will consider these in turn.



1. Pricing

        There are two models of open economy macroeconomics. One model assumes

a small country that faces given prices in world trade and adjusts, under

conditions of perfect com,petition to those prices. Depreciation raises prices

equi—proportionately and tariff liberalization reduces import prices by the

full amount of the tariff cut. The other niodel, which is used as the pricing

assumption Mundell-Flemming, has prices as a fixed markup over unit labor

costs. Wages are assumed fixed in nominal terms and so are accordingly prices.

In this model depreciation brings about an equi-proportionate gain in

competitiveness or loss in the terms of trade.

        The new direction of research considers explicitly an industrial

organization pricing approach as part of the macroeconomic model. Pricing

depends on market structure, market segmentation and in the domestic versus

foreign cost base of participating firms. This approach has obvious fruits in

two areas of application. Consider first exchange rate movements. When a

currency is depreciated, with wages fixed at home and abroad, foreign firms

experience a cost increase in home currency while home firms have no change in

their cost. Industry equilibrium is disturbed by the unfavorable cost shock
                                            3



experienced by foreign firms and industry price must change. The adjustment in

price will depend on a host of factors. An example will make this point. Using

a partial equilibrium approach to a particular industry, suppose that the

product is diversified and that the Salop—circle model describes well the

diversification. Assume that consumers are uniformly distributed along the

product circle (in terms of their tastes) and that there are four firms, two

domestic and two foreign. They alternate so that #1 and #3 are foreign while

#2 and #4- are domestic. Initially spatial competition has established a

symmetric location pattern where firms share the market equally, so that each

firm serves an equal number of customers to the left and right.

        We now explore the effects of a home depreciation, given fixed unit

labor costs in each country.2 Consider firm #1. The depreciation of say 10

percent raises foreign firms' costs in dollars and raises marginal cost

relative to the unchanged marginal revenue of competing the marginal customer

away from firm #2 or firm #3. The equilibrium relative price structure will

change as firm #1 raises its' price and firms #2 and #4 match the increase

partially. Figure 1 shows the reaction functions of the typical domestic (DD)

and foreign firms (RR). The equations are respectively:



(1)       p(p*+c/n+w)/2

and



(2)      p* =   (p   +   c/n   +   ew*)/2

where w and w are unit labor costs in the respective currencies, c is the

consumers' transport cost per unit distance away from the preferred product

and n is the total number of firms supplying the market. The price structure

is determined by the Nash equilibrium at point A. The level of prices is

higher, relative to unit labor costs, the lower the substitutability and the

smaller the number of firms.

        Home depreciation, by raising foreign suppliers' marginal cost in home

currency, shifts the foreign reaction function from RR to R'R'. The relative

price of foreign products increases at A' and the price charged by domestic

firms also increases. The elasticity of price with respect to the exchange

rate depends on the number of firms in the industry and on the

substitutability between alternative suppliers. The range of customers served

by foreign firms contracts as a result of their increased relative price, as

does their profitability. Home firms expand.

        The model can be made more realistic by inclusion of two further

considerations. The first is entry and exit. In the above discussion we

assumed implicitly that there are no fixed costs and that firms have a fixed

location in the product space. The second concerns capacity constraints. Each

of these will affect pricing strategies and hence the impact of exchange rate

movements on equilibrium prices.

        In the post—depreciation equilibrium the increased profitability of

firms whose cost base in the home market may bring about entry of new firms.

These entering firms will select a location that places them optimally between
                                   5



existing firms. The entrants cause industry price to decline relative to the

equilibrium at point A'. But they may also face high-cost foreign firms

altogether out of the market. Of course, the possibility of entry will

influence the pricing policy of existing firms and hence limit in the first

place the price response to depreciation.

        Capacity constraints also influence the response of pricing to

exchange rate shocks. Suppose that in the initial equilibrium at point A all

firms are almost capacity constrained. The move to A' with a reduction in the

relative price of domestic products is therefore not possible since it would

involve an expansion of sales by home firms. In the presence of capacity

constraints domestic firms price so as to maintain constant their volume of

sales. Thus they will fully match foreign firms' price increases. The large

price response in turn raises the issue of entry of new firms with a domestic

cost based or expansion of capacity by existing firms.

        These examples already show that there is a fruitful application of

industrial organization approaches to open economy price responses. These

ideas are important for the discussion of exchange rate effects and for the

international transmission of price disturbances. But they apply equally to

commercial policy questions. Suppose a small country liberalizes imports. We

would expect that with fixed costs in setting up distribution networks the

smaller the country the fewer the number of diversified products that can

profitably be marketed. But that has radical implications: even under free

trade we would not expect pricing at the world level. Except for the threat of

entry the size of the market creates an oligopoly structure. Changes in
                                    6


commercial policy such as tariff reduction are unlikely to be passed on fully.

In the competition on the circle model, for example, the elasticity of final

prices charged by foreign firms with respect to the tariff is less than 2/3

and that of home firms less than 1/3. Moreover, if there are few firms and

substitution is poor these elasticities fall off sharply. These conclusions

have immediate implications. Most important among these is the finding that

opening the economy to induce price discipline will work poorly in very small

countries and in industries where there are significant fixed costs and entry

costs.




2. Waiting

         Many investments have the property that the almost irreversible,

except via depreciation or at a significant loss. Pindyck (1986), following a

number of earlier authors, has explored the optimal timing of such

irreversible investments when the return on the investment project evolves

stochastically.

         Suppose, concretely that a firm faces a stochastic demand



(3)      p=x—aQ

where x denoters the state of demand which follows a Wiener process with drift

and has a standard deviation s. Pindyck derives for this case the investment

rule drawing on option pricing. The key idea is that the decision to invest

amounts to the exercise of an option. The option will be exercised only when
                                   7



the state of demand is sufficiently favorable. Even though a unit of installed

capital may already be profitable at a given level of demand it may be

profitable to postpone investment. The irreversibility of investment and the

possibility of adverse states of demand place a premium on waiting for

sufficiently favorable demand conditions. The optimal capital stock will

depend among other determinants on the state of demand, x, as well as on the

variability of demand,s.



(4)      K' = K'(x,s,. .)




The investment rule is to choose at any point the larger of K' and, K, the

actual capital stock in place. In Figure 2 we show the schedule K'(x,..)

upward sloping. At a given time there will be a realization of demand, Xo and

a given capital stock Ko. At a point like A the firm will not add to capacity.

But if demand improves to a level xi the firm would add to the capital stock

to reach point A'. Thus, small changes in demand, in the region below K'(x,..)

do not affect investment, while large increases in demand lead to investment.

The location of the schedule K'(x,..) will depend on the variability of

demand. Increased variability reduces the desired capital stock at each level

of demand.

        This option pricing approach to near—irreversible investments has many

applications in open economy macroeconomics. I will sketch here only two.

Consider first the issue of European unemployment. Unemployment is commonly

attributed to an excessively high real wage. It is argued that real wage

increases in the 1970s outpaced productivity growth and the adverse effects of

energy price increases. Hence unemployment is classical. The option pricing

approach to irreversible investments suggests an alternative interpretation.

We can think of labor as an almost irreversible investment. Attrition of the

labor force or severance pay are the only ways in which a firm can relinquish

labor.

         With a suitable reinterpretation of the Pindyck problem we can derive

as in Figure 3 the employment problem of the firm. The hiring and firing lines

are HH and FF. If demand falls sufficiently low, given the variability and

trend growth of demand relative to the rate of labor force attrition through

retirement the firm will fire workers. This defines the line FF which is the

maximum employment level the firm will sustain for a given low demand level.

The schedule HH shows the employment level to which a firm will move in

favorable demand states. The corridor in between defines the area where demand

changes do not influence employment. If the firm is initially at point A a

fall in demand below xi will lead the firm to fire workers and a rise demand

above X2 will lead to new hires. Smaller changes in demand have no effect.

         The location of these hiring and firing lines depend on all the

parameters that govern the evolution of demand, on labor force attrition and

on severance pay. For that reason the model can help explain how the shift in

the stochastic environment from the 60s to the 70s has led to the sharp

increase in unemployment. The stochastic environment has deteriorated since

trend growth of demand has declined while the variability of demand has

increased. Firms accordingly find that they have excessive labor and they

respond by shedding labor through attrition. In terms of Figure 3 the corridor

widens. The counterpart, of course, is an increase in youth unemployment and

longterm unemployment. The model also predicts that firms will not show a

significant response to small increase in demand.

        The same model can be used for any of a number of investment

decisions. Obvious candidates are investment responses to real exchange rate

changes. If real exchange rates move randomly, at what point do firms invest

do expand capacity nor scrapE capital? A different kind of question that can

be asked in Lhis setting is the issue of the return of flight capital. The

experience is that the return of flight capital tends to be very slow, except

when the threat of bankruptcy forces firms to repatriate funds. This issue

fits well into the spirit of the quas ireversible investment model. The risk

of returning capital too early is that conditions deteriorate again and that a

renewed outflow can only occur at       hign penalty cost. Hence the investment

climate must become "sufficiently' favorable so that the immediate payoff on

returning capital overshadows the prospect of a subsequent deterioration. But

that poses a policy problem because frontloading the benefits to a return of

flight capital may run counter to fiscal stabilization and a favorable

investment climate or it may involve a politically unacceptable income

redistribution.



3. Expecting

       The third direction of research which I find particularly fruitful

deals with expectations and their impact on portfolio choices and hence
                                   10



exchange rates. In Dornbusch (1976) I showed how once and for all changes in

the money stock, with sticky prices in goods markets perfect foresight in

asset markets, leads to an overshooting of exchange rates. Lyons (1987) has

rightly pointed out that the "once and for all" model is not very interesting

as a policy experiment. In a much richer model of a stochastic money supply

process and rational expectations he shows that innovations in money growth,

because they are extrapolated into cumulative increases in money, lead to

sizeable shortrun movements in exchange rates in response to even small

changes in money.

        This is a promising direction for modelling exchange rate responses,

putting the emphasis on the extrapolation of current events. A simple example

can explain what is involved. Suppose that innovations in money are serially

correlated and suppose that inflation only adjust gradually. A positive

innovation in money is extrapolated into a cumulative accumulation of money

relative to the trend growth. This implies that in the longrun the exchange

rate will have moved to as higher path as will the p[rice level. Because

inflation is not fully flexible in the shortrun the real money stock is seen

as growing and hence nominal interest rates will be declining for sometime

before inflation builds up to erode the growth in nominal balances. Ultimately

the system returns to the initial rate of inflation, money growth and

depreciation.

        Figure 4 shows the exchange rate path in response to this experiment.

Initially, up to time T0 the economy moves along the solid line. At T0 the

innovation occurs and is extrapolated. The public recognizes that

asymptotically the economy will converge to the higher exchange rate path

reflecting the cumulative increase in money relative to trend shown by the

dashed line. But there will be an immediate depreciation of the exchange rate

from A to A'. The overshooting reflects the fact that forward looking asset

holders anticipate the cumulative depreciation and will only hold domestic

assets, in the face of reduced interest rates, if the exchange rate is

appreciating. Along the new exchange rate path the rate of appreciation,

following the initial jump, will accelerate for some time as nominal interest

rates initially decline. The basic point of the Lyons analysis is that the

forward looking expectations about the evolution of money, extrapolating the

serial correlation of disturbances, must find their way immediately into the

spot exchange rate. The analysis has obvious extensions to fiscal policy and

other determinants of the exchange rate.



4. Concluding Remarks

        The common trend of the three developments I have reviewed is to take

open economy macroeconomics away from a simple and mechanistic model. These

new ideas do not change the qualitative direction of basic messages. In fact,

they are not even surprising. But they do bring with them much more qualified

comparative static properties. The response of investment to real exchange

rates depends not only on current profitability but also on the anticipated

persistence. The effect of innovations in money depends on how the public

extrapolates the money innovation. Exchange rate impacts on prices and trade

flows depend on the conditions of entry and on the number of firms. I believe
                                   12



these new ideas force us also to modify our testing of hypothesis. Case

studies seem a suitable approach to try and start capturing this broader

picture.
