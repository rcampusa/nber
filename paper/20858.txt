A central challenge in asset pricing is the weak connection between stock returns and observable economic
fundamentals. We provide evidence that this connection is stronger than previously thought. We use
a modified version of the Bry-Boschan algorithm to identify long-run swings in the stock market. We
call these swings long-run bull and bear episodes. We find that there is a high correlation between
stock returns and fundamentals across bull and bear episodes. This correlation is much higher than
the analogous time-series correlations. We show that several asset pricing models cannot simultaneously
account for the low time-series and high episode correlations.

1. Introduction

Consumption-based asset pricing models in the tradition of Lucas (1978) and Breedan (1979)
emphasize the theoretical link between asset returns and economic fundamentals, such as
consumption growth. Much of the empirical literature has tested these theories using annual,
quarterly, and higher frequency data. Classic examples include Shiller (1981), Hansen and
Singleton (1982), and Mehra and Prescott (1985). A central challenge that has emerged
from this work is the apparent weak relation between stock returns and observable economic
fundamentals.
      In this paper, we re-examine this relation using an empirical strategy inspired by Burns
and Mitchell’s (1946) work on business cycles which uses expansions and recessions as the
basic unit of analysis.1 In this spirit, we investigate whether the elusive relation between
economic fundamentals and asset prices emerges more clearly across long-run bull and bear
episodes.
      We begin by reproducing the standard finding that consumption and output growth
are weakly correlated with stock returns. We then use a modified version of the algorithm
developed by Bry and Boschan (1971) to identify peaks and troughs in long-run stock market
trends. We call “bulls” the episodes that occur between a trough and a peak and “bears”
the episodes that occur between a peak and a trough. These bull and bear episodes are
identified using only stock market data. We find that the correlation between stock returns
and fundamentals across bull and bear episodes is much higher (about twice as high) than
the time-series correlations. This finding holds for the U.S., G7, and OECD countries.
      As a check on our procedure, we also date episodes using only consumption data or only
output data rather than stock returns. Once again, we find that for the U.S., G7, and
OECD countries, the correlation between stock returns and fundamentals across bull and
bear episodes is much higher than the time-series correlations.
      Our results are consistent with the idea that fundamentals do not drive stock prices at
short and even relatively long periods of time. from period to period. But over the course of
episodes sparked by major technological, military or political events, stock prices do reflect
fundamentals.
      We investigate whether this new fact—episode correlations between stock returns and
fundamentals are much stronger than time-series correlations—is consistent with three asset-
  1
      Stock (1987) pursues a modern version of this approach.


                                                     1
pricing models. The first is the external-habit model proposed by Campbell and Cochrane
(1999). The second is the long-run risk model proposed by Bansal, Kiku and Yaron (2012).
The third is the valuation-risk model proposed by Albuquerque, Eichenbaum, Luo, and
Rebelo (2014). We find that none of these models can explain our basic fact.
      Both the external-habit model and the long-run risk model do well at accounting for
the high episode correlations. However, they imply time-series correlations between stock
returns and consumption growth which are too high relative to the data, even taking sampling
uncertainty into account. This result holds at the one-, five-, ten- and 15-year horizons. As
stressed in Albuquerque, Eichenbaum, Luo, and Rebelo (2014), this shortcoming reflects the
fact that the only source of uncertainty in those models comes from the production side of the
economy. The valuation-risk model of Albuquerque, Eichenbaum, Luo, and Rebelo (2014)
accounts for the time-series correlations at all horizons when sampling uncertainty is taken
into consideration. However, the model fails to account for the high episode correlations.
      We investigate whether the di§erence between the time-series and episode correlations
might be an artifact of the historical sample that we have at our disposal. At least for the
U.S., this possibility seems very unlikely. The evidence is somewhat more mixed for the G7
and OECD countries.
      We redo our analysis using dividends and earnings as alternative measures of fundamen-
tals. Our results for earnings growth are similar to those that we obtain with consumption
and output growth. The results with dividend growth are more nuanced. Dividend growth
is uncorrelated with stock returns at a yearly frequency. However, these series are correlated
at the 5- 10- and 15-year horizon, with a point estimate of roughly 0.5. There is a great
deal of sampling uncertainty associated with the episode correlation so that one can’t reject
the hypothesis that the episode and the long-horizon correlations are the same. A similar
pattern emerges for the G7 countries.2
      Considering the evidence as a whole, we are left with a puzzle: why is the correlation
between stock returns and fundamentals much stronger across bull and bear episodes than
the time-series correlations?
      Our paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we describe our modified version of the
Bry-Boschan filter, the data we use, and our empirical results. Section 3 describes the
three asset-pricing models we consider and their implications for time-series and episode
  2
      We cannot do this analysis for OECD countries because of data availability.

correlations between stock returns and fundamentals. Section 4 concludes.


2. Measuring long-run booms and busts

There is a long tradition of characterizing turning points in economic time series that goes
back at least to the work of Burns and Mitchell (1946) on dating business cycles. This
tradition gave rise to a large literature that uses time-series methods to estimate turning
points (see Stock and Watson (2010) and the references therein). An early, important con-
tribution to this literature is Bry and Boschan (1971) who develop an algorithm for dating
the beginnings and ends of recessions. This algorithm has recently been used to character-
ize high-frequency bull and bear stock markets (see e.g. Pagan and Sossounov (2002) and
Gonzalez, Powel, Shi and Wilson (2005)).
   This paper focuses on low-frequency swings in the stock market which we refer to as
long-run bulls and bears. The solid line in Figure 1 displays an annual index of U.S. stock
prices for the time period 1869 to 2013. It is evident that there are periods of irregular
length in which stock prices are dominated by either upward or downward movements. To
determine the turning points that mark the beginning and end of long-run bulls and bears,
we develop a modified version of the Bry and Boschan (1971) algorithm.
   The remainder of this section is organized as follows. In subsection 2.1, we describe
the modified Bry-Boschan (1971) algorithm. In subsection 2.2 we describe the data we use.
In subsection 2.3 we apply the algorithm to U.S. data and discuss historical events around
the identified turning points. In subsection 2.4 we revisit a classic question in asset pricing:
what is the correlation between fundamentals (consumption and output growth) and realized
returns to the stock market? We also extend our basic analysis to G7 and OECD countries.
In subsection 2.5 we pursue an alternative strategy for dating long-run bulls and bears, which
relies on consumption and output data. In subsection 2.6 we conduct tests to assess whether
our results are spurious in the sense of being an artifact of the filter that we use to date bull
and bear episodes. We also discuss the possibility that our results might reflect small-sample
bias.




                                               3
2.1. A modified Bry-Boschan algorithm

The Bry and Boschan (1971) algorithm is a series of ad-hoc filters designed to determine turn-
ing points in times-series data.3 As emphasized by Watson (2004), the algorithm identifies
local maxima and minima subject to constraints on the length and amplitude of expansions
and contractions.
       To focus on long-run movements in stock prices, we adopt the following modified version
of the Bry-Boschan algorithm. In the first step, we take logarithms of the data and eliminate
high frequencies and business-cycle frequencies (those lower than 8 years) using the bandpass
filter proposed by Christiano and Fitzgerald (1999).4 We refer to the resulting series as the
long-run stock price index, which we denote by P̄ (t). In step two, we identify peaks by finding
dates, t, for which P̄ (t) is higher than P̄ (t + j) for j 2 J, where J = {−3, −2, −1, 1, 2, 3}.
Similarly, we identify troughs by finding dates, t, for which P̄ (t) is lower than P̄ (t + j) for
j 2 J. In step three, we check whether there are two subsequent peaks or two subsequent
troughs. If we find two subsequent peaks (troughs), we retain only the most extreme peak
(trough). If the values of the peaks (troughs) are equal, we select the last peak (trough).
Finally, we refine the peaks and troughs using the original series instead of the long-run
stock price index. For every peak (trough) date identified using the long-run stock price
index, we search three years before or after the peak (trough) for higher (lower) values of
the actual stock price index.5 We identify the final peak (trough) as the highest (lowest)
value of the actual stock price index within that window. Unlike Bry and Boschan (1971),
we do not require a minimum duration for a bull or bear episode. An important aspect of
our algorithm is that it dates bull and bear episodes using only stock market data.
   3
      See King and Plosser (1994) for a detailed description of the Bry-Boschan algorithm.
   4
      Our algorithm to compute turning points uses a two-sided bandpass filter. The two-sided nature of this
filter does not pose a problem for our analysis because we are characterizing ex-post features of the data,
as opposed to forecasting or testing trading strategies. Obtaining accurate estimates of the long-run trend
requires the use of a long two-sided moving average. In fact, an ideal bandpass filter requires an infinite
two-sided moving average (see Baxter and King (1999) and Christiano and Fitzgerald (2003)). It is di¢cult
to estimate bandpass trends in the beginning and end of the sample, because long lags of the series are
not available. For this reason, one-sided versions of the bandpass filter generally produce very noisy trend
estimates (see Watson (2007) for a detailed discussion). Consistent with Watson (2007), we find that the
one-sided version of the bandpass filter produces a trend that is volatile and takes on values that are actually
closer to the original series than to the two-sided bandpass trend.
    5
      To assess the robustness of our results, we redid our analysis using the Bry-Boschan procedure without
this last refinement. We find that refining the Bry-Boschan procedure eliminates some of the episodes but
the basic facts about the correlations between realized stock returns and various measures of fundamentals
are very robust.

2.2. Data

Our data sets come from two sources. First, we obtain annual real stock returns for the
G7 and the OECD countries from Global Financial Data. The countries (sample peri-
ods) included in our data set are: Australia (1901-2013), Austria (1947-2013), Belgium
(1947-2013), Canada (1900-2013), Chile (1900-2013), Denmark (1900-2013), Finland (1923-
2013), France (1942-2013), Germany (1851-2013), Greece (1953-2013), Italy (1900-2013),
Japan (1894-2013), Korea (1963-2013), Mexico (1902-2013), Netherlands (1947-2013), New
Zealand (1947-2013), Norway (1915-2013), Spain (1941-2013), Sweden (1900-2013), Switzer-
land (1900-2013), United Kingdom (1830-2013), and United States (1869-2013).
   Second, we use the data set on real per capita personal consumer expenditures and real
per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) originally constructed by Barro and Ursúa (2008)
and updated by these authors until 2009.
   Third, we obtain data for dividends and earnings for the G7 from Global Financial Data.

2.3. Long-run bulls and bears

The solid line in Figure 1 corresponds to the logarithm of the U.S. real stock price index.
The dotted line is the bandpass-filtered version of the solid line in which high frequencies
and business-cycle frequencies have been removed. Circles and stars denote the peaks and
troughs identified by our algorithm.
   Table 1 provides summary statistics for bull and bear episodes. Consider the results for
the U.S. First, bull markets are on average much longer than bear markets, 14.8 years versus
3.2 years. On net, the economy spends 80 percent of the time in bull markets and only
20 percent in bear markets. The annual realized excess return to equity is, on average, 7.5
percent in our sample. However, this excess return is very di§erent across bull and bear
markets: 13.0 percent in bull markets versus −14.3 percent in bear markets. This sharp
di§erence primarily reflects the fact that equity returns are on average 14.2 percent in bull
markets but −15.5 percent in bear markets. The last two lines of Table 1 report the growth
rate of two measures of fundamentals that are at the core of standard asset pricing theory:
consumption and output. The average growth rate of consumption is higher in bull markets
(2.3 percent) than in bear markets (0.7 percent). While the average growth rate of output
is also higher in bull than in bear episodes (2.4 versus 2 percent), the di§erence is not as
dramatic as in the case of consumption. The results for consumption for the G7 and OECD


                                             5
are quite similar to the results for the U.S. There is a sizable di§erence between the growth
rate of output in bull and bear episodes for the G7 and OECD.
   Table 2 lists the dates of U.S. bull and bear episodes along with a summary of major
technological, military or political events associated with these episodes. While it is easy to
rationalize dates ex-post, many of the 20th century turning points are instantly recognizable.
The bear market of 1915-20 is associated with World War I and its aftermath. The bull
market of 1920 to 1928 is associated with a well-know period of fast technological progress.
The bear market of 1928-31 is associated with the Great Depression, while the bull market
of 1931-36 is associated with the recovery from the Great Depression. This episode also falls
squarely in the period that Fields (2011) calls “the most technologically progressive decade
of the century.” The bear market of 1936-41 coincides with the uncertainties associated with
the run up to World War II. The great bull market from 1941 to 1972 is associated with
the period of “pax Americana” as well as major developments like the emergence of the
commercial aviation industry and the construction of the interstate highway system. The
1972-74 bear market reflects adverse shocks to the price of oil. The bull market of 1974-1999
coincides with the information technology revolution that included the personal computer
and the internet. The bear market of 1999-2002 is associated with the Nasdaq crash and
the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The bull market of 2002-07 coincides with the credit and housing
boom, while the bear market of 2007-08 is associated with the Great Recession.
   Figures 2 and 3 display, for the G7 and the OECD, the logarithm of the stock price index,
the bandpass trend and the peaks and troughs associated with booms and busts episodes.
Figure 2 suggests that the boom and bust episodes are correlated across G7 countries. Recall
that we interpret long-run bull and bear episodes as being driven by major technological,
political, and military events. From this perspective, it is reasonable to expect that the
episodes would be correlated across countries.
   We use the concordance index proposed by Harding and Pagan (2002, 2006) to measure
the extent to which bull and bear episodes are synchronized across countries. To compute
this index, we define the indicator Stj for country j which takes on the value one if the
country is in a long-run bull at time t and zero otherwise. We use country index one to
denote the U.S. The concordance index between the U.S. and country j, Ij , is computed as:
                                 ( T                                         )
                             1    X                   X
                                                      T
                                                        #          $ #     $
                        Ij =            St1 Stj   +                      j
                                                            1 − St1 1 − St     .
                             T    t=1                 t=1


                                                      6
This index measures the fraction of time that two countries spend in the same stock-market
phase. Table 3 presents our results, ordering countries by their concordance with the U.S.
The degree of concordance between the U.S. and the other countries in our sample is higher
than 0.7 for most developed countries. Presumably, this statistic reflects the presence of a
common factor inducing long-run bulls and bears in stock returns across di§erent countries
and the fact that the long-term trend for stock prices is positive most of the time.

2.4. Correlations between fundamentals and stock returns

Table 4 reports the correlation between stock returns and the growth rate of consumption
and output for the U.S., the G7, and the OECD. We report correlations at the one-, five-
, ten- and 15-year horizons. Correlations at horizons longer than one year are computed
using overlapping observations. We report Newey-West (1987) heteroskedasticity-consistent
standard errors.6 We compute correlations for the G7 and the OECD countries pooling
data across all countries. This procedure implies that countries with longer time series
receive more weight in the calculations. Below we assess the sensitivity of our results to this
assumption.
      Consistent with results in Cochrane and Hansen (1992), Campbell and Cochrane (1999),
and Albuquerque, Eichenbaum, Luo and Rebelo (2014), we find that there is a relatively weak
correlation between consumption and output growth and stock returns at all the horizons we
consider. This result obtains for horizons as long as 15 years. One exception is the five-year
correlation between U.S. consumption growth and U.S. stock returns which is relatively high.
This result only holds in U.S. data: the analogue five-year correlation is not high for the G7
and OECD countries.
      A key question is: what is the correlation between stock returns and fundamentals like
consumption and output growth across episodes. Recall that bull and bear episodes are
identified using only stock market data.
      Table 4 reports two versions of the correlation between the average growth rate of fun-
damentals and the average annual stock returns across episodes. The first is a simple corre-
lation. The second is a correlation that gives more weight to longer episodes. The weighted
correlation between variable x and y is computed as:
  6
    To compute standard errors for the 1, 5, 10, and 15 year correlatio,n we use 6, 11, 16 and 21 lags,
respectively.

where i indexes episodes, a bar over a variable denotes the mean value of that variable over
the whole sample, and wi denotes the number of years in episode i. The variables xi and yi
denote the average annual growth rate of x and y, respectively, measured from the beginning
to the end of episode i. The variables x̄ and ȳ represent weighted sample averages.
      From Table 4 we see that there is a very high correlation between consumption growth
rates and stock returns across U.S. episodes. The simple correlation is 0.635 and the weighted
correlation is 0.626. In both cases, the correlation is significantly di§erent from zero and
insignificantly di§erent from one.7 Similar results emerge for the G7 and OECD countries.
For the G7, the simple and weighted correlations between consumption growth and stock
returns are 0.757 and 0.794, respectively. The corresponding correlations for OECD countries
are 0.579 and 0.604, respectively.
      The correlations between output growth and stock returns follow a similar pattern. For
the U.S., the highest time-series correlation (0.253) occurs at a five-year horizon. The lowest
correlation (−0.034) occurs at a 15-year horizon. Correlations across episodes are much
higher: 0.462 and 0.328 for simple and weighted correlations, respectively. For the G7, the
correlation between output growth and stock returns across episodes is about twice as high
as the time-series correlation. For the OECD, the episode correlations are about 2.5 times
the time-series correlations.
      Table 5 reports the time-series correlations between stock returns and fundamentals
within bull and bear episodes for the U.S., G7, and the OECD. As above, we compute
correlations for the G7 and the OECD countries by pooling data across all countries. In
sharp contrast with the positive correlations across episodes, correlations within bulls and
bear episodes are essentially zero.
      Next, we assess the robustness of our key results to di§erent ways of combining observa-
tions for the G7 and OECD countries. The rows in Table 6 that are labeled “pooled” report
correlations obtained by pooling observations from the G7 and OECD countries. These sta-
tistics are the same as those reported in Table 4. The rows labeled “average” report the
average of country-specific statistics. While the magnitude of the correlations varies, the

    Our results are robust to omitting the longest U.S. episode (1941-72). In this case the simple and
weighted correlation between stock returns and consumption growth are 0.61 (0.25) and 0.58 (0.19), where
numbers in parenthesis denote standard errors.


                                                     8
episode correlations are roughly twice as high as the time-series correlations.

2.5. Dating the episodes with consumption and output data

Up to this point, we dated episodes using data on stock prices and argued that there is a high
correlation between stock returns and fundamentals across episodes. A natural question is:
does a similar correlation obtain if we date episodes using data on consumption or output?
Presumably, if stock returns are reacting to those fundamentals, there should be a similar
correlation to the one obtained dating episodes with the stock market.
       Consider first the results obtained dating episodes with consumption data. According
to Table 7, the correlations between stock returns and consumption growth are similar to
those obtained dating the episodes with stock price data.8 This pattern also holds for the
correlation between stock returns and output growth.
       Table 7 also displays the results obtained dating episodes with data on output. For the
U.S., taking sampling uncertainty into account, the correlations across episodes for both
consumption and output are very similar to those obtained when we date episodes with
stock-price data. For the G7 and OECD we find, once again, very high correlations between
stock returns and both consumption growth and output growth.
       We conclude that, regardless of how episodes are dated, there is a strong episode corre-
lation between stock returns and our measures of fundamentals.

2.6. Alternative measures of fundamentals

In this subsection, we assess whether our results are robust to using dividend growth and
earnings growth as measures of fundamentals. We report our results in Table 4.
       The pattern that emerges with earnings growth is quantitatively very similar to the one
that emerges with consumption or output growth. The result with dividend growth are more
complicated. Like with our other measures of fundamentals the correlation between stock
returns and dividend growth is very low at the one-year horizon. However, the correlation
rises to roughly 0.5 at the 5-, 10-, and 15-year horizon. So there is less of a puzzle with respect
to dividend growth at long horizons than there is with consumption growth or output.
       The point estimate for the episode and weighted-episode correlation between stock return
and dividend growth is somewhat lower than the long-horizon time-series correlations. How-
   8
    Given the smooth behavior of consumption there are fewer consumption-based episodes than stock-price-
based episodes. This fact explains the relatively high standard errors associated with the U.S. correlations.


                                                     9
ever, there is a great deal of sampling uncertainty, so we do not reject the hypothesis that
the long-horizon and episode correlation are high and roughly the same. A similar picture
emerges when we look at the G7 countries.

2.7. Robustness checks

It is well known that Bry-Boschan-type filters applied to data generated by an univariate
random walk identify bull- and bear-like episodes. In fact, if we simulate a random walk
for stock prices and apply our version of the Bry-Boschan filter to the artificial data, the
filter identifies bull and bear episodes. From this perspective, one might be concerned that
the bull (bear) episodes identified by the Bry-Boschan filter simply result from a random
sequence of good (bad) shocks. In this case, there would be no reason to expect a correlation
across episodes between stock returns and consumption or output growth. Indeed, if we
simulate two independent random walks we find that both the time series and the episode
correlations are zero in population.
    In this subsection, we conduct two additional experiments designed to shed light on
the possibility that the correlation across episodes between fundamentals and stock returns
emerges is simply an artifact of the properties of our version of the Bry-Boschan filter.
    In the first experiment, we estimate a trivariate VAR(2) using annual U.S. data for the
growth rate of consumption, the growth rate of output, and stock returns. We obtain the
following representation:

The estimated covariance matrix for the vector error term is given by:

                                 7.2453 10.2668 350.2595

    We construct a synthetic time series of length 10, 000 using the estimated VAR(2). We
simulate the VAR by sampling the disturbances with replacement from the vector of actual
VAR residuals. We then calculate the time-series and episode correlations using the synthetic

                                             10
data. The results are reported in Table 8. We find that the time-series correlations are
quite similar to those estimated from actual data. However, the synthetic data implies that
the episode correlations are similar to the time-series correlations. This property contrasts
sharply with the results obtained from actual data. One possible interpretation of this result
is that the episode correlations reflect either non-linearities or non-stationarity not captured
by the VAR.
      As an additional robustness check, we scramble the bull and bear episodes as follows.9
Define the sequence of stock returns for bull episode i by the vector Ui and the sequence of
stock returns for bear episode j by the vector Dj . We place the six booms in our data in
urn Ū and the six busts in urn D̄:

                                  Ū = {U1 , U2 , U3 , U4 , U5 , U6 } ,
                                  D̄ = {D1 , D2 , D3 , D4 , D5 , D6 } .

We choose the first episode to be a bull or bear with probability 1/2. We then sample without
replacement alternating between the two urns. We match the resulting time series for stock
returns with the original time series for consumption returns. The last row of Table 8 shows
that both the time-series and episode correlations are close to zero. We infer that the actual
timing of the bull and bear episodes reveals important information about the comovement
between fundamentals and stock returns.

2.8. Small-sample properties

In this subsection, we investigate the possibility that the di§erence between the episode
correlations and the time-series correlations simply reflects small-sample bias. Suppose that
the true data-generating process is a linear VAR. Then, consistent with Table 8, there should
be no di§erence in population between episode and time-series correlations at five-, ten-, and
15-year horizons. But, it is possible that in a small sample we would find seemingly significant
di§erences between time-series and episode correlations. To investigate this possibility, we
proceed as follows. For every country in the OECD, we estimate a trivariate VAR(2) for
the growth rate of consumption, the growth rate of output, and stock returns. This VAR
specification is the same as in Section 2.6. We sample from the VAR residuals to construct
10, 000 synthetic time series for each of the variables in the VAR. For each country, each
  9

                                                     11
time series has the length equal to the corresponding number of observations in our actual
data set. For example, in the U.S. case the length is equal to 144 observations. Using the
synthetic time series we calculate the frequency of various events of interest.
   For each synthetic time series we compute the time-series and episode correlations. Define
kic to be the ratio of the episode correlation and the time-series correlation between consump-
tion growth and stock returns at horizon i. Define kiy to be the ratio of the episode correlation
and the time-series correlation between output growth and stock returns at horizon i. Both
kic and kiy are computed with our empirical estimates of the correlations.
   We define event 1 to be: the episode correlation between consumption growth and stock
returns is positive and greater than the product of kic and the analogue time-series correlation
at horizon i for either i = 1, 5, 10, and 15. In addition, the episode correlation between output
growth and stock returns is positive and greater than the product of kiy and the analogue
time-series correlation at horizon i for either i = 1, 5, 10. Event 2 di§ers from event 1 in only
one dimension: the contemporaneous correlation (i = 1) is excluded from the definition of
the event. The motivation for this specification is as follows. Bull and bear episodes last, on
average, 15 and three years, respectively. So, it seems reasonable to assess the robustness of
our results by excluding the contemporaneous correlation from the specification.
   Table 9 reports results based on VARs that are estimated using ordinary least squares.
For the U.S., events 1 and 2 occurs with less than one percent probability, regardless of
whether we look at simple episodes or weighted episodes. The results are somewhat more
mixed for the G7 and the OECD. In both cases, event 1 occurs with less than 5 percent
probability. Event 2 occurs with less than 5 percent probability for simple episodes and
slightly higher than 5 percent probability for weighted episodes.
   Viewing the evidence as a whole, it seems unlikely that the di§erence between the time-
series and the episode correlations are an artifact of small sample bias.


3. Three asset-pricing models

We consider three models: the external-habit model of Campbell-Cochrane (1999), the long-
run risk model of Bansal, Kiku and Yaron (2012), and the valuation-risk model of Albu-
querque, Eichenbaum, Luo, and Rebelo (2015). We assume that agents make decisions on a
monthly basis. We aggregate the monthly data simulated from the parameterized models to
produce annual data.


                                               12
3.1. The external-habit model

The representative agent maximizes utility given by:

                                           X
                                           1
                                                              − Xt )1−γ − 1

                                    U =E          δ                         ,
                                            t=0
                                                               1−γ
Ct denotes consumption at time t.
      The dynamics of the habit variable, Xt , are implied by the law of motion of consumption
and surplus consumption. The latter is given by:
                                                        Ct − Xt
                                             St =               .
                                                           Ct
The variable st = ln(St ) evolves according:


                         st+1 = (1 − φ)s̄ + φst + λ(st ) [∆ct+1 − E (∆ct+1 )] ,

where s̄ is the unconditional mean of st , φ is a parameter that controls the persistence of st ,
and ct = ln(Ct ). The deterministic function λ(st ) is given by:
                            + #      $p
                                1/S̄   1 − 2(st − s̄) − 1, when st < smax ,
                   λ(st ) =
                                          0,                when st ≥ smax ,

where S̄ is equal to:                                   r
                                                               γ
                                            S̄ = σ υ              ,
                                                              1−φ
and
                                                   1
                                        smax = s̄ + (1 − S̄ 2 ).
                                                   2
The logarithm of consumption follows a random walk with drift:

                                         ct+1 = ct + µ + υ t+1 ,

where υ t+1 is an i.i.d. normally distributed variable with mean zero and variance σ 2υ . We solve
the model using the algorithm discussed in Wachter (2005).10 We take the parameter values
from Table 1 in Wachter (2005). These values correspond to those used by Campbell and
Cochrane (1999), adapted for simulating the model at a monthly frequency. We summarize
these parameter values in Table 10. As in Wachter (2005), we consider a version of the model
in which equities are a claim to consumption.

3.2. The long-run risk model

The representative agent has the constant-elasticity version of Kreps-Porteus (1978) prefer-
ences used by Epstein and Zin (1991) and Weil (1989). The life-time utility of the represen-
tative agent is a function of current utility and the certainty equivalent of future utility:
                              h                    #       $ iθ/(1−γ)
                                       (1−γ)/θ          1−γ 1/θ
                        Ut = (1 − δ)Ct         + δ Et Ut+1             ,

where δ is a positive scalar. The variable θ is given by:
                                                    1−γ
                                            θ=            .
                                                   1 − 1/
The parameters      and γ represent the elasticity of intertemporal substitution and the coef-
ficient of relative risk aversion, respectively.
   The process for consumption growth is given by:

                               log(Ct+1 /Ct ) = µ + xt + σ t "ct+1 ,
                                          xt+1 = ρxt + φe σ t et+1 ,

When ρ is close to one, this process captures the notion that there are shocks to the long-run
growth rate of consumption.
   Dividends evolve according to:

                         log(Dt+1 /Dt ) = µ + φxt + πσ t η t+1 + 'σ t "dt+1 .

The volatility of consumption growth evolves according to:


                                σ 2t+1 = σ 2 (1 − ν) + νσ 2t + σ w "σt+1 .

The variables "ct+1 , et+1 , "dt+1 , and "σt+1 are mutually uncorrelated and follow a standard-
normal distribution.
   We use the parameter values proposed by Bansal, Kiku and Yaron (2012), which we
summarize in Table 11.

3.3. The valuation-risk model

The preferences of the representative agent are given by:
                                 h               #        $ iθ/(1−γ)
                                      (1−γ)/θ         1−γ 1/θ
                       Ut = max λt Ct         + δ Et Ut+1            .                     (3.1)
                                Ct


                                                   14
   The variable Λt+1 = log(λt+1 /λt ) determines how agents trade o§ current versus future
utility. This ratio is known at time t. We refer to Λt+1 as the time-preference shock.
   The growth rate of the time-preference shock evolves according to:

                                      Λt+1 = xt + σ η η t+1 ,                                    (3.2)
                                       xt+1 = ρxt + σ Λ "Λt+1 .

Here "Λt+1 and η t+1 are uncorrelated, i.i.d. standard normal shocks. We think of xt as
capturing low-frequency changes in the growth rate of the discount rate. In contrast, η t+1
can be thought of as high-frequency changes in investor sentiment that a§ect the demand
for assets as in the model proposed by Dumas, Kurshev, and Uppal (2009).
   The consumption process is given by:
                                                      #            $
           log(Ct+1 /Ct ) = µ + ρc log(Ct /Ct−1 ) + αc σ 2t+1 − σ 2 + π cλ "Λt+1 + σ t "ct+1 .

A share of stock is a claim on dividends which evolve according to:
                                                              #             $
                   log(Dt+1 /Dt ) = µ + ρd log(Dt+1 /Dt ) + αd σ 2t+1 − σ 2
                                         +π dλ "Λt+1 + π dc σ t "ct+1 + σ d σ t "dt+1 .

Volatility follows the process:
                                                #          $
                                σ 2t+1 = σ 2 + v σ 2t − σ 2 + σ w wt+1 ,

Variables "ct+1 , "dt+1 , "Λt+1 , and wt+1 are mutually uncorrelated, i.i.d. standard normal shocks.
   We use the parameter values estimated in Albuquerque, Eichenbaum, Luo, and Rebelo
(2015) for their extended model. We summarize these parameters in Table 12.

3.4. Evaluating the models

To evaluate the performance of the models, we compare their implications for time-series
and episode correlations with estimates for the U.S. Our results are summarized in Table 13.
   First, consider the external habit model of Campbell and Cochrane (1999). As discussed
in Albuquerque, Eichenbaum, Luo, and Rebelo (2015), the time-series correlations between
stock returns and consumption growth are uniformly too high relative to the data, even taking
sampling uncertainty into account. This shortcoming reflects the fact that the only source
of uncertainty in that model comes from the endowment side of the economy. Interestingly,

                                                    15
the non-linearities in the model imply that the episode correlations are higher than the
time-series correlations. So, arguably this model does well at accounting for the episode
correlations but does not do well at accounting for the time-series correlations.
   Next, consider the long-risk model of Bansal, Kiku and Yaron (2012). Like the Campbell-
Cochrane model, this model does reasonably well at accounting for the high episode corre-
lations. But it implies counterfactually high time-series correlations, even taking sampling
uncertainty into account. As with the external-habit model, this shortcoming reflects the
fact that all uncertainty stems from the production side of the economy. However, unlike
the external-habit model, the long-run risk model does not generate an episode correlation
that is substantially higher than the time series correlations.
   Next, consider the valuation-risk model of Albuquerque, Eichenbaum, Luo, and Rebelo
(2015). The time-series correlations implied by this model are uniformly lower than the
corresponding point estimates from the data. Taking sampling uncertainty into account, the
model accounts for the time-series correlations at all horizons. However, the model does not
capture the high episode correlations.


4. Conclusion

Our main finding in this paper is that there is a high correlation between stock returns
and fundamentals across bull and bear episodes. This high correlation stands in sharp
contrast with the low time-series correlations between stock returns and fundamentals that
have been documented in the literature. We show that several asset-pricing models cannot
simultaneously account for the low time-series correlations and the high episode correlations.
   There are two words for time in ancient Greek. Chronos is the word for calendar time.
Kairos refers to a moment of indeterminate time in which something special happens. To
account for our findings, we need a model in which the relation between stock returns and
consumption growth is di§erent in chronos and kairos time.
