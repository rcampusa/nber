                 RATIONAL EXPECTATIONS AND MACRO E)NOMIC F)RECASTS


                                     Abstract


     This paper presents extensive results from testing for bias and serially
correlated errors in a large collection of quarterly multiperiod predictions
from surveys conducted since 1968 by the National Bureau of Economic Research
and the American Statistical Association. The tests of the joint null hypoth—
esis that the regressions of actual on predicted values have zero intercepts
and unitary slope coefficients are very unfavorable to the expectations of
inflation, hut they show the forecasts of several other variables in a gener-
ally much better light. There have been strong tendencies for the forecasters
in this period to underestimate inflation and overestimate real growth.
Considerable attention is given to the effects of the sample size——the issue of
the power of the tests——and also to the extent and role o.E autocorrelations
among the residual errors from these regressions.

     Rationality in the sense of efficient use of relevant information implies
the absence of systematic elements in series of errors from the forecaster's
own predictions, measured strictly in the form in which such errors could have
been known at the time of the forecast. The frequencies of significant auto—
correlations among errors so measured vary greatly across the forecasts for
different variables, being very high for inflation, high for inventory invest-
ment and the unemployment rate, and much lower for most of the predictions of
the other variables covered (rates of change in nominal and real GNP and
expenditures on consumer durables). The corresponding tests for the group mean
forecasts show much less evidence of serially correlated ex ante errors, except
for inflation.

                                I. Questions and Data



 On Economics of Expectations and Surveys of Forecasts


      Much effort was spent in recent years on collecting and processing data

 from periodic surveys of intentions, plans, or predictions of various groups:

 consumers, corporate managers, business and financial analysts, economists.

 This work was motivated mainly by the prospect of obtaining useful tools for

practical forecasting, but it is increasingly recognized that the data can have

 important analytical uses for measurement and study of economic expectations.

     Recent theorizing about expectations concentrates on market prices and

rawards that motivate people to use all information that can be acquired cost—

effectively. The   rational   expectations hypothesis assumes that a sufficiently

large number of agents know "how the world works," that is, recognize the

structure of their environment and efficiently process all available and

pertinent data. It is the so formed expectations that are decisive for what

transpires in the market place, and they are reflected in the equilibrating

behavior of prices and other endogerious variables (Muth, 1961; Poole, 1976).

Prices in a market may incorporate all information that matters, even though

price expectations of many, perhaps even most, traders do not meet the

rationality criterion,1




     1For this to happen, all that is needed is that some resourceful partici-
pants have their way in eliminating the unexploited profit opportunities in
the given market. Those who succeed relatively often tend to reap gains: the
competitive game of economic prediction cannot be comprehended by treating
expectations as if they were simple-valued and universally shared. Thus it is
important to distinguish between individual and market expectations. For an
early argument that rational market reactions may coexist with a large amount
of individual "irrationality," see Becker, 1962.
                                     —2--




     However, under uncertainty and in areas of the economy other than the com-

petitive auction markets, quantity signals may be as important as price sig-

nals. Economic agents are presumably most interested in local variables

relating closely to their own activities, hut aggregate measures such as real

GNP growth, inflation, unemployment, sensitive cyclical indicators, changes in

money and credit, interest rates, and exchange rates are also widely monitored

and selectively used. For most of the macrovariables, market expectations are

nonexistent or unobservable, but it is evident that numerous predictions are

being regularly made and used throughout the economy. Macropredictions serve

as important inputs to micropredictions.

     Not surprisingly, professional business analysts and economists produce

the bulk of the macroeconomic predictions, both for public and internal uses,

and many of them participate in periodic business outlook surveys. It might be

argued that these are forecasts of people who study the economy (experts),

which are quite unlike the expectations of those who act in the economy

(agents). On the one hand, the experts are usually credited with more know-

ledge of the economy at large than the agents have. On the other hand, the

experts are often charged with being less strongly motivated to predict

optimally than the agents who are seen as having more at stake.

     In practice, the distinction between agents and experts is at this point

very blurred. Macroeconomic forecasters who sell their services to governmental

and corporate decision makers and often conpete as well in the market for public

attention are treated as "experts" hut they are certainly also "agents" in their

own rights. Indeed, many of them are influential agents who have passed criti-

cal market tests, as certified by their positions and by the rewards their

 forecasts and advice earn them in the business world. It can be presumed that,

 in general, they do have incentives to perform well and strive to do so.
                                      —3—



      Consistent with this view, it is appropriate that the results of business

outlook surveys have received alternative interpretations in the literature.

They are treated either as agents' expectations, e.g., in tests of whether

they conform to the hypotheses of rational or adaptive expectations, or as

experts' forecasts, e.g., in comparisons with predictions from particular

econometric models.2 This paper will adopt the first of these perspectives.

      An ideal survey would use a large, properly constructed random sample to

insure that the respondents represent well the universe of those whose expec-

tations count, and a system of rewards and penalties to insure that they have

a stake in their responses. Of course, the ideal surveys do not exist and the

actual ones may be far from ideal. If a survey yields inferior or biased pre-

dictions, it is possible that carelessness, poor information, or other fail-

ings of particular respondents are to blame, which should not be generalized.

The evidence may be distorted and the results misinterpreted because of

reporting errors, outliers, undue reliance on averages from small samples,

spotty participation, or limited time coverage. But detailed knowledge of,

and attention to, the data can go far to safeguard against such pitfalls.

This work should benefit from the author's direct involvement with the

management of the surveys to be discussed.


Tests of Rationality

      Rational expectations sensu stricto satisfy

where y      is the one—period-ahead prediction of the variable                 E   is   the

expected value operator; and I is the set of all information (data and

models) on which y      was conditioned at the time it was made. ll attempts

to apply this abstract formula confront a dilemma. To determine whether the

predictions y are rational in the sense of (1),                        must be specified, hut

as a rule the outside observer has no way of knowing what this set contains.
                                                                *
(Indeed, even the source of a particular value of y                 would probably often

find it difficult to define the contents of                   clearly and exhaustively.)3
                                *
      If   adequate data on y       are available, it is possible to test one

implication of rationality, namely lack of bias

To this end, the regression




is estimated to verify or falsify the joint hypothesis that a and b are

not statistically different from 0 and              1,    respectively. However, this is

a weak test, since rational expectations imply efficient use of pertinent

information, not just unbiasedness. Pnd            unbiased   predictions may still be far

from optimal or even accurate.




     3consider as an example the much studied short-term expectations of
inflation: what is known about their determinants? There are the dominant
hypotheses of economic theory. But economists do not agree on all the
important features of their models, and insofar as their models contradict
each other they surely cannot all be properly specified. It is difficult to
accept the notion that the representative agent is free of the limitations of
knowledge that are evident in experts' analysis of the economy. But conse—
quences of incomplete information or deficient knowledge may he mistaken for
departure from rational expectations (ZarnoWitz, 1982a).
                                                —5—




         The advantage of testing H0:          (a, b) =   (0,   1)   is that no specification

 is needed of what information the forecasters could and should have used, and

 how.       But it is possible to   use a considerably stronger criterion of ration—

 ality without getting involved in difficult and to some               extent inevitably
 arbitrary     assumptions about the plausible data and models constituting the

 information sets in question. For any variable, an important part of the

 set            is made of past errors made by the forecaster and known (or at

 least knowable) to him or her at the time of the forecast. The testable

 requirement here is that there be rio significant autocorrelation among such

errors, i.e., that the predictions be essentially free of systematic error

components that could have been detected and corrected on a current basis.

        In this study, the tests of bias and autocorrelation of errors are

applied to a large number of time series of multiperiod prediotions for six

selected macroeconomic variables. The data, described below, are believed to

represent well the contemporary "state of the art" in professional forecasting

of business conditions. Problems of how to measure the predictive errors and

how    to estimate the parameters in     question are best discussed in the context

of    the   actual data used.


Sources of Evidence and Scope of Study

        Owing to the efforts of the National Bureau of Economic Research, in

collaboration with the American Statistical Association, a large amount of

information has been assembled on        the   record of forecasting changes in the
J.   S. economy. Each quarter, the NBER         examines    the results of a questionnaire
mailed      by the ASA.4 The survey reaches a         broadly   based and diversified group



     4For the quarterly reports on each survey, see NBER Explorations in
Economic Research (through 1977) and NEEP. Reporter (since 1978). The
corresponding ASA reports have appeared in the American Statistician and
                                     —6--




of persons who are regularly engaged in the analysis of current and prospec-

tive business conditions. r4ost of the respondents are from the world of

corporate business and finance hut academic institutions, government,

consulting firms, trade associations, and labor unions are also represented.

The format of the survey remained unchanged from its inception in 1968:4

through 1981:2, with forecasts covering on each occasion the current and the

next four quarters, for eleven time series representing the principal measures

of national output, income, consumption, investment, the price level, and

unemployment.5

     Past work on the survey data has concentrated on summary measures (mainly

group medians or means, in some cases standard deviations), whereas this paper

is part of a comprehensive study of forecasts by individual respondents in the

NBER—ASA group. Further, unlike the many recent studies which consider only

expectations of inflation, this report covers other important aggregative

variables as well.

     The body of the data consists of 42 consecutive surveys covering the

period from 1968:4 through 1979:1. Altogether, the list of those who replied

to any of the questionnaires includes 172 names (which are treated confiden-

tially). However, many individuals responded only once or a few times, and




(since 1974) in mStat News. The forecasts have been regularly published and
frequently discussed in Economic Prospects, a report by the Commercial Credit
Company (1972-73), and in Economic Outlook USA, a report by the Survey
Research Center at the University of l Jgi (since 1974). On the origin of
the survey and the design of the questionnaire, see Zarnowitz, 1969a.

     51n 1981 the coverage has been substantially extended. The surveys also
have regularly collected unique data on the methods and assumptions used by the
participants, and on the probabilities they attach to alternative prospects
concerning changes in output and prices. For references to some evaluations of
the overall results from the ASA—NEER surveys, see Zarnovjitz, 1982c.
                                                 —7—




some decision had to be made on the minimum number of surveys that would

qualify a participant for inclusion. It was set at 12, which still left as

many as 79 individuals in the sample.

      Four of the variables covered have strong upward trends, and it is not

their levels that are of major interest hut rather their rates of change which

reflect their real growth and/or inflation. These are gross national product

and consumer expenditures for durable goods, both in current dollars (GNP and

CEDG); GNP in constant dollars (RGNP); and the GNP implicit price deflator

(IPO). For these series, forecast errors are measured as differences,

predicted minus actual percentage change.

      The change in business inventories (CBI), a current—dollar series, is

trendless, being already in first-difference form. The unemployment rate (Tm)

represents the percentage unemployed of the civilian labor force and is domi-
nated by short-term, mainly cyclical movements, not a long—term trend. For

these two variables, therefore, forecast errors are measured as differences,

predicted level minus actual level.6

      Including the group averages, about 400 quarterly time series of forecasts

are available for each of the six variables (five series for as many target

quarters per each of the 80 sources). The volume and quality of the data are

such as to permit an intensive study of each of the various aspects of economic

predictions .



     6See Zarnowitz, 1982c, for references to the treatment of level and
change errors.

     7Neglect of data problems explains why some survey evaluations yielded
mixed and partly contradictory results of limited applicability. ( case in
point is the series of surveys of economic forecasters conducted semiannually
since 1947 by Joseph . Livingston, a syndicated financial columnist. See
Carlson, 1977; Pearce, 1979; and Figlewski and Wachtel, 1981). Several
aspects of the surveys are important here: their timing, its consistency and
the effective forecasting spans involved; changes

       This paper is limited to one phase of this large research project, namely

the search for evidence on the extent and locus of those errors that appear to

by "systematic." What are the frequencies and significance of bias and auto—

correlated errors? How do the findings vary for different variables and

predictive horizons? For individual and composite forecasts? What do the

results indicate about the rationality hypothesis as applied to macroeconomic

predictions?

       The next section defines the measures to be used, discusses problems with

the data and presents the evidence on the question of bias in multiperiod pre-

dictions by individuals. Section III addresses the problem of serially depen-

dent residual errors and applies the tests for unbiasedness to group forecasts

from the surveys. Section IV deals with the tests for autocorrelation in the

"knowable" forecast errors. The final section (V) sums up the results and

places them in the context of                earlier       related work.


                          II.      sting for Bias in Multiperiod Predictions

The Pctual and Predicted Values Defined

      Let t = 1,            ...,    n   be the survey quarter during which the forecast is

made and t +          j    be the target quarter to which the forecast refers, where

                                                                           Af

j =   0,   ...,   4       quarters. For any variable,                =          denotes the actual

level in the target period and                         =            denotes the corresponding level

prediction by the th forecaster. Where appropriate, the actual percentage


in composition over time; the role of outliers; and reporting errors.
careful proofreading of the survey questionnaire is needed to detect simple
mistakes of calculation, copying, and typing which chance or neglect will
always occasion in some replies. The voluminous NBER-PSA materials were
submitted to such an audit with the aid of the computer and, where needed,
inspection of the original submissions. although the number of the thus
identified mistakes turned out to be very small in relative terms, failure to
eliminate them would have affected adversely the evaluation of several
individual records.

       The ASA-NBER surveys are taken in the first half of each quarter, at a

time when the most recent data available would be the preliminary estimates for

the preceeding quarter, which are marked                            in (5),8 Consequently, the

P figures for the current quarter (j = 0)                     are authentic ex ante forecasts

whose span is approximately one quarter.

       The "actual' values are not well defined for many economic variables, such

as GNP and components, which are subject to several, often sizable, revisions.

Here they      are represented by the         last data available prior to the benchmark

revisions      of   January 1976 and December 1980. These are presumably the "best"

of those estimates that are conceptually comparable to the corresponding survey

predictions .




       8 exception is the unemployment rate series which is available monthly.
     9This procedure imposes on the forecasters the burden to predict future
revisions that are assumed to remove observational errors. n alternative is
to compare the forecasts with provisional data that are closer to the most
recent figures that were available to the forecaster. The most informative
approach is one that integrates the analysis of data errors and of predictive
errors, which would be a good task for another paper. On the role of prelim—
mary data and revisions in economic measurement and prediction, see Cole,
1969; Howrey, 1978; and Zarnowitz, 1979 and 1982a.

                     (5),

limiriary estimate of the previous level,       (itself a prediction or
etrapolation based on irncomplete data). For j > 0, the base is the forecast
of    the level in the preceding quarter,                            The differences betieen the

successive levels predicted in a multiperiod forecast made at time t,                                           —


           are   implicit predictions of changes over the successive subperiods

covered. Note that each of these marginal ("intraforecast") predictions covers

a single quarterly interval, so the target periods do not overlap. The

predicted changes refer to successive quarters, 0—1, 1—2, ...                                 (In   contrast,

forecasts of average changes over increasing spans, 0—1, 0—2, ...,                                    involve
overlapping target periods and their errors are therefore necessarily

intercorrelated. See Zarnoitz, 1967, pp. 64—70.)


Estimating Regressions of Pctual on Predicted Values

       Regressions of the actual on the predicted values have been computed for

each of the 79 individuals who participated in at least 12 surveys and also for

the series of means of the corresponding predictions (called the group mean

forecasts). For the unemployment rate (UR) and inventory investment (CBI),

levels were used as in

vihile for nominal and real GNP, the price index, and consumer durabLes (GNP,

RGNP, IPD, and CEDG), percentage changes were used as in

       Estimation   of either (6) or (7) requires certain assumptions about the

probability distribution of the disturbances                                 The simplest and most

common approach is to assume that g(u) = 0                    ,

 target quarter. The technique of ordinary least squares (OLS) applies in this

 case. The sample least—squares estimates a and b (the subscripts may now

 be dropped for simplicity) lend themselves to statistical tests of the joint

 null hypotheses that the true (population) parameters of the relation between

    and P are a =    0   and   =   1   •    sufficiently high F   ratio   refutes that

hypothesis, suggesting that the forecast contains some systematic errors.

     However, it is uncertain whether the assumption that the U's are serially

uncorrelated is appropriate in the analytical situation before us. Consider

multiperiod forecasts issued each quarter for a chain of m quarters ahead:

clearly, both the actual and predicted values for the cumulative changes during

the overlapping intervals (0—1, ..., 0—rn) will show autocorrelatjons of, at

least, first to rnth order. But it may be possible to circumvent this

particular problem by focusing on marginal changes over nonoverlapping single—

quarter intervals instead of the average or cumulative changes, as it is done

in this paper. It is also important to note that the individual forecast

series contain gaps whenever a respondent missed any of the surveys (recall

that the criterion for inclusion is a minimum of twelve responses which need

not be consecutive). While such gaps reduce the informational contents of the

data available for estimating the regressions (6) and (7), they also reduce the

probable autocorrelations in the disturbance terms of these equations. It

would clearly be improper to try to replace the missing observations (predic-

tions) by any kind of interpolation, since this would amount to augmenting

authentic forecasts with artifacts. (The worst thing to do, given our purpose

of forecast assessment, would be to use the available actual data to close the

gaps.) Forecasters miss surveys essentially at random because of reporting

problems (Zarnowitz, 1982c), which means that simply dropping the observations
                                       —12—




when    forecasts are not available should be a reasonable procedure which will
cause   a loss of efficiency in the OLS estimates but not bias or inconsistency.

        In sum, this simplest approach to testing for unhiasedness in the regres-

sion framework is arguably justified by the nature of our data and objectives,

besides having the advantage of using the entire set of the more regular fore-

casts at our disposal. Of course, this does not reduce the need to check on

the autocorrelations among the disturbances, which can be caused by various

factors, notably shocks and/or measurement errors in the actual values that are

unanticipated and persist for more than one unit period. In this connection,

it .iill be instructive to pay particular attention to forecast series that have

no gaps such as the series of comprehensive group mean predictions, and to

apply to them the techniques of generalized least—squares (GLS) estimation.


Distributions of the Regression and Test Statistics

        Table 1 presents the evidence from a very large collection of forecasts,

including 790 Pj and 1,560 P.. series. To provide a background of

descriptive statistics, the OLS estimates of the intercepts and slope coeffi-

cients in equations 6 and 7 are summarized in columns 1—4. There is a great

deal of dispersion in these figures, reflecting partly differences in the

ability of the individuals to produce unbiased forecasts and partly differences

in time coverage.

        The means of a.(a) tend to increase with j,       the distance to the

target quarter, at least from QO through Q3, except for RGNP (column 1). In

contrast, the means of      b..(b) typically decrease (column 3). The :tandard

deviations of a1 and             both tend to   rise as the predictive horizon
lengthens (see columns 2    and 4, and note the main irregularities in the SDa

figures    for IPD and the SOb figures for CBI). Hence the relative dispersion
measures for          and       behave quite differently: the SD/a show no

 common pattern of change, while the SDb/b ratios increase strongly from QO to

 Q4, with few exceptions.

      When   the P   ratios   are averaged across comparable regressions for the
 individuals, the resulting mean values     seem low   for all hut   one     of the vari-
 ables covered, ranging from 0.9 to 2.2      and averaging 1.5 with a standard

 deviation of .35 (column 5). For the IPO inflation forecasts, however, the

P values average 3.9 and rise from 2.6 in QO to 4.5 in Q3.

      The impression of a sharp contrast between the predictions of inflation

 and those of other variables is confirmed by the relative frequencies of the

 individual forecast series that failed to pass the joint test for unbiasedness

      0    and 8 = 1) according to the F tests at the 5% significance level

 (column 6) .o For IPD, about half of the computed F ratios exceed the

critical F95 values, whereas for GNP and RGNP the corresponding frequencies

are 12 and 11 percent, for tJR, CEDG, and CBI six to eight percent.

     according to the separate t tests for regression intercepts arid slopes,

which also use the significance level of 5%, the incidence of           o.     0 is much
higher for IPD than for GNP, while the incidence of 8          1     is similar for the

two variables (columns 7 and 8).h1 These tests suggest that the poor overall

results for the inflation forecasts, as evidenced by the F ratios, are

associated to a larger extent with the deviations of           from zero than with

the deviations of 8 from unity. The               tests are also relatively

unfavorable to he inventory investment (CBI) forecasts, but for the real

null hypothesis is true, the test statistic should have an F distribution
with two degrees of freedom in the numerator and n—2 in the denominator
(where ri,  the number of observations varies across the individuals).

     11The appropriate tests are two—tailed. If the null hypothesis holds,
the test statistic should follow the t distribution with n—2 degrees of
freedom.

growth and consumer durables (RGNP and CEDG) forecasts it is the results of the

    tests that wpear to be more damaging.

    The Lest results do not show a common pattern of systematic dependence on

the time horizon j.   Thus for IP1) the frequencies of significant F    and   t


ratios increase sharply between Q0 and Q2 or Q3, but   those   of the   ratios do

not (columns 6-8). The frequencies for tJR generally tend to rise, those for

CEDG and, particularly, CBI tend to decline as the target quarter recedes into

the future. The figures for the other variables show on the whole smaller or

more irregular fluctuations.


The Effects of Sample Size

     Although broadly based and rich in comparison with the few small samples

used in most studies of economic forecasts, our data also have some important

limitations that need to he recognized. The forecast series are numerous but

inevitably much shorter than would he desirable, since our surveys began in

1968 only. The minimum requirement of participation in at least twelve surveys

improves the data by eliminating the occasional respondents and the shortest

series.12 As a result, the distributions of the admitted forecast sets are

skewed toward the longer series. But the average number of observations per

series is still no more than 23, with a standard deviation of 8.

     The conventional 1% and 5% significance levels imply low (.01 and .05)

probabilities of wrongly rejecting the null hypothesis H0 when it is true hut

also high complementary (.99 and .95) probabilities of wrongly accepting H0

when it is false. For small sample sizes, therefore, these tests have very low



     12There are a few exceptions where a series contains less than twelve
observations. These refer to the longer horizons and arise because some fore-
casters occasionally predicted fewer than four luarters ahead. Thus of the
         series for GNP, 16 (4%) have 10 or 11 observations each, all but four
of them for Q4.   (The count is very similar for each of the other variables.)
                                        —17—




power against the alternative composibe hypothesis which is merely a negation

of H0 (i.e., Hi: .        0,     1). This raises a serious question about the

meaning of the test results in such cases.13

     A simple experiment strikingly illustrates the importance of the sample

size in this context. The frequencies of the F ratios that are significant

at the 5% level are throughout very much lower for the forecasters who partici-

pated in 12 to 19 surveys than for those who participated in 20 or more surveys

(Table 1, columns 9 and 10). Indeed, the proportions for the first subset,

F(s), are typically zero or less than five percent and average 1.9, except for

IPI) where they range between 9 and 24 percent and average 17.1. In contrast,

the proportions for the second subset F(.Q), are concentrated between 10 and 25

percent and average 14.4, except again for IPD where they range between 38 and

98 percent, and average 76.0! Clearly, had only the shorter series been at our

disposal, they would have led us to an overly favorable appraisal of the fore-

casts, though not without a correct warning about the relatively high incidence

of bias in the predictions of inflation. It should be noted that the predic-

tions of both groups of forecasters, those with the shorter Cs) and those with

the longer ()   series,   are spread about equally across the 1968-79 period, so

that the large discrepancies between the reported results for F (s) and

F(.Z) cannot be attributed to differences in the periods covered.14



          shown in Zeilner, 1979, several issues arise in analyzing regression
hypotheses, notably the asymmetric treatment of H0 and        in classical
tests, the associated uncertainty about the choice of significance levels that
are appropriate for different sample sizes, and the "sharpness" of null hypoth-
eses. Although the problems are well known in principle, they are seldom given
much attention in textbooks and are almost habitually disregarded in applied
economic and econometric literature.

     14The shorter series number 31—33, the longer series 44—46, depending on
the variable covered (see Table 1, note b for more detail). For the 42 surveys
of 1968:4—1979:1, the mean (standard deviation) of the participation numbers is
43 (9); for the two subsets of 21 surveys each, 1968:4—1973:4 and 1974:1—1979:1,
                                                 —18—




       To increase power, higher significance levels may be employed. Table 2

shows that the F(s) frequencies at tile 10% level exceed their counterparts at

the 5% level by factors ranging from 3 to 14.                   In   contrast, the F(s) frequen-

cies   at tile 1% level are all zero, misleadingly suggesting that no bias at all

exists in this group of relatively short forecast series (cf. columns                           2, 5, and
8).    For tile longer series, however, the decision to use 10% instead of 5% as

the significances level would have made little difference in our conclusions,

and even at the 1% level the negative results on the inflation forecasts are

very evident in the F(9.) entries (columns 3, 6, and 9). F)r the total

sample,    too, the high incidence of bias in the IPD predictions stands out

everywhere, hut here the comparisons are much less favorable to the other vari-

ables at the 10% than at the lower significance levels (columns 1, 4, and 7).

est to compare the confidence regions for selected "short" and "long" series of


the corresponding figures are 48 (8) and 38 (8), respectively. Thus some attri-
tion occurred in the number of forecasters per survey. However, its effect was
about the same for the two groups of forecasters: for set s, the proportion of
observations in the earlier period is 0.61, for set I, it is 0.64.

forecasts from our collection and observe how they vary with the choice of g

and relative to the (0, 1) point of the null hypothesis.

        For purposes of illustration, two forecasters were chosen, one coded "8"

who participated in 13 consecutive surveys, 1972:1—1975:1, the other "48' whose

record includes 33 consecutive surveys, 1963:4—1976:4. Using their QO fore-

casts of inflation arid real growth, Chart 1 demonstrates the strong dependence

of the results on the sample size. For either variable, the ellipses for the

shorter series are much larger than those for the longer series (about twice as

long and twice as wide as measured by the major and minor axes). Had space

been available for more such comparisons, they would generally confirm the

large gains in the precision of numerical statements that can thus be derived

for the longer forecast series.

       The concentric ellipses associated with the confidence coefficients of

.99, .95, and .90 (which correspond to the significance levels of 1%, 5%, and

10% in our tests of H0:         =   0,   =   1)   are close to each other for the longer

series, spaced more widely apart for the short ones. although understandably

motivated by the wish to reduce the probability of type I errors, the use of

high g values in analyzing small sets of predictions can be quite costly in

terms of the lack of precision implied by large confidence regions.

       The high incidence of bias in the inflation forecasts is on the whole re-

affirmed by this analysis, as exemplified by the IPD graphs in Chart 1. Here

the (0, 1) points are located very near the boundaries of the confidence regions

for    both   forecasters: within the ellipses for the 1%     level   of significance but

barely    inside or outside those for the 5% and 10% levels. In contrast, (0, 1)

short series #s.15

     That the confidence ellipses in Chart 1 have downward sloping major axes

indicates that a and h are negatively correlated, which simply reflects the

fact that the mean values of the forecasts are positive.16


Mean Errors

     The tests summarized in Tables 1 and 2 suggest the presence of certain

systematic errors in some of the forecasts. An analysis of the distributions

of the mean errors of the forecasts helps to identify the probable nature of

such errors.

     A tendency toward underestimation of change has long been observed in a

great variety of forecasts; it is consistent with rational expectations, hut it

also can arise in biased predictions. Table 3 shows that almost all fore-

casters underestimated inflation, and did so increasingly for the more distant

future. In contrast, real growth as measured by the rates of change in RGNP

was predominantly overestimated in this period of an unexpected deterioration

in both inflation and the cyclical business performance. On the average, these

overestimates rise steadily with the predictive horizon. The underestimates of

the price component and the overestimates of the quantity component tend to

     aThe errors are defined as predicted minus actual value, so minus (plus)
signs are associated with under (over) estimates. For GNP, IPD, and CEDG, the
mean error is computed in percentage change terms as P.. - A..                                     ;     for   tJR   and
CBI, it is comouted in terms of levels as                            P. —   A.     ,    for any th individual

standard deviations are within the parentheses.

     bThe percentage of individual forecasters with mean errors that are negative
(positive) is shown without (within) the parentheses. The number of individuals
covered is 75 for CEDG, 79 for each of the other variables (all forecasters who
participated in at least 12 quarterly ASA—NBER surveys in the period 1968:4—
1979:1)

very small throughout (cf. columns 1-3). Underpredictions prevail for the

unemployment rate in Q2—Q4 (consistent with the overprediction of real growth)

and for business inventory investment, while the record for the rates of change

in   consumer durables is more mixed (columns 4-6)

               III.   Allowing   for   Serially Dependent Residual Errors

iutocorrelated   Disturbances and Bias in Individual Forecasts

       Tests for serial correlations among the regression residuals

(eqs. 6 and 7) have been made for all those series in our collection that

consist of at least 13 observations and contain no gaps. These data refer to

the forecasts by 18-20 individuals (the number varies somewhat depending on the

target) who participated in more than 12 consecutive surveys. The noncon—

secutive predictions by the same forecasters are omitted. The series number

452, vary in length from 13 to 33 and average 19 quarters, and cover Q0—93 (the

samples for Q4, which are smaller, are not included).

       For each of the thus obtained residual error (ut) series, serial corre-

lation coefficients        are computed for k         1, ...,   6.   (Since many of the

available series are short, only the first six coefficients are considered.)

On the assumption of homoscedasticity, these measures are defined as


                                  =    cov(u, 1k)/var(u)

       The Box-Pierce statistic Q serves as a convenient test for the presence

of autocorrelation in such sets of the 's .           In   the present context, it is

calculated by
                                             —25—




(10)                      Q = n(n   +   2)          (n —   k)1

which is approximately distributed as chi—square with six degrees of freedom.17

       1ost of the Q statistics computed for the inflation and unemployment

forecasts are found to be statistically significant at the 5% and 10% levels,

and the frequencies are particularly high for IPD (see Table 4, columns 1—4).

In contrast, only about one—sixth of the F                 tests   for RGNP produces similar

results, and the frequencies for CEDG are not much higher. according to these

figures, then, the incidence of autocorrelated residual errors, varies greatly

across the variables covered.18

       We next match up for each individual the results of the Q tests with those

of the previously discussed F   tests        and show the percentage distribution of the

forecasts according to the significance (at the 10% level) of both statistics

(Table 4, columns 5-8). Because the F           tests      are based on larger samples that

include nonconsecutive observations for the same forecasters, the measures

underlying this cross-tabulation are not strictly comparable, hut the broad

indications obtained are deemed to be meaningful and of sufficient interest.19




     17If the errors formed random uncorrelated sequences, the       would
themselves be uncorrelated with variances equal to (n - k)/n(n + 2). For
large values of n and relatively small m, the variances approximate 1/n
and '7 = n          x     In view of the small size of the available samples, it
seemed advisable to avoid these common approximations. See Box and Pierce, 1970.

     18The frequencies of significant Q 's increase from QO to Q3 for IPD, UR,
and CEl, hut appear to be unrelated to the predictive horizon for the other
variables.

     19Given the nature of the available data, few alternatives to the adopted
procedures were perceived and none seemed preferable in terms of the prospec—
tive costs and returns.

      Serial correlation in the error terms u may bias upward the F statis-

 tics, causing them wrongly to reject the null hypothesis. ut cases in which

 both Q and F are significant represent only four to eight percent of our

observations for GNP, RGNP, CEDG, and CBI, and 14 percent for OR (column 5).

Once more, the situation is entirely different for IPD, where such cases account

for as much as 66 percent of the forecasts. Except for IPI) and OR, the F's

clearly are more likely to be significant when the F's are not (cf. columns 5

and 7). Often, too, the Q's are significant while the F's are not; this is

so in particular for GNP, OR, and CEDG (column 6). Finally, except for IPD,

tests which find neither Q nor F to he significant are very frequent,

adding up to more than half of the observations (column 8).


OLS Estimates and Tests for the Group Mean Forecasts

     Consider now the overall group forecasts, that is, series of means of the

corresponding predictions by all individuals included in this study. For each

of our thirty target categories (6 variables x 5 horizons), actual values are

regressed on these composite forecasts by means of ordinary least squares.

Table 5 shows that the results vary greatly for the different targets. The

absolute values of the regression intercepts JaJ often increase with the

predictive horizon, while the signs of these estimates are about equally mixed

(column 1) .   All   of the slope coefficients (b) are positive but they other-

wise display no common regularities (column 2). For example, the b's tend to

be smaller than 1 .0 and declining with the horizon for IPD and OR, larger than

1.0 and rising with the horizon for RGNP and CBI.

     For GNP, the values of a do not deviate significantly from zero and the

values of h from unity, according to the F and t ratios (columns 3-5)

In contrast, the F tests strongly reject H0: (, ) = (0, 1) for the infla-

tion (IPD) forecasts, particularly in the more distant quarters, and the   t

statistics suggest that this is attributable mainly to               >   0.     The estimates

for UR show a striking dependence on the..hotidn but bias is here strongly indi-

cated in the longest forecasts only. Elsewhere, on           the   contrary, it is the

short predictions (QO ad Qi for RGNP and CBI, QO for CEDG)               that    are apparently

biased, which could be due to measurement errors in estimating the base of the

forecast. Here the t ratios oftensige't inefficiency in the sense of                       >    1.

     As background information, Table 5.includes statistics on the goodness of

fit (r2), the dispersion of the errors assódiated with the regression line

(SER), and the means and standard deviafi5n&of the series of realizations

(columns 6, 8-10). These measures are more relevant in evaluating aspects of

accuracy rather than rationality of the forecasts, and some of them are treated

elsewhere.20 But    it   is interesting to observ that the incidence of bias does

not appear to he systematically related to either the relative accuracy of the

forecasts or the   relative    smoothness of the target series. Thus, the percent-

age changes in GNP   are     far more olati],.e than .e levels of the unemployment

rate, which helps to explain why thei coefficients are '=o much higher for

the latter (compare the corresponding entries in columns 6, 9, 10), hut the

F and t tests are much more favorable to GNthan to UR. There are strong

indications of bias in the forecasts of IPD1[ilation and none in those of the

rates of change in CEDG beyond QO, but the reive

biased are indeed relatively accurate (notably for UR but also the short pre-

dictions of IPD, RGNP, and CBI).

       The mean square error of a series of forecasts (say, any of the overall

group   mean forecasts P)       can be viewed as a sum of the mean component, slope

component, and residual variance defined as

       Reflecting the favorable results of the bias tests, RV accounts for more

than 90% of M for GNP, tJR, and CEDG. The MC estimates are 6% or less, with

the important exception of IPD inflation, where they rise from 15 to 45% be-

tween QO and Q4. The Sc proportions are relatively high for the shortest pre-

dictions of RGNP and CBI which are very sensitive to errors in the jump-off

estimates; elsewhere they average 2-5% only.

       The Durbin—Watson (DW) statistics listed in Table 5, column 7, suggest

that the residual disturbances froe the regressions of actual on                predicted

values for GNP, RGNP, and CEDG are essentially free of first—order serial cor-

relations when 5% significance points are used. On the other hand, the DW

tests for IPO and UR    indicate   strongly the presence of positively autocorre—

lated residuals, and most of the results for CEI point with less force in the

same direction.

        The well—known property of positively autocorrelated residuals is to bias

downward the SER and upward the          values (while leaving the OLS regression

estimators unbiased and consistent). The loss of efficiency—--underestimation

of sampling variances of the regression coefficients-—may in some cases invali-

date the results of our tests, which motivates the next step in this analysis.


Putoregressive Errors and GLS Estimates

        Table 6 presents estimates of the parameters in linear regression models

with autoregressive errors of the general form

     22The procedure used is UT0REG, see SAS/ETS User's Guide, 1980 edition,
pp. 8.1—8.7. AUTOREG first estimates the OLS regressions, computes the auto—
correlations of the resulting residuals, and uses the Yule—Walker equations to
estimate the p's. Then the variables from the original data are transformed
by the autoregressive model and new estimates of the regression parameters
(here a and b) are obtained by an OLS regression using the transformed
data. The procedure thus yields generalized least squares (GLS) estimates.
It is not applicable to data with missing values, hence the exclusion of Q4
from Table 6.

      For GNP, none of the estimates of the autoregressive parameters p. are
significant, confirming the absence of serial correlation among the residuals

from the OLS regressions. Not surprisingly, then, all the statistics in Table

6, lines 1—3, resemble closely their counterparts in Table 5, lines 2_4.23 The

GLS and OLS estimates also show no significant differences for the forecasts of

RGNP in 22 and and 93    and those of CEDG in Q1-Q3 (all cases in which there is

no clear evidence of serially correlated u's).

      There is no doubt about the presence of first—order autocorrelations in

the error terms of the OLS regressions for inflation and inventory investment,

and here the GLS estimation results in large reductions of the test statistics.

The F ratios for IPD in Table 6 are much smaller than their counterparts in

Table 5 but still significant at the 10% level.

       Finally, there is no visible improvement in the cases of RGNP-Q1 and EJR—

93,   where the F    and t   ratios in Table 6 are indeed larger than the corre-

sponding entries in Table 5. It should be noted that the high values of

      and 2 indicate the presence of a second—order autoregressive process in

the   error   terms of the OLS regressions for the unemployment rate in Q2 and 93.


                  IV. Testing for Autocorrelation in Forecast Errors

Framework of .nalysis and Results for Individual Forecasts
       The actual values employed in the previous section include all the noncon—
ceptual (prebenchmark) revisions in the data. These revisions presumably bring
the data closer to the "true' values that one would like to have predicted.
But ft is important to    recognize that such data, and hence the estimates




     23Output from the initial OLS part of AUTOREG is identical with the
output of the TSP program that was used to generate the corresponding
estimates in Table 5 at least up to four decimal places.
                                             —35—



derived from them are all ex post in nature. The residual errors from our

regressions could not have been known to the forecasters on the current basis.

The requirement that such errors be free of serial correlation is therefore not

a   straightforward test of rationality in the sense of             efficient use of contem—

poraneous information.24
        The following tests allow for this problem by         using series of      errors meas-
ured as actual differences between past predictions and realizations, the
latter    being based exclusively on data        that were available to participants in
the    successive surveys. The underlying argument is that the forecasters could

and should have used this information so as to exploit and thereby eliminate as

systematic elements in it. However, it must be noted that keeping trackof the

many successive revisions in complex data, particularly the quarterly national

income and product accounts, is not a small or low—cost operation in which

forecasters can    be    expected to engage routinely. The analysis that follows

required creation of a comprehensive computer file of successive vintages of

the    data covered.25
        Drawing upon that record to obtain the cx ante forecast errors as defined
above, we next use these errors in      autocorrelation functions of            the general

form


(13)                     e. =            —   k      ,   k = j +1,    ...,   m




Here    e÷ represents the error of forecast nade at time t for the ith
target quarter and            is the sample autocorrelation coefficients for the lag


     24Thjs is not to deny its validity as a criterion of statistical cx post
assessments of the properties of the forecasts. The tests reported earlier in
this paper can all be viewed as being of this nature.

        251 am very much indebted to Louis Lambros for the accomplishment of this
task.

k. The omission of         for k    j   reflects the fact that the information

available at time t includes the errors of past predictions through the

previous quarter Ct — 1)    hut does not include the errors of the current pre-

dictions for t +    j.26
       The aitocorrelation functions (13) are computed for the errors in fore-

casts of those individuals who participated in more than 12 consecutive

surveys, the same sample as that used before in the context of Table 4. Given

these data, it seemed best to set k = 6        and again to use j = 0,   ...,   3

(excluding Q4). The Box—Pierce statistic is then calculated by


(14)                          = n(n + 2)       (n —


which is approximately distributed as chi-square, with 6 —      j   degrees of

freedom.

       Table 7 shows that the averages of the calculated        valies for the

forecasts of GNP, RGNP, and CEDG decline systematically and strongly with the

increase in the predictive horizon (column 2). 'The corresponding standard

deviations show the same tendency hut remain large in relative terms (column

3). For IPD, LJR, and CBI, the mean values of Q are generally high and there

is rio evidence of any regular dependence of the distributions of the Q values

on the distance to the target quarter.

       The critical 10 percent level is widely used in practice as a cutoff for

the Q test, and on this criterion most of the error series in most of the

covered categories would pass the joint hypothesis that all of the examined



     26For example, the errors of the QO forecasts will not be known until a
quarter later, hence they are not yet available to the forecasts for Qi, Q2,
and Q3, which are all made at the same time as those for QO. The lack of cur-
rent knowledge, then, impedes the elimination of significant autocorrelations
for k where k j. This argument applies here specifically to             for
Q1, Q2, and Q3; 2 for Q2 and Q3; and 23 for Q3.

autocorrelation coefficients are zero. The tests for RGNP and CEDG are the

most favorable in this regard (see columns 4—6 and the summary in Table 7).

However, two—thirds of the series for IPD and half of those for CHI have

statistics that are significant at the 10% level. The frequencies of autocor—

related errors are also large for the short forecasts of GNP and the long

forecasts of UR. Thus many forecasters appear to have failed to treat their

own past errors efficiently as data to learn from, for one reason or another

(inconsistent or deficient information, models, and judgments, surprisingly

large and frequent disturbances).

     it should be noted that these chi—square tests are neither strong nor

direct.27 An additional test is performed by inspecting all individual

coefficients to see how many of them fall outside of the range of two standard

deviations from zero. The results, listed in the last column of Table 7, agree

generally well with our earlier conclusions.

Evidence from the Group Mean Forecasts

     Table 8 presents sample estimates of the autocorrelation functions (eq. 13)

for the errors in the ASA—NBER group mean forecasts. If the error series, each

of which contains 42 observations, were white noise, the standard deviation of

    would be approximately 0.154. Of the 108 entries in columns 1—6 of the

table, 82 are smaller than 0.154 in absolute value; 22 fall between 0.154 and

0.301; and only four exceed 0.301, that is, are outside the range of     s.d.

from the mean zero. Inflation forecasts account for eight of the observations

in the second and all four observations in the third group.




      27For example, a value of Q below the 10% level indicates a probability
of less than 90 percent that the hypothesis that the errors are not white
noise is  true. For more detail and examples, see Pindyck and Rubtnfeld, 1981,
pp. 549—550.

         Not surprisingly, the Q statistics are definitely significant for the

 IPD errors, but the same does not apply to the other series, where they      are
 actually rather small, with only a few exceptions (column 7). In several

 cases, the calculated Q's decline between QO and Q3, notably so for GNP and

 CEDG.

         There is no ind.ication that the absolute values Jk are
                                                                   Systematically
 related to the lag k.     In particular, they do not tend to decline as k rises
 (for IPD the        values, all negative, are particularly large). It is not

 clear that autocorrelations of higher order among the errors of these composite

 forecast series deserve much attention, but it certainly cannot be assumed that

all or even most of them are zero.28


                            V. Summary and    Conclusions

4ain Results

     1. The hypothesis that the regressions of actual on predicted values have

zero intercepts and unitary slopes is rejected at the 5% significance level for

362 of the 2,350 forecast series examined (15.4%). Nearly   half   of these

rejections refer to the inflation (IPD) forecasts, where they account for 44.3%

of the regressions. The combined result for the otehr five variables is 187

rejections, or 9.6% of the 1,955 trials. I conclude that these weak tests of

rationality are quite unfavorable to expectations of inflation, while showing

other forecasts generally in much better light.




     28In an earlier study based on ex post errors in the group mean forecasts
and using as many as twelve autocorrelation lags, some of the k coefficients
for k of 8, 9, and 10 quarters were found to be large and significant (see
Zarnowitz, 1982b, Table 9 and text). However, one would expect the autocorro—
lations to he on the whole lower for the errors that are knowable ex ante than
for the ex post errors, and the evidence we have tends to he
                                                             consistent with
that expectation.

attitudes of the University of Michigan Institute for Social Research (ISR).

These questions have dealt mainly with the direction, not the size, of the

expected price changes and they were altered repeatedly over the period, so

that here the creation of a group forecast series requires a rather elaborate

ex post procedure of quantitifying qualitative responses. Some of the studies

find that the unbiasedness hypothesis cannot be rejected for the ISR data,

others merely that it is "not so decisively rejected" as the inflation fore-.

casts by economists and business executives.29

     The regressions of actual on predicted inflation have also been found to

produce serially correlated residuals, which some of the studies interpret as

another departure from rationality. But the correctness of this view depends

on the (generally unexamined) extent to which the calculated regression error

terms constitute information knowable at the time of the forecast.

     Tests for the joint null hypothesis of unbiasedness based on both OLS and

GLS regression estimates are applied in McNees, 1978, to IPD, RGNP, and UR

forecasts from three well-known econometric service bureaus, Chase, DRI, and

Wharton. The periods covered are short, 51/2 or 6 years beginning in 1970:2,

so the power of these tests is low, and the results are in part difficult to

rationalize. For the rnultiperiod forecasts of inflation, the F statistics are

generally significant but much higher for the GLS than the OLS estimates. For

real growth, the situation is reversed and the null hypothesis is consistently



      29For a comprehensive d1SCUSSLOn of rationality tests with applications to
 the ISR data, see Huizinga, 1980; also Juster, 1979; Curtin, 1982; and Gramlich,
 as quoted. Business forecasts of price changes for goods and services sold and
 capital goods purchased come from the plant and equipment surveys of the Bureau
 of Economic Analysis, U. S. Department of Commerce; they have been examined by
 deLeeuw and McKelvey, 1981, and fail to pass the F test for unbiasedness
 decisively in 1970—80 as noted by Gramlich. Papadia, 1982, has applied the
• tests for aggregate results from consumer surveys conducted three times a year
 since 1973 or 1974 in seven EEC countries; he finds that the hypothesis of
 unbiasedness can be rejected in about half of the cases.

accepted for predictions over more than one quarter when GLS is used. The

results for UR are quite mixed, with indications of bias in the predictions of

cimulative change over the four—quarter span hut not in the one—quartar ahead

forecas t.s.

      The first half of the 1970's was clearly among the most trying times for

the forecasters generally (see Zarnowitz, 1979). But this is not to say that

the forecast period somehow explains or excuses the observed failures of the

forecasts to avoid bias and inefficiency. 7fter all, it is precisely in times

of highly variable inflation and real growth rates that the incentives to use

data and predict efficiently are especially high. i4oreover, as suggested by

the present study, much of the variation among the forecasts is attributable to

differences between the sources, models, variables, and horizons involved; it

simply cannot be explained by differences in the periods covered.
