                                               ABSTRACT

Using novel survey data on technology licensing, we report the first empirical evidence linking the
three main sources of failure emphasized in the market design literature (lack of market thickness,
congestion, lack of market safety) to deal outcomes. We disaggregate the licensing process into three
stages and find that although lack of market thickness and deal failure are correlated in the first stage,
they are not in the latter stages, underscoring the bilateral monopoly conditions under which negotiations
over intellectual property often occur. In contrast, market safety is only salient in the final stage. Several
commonly referenced bargaining frictions (congestion) are salient, particularly in the second stage.
Also, universities and firms differ in the stage during which they are most likely to experience deal
failure.

1         Introduction

Many innovative firms face the strategy decision of whether to engage in the ideas market
(e.g., licensing out their innovation) or to compete downstream in the product market (Teece,
1986; Gans and Stern, 2010). The ideas market is playing an expanding role in economic
growth and the diffusion of knowledge. Its size has increased by more than three times be-
tween 1995 and 2002 in terms of transaction value (Arora and Gambardella, 2010). Robbins
(2006) estimates domestic income from licensing intellectual property (IP) in the United
States was approximately $50 billion in 2002, and Arora and Gambardella (2010) estimate
the global market for technology was about $100 billion in the same year.1 In addition to
the potentially high social and private gains to trade, a well-functioning market for ideas
can facilitate vertical specialization; for example, many biotechnology firms specialize in up-
stream idea production and sell them downstream to pharmaceutical firms that specialize in
marketing and distribution. Furthermore, a well-functioning ideas market can improve the
efficiency of resource allocation decisions and direct R&D effort through pricing information
in contrast to in-house allocation decisions made by fiat.
        However, growing anecdotal evidence suggests the market for ideas is prone to failure.
In other words, many potentially surplus-enhancing transactions fail to occur. In terms
of scale, Rivette and Klein (2000) claim “a staggering $1 trillion in [ignored] intellectual
property asset wealth” is foregone in the U.S. We present survey data where a quarter of the
firms claim they are likely to license less than 50% of their potentially licenceable inventory
of IP. To explain this phenomenon, economists and management scholars have identified
various information asymmetry problems, such as Arrow’s Paradox (Arrow, 1962), moral
hazard (Arora, 1996), and hold-up problems (Pisano, 1991), that are often associated with
    1
     Both Robbins (2006) and Arora and Gambardella (2001) assume the proportion of technology licensing,
as opposed to licensing of trademarks, copyrights, and packaged software, is the same as that in cross-border
transactions, which implies licensing of industrial processes amounts to $66 billion. Of this, around $50
billion is earned domestically. Arora and Gambardella (2010) assume the US accounts for 60% of the global
market for technology, which implies the global market for technology in 2002 was about $100 billion.

technology licensing.
   Moreover, given the economic significance of the market for ideas, it is perhaps surprising
we know relatively little about how it functions. In traditional markets, we typically evaluate
transactions based on information on prices and quantities in competitive settings. However,
with a few exceptions on university licensing, data in the ideas market is generally quite
poor. Furthermore, it is unclear what should be the appropriate benchmark used to evaluate
technology transactions.
   The market design literature (Roth, 2007, 2008) identifies three primary market fea-
tures associated with efficient market operation: 1) market thickness (buyers and sellers
have opportunities to trade with a wide range of potential transactors), 2) non-congestion
(transaction speed is sufficiently rapid to ensure market clearing but slow enough to allow
participants to seek alternatives), and 3) market safety (agents do not have incentives for
misrepresentation or strategic action that undermines the ability of others to evaluate po-
tential trades). Gans and Stern (2010) consider well-established economic properties of the
technology sector in the context of these market design principles and conclude that licensing
is particularly susceptible to market failure since these three features are often lacking.
   For the first time, to our knowledge, we bring licensing data to shed light on sources of
deal failure in the ideas market in the context of the Roth (2007, 2008) and Gans and Stern
(2010) frameworks (hereafter, RGS). Furthermore, we divide the licensing process into three
stages - 1) identifying a buyer/seller, 2) initiating negotiations, and 3) reaching an agreement
- which enables us to better describe when the relationship between each of the market design
features and deal failure is most salient. We find market thickness is salient only in the first
stage; identifying a licensee is harder when the market is thin. Perhaps more surprising is that
market thickness is not correlated with deal success in the two latter stages. This underscores
the bilateral monopoly conditions under which licensing negotiations often occur (Anton and
Yao, 1994; Gans and Stern, 2000). Market safety, on the other hand, is only correlated with
deal success in the final stage of reaching an agreement. We speculate this may be due to the

                                               3
dynamics of legal due diligence. Bargaining frictions, our operationalization of “congestion,”
are correlated with deal failure in the (second) negotiation stage. In particular, we find the
firms most likely to fail to initiate negotiations are the ones with higher perceived costs of
due diligence. This may be because they have less experience or in-house capability and thus
a higher marginal cost to carry out due diligence.
   We also examine how organization type (universities versus firms) and industry type
(Healthcare versus Software & Electronics) mediates the relationship between market fea-
tures and deal failure. Universities are more likely to experience deal failure in the first stage
of the licensing process, perhaps due to the embryonic nature of their inventions (Jensen and
Thursby, 2001). However, they are less likely to experience deal failure in the final stage of
the process, perhaps due to the incentives faced by technology transfer offices and faculty
(Lach and Schankerman, 2008; Thursby and Thursby, 2002). We also find in the final stage
healthcare firms are more harmed than IT firms by a lack of market safety, perhaps because
IT firms rely less on formal patent protection and more on rapid innovation and versioning.
   Overall, we offer three contributions in this paper. First, we provide the first empirical
evidence (correlations) relating market features to deal outcomes in the context of licensing,
exploiting firm-level variation in market features and deal success. We cannot make causal
claims concerning how a specific feature, such as lack of market thickness, causes deal fail-
ure since our data is cross-sectional and also based on perception rather than action (survey
data). Nevertheless, our correlations offer evidence consistent with the causal mechanisms
suggested by theory, and the provision of these basic empirical facts stand in contrast to the
general paucity of data on licensing in general and on deal failures in particular. In terms
of prior research, other papers have focused on how certain factors, such as the presence
of multiple technology holders (Fosfuri, 2006), patent effectiveness (Arora and Ceccagnoli,
2006), and institutional prestige (Sine, Shane, and Di Gregorio, 2003), affect a firm’s propen-
sity to license. However, these papers do not empirically examine the relationship between
the three main market features highlighted in the market design literature and the rate of

                                                4
deal success. Anand and Khanna (2000) provide one of the few econometric investigations
into the rate of licensing. However, their study is aggregated at the sector level; they do not
examine firm-level differences in licensing rates.
    Our second contribution is that we identify three distinct stages in the licensing process
based on expert interviews and then use this disaggregation of the process to describe vari-
ation in the timing of when each market feature is most relevant. Finally, we show how
the relationship between market features and deal failure is mediated by organization type
(universities versus firms) and industry type (Healthcare versus Software & Electronics) in
ways that can be explained by their economic properties.



2     Stages of the Licensing Process

We categorize licensing activities into three discrete stages based on interviews with experts
at LES: 1) identifying a buyer/seller, 2) initiating negotiations, and 3) reaching an agree-
ment. Each of these stages is itself complex. For example, with respect to the second stage,
in advance of a negotiation, a party may spend many months defining business objectives,
assessing leverage, researching the other party, deciding positions on key terms, and protect-
ing intellectual property (IP), among other tasks. In addition, each negotiating party needs
to decide on its legal counsel and which parties to bring to the table (WIPO, 2004). Even so,
we believe dividing the process into the three stages provides significant insights. Thus, we
present a loose theoretical explanation of how various market features may come into play
at different stages of the licensing transaction. While our intention is to provide a useful and
illustrative framework for thinking about discrete elements of the licensing process, what
follows is neither exhaustive nor rigorous.
    Stage 1: Identifying a buyer/seller A market is thick if it brings together a large enough
proportion of potential transactors at the same time (Roth, 2007, 2008). If the market is thin,
a natural implication is, all else equal, the likelihood of finding potential buyers or sellers is


                                                5
lower. Anecdotal evidence suggests finding a potential licensor or a licensee largely relies on
old-fashioned word-of-mouth networking and research (Licensing Executives Society, 2009).
“Individuals may not know about particular needs or know the right individuals to contact
... Because that process relies heavily on personal networking, it may take up to 18 months
(or more) to find a buyer and to negotiate a deal” (Yet2.com).2 Given that the first stage
of the licensing process we examine is related to finding potential parties to transact with,
it is straightforward to show thickness is likely an important market feature in the first
stage. Whether market thickness plays a role in latter stages depends on the degree to
which competition can influence negotiations. Gans and Stern (2010) suggest the influence
of potential outside parties is limited because the value of the idea declines when the seller
negotiates with multiple buyers.
      Stage 2: Initiating negotiations Early in the bargaining process, the main transaction
cost stems from acquiring sufficient information about the deal. Given the heterogeneity of
ideas for sale, one of the main challenges that arises is the cost of conducting due diligence
on the “fair” price to pay for the technology and evaluating its potential market prospects.
This process is often lengthy and expensive. It typically involves both parties signing non-
disclosure agreements and gathering public and private data to evaluate the technology, the
IP, and various terms of the contract. Whereas licensing a tangible object, such as a house,
also faces substantial heterogeneity in the products available, it is relatively straightforward
to assess the relevant attributes of the product because many comparable transactions are on
the market. In contrast, substantial information asymmetry exists when licensing technology.
Furthermore, licensing is typically conducted on a bilateral basis, which means both parties
agree to limit contact with other potential buyers and sellers for a certain amount of time.
While a seller can conduct due diligence on the buyer by examining the kinds of products
it has brought to the marketplace and how successful they have been (Licensing Executives
Society, 2009), both parties cannot fully assess outside alternatives due to bilateral secrecy, so

                                                      6
there is often significant uncertainty regarding the “fair” price for an idea of a given quality.
Indeed, Lemley and Myhrvold (2008) label the market for patents as “blind.” “Want to
know if you are getting a good deal on a patent license or technology acquisition? Too bad”
(Lemley and Myhrvold, 2008). Given the cost and difficulty of conducting due diligence
on an IP deal in a bilateral environment, many prospective buyers and sellers are reluctant
to start substantive negotiations and are often slow to enter into an agreement (Licensing
Executives Society, 2009). Not surprisingly, some buyers purchase an option, or an exclusive
right, to assess the idea before starting negotiations. Otherwise, the only viable option in a
bilateral environment is to start negotiations in good faith.
   Later in the bargaining process, the main transaction cost stems from contracting prob-
lems and opportunism. Once negotiations begin, a variety of contracting problems can arise
that may lead to negotiation breakdown. As a result of bounded rationality, both parties
cannot foresee all the contingencies that might arise and incorporate them into the contract
(Williamson, 1999). In particular, disagreements over financial and non-financial terms of
the deal, such as the scope of the IP, can lead to bargaining breakdown. Having multiple
parties at the negotiating table can also hold-up the deal and delay reaching an agreement.
Standard setting committees (e.g., patent pools) are examples where multiple parties act
in concert for the purpose of standard setting. However, participants in standard setting
organizations (SSOs) often have private agendas, which may cause a delay in reaching a
consensus (Simcoe, 2008). On the flip side, deals may break down if one or more parties find
better alternatives, or deals may expire if both parties cannot reach an agreement in time.
Even though offers may be left open for less time to encourage reaching an agreement, such
exploding offers can result in inefficient “matches” or deal failure if the offer expires. These
different transaction costs arising from the bargaining process capture the key dimensions of
congestion as described by RGS.
   Stage 3: Reaching an agreement In the last stage of the licensing process where substan-
tive negotiations have started, important details regarding the technology are revealed to all

                                               7
parties. The paradox of disclosure becomes salient because revealing the idea to multiple
sellers also reduces the individual valuation of the idea by each seller (Arrow, 1962). With-
out market safety (i.e., effective IP protection), information about each party’s preferences
can be exploited. When information about market participants’ preferences or type can be
exploited, both buyers and sellers tend to disclose this information strategically (Gans and
Stern, 2010). For instance, sellers may be unwilling to disclose aspects of their idea due to
expropriation concerns, and buyers have an incentive to walk away from the table and expro-
priate the invention by themselves. Effective intellectual property protection increases the
likelihood that market participants will disclose their preferences truthfully and minimizes
the likelihood they will engage in ex post opportunistic behavior once the seller reveals im-
portant details of the idea in the course of negotiation. Thus, having market safety increases
the likelihood negotiations will reach an agreement.



3     Empirics

3.1    Data

We use the 2006 annual survey conducted by the Licensing Foundation, the charitable and
educational arm of the Licensing Executives Society (LES) (USA & Canada), which we
co-designed with subject experts from the Foundation. The Foundation’s purpose is to
develop an improved understanding of the “industry” of licensing in North America. It
serves companies and organizations that create IP and technology directly or are IP asset
owners, rather than professional services firms (legal, consulting, etc.). The survey focuses
on asking organizations to provide information about their organization and its licensing
activity. We administered the survey via email with a link to an online form we built
using SurveyMonkey.com. For a detailed description of the data, see Razgaitis (2006) and
Berneman, Cockburn, Agrawal, and Iyer (2009). What is particularly interesting about the



                                              8
2006 survey is that a central theme is impediments to licensing. The data are at the firm-
level, and survey responses provide an interesting and, to our knowledge, unique window
into how organizations perceive licensing challenges and the extent to which such challenges
affect their licensing activities.
   We provide descriptive statistics in Table 1. We survey 600 technology-oriented organi-
zations. While the sample is not unrepresentative of LES membership, we cannot conclude
it is representative of a random sample of licensing firms. The firms in our sample come
from a variety of industries and are relatively large; the average firm in our sample has an-
nual revenues between $1 billion and $10 billion, an R&D budget between $200 million and
$500 million, and between 5,000 and 10,000 employees. These firms represent a variety of
industries, including Energy (11%), Healthcare (44%), Software & Electronics (11%), Trans-
portation (3%), and Universities (28%). Not all respondents answer every survey question,
which is reflected in the varying number of observations across different variables (Table
1). The response rate tends to drop further into the survey, although the response rate for
questions regarding deal success and sources of bargaining breakdown is around 70%. Con-
ditional on participating in the survey, we do not find any obvious differences in industry
affiliation and firm size between responders and non-responders.


3.2     Measures

Our analysis focuses on when each market failure highlighted by RGS is salient during the
licensing process. All dependent variables are binary measures that equal 1 if the percentage
is greater or equal to the median response category, and 0 otherwise. We construct all of
our variables from discrete categories of survey responses (Appendix B). Each dependent
variable corresponds to a measure of deal success at a specific stage of the licensing process.
The three dependent variables are operationalized as follows:
   Level of unlicensed IP with at least one potential licensor/licensee. In the first stage of



                                              9
the licensing transaction, firms seek to identify potential buyers or sellers. Our measure of
deal success is the level of the organization’s unlicensed IP where they are able to identify a
potential buyer or seller. The survey asks respondents: “Thinking about intellectual property
that could have been licensed in the last 12 months but wasn’t, for what percentage was
your organization able to identify at least one potential licensee/licensor?” Note this measure
focuses on IP the organization is willing and able to license. IP the firm cannot or will not
license is, at least in principle, excluded. The preceding survey questions ask respondents to
identify the percentage of their entire inventory of IP they would never license voluntarily
and the percentage they would like to license but cannot. Thus, we attempt to exclude “junk
patents” from this measure.
   Level of negotiations started. We measure deal success in the second stage by the fraction
of negotiations started after buyers or sellers were identified. The survey asks respondents:
“Where potential licensees/licensors were identified, in what percentage of cases were sub-
stantive negotiations ever started?”
   Level of agreements reached. We measure deal success in the third stage by the fraction
of negotiations that resulted in an executed agreement. The survey asks respondents: “Of
all the times you entered into substantive licensing negotiations in the last 12 months, what
percentage resulted in a successful agreement?”
   Our key explanatory variables correspond to the market features outlined by RGS:
   Level of market thickness. Market thickness is a difficult phenomenon to measure and is
highly context-specific. Here, we measure lack of market thickness by whether respondents
agree to the statement that: “There are usually fewer potential buyers/sellers for the IP
[relative to tangible assets].” The variable takes on a value of 1 if the respondent agrees, and
0 otherwise. This measure roughly corresponds with RGS’s definition of market thickness.
   Bargaining frictions (congestion). We capture different types of transaction costs that
arise during the bargaining process, some of which correspond to key dimensions of conges-
tion described by RGS. Early in the bargaining process, the main transaction cost arises

                                              10
from acquiring sufficient information. As a result of the heterogeneity of ideas available
on the market and the cost of observing comparable transactions, substantial information
asymmetry exists, hence the cost and difficulty of conducting due diligence in the absence of
a multilateral exchange environment. As with market thickness, these costs are not easy to
measure directly, and again we look to responses to questions that compare licensing transac-
tions to transactions in tangible assets: “Due diligence will be much more difficult/costly for
the IP deal [relative to tangible assets].” The variable takes on a value of 1 if the respondent
agrees, and 0 otherwise.
   Later in the bargaining process, key transaction costs are associated with opportunism
and contracting problems. As noted by Gans and Stern (2010), the degree of congestion is
related to whether exchanges take place in the shadow of an endogenous outside option for
both parties. This is reflected by either deal breakdown due to better alternatives emerg-
ing for one or more parties or time running out before a deal is completed. We measure
these bargaining frictions by responses to some of the survey questions that ask respondents
to identify reasons for negotiation breakdowns. For example: “Over the past 12 months,
when substantive licensing negotiations have failed to reach an executed agreement, in what
percentage of cases was the breakdown due to ‘better alternatives emerged for one or more
parties’ or ‘delay (i.e., the clock ran out).”’ Respondents answer by choosing between several
discrete response categories (0%, 1-5%, 5-25%, 25-50%, 50-75% ,75-99%, 100%); we use the
mid-point of these ranges.
   We also examine other potential sources of bargaining breakdown, such as disagreement
over financial and non-financial terms, having too many parties at the table, legal and
regulatory problems, poor negotiating skills, lack of trust, and ego (Appendix B).
   Lack of market safety. We measure a lack of market safety by responses to the question:
“Of the IP that your organization would like to license but cannot, approximately what
fraction would you say is not effectively protectable by patents, trade secrets, etc.?” This
measure corresponds closely to the RGS definition because effective intellectual property

                                              11
protection increases the likelihood that market participants will disclose their preferences
truthfully, minimizing the likelihood they will engage in ex post opportunistic behavior once
the seller reveals important details of the idea during the course of a negotiation. As before,
respondents answer by choosing between discrete response categories, and we use the mid-
point of these ranges.
   We control for a number of factors that may affect our key relationships.
   Demand for IP. One concern when estimating the relationship between market thickness
and market failure is that we might be confounding a thin market with a lack of demand
for IP. The distinction is that a market can have a low volume of transactions even in the
presence of many potential buyers and sellers due to low demand for a particular technology.
We control for this using responses to the following question: “Of the IP that your organi-
zation would like to license but cannot, approximately what fraction would you say has no
discernible demand from end-users?”
   Organization size. To address the concern that large firms might be better at partici-
pating in the ideas market because they have more resources to find buyers and sellers and
enforce effective IP protection, we include four measures of firm size: revenue, R&D budget,
number of employees, and number of licensing professionals employed.
   Industry. Similarly, some industries may have institutions that facilitate more effective
use of the ideas market. For example, firms in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical indus-
tries have traditionally conducted negotiations on a bilateral basis (Gans and Stern, 2000),
whereas semiconductor firms have not historically relied heavily on patents to appropriate
the returns to R&D (Hall and Ziedonis, 2001), which may suggest they have other ways of
ensuring market safety. We include five industry indicator variables that take on a value of 1
if the firm’s focal activities are in that industry: Energy, Software & Electronics, Healthcare,
Transportation, and University & Government. The latter is the omitted category in all
specifications.



                                              12
3.3     Empirical strategy

As discussed above, the cross-sectional nature of our data does not allow us to identify causal
relationships. Instead, we use correlations to gain insights into our research question. The
main estimating equation is:


DealSuccessi = β1 Lackof M arketT hicknessi + β2 Lackof M arketSaf etyi
    + β3 BargainingF rictionsi + γF irmSizei + δIndustryi + i ,


where DealSuccessi measures the level of deal success for organization i at a particular
stage of the licensing process. The main parameters of interest, β1 , β2 , andβ3 , represent the
estimated effect of a lack of market thickness, bargaining frictions, and a lack of market
safety, respectively, on measures of deal success. F irmSize represents a vector of variables
that captures the size of the organization, as described above. Similarly, Industry represents
a vector of industry dummies. We report average marginal effects from probit models and
employ robust standard errors in all our specifications, although the key findings are robust
to alternative probability models and samples.3
    3
      In models not presented in the paper, we run additional regressions using linear probability models,
logit models, and ordered probit models, each with both binary and continuous versions of the main in-
dependent variables. We also run an ordered probit model with known thresholds, which allows us to
accurately specify the thresholds of our survey response categories rather than treating them as unknown
(see http://www.applied-ml.com/download/amldoc.pdf). In order to alleviate concerns of respondents spe-
cific propensities to answer high or low on rating scales, we jointly estimate the effect of market features
on all three stages of the licensing transaction with a random respondent effect common across all three
equations. We also try logged transformations of our dependent variable to ensure we are not estimating
beyond the survey category boundaries (e.g., less than 0% or greater than 100%). Our results are largely
consistent across all models and specifications.

4     Results

4.1    Descriptive evidence

Before turning to regression analysis, we present summary statistics to provide some basic
intuition on the relationship between each of the three market features and deal success in
each stage of the licensing process. We categorize firms based on the degree of deal success.
We classify a firm as having high deal success if the measure of deal success is greater than
the median percentage category. We present the means of our measures of lack of market
thickness, lack of market safety, and bargaining frictions for each of the three dependent
variables, respectively, in Tables A1-A3 in Appendix A. In almost all cases, firms in the low-
deal success category are more likely to experience market thinness, lack of market safety,
and bargaining frictions, relative to firms in the high-deal success category. However, the
relative magnitude in differences of means varies for each dependent variable, suggesting the
relative importance of market thickness, bargaining frictions, and market safety varies at
each stage of the licensing process.


4.2    Main results: Market features and licensing stages

We now turn to our regression analysis for a more nuanced examination of the link between
market features and deal failure. In Table 2, we consider each of the three discrete stages of
the licensing process, respectively: 1) identifying a potential buyer/seller, 2) initiating nego-
tiations, and 3) reaching an agreement. The dependent variable in each table corresponds to
our measure of an organization’s success rate at each stage of the licensing process: 1) the
level of unlicensed IP with at least one potential licensor/licensee identified, 2) the rate at
which negotiations are started once potential licensors/licensees are found, and 3) the frac-
tion of negotiations started that ultimately results in a completed agreement. Each column
includes controls for demand for IP, firm size, and industry.



                                               14
4.3    Market thickness

Our results are consistent with our main conjectures about the structural features of the
ideas market. Lack of market thickness appears to be most important in the first stage of
the licensing process since it is the only market feature correlated with deal success at this
stage and is not significant in any other stage. It is not surprising that lack of market thick-
ness is associated with lower deal success in the first stage given that it is more difficult to
identify potential transactors when the market is thin. Perhaps more interesting is that lack
of market thickness is not correlated with deal success in the latter stages. This underscores
the bilateral monopoly conditions under which licensing negotiations often occur. Indeed,
Gans and Stern (2010) point out that “detailed negotiations over the precise terms and
conditions of a license take place in a bilateral rather than multilateral environment...Each
potential buyers’ value may depend on whether other buyers have had access to the tech-
nology or not (since rival access would allow competitors to expropriate some portion of the
value by imitating technology)” (page 820). In other words, although many negotiations are
influenced by the shadow of competition, rivalry curtails the influence of potential outside
parties and limits the ability of participants to consider alternative offers. We find evidence
consistent with Gans and Stern that these negotiations take place in conditions of bilateral
monopoly since lack of market thickness is not correlated with deal success during the ne-
gotiation phase. Another though not mutually exclusive explanation is that parties that
anticipate deal failure in the later stages of negotiations due to market thickness issues avoid
initiating interactions at the outset and so select out of the process in advance.


4.4    Market safety

Lack of market safety is most salient in the third stage. In this last stage of the licensing
process, where substantive negotiations have started, the seller reveals material information
about the technology. This is likely due to the dynamics of legal due diligence. Due to


                                              15
its cost, many firms only engage in due diligence after they have determined the general
feasibility of reaching an agreement. Negotiating parties may be less likely to reach an
agreement when sellers are hesitant to provide full disclosure due to expropriation risk (or
buyers are hesitant to pay after they have appropriated), consistent with Arrow’s Paradox
(Arrow, 1962). Thus, effective market safety in the form of IP protection provides a way
to limit such behavior ex ante. Interestingly, firms do not seem to anticipate market safety
issues since it is not correlated with deal success in the first two stages.


4.5    Bargaining frictions

Various bargaining frictions are correlated with deal failure in the negotiation stage. In
particular, we find firms most likely to fail to initiate negotiations are the ones with higher
perceived costs of due diligence. An implication of conducting deals in the market for in-
tangibles relative to the product market is that participants face higher levels of uncertainty
and heterogeneity regarding the prospects of a deal. As a result, market participants face
a higher cost of conducting due diligence, which is exacerbated by the bilateral exchange
environment. Thus, even if potential buyers and sellers of IP have been identified, partici-
pants are less likely to initiate negotiations and reach deal completion if the marginal cost
of carrying out due diligence is high. Consistent with expectations, the inability to arrive at
mutually acceptable financial terms as well as too many parties at the table are also salient
frictions in the second stage. In the third stage, frictions associated with legal/regulatory
problems are salient. Again, market participants do not seem to anticipate these problems,
since these frictions are not correlated with deal failure in the first stage of the licensing
process (identifying a buyer/seller). Also, we do not find evidence that “delay” and “better
alternatives emerged for one or more parties” to be correlated to our measures of deal suc-
cess. Furthermore, frictions related to behavioral elements, such as “lack of trust,” “poor
negotiating skills,” and “ego,” although often cited by practitioners as common sources of



                                               16
deal failure (LESI, 2002), are not associated with reported rates of deal success at any stage.
Taken together, this suggests that bargaining frictions in licensing are mainly shaped by the
cost of assessing the deal in a bilateral environment.


4.6    Selection

A natural concern when observing a lower level of deal success in the first stage is that the
unlicensed IP is of low quality. If this is true, then poor-quality deals, rather than a lack of
market thickness, are associated with low-deal success. After all, the skewness of ideas has
long been established (Scherer, 1965). We take a step towards addressing this concern by
limiting the sample to firms that have at least 5-25% of negotiations reaching an agreement
(Table 3). By focusing on firms that achieve a minimum level of agreements, we reduce the
concern that high rates of deal failures early on are mainly attributable to a preponderance of
low-quality IP in the firm’s portfolio. The estimated coefficients using this restricted sample
are similar to those generated from using the full sample. Further, raising the threshold
to firms with at least 25-50% of negotiations reaching an agreement does not change the
main findings. In results not presented in the paper, we also jointly estimate the effect of
market features on all three stages of the licensing transaction with a random respondent
effect common across all three stages, which accounts for underlying unobserved respondent
heterogeneity across the three stages. The results are largely consistent.


4.7    Mediating factors: Organization type and industry effects

Finally, we explore how the relationship between deal failure and market features is medi-
ated by organization type (Universities versus Firms) and industry type (Healthcare versus
Software & Electronics). Jensen and Thursby (2001) document that university technologies
are often licensed at an “embryonic” stage, frequently even before patent applications are
filed. We find universities are less likely than firms to be able to identify potential buyers


                                              17
for their IP (Table 4, Column 1). This is likely due to greater difficulties in establishing
product-market fit due to the early-stage nature of their inventions. The predicted proba-
bility of deal success in the first stage is roughly 20% less for universities compared to firms;
in other words, university technologies are more likely to be orphaned. However, conditional
on finding a buyer to transact with, universities are 31% more likely to reach an executed
agreement relative to firms in the final stage (Column 3). We speculate this has to do with
the different incentives (both pecuniary and intrinsic) faced by faculty, technology transfer
officers, and university administrators, which are distinct on several dimensions from the
incentives faced by firms (Lach and Schankerman, 2008; Thursby and Thursby, 2002). Not
only do many universities count utilization, as opposed to profit maximization, as a primary
objective, they also do not consider downstream product market competition an alternative
to licensing for extracting rents from their intellectual property, unlike many firms.
   In Table 5, we restrict the sample to only Healthcare and IT (Software & Electronics)
firms. Ideally, we would like to compare just Healthcare and Software industries. Unfor-
tunately, we do not have enough variation from the limited number of firms in the latter
industry. We know from prior literature healthcare and IT operate quite differently in terms
of technology licensing. Firms in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries tradi-
tionally conduct negotiations on a bilateral basis (Gans and Stern, 2000), whereas IT firms
historically have not relied as heavily on patents to appropriate their returns to R&D (Hall
and Ziedonis, 2001). The main result here is that in the final stage of reaching an executed
licensing agreement, healthcare firms are more harmed than IT firms by a lack of market
safety (Column 6). This may be because the IT industry also engages in a variety of substi-
tute approaches for patent protection, such as rapid innovation and versioning. Furthermore,
we find lack of market safety is also negatively correlated with deal success for healthcare
firms in the first stage (Column 2), suggesting that to some extent firms may be able to
anticipate the problems that might arise due to a lack of market safety.

5     Conclusion and Implications

When do deal failures occur in the licensing process? Despite theory and anecdotal evidence
suggesting the ideas market is prone to failure, sources of licensing frictions on the rate of
deal success have not been systematically examined empirically. Furthermore, little research
exists on when during the licensing process market failures occur. We bring rare firm-level
licensing data to shed light on how market imperfections impact different stages of technology
licensing. Our results provide suggestive evidence that deal failure is not only prevalent but
that the relative salience of each market feature varies across the different stages of the
licensing process.
    How can these trading frictions be minimized? A growing number of firms begun to utilize
online marketplaces that facilitate licensing and other forms of trading between buyers and
sellers. Additionally, firms may experience significant returns to developing their licensing
team and selecting appropriate legal counsel to navigate negotiations in order to mitigate
due diligence costs. Many of the problems currently experienced by firms arise from lack
of information; very often, this is information about prices and transactions. Government
policy may be able to improve the functioning of ideas markets by increasing transparency
through better public reporting of IP transactions and their economic impact, as well as
supporting the development of critical market infrastructure (such as timely and predictable
dispute resolution mechanisms) and insurance against certain types of risks (akin to real
estate markets, where many jurisdictions support title insurance to protect purchasers from
legal and technical errors in transactions). Finally, policy makers can play an important role
in reducing uncertainty about the scope, validity, and enforceability of IP rights through
reform of patent law, building consensus around patent valuation, and active exploration of
new technologies and processes to improve patent examination (Cockburn, 2007).
    In future work, we plan to explore the relative importance of alternative forms of intel-
lectual property protection (i.e., copyrights and trade secrets) on rates of deal success across


                                              19
various licensing stages. We also hope to identify empirical indicators for the characteristics
of ideas noted by Gans and Stern (2010) - idea complementarity, value rivalry, and user
reproducibility - which are likely to pose distinct challenges for the efficient operation of the
ideas market. We believe the analyses of these issues are not only important to the study of
idea dissemination but also vital to understanding an increasingly economically significant
and complex market.

      fewer potential buyers/sellers for IP [relative to a tangible asset of similar value],” and 0
      otherwise. The first two Congestion measures are binary variables that are equal to 1 if
      respondents “Strongly agree” or “Agree” to the corresponding statement that compares an IP
      deal with a deal involving tangible assets. The remaining Congestion measures are continuous
      variables that are equal to the percentage of cases of bargaining breakdown. The measure of

  Notes: In our variable construction from survey responses, we take the midpoint from discrete
  response categories to transform responses of a particular question into a continuous variable. For
  instance, if the response to the question “How many people does your organization employ? is 200-
  500, we translate that response into 350. Similarly, if the response to the question “Of the IP that
  your organization elects not license, approximately what fraction would you say is not effectively
  protectable by patents, trade secrets, etc?” is ‘50-75%’, we code that response as 62.5%. We code
  any response of “Don’t know” as missing.
