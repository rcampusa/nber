                                             ABSTRACT

We investigate optimal consumption, asset accumulation and portfolio decisions in a realistically
calibrated life-cycle model with flexible labor supply. Our framework allows for wage rate uncertainly,
variable labor supply, social security benefits and portfolio choice over safe bonds and risky equities.
 Our analysis reinforces prior findings that equities are the preferred asset for young households, with
the optimal share of equities generally declining prior to retirement. However, variable labor materially
alters pre-retirement portfolio choice by significantly raising optimal equity holdings. Using this model,
we also investigate the welfare costs of constraining portfolio allocations over the life cycle to mimic
popular default investment choices in defined-contribution pension plans, such as stable value funds,
balanced funds, and life-cycle (or target date) funds. We find that life-cycle funds designed to match
the risk tolerance and investment horizon of investors have small welfare costs. All other choices,
including life-cycle funds which do not match investors' risk tolerance, can have substantial welfare
costs.

                                         I. Introduction


   We investigate optimal consumption, asset accumulation and portfolio decisions in a life-cycle

model with flexible labor supply. Using this model, we also investigate the welfare costs of con-

straining portfolio allocations over the life cycle to mimic popular default investment choices in

defined-contribution pension plans.

   Most prior work on life-cycle investing has treated labor earnings as exogenous (Luis M. Vi-

ceira, 2001, Joao Cocco, Francisco J. Gomes, and Pascal Maenhout, 2005, Francisco J. Gomes and

Alexander Michaelides, 2005, Francisco J. Gomes, Luis M. Viceira, and Laurence J. Kotlikoﬀ, 2006).

As such, it has focused on the bond-like feature of labor earnings–the fact that these resources are

not closely correlated with the returns to equities–while ignoring the insurance feature of variable

labor supply –the ability of investors who do poorly on the market to hedge their losses by working

and earning more. Our work considers this second aspect of labor earnings and studies not only

how labor supply aﬀects portfolio choice, but also how portfolio choice aﬀects labor supply. Our

framework is a realistically calibrated life-cycle model with wage rate uncertainly, variable labor

supply, and portfolio choice over safe bonds and risky equities.

   Our analysis reinforces prior findings that equities are the preferred asset for young house-

holds, with the optimal share of equities generally declining prior to retirement. However, variable

labor materially alters pre-retirement portfolio choice by significantly raising optimal equity hold-

ings. Post retirement, however, the optimal equity share increases as households spend down their

financial assets, leaving bond-like pension benefits to increasingly dominate household resources.

   Our derived pre-retirement optimal portfolio allocation is similar to the holdings of “life-cycle”

or “target date” funds, which are replacing money market and stable funds as the default portfolio

in many defined-contribution plans (Zvi Bodie and Jonathan Treussard 2007, Luis M. Viceira

2008). As we show,it is highly costly for moderately risk averse investors to invest their savings

                                                 1
only in stable value funds. In contrast, the welfare losses from investing in balanced funds (the

stock-bond mix is fixed) and life-cycle funds are much smaller and, indeed, negligible in the case

of life-cycle funds that follow the average optimal asset allocation path the investor would choose

if unconstrained. Interestingly, constraining portfolio choice aﬀects asset accumulation, but has a

relatively small eﬀect on labor supply.

     Ours is not the first study to incorporate flexible labor supply over the life cycle. Eric French

(2005) and Hamish W. Low (2005) explore optimal consumption in a realistically calibrated life-

cycle model, but ignore portfolio choice. Zvi Bodie, Robert C. Merton, and William F. Samuelson

(1992) and Zvi Bodie et al. (2004) consider portfolio choice, but assume wages are perfectly spanned

by the set of traded securities. Lewis Y. Chan and Luis M. Viceira (2000) also consider portfolio

choice but in a less realistic setting.


                                                 II. Model

                        A. Preferences and Investment Opportunities


     Agents work their first K periods and live a maximum of T periods. Lifespan is uncertain, with

pj denoting the probability of surviving to date j given survival to date j − 1. Preferences are given

by                                                  ⎛            ⎞
                                          T
                                          X              t−2
                                                         Y            (Ct Lαt )1−γ
                                 U = E1         δt−1 ⎝         pj ⎠                ,              (1)
                                          t=1
                                                                        1−γ
                                                     j=0

where δ < 1 is the discount factor, Lt is time-t leisure, Ct is time-t consumption, γ > 0 is the

coeﬃcient of relative risk aversion with respect to consumption, and α is a leisure preference

parameter. Leisure is measured as a fraction of total available time and satisfies Lt ∈ [L, 1], where

L is minimum leisure time (set to 1/3 below). Note that for γ greater than 1–our case of interest–

, marginal utility of consumption decreases with leisure, thus making leisure and consumption

substitutes. With these modified Cobb-Douglas preferences, labor supply is invariant to secular


                                                     2
changes in the real wage in accord with U.S. experience.

         There are two ways to invest — in riskless bonds with constant gross real return Rf , and in risky

stock, with gross real return Rt . Log stock returns are normally distributed, with mean μ + rf and

variance σ2R , where rf = ln Rf . Investors hold Bt and St dollars of each asset respectively, and face

borrowing and short-sales constraints, so that Bt ≥ 0 and St ≥ 0. Letting πt denote the proportion

of assets invested in stocks at time t, these constraints imply that πt ∈ [0, 1] and that wealth is

non-negative. We use Rpt to denote the after-tax net return on the portfolio held from period t to

period t + 1, i.e.,

                                    Rtp ≡ 1 + (1 − τ C )(πt Rt + (1 − πt )Rf − 1) ,                                (2)

where τ C is the uniform tax rate applied to all asset income. We ignore tax-exempt retirement

accounts, since our focus is on asset allocation, not tax-eﬃcient asset location (see Dammon, Spatt,

and Zhang, 2004).


                              B. Wealth Accumulation During Working Life


         The investor starts period t with wealth Wt . He then observes his wage rate wt and makes

work (Nt = 1 − Lt ), consumption (Ct ), and investment (πt ) decisions. We treat housing and other

durables consumption expenditures (ht ) as exogenous, “oﬀ-the-top” spending and subtract it from

the measure of disposable income.2 Agents face proportional income taxes.                        This preserves the

scalability/homogeneity of the model and limits the number of state variables. In particular, we

assume that labor income is taxed at a rate τ L , that retirement income is taxed at a rate τ SS , and,

as noted, that asset income is taxed at a rate τ C .

         Under these assumptions, the investor’s financial wealth at the end of working period t is given

by

                                 Wt+1 = Rpt+1 (Wt + (1 − ht ) (1 − τ L ) wt Nt − Ct ) ,                            (3)
     2
         Assuming investors save to make a downpayment on a house early in life doesn’t materially aﬀect our findings.


                                                             3
where wt is the time-t wage.

   The log of wages follows the process


                                         ln wt = f(t) + vt + εt ,                                     (4)


where f(t) is a deterministic function of age, vt is a permanent component given by


                                             vt = vt−1 + ut ,                                         (5)


ut is distributed as N(0, σ 2u ), and εt is a transitory shock uncorrelated with ut , which is distributed

as N(0, σ2ε ). The innovation to the permanent component of the wage rate (ut ) can be correlated

with the return to equity Rt , with coeﬃcient ρ.


                         C. Wealth Accumulation During Retirement


   During retirement (t > K), wealth accumulation follows

                                   p
                           Wt+1 = Rt+1 (Wt + (1 − ht ) (1 − τ SS ) Y − Ct ) ,                         (6)


where Y denotes social security income, which is taxed at a rate τ SS . We assume that the log of

social security income is a fraction λ of the average lifetime labor earnings that the agent would

have obtained had he worked full time during his working life:

                                                  PK
                                                   t=1 (f(t)   + vt )
                                     ln(Y ) = λ                         N,                            (7)
                                                           K

where N denotes full time labor supply.

   Retirement age and the level of social security benefits are exogenous. In practice, social security

income depends on the individual’s average earnings in his 35 highest earnings years. French

(2003) notes that this provides incentives to retire at age 65 and to increase labor supply over the

working life. Thus our simplified assumption should be viewed to a first-order approximation to


                                                       4
the incentives built into the Social Security system.3


                                         III. Optimization Problem


       The agent maximizes (1) with respect to Ct , Lt , and πt , subject to (2)-(6), Ct ≥ 0, Lt ∈

[L, 1], and πt ∈ [0, 1]. There are four state variables: age (t), wealth (Wt ), and the permanent

and transitory components of the wage rate (exp(vt ), and exp(εt )). However, our assumptions of

homothetic preferences and linear tax rates make the model scale free with respect to the permanent

component of wages exp(vt ); i..e, if this state variable doubles, all choice variables double. This

allows us to eliminate one state variable by normalizing wealth and the choice variables by exp(vt ).

The model is solved via backward induction using grid search, cubic value function interpolations,

and Gaussian quadrature.


                    IV. Calibration: Baseline Results and Comparative Statics

                                              A. Parameterization


       Agents are initially age 21, retire at age 65, and die for sure at age 100. Prior to this age we use

the mortality tables of the National Center for Health Statistics to parameterize the conditional

survival probabilities, pj for j = 1, ..., T . We set the discount factor δ to 0.97 and the coeﬃcient of

relative risk aversion γ to 5. Following Low (2005), we choose α so that the average labor supply

over the life cycle matches the average male hours of work per year reported in the Consumer

Expenditure Survey — 2080 hours per annum. Assuming a time endowment of 100 hours per week

and that α = 0.9, average lifetime labor supply equals 0.374. We take the housing expenditure

profile ({ht }Tt=1 ) from Gomes and Michaelides (2005).

       The mean equity premium (in levels) is set at 4.0% per annum, the risk-free rate is set at 1.0%
   3
       Letting social security income depend on past labor supply decisions–specifically, average past labor supply—

introduces a computationally costly extra state variable, but makes little diﬀerence to the results.


                                                          5
p.a., and the annualized standard deviation of innovations to the risky asset is set at 20.5%. This

equity premium is lower than the historical equity premium based on a comparison of average stock

and T-bill returns, but accords with the forward-looking estimates reported in Fama and French

(2002). Higher premiums generate unrealistically high equity portfolio shares.

       The tax rate is 30% on labor income (τ L ) and 15% on retirement income (τ SS ). Asset income is

taxed at a 20% rate (τ C ). These rates roughly match eﬀective income tax rates faced by a typical

household.

       In order to calibrate the wage income process (4)-(5) we combine the wage profile reported in

Fehr, Jokisch and Kotlikoﬀ (2005), which we use for the deterministic age-dependent component

of wages,4 with the estimates of σu and σε of 10.95% and 13.89% reported in Cocco, Gomes and

Maenhout (2005).5 The implied wage growth rates over the life cycle generated by this function

exhibit an inverted-U shape and are comparable to average total income growth rates in the PSID

data. We also assume a zero correlation between stock returns and innovations in the permanent

component of wages (ρ). Finally, we set the replacement ratio λ equal to 68.8% of labor supply at

age 65.


                                                B. Baseline Results


       Figures 1, 2, and 3 show baseline results. Figure 1 plots average paths of optimal consumption,

income and financial assets over the life cycle, all relative to permanent income; Figure 2 plots the

average path of the optimal allocation to stocks as a percentage of financial wealth; and Figure

3 plots average optimal labor supply before retirement, which occurs at age 65, as a fraction of

available hours.
   4
       Specifically we use their earnings function E(a, 2), given in equation (9) of their paper, with parameter λ equal

to 0. In this function, the argument a denotes age, and 2 denotes the middle income class.
   5
       Following Carroll (1997), we divide the estimated standard deviation of transitory income shocks by 2 to account

for measurement error.


                                                            6
   Overall, Figures 1 and 2 show consumption, income, asset accumulation, and asset allocation

patterns that are qualitatively similar to those assuming fixed labor supply (Cocco, Gomes, and

Maenhout 2005). In particular, consumption, income and wealth accumulation exhibit an inverted-

U shaped pattern over the life-cycle, while the share of stocks in the portfolio exhibits a U-shaped

pattern.

   Figure 3 helps explain the life-cycle pattern of labor income. This figure shows that, consistent

with the patterns observed in the data (French 2005, Low 2005), the investor chooses a declining

pattern of labor supply over the live cycle after an initial period of slightly increasing labor supply.

This pattern, together with the pattern in the wage rate, which in our model as in the data exhibits

an inverted-U shape, results in income increasing steadily until the investor is in his late thirties,

and decreasing smoothly until he reaches retirement age. At that point income drops by roughly

35 percent drop as social security starts replacing labor earnings.

   Figure 1 shows that, consistent with the empirical evidence, consumption slightly declines as the

investor starts increasing leisure late in his working life, and falls more sharply at retirement, when

leisure increases dramatically. Asset accumulation exhibits an inverted U-shape, but assets peak

much later than labor income. Assets grow rapidly until the investor is in his mid-fifties, at which

point he starts de-saving. The rapid accumulation of assets through middle age reflects concern

about wage uncertainty and the presence of liquidity constraints. But portfolio choice also matters

here. Figure 2 shows that the investor is optimally fully invested in stocks until his early thirties.

At that point the optimal portfolio share of stocks declines steadily until it reaches a minimum

of about 45% at retirement age, and increases monotonically afterwards. Thus while the share of

stocks declines steadily during the working life of the investor, it is still very high on average, thus

contributing to a rapid growth in asset values along the mean optimal path.

   The risk characteristics of the investor’s human wealth–the present discounted value of the


                                                   7
investor’s future earnings and pension income–and the life-cycle path of assets and human capital

explain the patterns in portfolio shares over the life cycle. Uncertainty about future wages makes

human capital risky. However, wage uncertainty is uncorrelated with stock market uncertainty,

and the investor can oﬀset adverse shocks to wages or to financial wealth by increasing his labor

supply. This makes human capital equivalent to an implicit investment in a relatively safe asset.

Thus the investor optimally tilts his portfolio towards stocks, particularly early in the life-cycle

when human capital is largest relative to financial wealth. As the investor accumulates assets and

his human capital is depleted, he optimally decreases the allocation to stocks. This trend reverses

in retirement, when the investor starts depleting his assets rapidly and the value of safe pension

income becomes increasingly important relative to financial assets.

   The optimal portfolio allocation to stocks over the life cycle generated by our realistically

calibrated model is qualitatively similar to the asset allocation path built into self-rebalancing life-

cycle mutual funds (Viceira, 2008). Thus our realistic calibration of life-cycle portfolio decisions

and labor supply decisions provides support for this approach to saving for retirement. Our model

also suggests that investors receiving pension income should increase their allocation to stocks as

they age as they spend down their assets but experience no diminution of social security income.

Note, however, that our model does not account for potentially large financial liabilities generated

by healthcare costs in retirement, which are likely to reduce the investor’s willingness to invest in

stocks in retirement.


                                     C. Comparative Statics


   Our baseline model assumes that the investor makes optimal decisions about consumption (or

savings), portfolio and labor supply decisions subject to liquidity constraints and maximum labor

supply constraints. We now examine the impact on investor’s welfare and on optimal decision-

making of imposing fixed labor supply constraints and portfolio constraints in our baseline model.

                                                   8
Table 1 reports average optimal consumption, wealth accumulation, labor supply, labor income and

portfolio allocation to stocks for each set of constraints (left side of the table) as well as changes

in these variables relative to the baseline case (right side of the table). To save space, we report

average values of these variables across age ranges.

   Panel A in Table 1 reports results for our baseline case. Panel B in Table 1 reports optimal

consumption, asset accumulation and allocation to stocks when labor supply is fixed. A comparison

of Panel A with Panel B shows that the optimal allocation to stocks is more conservative when labor

supply is held fixed. This results from the fact that financial wealth relative to future labor income

is higher in that case. To understand this pattern, note that Panel B shows that labor income

early in life is lower than in the case with flexible labor supply, and higher closer to retirement.

This is expected given the roughly declining pattern in optimal labor supply over the life cycle.

Interestingly, the individual also chooses a lower level of consumption early in life, which together

with higher labor earnings lead to significantly larger wealth accumulation during his working life.

This wealth accumulation results in more conservative portfolio allocations over the life cycle, and

it sustains higher consumption in retirement.

   These results suggest that the ability to increase labor supply acts as an important buﬀer against

future income uncertainty. When we eliminate this extra choice variable, the individual is forced

to accumulate extra savings to increase his buﬀer stock and behaves more conservatively in his

portfolio decisions. The welfare loss from not being able to adjust labor supply optimally is very

large. Relative to our baseline model, the investor would be willing to give up 82% of his first-year

expected labor income to be able to optimally adjust his labor supply. Note that we use first-year

labor income as a benchmark for our welfare computations instead of consumption as it is standard

in this literature because we also have leisure entering the utility function. In a model without

leisure the welfare loss in this case would probably correspond to about 4% of annual consumption,


                                                  9
but in our model we can’t make those calculations.

       Panels C through Panel F examine the impact on consumption, wealth accumulation and labor

supply of constrained portfolio allocations. These allocations mimic investments in a bond (or

“stable value”) fund (Panel C), two balanced funds (Panel D and Panel E), and a life-cycle fund

(Panel F), and thus let us explore the welfare costs of popular default choices for defined contribution

plans.

       Panel C reports results for the case that constrains the investor to invest only in bonds. This is

the case considered in prior research on life cycle consumption with flexible labor supply. Thus it

provides a useful point of comparison for our baseline case. This case is also relevant for its practical

relevance, since until recently the preferred default investment choice in defined contribution plans

was a money market fund or a stable value fund. Relative to the case where the individual has stocks

available for investment, this case leads to significantly lower asset accumulation and consumption

over the life-cycle, particularly at retirement, and to substantial welfare losses, in the order of 46%

of first-year labor income.6

       Panel D and Panel E examine the case where investors can hold stocks, but only in fixed

proportions of their financial wealth–50% and 60% respectively. Balanced funds typically follow

this type of fixed-proportion asset allocation strategy with constant rebalancing. Relative to our

baseline case, this constrained case leads to smaller loses in consumption and wealth accumulation

than the case with no stock investment at all. Overall welfare losses are also substantially smaller,

at 4.8% and 7.3% of first-year labor income respectively.

       Finally, Panel F examines the case where the investor follows a strategy of constantly rebalancing
   6
       Note that in our model the individual invests in a bond fund with a constant real return, while in reality the

default investment choice in defined contribution plans has been a nominal money market fund or a nominal stable

fund which are subject to real interest rate risk and short- and medium-term inflation risk. Thus our calibration

likely underestimates the welfare losses from constraining portfolio choice.

his portfolio using weights that change with age along a deterministic path that equals the optimal

average allocation in the unconstrained case (see Panel A). For ages below the retirement age this

fixed path mimics the strategy typically followed by life-cycle–or target retirement–funds. This

strategy is the one that produces minimal deviations in consumption and wealth accumulation

with respect to the baseline case, and results in the smallest welfare loss, at 2.4% of first-year labor

income. We have also computed, but not reported here to save space, the welfare losses for each of

these cases when labor supply is fixed. These losses are generally large, but comparable to those

with flexible labor supply.

   The parameterization of the wage profile, retirement income, survival probabilities, tax rates,

and investment opportunities are all based on the empirical evidence available for U.S. households

and U.S. capital markets. The only parameters not explicitly tied up to the empirical evidence are

the discount rate δ and the coeﬃcient of relative aversion γ, which we set to values that we deem

plausible. Thus it is interesting to examine whether the conclusions from our baseline calibration

are robust to alternative values of those parameters, particularly the coeﬃcient of relative risk

aversion.

   Table 2 reports average optimal consumption, wealth accumulation, labor supply, labor income

and portfolio allocation to stocks across age ranges for our baseline parameterization when the

coeﬃcient of relative risk aversion γ is set to 2 (Panel A) and to 8 (Panel C), respectively. For

ease of comparison, the middle panel (Panel B) of the table also reproduces the baseline results for

an investor with γ = 5 shown in Panel A of Table 1. In general, the optimal policy functions all

exhibit the same shape as a function of age across diﬀerent coeﬃcients of relative risk aversion, but

their levels diﬀer in interesting ways. More risk tolerant investors invest more in stocks throughout

their lives than their conservative counterparts. But they also consume more and work less early

in their life cycle. This creates oﬀsetting eﬀects on wealth accumulation: The increased exposure


                                                  11
to stocks will have a positive eﬀect on wealth accumulation, but the reduced savings will have

a negative eﬀect. Table 2 shows that on balance the net eﬀect is negative: More risk tolerant

investors accumulate less wealth on average than their conservative counterparts, which in turn

leads to lower consumption and leisure later in life.

   Table 3 explores the welfare costs as a percentage of first year labor income of the basic con-

straints shown in Table 1 for investors with coeﬃcients of relative risk aversion γ equal to 5–our

baseline case, already reported in Table 1–, 2, and 8. We also report welfare costs for an additional

portfolio constraint consisting in forcing the investor to follow a pre-determined portfolio strategy

whose weights equal the optimal average allocation for an investor with γ = 5. This case helps us

explore the welfare cost of forcing investors with diﬀerent risk tolerance to follow the same portfolio

strategy.

   The results on Table 3 are consistent with those reported in Table 1 for our baseline investor

with γ = 5. Constraining investors from flexibly adjusting their labor supply is very costly to them,

with costs that are about 80% of first year labor income across all investors.

   The cost of constraining investors to follow a predetermined asset allocation policy is negligible

when this strategy equals the average portfolio allocation they would have followed if unconstrained.

In all other cases, however, welfare costs are not negligible in general, and they can be quite

substantial when the constrained allocation forces the investor to depart considerably from the

optimal life-cycle asset allocation.

   For example, the cost of constraining an investor with γ = 8 to follow the average optimal asset

allocation path of an investor with γ = 5 is about 234% of his first-year labor income, while this

cost is only 12% for an investor with γ = 2. The reason for this welfare cost diﬀerential is that the

investor with γ = 8 wants to follow, if unconstrained, a much more conservative investment policy

than the investor with γ = 5, while an investor with γ = 2 wants to follow a portfolio strategy


                                                  12
which is much more similar to that of the γ = 5 investor. The average life-time allocation to

equities across age ranges of an investor with γ = 8 is about 32% , while it is 71% for an investor

with γ = 5, and 98% for an investor with γ = 2.

   Interestingly, the welfare cost of a 100% bond allocation is higher for a moderately risk averse

investor with γ = 5 than for both an aggressive investor with γ = 2 or a conservative investor with

γ = 8. These diﬀerences are caused by the fact that while the optimal portfolio share invested

in stocks declines as risk aversion increases, the optimal dollar amount invested in stocks is hump

shaped. As investors become more conservative, they also become more prudent and accumulate

more wealth over the life cycle. A simple calculation of the optimal dollar amount invested in

stocks–i.e., the product of accumulated wealth times the optimal portfolio share in stocks–in

Table 2 shows that the investor with γ = 5 holds the largest dollar holdings of stocks across all

age ranges. The investor with γ = 2 invest the largest fraction of his wealth in stocks, but he also

accumulates much less wealth; the investor with γ = 8 accumulates much more wealth, but he also

allocates the smallest fraction of this wealth to stocks. Thus Table 2 shows that the welfare costs

from being unable to invest in stocks are related to the dollar amount, not the portfolio share, the

investor wished to invest in stocks.

   Our results are consistent with the result in Gomes and Michaelides (2005) that stock market

participation rates are an increasing function of risk aversion for a range of coeﬃcients of relative

risk aversion between 1 and 5. Our results suggest that participation rates are likely to decline

for more conservative investors, i.e., that stock market participation rates are likely to be a hump-

shaped function of risk aversion. Finally, the magnitude of the welfare costs is also consistent with

the conclusion in Gomes and Michaelides (2005) that CRRA investors with moderate risk aversion

will participate in the stock market unless they face extremely high costs from doing so.

   Finally, our results suggest that life-cycle funds that mimic the average optimal life-cycle port-


                                                 13
folio allocation of the investor can be approximately optimal, but that forcing all investors to invest

in the same fund can be highly costly unless they all have very similar risk tolerance, and the

fund is designed to mimic their average portfolio allocation over the life-cycle. Thus, if investors

exhibit heterogeneity in their tolerance for risk, it might make sense for the mutual fund industry

to change its current practice of oﬀering only “age-based” life-cycle funds, and to start oﬀering

“risk-and-age-based” life-cycle funds.
