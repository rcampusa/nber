Willingness to Pay for Drug Rehabilitation: Implications for Cost Recovery

JEL No. I1, I10

                                           ABSTRACT


Objectives: This study estimates the value that clients place on drug rehabilitation services at the
time of intake and how this value varies with the probability of success and availability of social
services.

Methods: We interviewed 241 heroin users who had been referred to, but had not yet entered,
methadone maintenance treatment in Baltimore, Maryland. We asked each subject to state a
preference among three hypothetical treatment programs that varied across 3 domains: weekly fee
paid by the client out of pocket ($5 to $100), presence/absence of case management, and time spent
heroin-free (3 to 24 months). Each subject was asked to complete 18 orthogonal comparisons.
Subsequently each subject was asked if they likely would enroll in their preferred choice among the
set of three. We computed the expected willingness to pay (WTP) as the probability of enrollment
times the fee considered in each choice considered from a multivariate logistic model that controlled
for product attributes. We also estimated the price elasticity of demand.

Results: We found that 21% of clients preferred programs that were logically dominated by other
options. The median expected fee subjects were willing to pay for a program that offered 3 months
of heroin-free time was $7.30 per week, rising to $17.11 per week for programs that offered 24
months of heroin-free time. The availability of case management increased median WTP by $5.64
per week. The fee was the most important predictor of the self-reported probability of enrollment
with a price elasticity of -0.39 (SE 0.042).

Conclusions: Clients' median willingness to pay for drug rehabilitation fell short of the average
program costs of $82 per week, which reinforces the need for continued subsidization as drug
treatment has high positive externalities. Clients will pay more for higher rates of treatment success
and for the presence of case management.

Introduction

       The economic burden of illicit drug use was estimated at $143 billion in 1998 ($160

billion in 2003) (Cartwright, W. S. and P. L. Solano 2003;Harwood, H. J., J. Fountain, and G

Livermore 1998). Contributing to this problem are an estimated 119,000 heroin users, 2.3

million cocaine users, and 4.7 million Americans who used pain killers illicitly in 2003

(Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 2004).         Social costs are

estimated to average $22,000 annually per illicit drug user ($160 billion/7.3 million users)

(Cartwright, W. S. and P. L. Solano 2003). An estimated 7.3 million illicit drug users could

be classified as needing specialty treatment for their drug problem (Substance Abuse and

Mental Health Services Administration 2004). Of these, 1.5 million (20.8%) were estimated

to perceive a need for drug abuse treatment. However, only 1.1 million (15%) illicit drug

users actually received treatment for illicit drugs (Substance Abuse and Mental Health

Services Administration 2004). Revenue from treatment came from a variety of sources, out

of pocket (40.3%), private health insurance (32.1%), Medicaid (24.0%), public assistance

(21.1%), Medicare (16.4%), or with the help of family members (19%) (Substance Abuse

and Mental Health Services Administration 2004).

That only 21% of those with illicit drug problems recognized a need for treatment and only

15% actually obtained treatment is the basis of a policy dilemma. Treatment could help to

reduce the external costs that illicit drug users impose on society via crime, interpersonal

violence, spread of disease (e.g. HIV/AIDS and TB), and the socially insured health harms

which drug users suffer. Many drug users now enter treatment through coercion from the

criminal justice system. For example, In California, Proposition 36 was passed in 2000 to
allow of those convicted of 1st and 2nd time nonviolent, simple drug possession to receive

drug treatment instead of incarceration (www.prop36.org).

       For illicit drug users who recognize a need for treatment, subsidies for treatment can

be justified on the basis of the large social externalities caused by drug illicit drug use.

Methadone maintenance treatment is estimated to cost $82 per week and many in methadone

stay in treatment for months (Roebuck, M. C., M. T. French, and A. T. McLellan 2003).

However, studies have shown that treatment is cost effective (Cartwright, W.S. 2000;Jofre-

Bonet, M and JL Sindelar 2001;McCollister, K.E. and M.T. French 2003). Thus, it is in

society’s interest to ensure that those who desire treatment can obtain it and can receive

effective, high quality care. Further, longer lengths of stay have been shown to produce

greater benefits (Zarkin, G.A. , L.J. Dunlap, J.W. Bray, and W.M. Wechsberg 2002).

Despite the compelling public interest, it is thought that there is inadequacy of public funding

to provide the good-quality, accessible care that would benefit not only the drug users but

society at large. One way to expand the system would be to use price discrimination to

provide revenue to clinics by encouraging individuals who are willing to pay to do so more

often than currently occurs.

       A rational approach to budgeting treatment subsidies would not require underwriting

100% of treatment for every client. One could use a method of Ramsey pricing to base the

subsidy for various drug users on their elasticity of demand (Baumol, William J. and David

F. Bradford 1970). Ramsey pricing would set up a regime of price discrimination that

maximizes revenue to the drug rehabilitation system by charging more for those with higher

demand and less for those with lower demand. To optimize a Ramsey pricing system in

drug treatment services, information on the price elasticity and how it varies by program and
user characteristics would be needed. However, information on price elasticity for the

demand for treatment for illicit drug use is not currently available (Cartwright, W. S. and P.

L. Solano 2003), but see (Borisova, N. N. and A. C. Goodman 2003) on travel time elasticity.

The willingness of ordinary citizens to provide public support has been studied using

contingent valuation survey methods in mall-intercept samples from Brooklyn, NY and the

Triad area of North Carolina where investigators derived a mean willingness to pay of $37

per payer towards expansion of drug treatment programs (counseling based, not methadone)

to treat an additional 100-500 patients per year (Zarkin, G. A., S. C. Cates, and M. V. Bala

2000).

         The objective of this paper is to inform cost-sharing strategies among users, providers

and payers of drug rehabilitation. In section 1, we develop a welfare economics model of the

optimal subsidy that a social planner would pay to underwrite the drug rehabilitation of an

illicit drug user. Section 2 describes the primary data collected in Baltimore during 2002-

2003 as part of a conjoint analysis to estimate the demand for drug rehabilitation and leads to

section 3 where we describe the methods used to analyze the data. In section 4 we present

our results. Finally in section 5 we describe limitations of the analysis and discuss

implications for policy.

1. A Model of the Optimal Subsidy

         Suppose there is a population of addicts and taxpayers. There are NA addicts who pay

no taxes and NT taxpayers who pay a flat tax, τ. We assume NT>NA and define the ratio of

addicts to taxpayers as: θ=( NA/NT). Each addict derives an identical income, yA by inflicting

property losses on the taxpayers. Each taxpayer has income yT and yT>yA. The average

property loss per taxpayer is (yA NA/NT ) or θyA . The addicts have a demand for a medical
treatment, m, that is 100% successful in curing their addiction thereby converting them into

taxpayers. The treatment is available at price, p per episode of treatment. There is no other

way to cure addiction besides purchasing the treatment. We now consider a social planner

who wants to maximize social welfare by devoting all of the tax towards a Pigouvian

subsidy, s, applied to the price of the treatment. The social planner’s budget constraint is

NTτ=mNAs, which implies that τ=θms. With the simplification that each member within the

two subpopulations is identical, an egalitarian social planner weighs the utility of each

member of the population equally, the social planner’s problem is to choose “s” in order to

maximize W as follows:

       [1] W = N A × U A (mi , c A ) + N T × U T (c T )

       Normalizing the price of c to be equal to 1, the respective budget constraints can be

written as:

       [2] yA=cA+(p-s)m

       [3] yT=cT+τ+θyA

       Inserting the budget constraints and the tax identity τ=θms into [1] we can recast the

social welfare function as:

                       [                                  ]     [
       [4] W = N A × U A ([mi ], [ y A − ( p − s )mi ]) + N T × U T ([ y T − θms − θy A ])   ]
       Define the addict’s marginal rate of substitution between m and c as

           dU A
              A
       ψ = dm A
           dU
           dc A

       Define the social rate of substitution between addict consumption and taxpayer

consumption as
               dU T
                  T
           ϕ = dc A
               dU
               dc A



                                                                                  dU T dU A
           Assuming that U’(c )>0 and U’’(c )<0, would ordinarily ensure that          <
                                                                                  dc T   dc A

and thus that ϕ<1 because of the higher income and lower marginal utility of taxpayers’

consumption. This would mean that redistribution of 1 unit of consumption from a taxpayer

to an addict creates a utility gain for the addict that outweighs the utility loss for the taxpayer.

It also is possible that addiction could also lower the marginal utility of consumption because

substance use effectively satiates the pleasure centers in the brain. We simply stipulate that

                 dU T dU A
in general,           ≠      and consider the two possibilities of ϕ<1 and ϕ>1.
                 dc T   dc A

           The first order condition that defines the optimal subsidy s* can be written as

                        ψ       p (1 − ϕ − ε p )
           [5] s* =           +
                      (ϕ − 1)      (ϕ − 1)ε p

           (See Appendix A for derivation.)

           Furthermore as shown in Appendix A,

                 ds   p
           [6]      = 2
                 dε ε p

           So that the subsidy declines as the addict’s demand for treatment becomes more

elastic.

           The optimal subsidy is 0 when

                  p (ϕ − 1 + ε p )
           ψ =
                        εp
       For the typical case where ϕ<1 and εp<1 , the point at which the optimal subsidy is

zero occurs at non-negative values of ψ when addicts have a high willingness to pay for their

own treatment. The optimal subsidy can become negative (e.g. a surtax on treatment) if

addicts have very high willingness to pay for treatment ψ>>0 or if it is socially optimal to

redistribute wealth from addicts to taxpayers because ϕ>>1. The optimal subsidy is negative

                p (1 − ϕ − ε p )
whenever ψ >                       .
                      εp

       The foregoing considerations apply to the optimal subsidy assuming that all addicts

are equal and have stable preferences. As is well-known both from field experience with

addicts and from economic theory (Dockner, Engelbert and Gustav Feichtinger 1993), an

individual addict’s demand for treatment waxes and wanes over time. If each addict had

cyclic preferences so that their demand for treatment exhibited regular peaks and troughs, the

optimal subsidy would need to be tailored to each addict as their willingness to comply with

treatment waxed and waned. One could, in principle, assess demand for treatment by

repeatedly measuring an individual addict’s demand elasticity and then calibrate incentives

and subsidies to keep pace with dynamic shifts in demand. As equation [6] indicates the

optimal subsidy would have to keep pace with 1/ε2. A more feasible approach would be to

find easily measured predictors of demand for drug rehabilitation services in order to follow

the dynamic evolution of these markers.



2. Study population

       Between January, 2002 and January, 2003, 247 heroin injection drug users (IDUs)

who requested and were granted an available methadone maintenance treatment slot by the
Needle Exchange Program (NEP) program staff were invited to participate in a randomized,

controlled trial of strengths-based case management vs. usual methadone maintenance. The

participation rate among those invited to participate was approximately 99.2% (245 of 247).

Within 7 days of the initial interview, only 34% of the participants followed through and

actually enrolled into the treatment slot to which they were assigned.

         Details of this randomized trial are available elsewhere (Strathdee, S. A., Erin

Ricketts, S Huettner, Llewellyn J. Cornelius, D Bishai, Jennifer R. Havens, P. Beilenson, C

Rapp, J.J. Lloyd, and Carl A. Latkin 2006). For IDUs who agreed to enter the trial, a signed

consent was obtained and a baseline interview was conducted prior to the treatment intake

appointment. This study was approved by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public

Health Committee on Human Research.

       To develop the survey instrument, we held key informant interviews with drug

rehabilitation case managers and their administrator. These revealed that price, duration of

effect and the availability of case management would be the most salient program features to

inquire about. We studied five different prices ($5, $25, $40, $60, and $100 per week); two

different availabilities of case management (available or not); and three different durations of

treatment effect (3, 6, or 24 months of freedom from heroin). In order to cover a complete

and orthogonal set of these product features with minimal respondent burden we consulted

Sawtooth software (Louviere, Jordan J. 1988;Sawtooth Software Inc. 1999), and concluded

that two parallel sets of 18 sequential choices among were necessary. Subjects were

randomized so that half of them saw each set. Each of the 18 choices imposed a new array of

three hypothetical methadone maintenance program descriptions listing the price, duration of

effect, and presence of case management (See Figure 1). All subjects were told to expect
that they would have to pay for the hypothetical program themselves because insurance

would not reimburse for the treatment. Cards were-randomized so that each of the 5 prices

was faced in about 20% of encounters, each case-management choice in roughly 50% and

each effect duration in roughly 33% of product encounters. After viewing the three options,

subjects were asked, “From these three cards, which program would you PREFER? The

subsequent question was “Would you actually enroll in this program?”.

       Each version included one choice set in which one program clearly dominated the

other two— a choice having case management, longer treatment effects, and lowest price.

Subjects who preferred dominated programs were flagged.


3. Statistical Analysis

        The evaluation of each of these 54 drug treatment programs (18 sets × 3 programs

per set) always occurred in the context of exactly 2 competitor programs. The respondents

indicated both which program they preferred and, in a separate question, whether or not they

would pay for the preferred program. This analysis studies the responses to the second

question—“whether they would pay”.

        The dependent variable in our model is a binary variable indicating whether the

respondent would pay out of pocket to enter treatment with the preferred set of characteristics

out of each set of the three alternatives. The independent variables are the attributes (price,

duration, and heroin-free time) of the programs considered and the baseline personal

characteristics (e.g. socio-economic-demographic as well as addiction severity indices). The

generalized linear model which we studied takes the form

[7]

               E(Y)=g-1[(β’P Pk +β’D Durk +β’SSk +β’AX)+(µQuestion+µSubject+ε)]
where g-1() is an inverse logistic link function and (µQuestion+µSubject) are separate random

effects associated with each of the 18 questions and each of the 245 subjects. Y is an

indicator of whether the subject would pay for the program and Pk is a vector of the

program’s own price and the prices of the 2 competing programs appearing within each set of

the 18 card sets. Durk and SK are respectively, vectors of “own” and two competing

durations of freedom from heroin and “own” and two competing indicators of availability of

case management. The vector X represents individual respondent characteristics that might

influence choice.

        We first estimated this model using maximum likelihood methods based on the

“gllam” program in Stata ™ (Rabe-Hesketh, Sophia and Anders Skrondal 2002). We

subsequently ran simple logit models without any random effects specification. The

increased efficiency of the computationally intensive maximum likelihood approach led to

smaller standard errors but coefficient estimates that were very close to the simple logit

estimates. The significance of the coefficients was the same for the random effects and

simple logit models. To ease interpretation we exponentiated the logit coefficients to obtain

estimates of odds ratios. We also used the “mfx” command in Stata 8.0 to convert the

coefficients into marginal effects that could be interpreted as own price and cross price

elasticities. These arc elasticities have the conventional interpretation: the percentage

increase in quantity demanded from a percentage decrease in price. The elasticity will only

be valid around the means of all of the covariates in the sample. It will reflect the response to

one program in an environment where there are 2 alternatives each with the mean price,
duration, and case management availability of the products on the 18 sets of programs. It

will also reflect the mean income and perceived risk characteristics of the sample.


4. Results

       For this sample of heroin users, the mean daily expenditure on heroin was $64.63 (SD

$47.31), excluding two outliers who reported spending over $1000 per day on heroin. Table

1 shows the basic descriptive data from the sample. The sample had a majority of non-

Hispanic African Americans and males. Self-reported income had a mean of $1207, a

median $855, and a maximum of $8000 per month. Only 8.5% of respondents were

employed. Over 38% of respondents reported deriving income from illegal sources; there

may be underreporting.

       Respondents were asked to express a preference for one of the three hypothetical

treatment programs in each of the 18 card sets. Out of the 245 subjects, there were 5

refusals to answer preference questions leading to the collection of preference statements for

18 × 240 sets of three goods. After indicating which of the three was preferred, respondents

were asked if they would pay the stipulated fee to enroll. The data describe the outcomes for

18 card sets × 3 programs per card set × 240 subjects= 12,960 non-independent opportunities

to express a willingness to purchase and or a preference.

       Figures 2 and 3 visually summarize the preference data. Figure 2 shows that the

subjects intended to purchase the lowest priced ($5.00 per week) program 63% of the time

when it was coupled with the promise of 24 months free of heroin. This willingness to

purchase at $5.00 fell to 40% with only 6 months free of heroin and to 36% if only 3 months.

Figure 2 provides some face validity; the proportion intending to enroll decreases

systematically with: 1) price for a given time free heroin, and 2) time free from heroin at each
price. That is, the slopes are downward sloping and increase by time heroin-free. Similarly,

Figure 3 demonstrates that the presence of case management increases the probability of

enrolling by about 10-20%, holding the fee constant.

         Figures 2 and 3 can be used to calculate a summary measure of willingness to pay

using “the area under each curve” and the data on the predicted probabilities of purchase.

This can be done using a logit model of equation [7] (excluding the “X” variables) to impute


the probability of purchase
                                 ^
                               ( πi for the “i-th” respondent) , for each of the 12,960

respondent-product pairs and data on the prices and other product attributes. The area under

                                               ^
each of the curves in Figures 2 and 3 are Σi (πi × Pricei ) where Pricei is the price of the “i-


                                                 ^
th” encountered product. One could interpret (πi × Pricei ) as the statistically expected

revenue from the “i-th” person-product encounter and offer summary measures of this

distribution to convey willingness to pay of the sample. The skewness of the distribution

makes the median a better summary measure than the mean (Mitchell, R. and R. Carson

1989).    If a drug rehabilitation program practiced perfect price discrimination in a range

between $5 and $100, the median expected revenue per client (corresponding to area under

the curve in Figure 2) would be $17.11, $8.42, and $7.39 for programs that offered 24, 6, and

3 months of heroin-free time. For Figure 3, the corresponding summary measures are $13.05

and $7.40 for programs that do and do not offer case management respectively. However,

these numbers could be underestimates of the true WTP as our 5 price points do not exhaust

the full range of demand. As can be seen in Figure 2, there remain as many as 40% of

subjects who say they would purchase treatment at $100 per week. If these percentages
remain high at prices of $150, $200, or even $250, there could be substantial private

willingness to pay that is unmeasured in our model.

       Table 2 explores whether or not models of willingness to pay are robust to the

inclusion or exclusion of the 21% of subjects who were willing to purchase dominated

products. Table 3 shows that the effects of price and product attributes on WTP are nearly

identical whether or not all subjects are included. Case management increases willingness to

pay, whether or not irrational responders are included, which confirms our assumption that

case management is generally perceived as a normal good. In separate analyses (not shown)

a dummy variable indicating having preferred dominated choices had no effect on the

probability of declaring a willingness to pay. We ran additional analysis (not shown) to

predict the probability of making a dominated choice. The odds of preferring a dominated

product were associated with several background variables, including seldom attending

church (lower odds), homelessness (higher odds) and being married (lower odds) but not

with schooling attainments. To maximize the power of the sample, all of the subjects were

retained for subsequent models and background variables were retained as covariates.

       In Table 3 we display the results of 4 different multivariate models of the willingness

to pay using logistic regression. Product attributes, especially price, are the most powerful

determinants of the decision to purchase and personal attributes including the preference for

dominated options have a very weak interaction with the effects of price. The principal

sociodemographic background variables associated with WTP were co-residence with

females or with parents, which increased WTP and frequent religious service attendance

which decreased WTP. A separate study of the data from this trial confirmed that living with

a sexual partner increased threefold the odds of actually entering treatment (Lloyd, J. J., E. P.
Ricketts, S. A. Strathdee, L. J. Cornelius, D. Bishai, S. Huettner, J. R. Havens, and C. Latkin

2005). It may be that the highly religious may see their religious participation as a substitute

for opioid agonist therapy with methadone1. The components of the addiction severity index

had opposing effects. The psychiatric subscale was associated with increased willingness to

pay while the medical and drug use subscales were associated with decreased willingness to

pay.

            Based on model 1 of Table 3, the price elasticity of demand for drug treatment was

estimated at –0.39 based on a computation of marginal effects. This elasticity was estimated

at the sample mean of the product attributes implying a cash price of $48 per week of

treatment, a mean stipulated treatment outcome of 10 months of freedom from heroin, and a

49% probability that there would be case management services available.



5. Discussion

           Our study revealed that drug addicts have a relatively inelastic demand for methadone

maintenance treatment with an arc elasticity of –0.39. This is the first estimate of price

elasticity in the literature. This estimate of elasticity is contingent on the setting of this study

and the set of hypothetical program parameters, as well as the characteristics of the sample

population. Thus, the estimate of the price elasticity is not as generalizable as we would like.

However, as the first estimate, we hope that it paves the way for future research. Revealed

preference data from price experiments in drug treatment clinics are difficult to obtain.

Knowledge of the price elasticity is important as there are many applications to policy issues.



1
    Marx may have had a different phenomenon in mind when he declared that “Religion is the opiate of the

masses.”
There is scant literature on the sensitivity of demand to program characteristics. An important

prior study (Borisova, N. N. and A. C. Goodman 2003) showed that addicts have a

willingness to pay for reductions in travel time to methadone maintenance, but did not

address the price elasticity of treatment.

       Our results have face validity in that increments in desirable program attributes such

as availability of case management and the program’s stipulated time free from heroin

dependence led to increments in demand. Also, we were able to provide stronger validation

through revealed preference. The 245 respondents in our trial were randomized after our

survey to treatment with case management (Strengths Based Case Management (SBCM)) or

without case management. Assignment was revealed right after the WTP survey was

conducted and subjects who were assigned to SBCM immediately received an initial session

with a case manager. We subsequently observed whether the client actually followed through

with the referral and later enrolled in the assigned treatment program by record linkage with

the Baltimore Substance Abuse System. As reported in a separate paper 39.8% of clients

assigned SBCM enrolled in treatment, compared to 26.5% of those in the control arm

(Strathdee, S. A., Erin Ricketts, S Huettner, Llewellyn J. Cornelius, D Bishai, Jennifer R.

Havens, P. Beilenson, J. J. Lloyd, C Rapp, and Carl A. Latkin 2004). This 12.8 percentage

point difference in enrollment rates is similar to the difference between the demand curves

for case management in the two curves shown in Figure 3.

       We found that product attributes, especially price, are the most powerful determinant

of the decision to purchase. Thus, program characteristics may be the best vehicle on which

to base price discrimination.
       Policy Implications. The key policy issue is how to increase the number of heroin

users who obtain treatment. Our findings suggest a perhaps greater role for private payments.

With Ramsey pricing and price discrimination for private payers, the total revenue for

treatment clinics could be expanded. Currently, there is ample price discrimination not only

by individuals paying out of pocket, but also by public payers and private insurers. However,

taking a Ramsey pricing approach might help to optimize the system and to provide greater

benefits through treatment. The administrative challenges of actually imposing a system of

Ramsey prices that charged each client in perfect proportion to their willingness to pay would

be formidable. Instead of individual level price discrimination, market segmentation might be

more likely. The market could be segmented perhaps by clinic or by program within a clinic,

with some clinics or programs offering higher service quality or specific services which

would attract those more willing to pay. Our study shows that case management or concierge

type services increase willingness to pay. Issues of equity might surface with such price

discrimination, but this concern would by partially offset by the potential to increase funds

for treatment. The cyclical nature of demand would be difficult to address, however, as

addicts drop in and out of treatment repeatedly during the course of their disease. It would be

far better to use a dynamic subsidy system to keep individuals in treatment, but it would be

quite difficult to design an effective, dynamic subsidy system.

       Although our estimates suggest a role for private payments, our estimates of expected

revenue from heroin addicts fall significantly short of being able to finance the full cost of

drug rehabilitation. According to our estimates, a drug rehabilitation system that could

maintain a discriminatory pricing regimen would obtain a median expected revenue per

addict of $7.40 to $17.11 per week with a clientele similar to our sample. This would not
cover the cost of outpatient methadone maintenance programs which average $82 per week,

with the least cost program at $42 per week (Roebuck, M. C., M. T. French, and A. T.

McLellan 2003). This suggests that subsidies ranging from $65 to $75 per patient per week

would be necessary in order to make up the difference. Note that counseling based drug

treatment costs considerably less and the length of stay is much shorter, but there are no data

on WTP.

        One could argue for subsidies equal to the full cost of treatment because of the large

negative externalities of drug use joint with the fact that drug users seems resistant to

entering treatment on their own (many come to treatment under the duress of the criminal

justice). Indeed, a prior study found that the availability of free drug treatment was the most

important predictor of actual treatment entry (Booth, R. E., C. Kwiatkowski, M. Y. Iguchi, F.

Pinto, and D. John 1998). However, co-payments generate income and the revenue could be

used to increase the supply of treatment slots and conduct outreach. Demand for treatment

might be increased by using the revenue for social marketing (e.g. public service

announcements) if some of the revenues accrued to government payers. To the extent that

providers reap some of the revenue of higher co-payments, they could finance marketing

campaigns for their clinics which might spillover benefits to increasing the overall demand as

well as attract clients to their specific clinic.

        Another alternative to increasing demand would be to pay drug addicts to seek

treatment. The optimal co-payment for selected addicts could be negative in order to attract

addicts who presently have no desire for treatment. “Contingency management” techniques

are currently being designed to pay those in treatment to attend counseling sessions and to

make payments contingent on verified abstinence from drugs. Some of the systems are
designed with escalating payments systems which increase the price of use of drugs over

time and with ‘booster payments’. These systems have been found to be effective and could

perhaps serve as the basis of a dynamic negative subsidy (Petry, N.M., J. Pierce, M.L.

Stitzer, J. Blaine, J.M. Roll, and A. Cohen 2005).

       This study shows that drug addicts’ demand depends on price, service amenities and

perceived treatment outcomes. Estimates of addicts’ price elasticity for drug treatment have

many policy applications, one of which is the development of an optimal subsidy system.

Segmentation of the market for drug rehabilitation is currently practiced in many urban areas

and enables programs to charge differential user fees based on accompanying amenities like

service hours and locations. The appropriate deployment of cost-sharing mechanisms can

increase the revenue for programs and potentially free up public funds to further expand

treatment availability and conduct outreach. Informed and thoughtful development of cost-

sharing mechanisms for drug treatment can expand service capacity and reduce the negative

externalities associated with drug use.
