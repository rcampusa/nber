                                         ABSTRACT

Before the 2008 crisis, the cross-sectional skewness of banks' leverage went up and macro risk
concentrated in the balance sheets of large banks. Using a model of profit-maximizing banks with
heterogeneous Value-at-Risk constraints, we extract the distribution of banks' risk-taking
parameters from balance sheet data. The time series of these estimates allow us to understand
systemic risk and its concentration in the banking sector over time. Counterfactual exercises show
that (1) monetary policymakers confront the trade-off between stimulating the economy and
financial stability, and (2) macroprudential policies can be effective tools to increase financial
stability.

1.     Introduction

     Financial crises are a recurring phenomenon in economic history. Their consequences
on growth and investment can be severe and protracted, as the Great Financial Crisis of
2008 so clearly illustrated. Eichengreen and Portes (1987) write that "much as the study
of disease is one of the most effective ways to learn about human biology, the study of
financial crises provides one of the most revealing perspectives on the functioning of monetary
economies." There is now substantial evidence showing that credit expansions can end in
crashes materializing in banking crises and recessions, (e.g., Borio and Lowe, 2002; Mian
and Sufi, 2009; Schularick and Taylor, 2012; Fouliard, Howell and Rey, 2020). However, the
mechanism and characteristics of credit expansions as well as their root causes remain largely
elusive. Making progress on those fronts is key for policymakers in charge of macroprudential
policies.
     In this paper, we start from three facts important facts. First, there is substantial
heterogeneity in risk-taking across financial intermediaries, particularly during credit booms,
and some large actors are particularly reckless. Leverage increases on average in the financial
system during booms, but some banks gain market share rapidly. Wilmarth (2014) for the
US before 2008, Englund (2016) for Sweden before 1992, Santos (2017) and Hellwig (2018)
for Spain and Germany respectively before 2008 all show in their case studies on crises that a
subset of large actors took excessive amounts of macro risk before the crash. For example,
Deutsche Bank leveraged up to quadruple the size of its balance sheet from about e0.5
trillion in early 1990s to about e2 trillion in 2008 as a return of equity (RoE) of 25% was
regularly targeted by the bank CEO. Second, as explained in Adrian and Shin (2010); Adrian
and Boyarchenko (2012); Stulz (2016), banks and other financial institutions make extensive
use of value-at-risk (VaR) measures to manage their risk. Firms estimate the probability
of making losses that could put them in financial distress or default. A certain amount of
losses that is exceeded with a probability p over one month gives the VaR over one month at


                                              1
the probability level p. The use of VaR is ubiquitous in the financial sector. Third, there is
great variation across financial intermediaries regarding how VaR are calculated and how
internal risk models of banks are evaluated. A prima facie example of that variation is the
exercise performed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, who undertook a review
of the consistency of risk weights used by a sample of banks (Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision, 2013). Those risk weights, for a given portfolio, depend on internal risk models
of the different institutions. When given a diversified test portfolio, the surveyed banks,
who knew they were answering their regulators, produced a wide range of results in terms
of modeled VaR and gave answers ranging from 13 million to 33 million euros in terms of
capital requirement with a median of about 18 million. These differences in VaR modeling
may be reflecting corporate culture (risk appetite of the boards as discussed by Stulz, 2016)
or different interactions between banks and their national supervisors, some being much
more prescriptive than others. The tightness of VaR constraints varies substantially across
institutions.
   In this paper, we zoom on this heterogeneity in risk-taking by analyzing the evolution of
the cross-sectional composition of the balance sheets of financial intermediaries. We estimate
the distribution of their VaR constraint parameters and show how they change over time as
macroeconomic conditions and regulations fluctuate. We show that the time variation and
the shape of the estimated distributions of the VaR parameters are very good predictors of
bank performance and carry important information on systemic risk. Importantly, we find
that it is crucial to consider the heterogeneity across different financial intermediaries as the
larger share of time variation in our measure comes from the cross-section. Simply looking
at changes in aggregate leverage in the system would therefore miss an essential part of the
story. As an aside, our measure outperforms those based on asset prices when predicting
aggregate risk. In spirit, our systemic risk indicator is related to Baron and Xiong (2017)
who link bank credit expansion to negative predicted excess returns of the bank equity index
in the next three years, but we estimate structural parameters at the bank level rather than

outcome variables at the country level.
    Figure 1 presents the time series of asset-weighted leverage for quantiles of a broad
cross-section of financial intermediaries worldwide. There is clearly substantial heterogeneity
in the cross-sectional dynamics of asset-weighted leverage. In the build-up to the 2008
crisis, the intermediaries that were already the most leveraged were the ones that increased
asset-weighted leverage the most, while the middle and lower quantiles tended to decrease
their asset-weighted leverage during this period. This indicates that the rise in asset-weighted
leverage pre-crisis was driven primarily by large, highly levered intermediaries and not by
small ones with little macroeconomic importance.
    Simply looking at changes in leverage to assess systemic risk could however be misleading
as the implications for financial stability can be very different depending on the main driver
behind such changes. In the words of Gorton and Ordo~
                                                    nez (2019), there are good booms
and bad booms. For example, if changes in growth and investment opportunities are driving
leverage, that might have very different implications from a case where leverage is being
driven by a rise in the supply of credit by intermediaries due to low cost of funds or a rise in
risk appetite. By using a structural model, we can make progress on those issues. Coimbra


                                                3
and Rey (2020) develop a full general equilibrium model of good booms and bad booms and
of the risk-taking channel of monetary policy.
   Our empirical strategy relies on two assumptions: i) leveraged financial intermediaries
maximize profits under their specific VaR constraints, and ii) the VaR parameters follow a
time-varying Beta distribution. We use a maximum likelihood approach applied to Com-
pustat Fundamentals Annual data from 1993 to 2018 to estimate the distribution of VaR
parameters from leverage data. The estimated risk-taking behavior closely relates to observed
intermediaries' distress and to both market and book returns, providing external validity to
our estimates.
   We then use the results to understand how changes in the distribution of risk-taking
affect financial instability. Aggregate systemic risk -- the probability of a systemic crisis
occurring -- can be measured by the asset-weighted mean of VaR parameters. An individual
intermediary's contribution to our systemic risk measure is then a combination of its size
and balance sheet risk. Our measure indicates that systemic risk is very concentrated, with
the top 5% intermediaries contributing to about 79% of the total value on average and also
driving most of the variation over time. Also, we find strong evidence that it is crucial to
account for heterogeneity in macro-finance research. A measure consisting of a representative
intermediary with average leverage would only explain around 22% of the systemic risk
measure.
   We find that systemic risk increased between 2000 and 2008 as liquidity was abundant
in the global economy and regulatory policies were loose. It decreased after the financial
crisis when banking regulations were gradually tightened. According to our structural
interpretation, changes in the distribution of risk-taking pre-crisis were driven by a fall in the
cost of funds (due in part to the abundance of world savings and loose monetary policy) and
to weak bank and financial markets regulation. We perform two counterfactual exercises; one
where we consider what would have happened with higher costs of funds; and another one
without changes in the regulatory environment post-crisis. The recent decline of systemic


                                                4
risk measures stems from changes in the post-global financial crisis's regulatory environment.
Monetary policy faces a trade-off between stimulating the economy (low interest rate, low
cost of funds) and financial stability. Low interest rates generate incentives for intermediaries
to borrow, which increases systemic risk, but also may be necessary from the point of view of
economic activity. These results suggest that macroprudential policy can serve as a useful
complement to monetary policy.1 .
         The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents a framework and estimation
strategy for investigating heterogeneity in risk-taking behavior. Section 3 documents the
estimation results and validation of our framework. Section 4 provides evidence on systematic
relationships among risk-taking behavior, bank performance, and financial crisis. Section 5
analyzes systemic risk. In Section 6, we explore different counterfactuals in order to better
understand the role of monetary policy and regulatory policy changes. Section 7 concludes.


2.         A Framework with Heterogeneity in Risk-Taking

2.1.        Model

         This section presents our empirical framework to analyze the heterogeneous risk-taking
behavior of financial intermediaries. Consider a financial sector composed of a continuum of
financial intermediaries in a competitive environment. An intermediary i is a risk-neutral
agent that maximizes its profit subject to a Value-at-Risk (VaR) constraint. This constraint
imposes that intermediary i chooses an investment strategy such that the probability its
return on equity is negative is smaller than an intermediary-specific parameter i,t . A large
i,t will therefore denote a high risk tolerance while a low i,t will characterize a more
conservative bank. Specifically, the VaR constraint can be written as:


                                             Pr(i,t+1 < i,t )  i,t .                                        (1)
     1
         See Coimbra and Rey (2020); Caballero and Simsek (2020) for theoretical discussions about these issues.



                                                         5
This condition imposes that intermediary i invests in such a way that the probability of
distress ­ negative returns on equity ­ must be no greater than an intermediary-specific
threshold parameter i,t . Negative returns on equity occur when its cash flow i,t+1 is smaller
                                                                              a
than starting equity i,t . We assume that the idiosyncratic return of assets ri,t +1 is an

independent and identically distributed random variable Zt+1 . The conditional mean and
                                 2
variance of ln Zt+1 are µZ,t and Z,t , respectively. The deposit (debt) di,t is contracted at the
                                d                                          a              d
costs of funds (interest rate) rt . The cash flow, thus, is i,t+1 = i,t + ri,t +1 ai,t - rt di,t where

ai,t are total assets. For a participating intermediary i, the VaR constraint binds because of
risk neutrality2 . For convenience, introduce Zte+1 = exp(µZ,t ). After some straightforward
algebra, we obtain the following equation that links the leverage i,t , defined as assets divided
by equity, to the threshold i,t

                                                         d
                                          ai,t          rt
                                   i,t         = d                   ,                                (2)
                                          i,t   rt - Zte+1 Qt (i,t )

where we define Qt (·) by the quantile function (inverse cumulative distribution function) of
Zt+1 /Zte+1 . The mapping between leverage and the parameter i,t varies systemically with
macroeconomic fundamentals: expected asset returns, interest rate, and uncertainty.
       Equation (2) allows us to use the leverage of financial intermediaries observed in the data
and the VaR constraint to infer risk-taking and fundamental macroeconomic parameters. The
equation can be rewritten in terms of the debt-to-asset ratio i,t which can be conveniently
expressed as follows.3

                                     i,t  1 -        = t Qt (i,t ),                                   (3)

where t = Zte+1 /rt

   2
     In Coimbra and Rey (2020), intermediaries endogenously choose whether to participate or not in the
market for risky projects. They also choose how much to leverage based on macroeconomic conditions and
their characteristics. Non participating intermediaries invest in a safe storage technology.
   3
     Since the debt-to-asset ratio is bounded between 0 and 1, its moments always exist. However, leverage
can be theoretically infinite. Its upper tail is fat, thus some moments do not exist.


                                                    6
Qt (·) embeds some macroeconomic variables such as the expected volatility of returns. Qt (·)
falls ceteris paribus when volatility rises so that a bank needs to decrease leverage if it wants
to keep constant its level of risk-taking. Coimbra and Rey (2020) show that VaR constraints
                                                                               2
get looser when the cost of funds is low (high t ), and volatility is low (low Z,t ), and that
such conditions enable the more risk-tolerant intermediaries to leverage up massively. When
interest rates are low or when the volatility of returns is low, the probability of distress is
lower, ceteris paribus. In that region, increases in leverage translate into small increases in
the probability of distress, which implies that intermediaries can increase leverage by sizable
amounts until they hit the VaR constraint. Similarly, for looser VaR constraints, leverage
can be increased a lot before the constraint is hit. Thus, the most risk-taking intermediaries'
leverage will respond more to changes in the cost of funds. This heterogeneity of leverage to
changes in the cost of funds means a more skewed cross-sectional distribution of leverage as
interest rates fall. This generates a composition effect, where the proportion of assets being
held by the more risk-taking intermediary rises. Since the intensive margin effect is more
significant with low interest, it follows that this composition effect is particularly strong at
low interest rates.


2.2.   Estimation Strategy

   To make use of the structure of our model, we make two parametric assumptions, which
are very general. We first assume that ln Zt+1 follows a logistic distribution with parameters
                                                                            
                                                                               
(µZ,t , Z,t ). Its mean and standard deviation are thus µZ,t and Z,t = Z,t    / 3, respectively.
                                                                                
Zt+1 /Zte+1 therefore follows the log-logistic distribution with parameters (0, Z,t ), and the
                                                        
quantile function Qt is given by Qt (p) = [p/(1 - p)]Z,t . Second, we assume that the cross-
sectional distribution of risk-taking ability (VaR threshold) follows a Beta distribution:
     ub                                   ub
i,t /t   Beta(L,t , R,t ) on (0, 1) where t   1 is the upper bound of i,t for period t.
Beta distributions are widely used in statistical models of bounded random variables due to
                             ub
their flexibility. Note that t  is the upper bound of the support of i,t at t so will in general


                                               7
be larger than the (finite) sample maximum. L,t and R,t are shape parameters for the left
and right tails, respectively.4 The shape of the right tail parametarizes the concentration
of risk on the balance sheet of the most risk-taking intermediaries. This is a particularly
important parameter as the larger the mass of high risk intermediaries, the less financially
stable the economy.
         Given our parametric assumptions, the debt-to-asset ratio follows the McDonald and
Xu (1995)'s five parameters generalized beta distribution with t = {p,t , s,t , c,t , L,t , R,t },
                                                            
                                                   ub Z,t ub
where {p,t , s,t , c,t , L,t , R,t } = {1/Z,t , t (t ) , t   , L,t , R,t }.5 The generalized beta
distribution nests many distributions used in economics and finance, for example, the Burr,
gamma, beta, log normal, Weibull, log-logistic, Pareto, uniform, and exponential distributions.
Therefore, despite our parametric assumptions, the shape of the distribution of i,t is relatively
unrestricted and is mostly determined by the underlying data itself. The probability density
function (pdf) is

                                                                                    R,t -1
                                     p,t xp,t L,t -1 1 - (1 - c,t ) (x/s,t )p,t
                 pdf (x|t ) =                                                          L,t +R,t
                                                                                                           (4)
                                      p,t L,t                                    p,t
                                (s,t )          B (L,t , R,t ) 1 + c,t (x/s,t )


on (0, s,t / (1 - c,t )1/p,t ). From our structural model, it follows that the power p,t and
scale parameters s,t are positive and we include that restriction in the estimation. The
parameter c,t determines the class of distribution: values c,t  0 and c,t  1 imply beta
distributions of the first and second kind, respectively. L,t and R,t are the left and right

     We are interested in a random variable on a non-negative support. Thus, we assume that p,t and s,t
are positive. However, the original five parameter generalized beta distribution does not restrict p,t and
s,t , and it can have a negative support. See McDonald and Xu (1995) for details of the five parameter
generalized beta distribution. Also, see McDonald (1984); Cummins et al. (1990); McDonald and Xu (1995,?);
Parker (1999); Cowell and Flachaire (2015); Kakamu and Nishino (2019); Higbee and McDonald (2021) for
applications of the generalized beta distribution.

       Rather than assuming a particular time series-structure for the parameters, we estimate
t each year using a weighted maximum likelihood (ML) method:

         subject to p,t , s,t , L,t , R,t > 0, s,t < 2, c,t = 1 - s,t /t                 , and t  = 1.


The log-likelihood function is weighted by log size (measured by assets) so that we take into
account that larger intermediaries are economically more important than smaller ones.6
       We restrict the parameter space so that the distribution is defined only when L,t , R,t ,
                                                                          ub
and s,t are positive as in standard generalized Beta distributions. Since t  should be less
than one, we obtain s,t < t , where t defined in equation (3) is the spread, i.e. the ratio of
expected returns on assets over the cost of funds. Thus, setting the upper bound on t to
two (which implies s,t < 2, is equivalent to setting an upper bound on the margin of above
one hundred percentage points, which is again quite unrestrictive. The restriction on c,t
                                          ub
derives from the support of distribution: t  = s,t /(1 - c,t )1/p,t . We fix the upper bound
of the debt-to-asset ratio at one because the maximum debt-to-asset ratio we observe during
any year is almost one.
       Before applying the ML procedure to the balance sheet data, we drop intermediaries with
leverage in the bottom ten percent of our sample over the whole period7 . Our specification
relies on the model-derived binding VaR constraint faced by endogenously-levered financial
intermediaries in the previous section. However, some intermediaries' VaR constraints might
not be binding: in the structural model of Coimbra and Rey (2020) there is a cutoff value
of the VaR threshold, below which an intermediary j will choose not to leverage up to its
constraint.8 For those intermediaries, the VaR constraint does not bind, and our empirical

     The cutoff systemically varies with economic conditions. Thus we drop the bottom five or ten percent of
our whole period sample, not each year.

asset ratio) intermediaries in the estimation stage. However, after the ML estimation, the
construction of our systemic risk measure and counterfactual analysis use the entire sample.


3.         Heterogeneous Intermediaries and Their Distribution

         This section applies the ML procedure to the balance sheet data of financial intermediaries.
Compustat Fundamentals Annual data from 1993 to 2018 yields a yearly sample with 584
observations on average and with observation counts ranging from 448 to 521.9 We also
impose certain filtering criteria such as, for example, excluding observations with negative
equity or negative assets. Appendix A provides more details on the sample used.

power and scale parameters. We discuss their economic implications below. In Appendix B,
Figure A5 shows our estimated distribution of debt-to-asset ratios for each year. Overall the
fit seems quite good, which shows the benefit of using a highly flexible and general class of
distributions for our estimation.
   Once we have estimated the distribution parameters, we can use observed leverage to
recover the implied risk-taking of each intermediary i using equation (2):

                                                                                      ^p,t
                                                                    ^c,t (1 - 1/i,t )
                                                                    
                             ^ i,t          = (i,t |^ t) =                                       ,                            (5)
                                                                                            ^p,t
                                                             (^s,t )^p,t
                                                                         +  ^ct (1 - 1/i,t )


where the function (i,t |^ t ) is independent of the left and right tail parameters ^L,t and
^R,t , respectively. Conditional on the estimated parameters in equation (5), concentration in

risk-taking emerges from the concentration in leverage. Of course, all parameter estimates
are dependent on the entire sample distribution for each year.
   In Figure 2, we observe that L,t is smaller than one, while R,t is greater than one for
all periods. These results imply that the density of i,t is strictly decreasing, as Figure 4



                                                                 11
shows. We find that the risk-taking of financial intermediaries is right (i.e., positively) skewed.
Dynamically, the left tail parameter is quite stable over time, while there is significant
variation in the right tail. Before the financial crisis, the right tail parameter decreased,
implying a thicker right tail in the risk-taking distribution. A low right tail parameter implies
more intermediaries taking high risks.11 As we can infer from the relationship between
leverage and i,t , the distribution of leverage also has a thicker right tail, and we can observe
a significant growth in risk-taking (higher i,t ) in the run-up to the crisis (Figure 4 ). In
recent years, this trend has reversed, and the right tail parameter has risen. This recent
trend likely results from significant changes in banking regulation imposed by the Basel III
Accord as shown in Figure 3. As can be seen from the measure of macroprudential policy
stance of Forbes (2021)12 , macroprudential policies were largely nonexistent in advanced
economies before 2009. In that environment where the dominant supervision doctrine was
one of "laissez-faire", banks were stretching regulatory frameworks to their limits. Some of
them were increasing their leverage massively without any corresponding increase in their
value-at-risk: leverage was going up over time while estimated risk-weighted capital stayed
constant. This period of lax regulation and laissez-faire is captured by a decrease in the right
tail parameter between 1999 and 2008. After the crisis, macroprudential regulations were
gradually tightened in all advanced economies, supervisors became much more active, and
our right tail parameter went back up.
       Central to our estimation strategy are the intermediaries' VaR constraints, which are
hard to get directly from the data13 . Fitting the implied moments of risk-taking i,t and
uncertainty (volatility) Z,t , however, can serve as an indirect test of our empirical framework.
We perform a number of external validation checks of our estimates. Figure 4 shows the
  11
      In Table A2 we can also observe that the period of 2000-2008 was characterized by a low right tail
parameter when compared to both the preceding period (1993-2000) and the post-crisis period of 2009-2018.
   12
      We are very grateful to Kristin Forbes for sharing her data and calculations of the macroprudential policy
stance.
   13
      Some large banks report some of their VaRs. However, they do not cover their entire balance sheet;
because they depend on internal risk models for specific portfolios, they do not represent the aggregate
risk-taking behavior of intermediaries, which is our parameter of interest.

estimated distribution of risk-taking behavior and some cross-sectional statistics over time.
In the figure, the mean and median plots are inversely U-shaped. The peak of intermediaries'
risk-taking, on average, is around the financial crisis, with a sustained rise between 1999 and
2008. This pattern corresponds to the U-shape of right-tail parameters over time in Figure 2.
That pattern implies that the right tail movements mainly drive the distribution changes
over time. In Figure 4, one can see that the right tail around 2008 is fatter than that of 2018
or 2013. Interestingly, we also see that the dispersion of risk-taking parameters is increasing
markedly before the crisis. This fits very well with the papers cited in the introduction which
emphasize a race for a market share of the most reckless financial intermediaries during boom
times, while the most conservative ones hold back. Understanding the time variations in the
distribution of risk-taking parameters is important because they are systemically related to
financial instability in the macroeconomy.

Figure 5: Uncertainty: The figure plots implied uncertainty (%) 100 × Z,t = 100 × /(p,t 3)
from the estimation results (blue line with circles) with 95% intervals (light blue shades) and
long-run risk measure (red line) as an uncertainty measure. The long-run risk measure comes from
Schorfheide, Song and Yaron (2018)'s structural model estimation.



       To check our model's validity, we also look at whether the secular trends in our implied
uncertainty measure are consistent with traditional measures in the literature. Figure 5
illustrates estimates for uncertainty in asset returns derived from our structural model as
               
Z,t = /(p,t 3). We find an increasing secular trend of implied uncertainty, up to the
financial crisis, with a slight reversion in its aftermath. Even though we do not use any
standard macro variables and extract information only from the cross-sectional moments
of leverage alongside our structural model, the implied uncertainty of the economy shows
a similar pattern to the macroeconomic risk of long-term economic growth estimated by
Schorfheide, Song and Yaron (2018): i.e., the volatility of the persistent component in the
long-run risk model. Comin and Philippon (2005); Kehrig (2015); Bloom et al. (2018); Farhi
and Gourio (2018); Schorfheide, Song and Yaron (2018) document similar patterns of rising
volatility or uncertainty in macro and macro-finance.14

    More precisely, our implied uncertainty changes are consistent with 1) Farhi and Gourio (2018)'s risk
component of the spread between the marginal product of capital and the risk-free rates, 2) Schorfheide, Song
and Yaron (2018)'s estimate of long-run risk components, 3) Comin and Philippon (2005); Kehrig (2015);
Bloom et al. (2018) document a similar pattern of (respectively) rising volatility, dispersion and uncertainty
in macro.

4.       Risk-Taking and Economic Performance

4.1.      Risk-Taking Behavior and Financial Distress

       To provide external validation of our estimates, we now study the link between estimated
VaR parameters and outcomes. The VaR parameter should have a strong link with the
intermediary's risk-taking and, therefore, its economic performance. More precisely, the
estimated VaR parameter should strongly predict the (ex-post) default or distress of individual
financial intermediaries. We check whether our measure predicts bank outcomes, despite not
using any specific information about those in our estimation procedure.
       As equation (5) highlights, the VaR parameter is the probability that returns on equity are
negative. A negative RoE may lead to default, liquidation, delisting, and/or being acquired.
We construct a default dummy Def aulti,t using a strict definition of default15 . We also
construct a distress event dummy Distressi,t using combinations of the following events:
(1) income is non-positive, (2) equity becomes non-positive, and (3) existed in the previous
period but is no longer available in the current period. The benchmark distress dummy
Distressi,t has value one if (1), (2), or (3) occurs at time t + 1, and 0 otherwise. As an
alternative, we also consider (2) and (3) for a more narrowly defined distress event.16 Table 1
  15
     When Research Company Reason for Deletion (dlrsni ) is identified as 02 (Bankruptcy) or 03 (Liquidation).
This definition is, however, very limited because of missing labels in the data. In our sample, only 0.1%
of banks are identified explicitly as bankrupt or liquidated, which is significantly lower than what can be
inferred from FDIC data.
  16
     More precisely, in the benchmark, Distressi,t = 1 when the following cases occur: (1) Income is non-
positive: ibi,t+1  0, (2) Research Company Deletion Date is non-empty dldtei = ·, and t is the last period

We use a logistic estimation. The dependent variable is the one-year ahead distress dummy. Other controls

shows some summary statistics for quantiles values of the estimated VaR parameter around
the global financial crisis. We observe that the subset of banks that defaulted or were in
distress indeed have significantly larger estimated risk-taking parameters than the population
and that this difference is larger, the stricter the definition is. This comforts us in the view
that our estimated distributions capture risk-taking meaningfully.
    For an investigation of the statistical relation between VaR parameters and realized
distress events17 , we estimate the following logistic regression equation:


                           Distressi,t = b0 + b1 i,t + (ln xi,t )T b + i,t + i,t ,                            (6)


The bank corporate trait vector is denoted by xi,t and includes dividend yield, book to
market ratio, and asset size. Note that our regressions also include various fixed effects
denoted broadly by i,t . We include a bank, bank type, country, and/or year fixed effects.18

Figure 6: Risk-Taking Behavior and Bank Performance: The figures plot each year cross-
sectional correlation between a bank's lagged risk-taking measure (i,t ) and its performance measure
(the y-axis) and each period average performance of banks weighted by the equity (the x-axis).
Bank performance is measured by stock returns (left) and return on equity (right). See Figure A6
for the corresponding figure with return on asset.



These fixed effects allow us to control for (i) any time-invariant firm-specific, sub-sector, and
cross-country differences that might affect the distress and (ii) time-varying characteristics
that influence the distress.
    Table 2 provides statistically significant evidence on the positive association of our
risk-taking measure (VaR parameter) with ex-post bank distress. Our VaR parameter is
consistently positively associated with a higher probability of distress for all our specifications.
We now look at whether the pattern of stock returns is also consistent with our structural
model.


4.2.                  Risk-Taking Behavior and Stock Returns

    Conventional theory suggests that high risk-taking intermediaries' ex-post returns should
be larger in good times, but that their losses should be larger in bad times (see Miranda-
Agrippino and Rey (2020)). We now use the estimated risk-taking behavior in the previous
section to predict stock returns during good and bad times in order to provide further evidence
on the external validity of our estimates.

                                                                                        17
       Figure 6 highlights that the cross-sectional correlation between the lagged VaR parameter
and bank performance (measured by stock returns or return on equity) fluctuates over time.
The relationship between intermediary risk-taking and performance depends on the banking
sector's aggregate performance. When the banking sector performs well, high risk-taking
intermediaries earn more than others, thus profiting from their aggressive approach. The
cross-sectional correlation between lagged VaR and returns is then positive. However, when
returns are negative, they also make the largest losses, and the correlation turns negative.
       To examine whether bank's risk-taking behavior matters for stock returns more formally,
we use the following panel regression:

corporate trait vector is denoted by xi,t and includes dividend yield, book to market ratio, and
asset size. Our regression also includes various fixed effects denoted by i,t . We include a bank,
year-bank type, and/or year-country fixed effects.19 These fixed effects allow us to control (i)
any time-invariant financial intermediaries' characteristics that generate a firm-specific trend
in stock returns, (ii) any time-varying and time-invariant sub-sector differences that might
affect stock returns, and (iii) time-varying and time-invariant country characteristics that
influence the stock market performances.
       In Table 3, we present the results of the panel regression model specified in equation (7)
using three different samples.20 Columns (1), (4), and (7) correspond to results associated
with the entire sample. Intermediary market returns increase when they take more risk.

The dependent variable is the excess stock return. Other controls are dividend yield, book to market ratio,

returns. Columns (3), (6), and (9) only include intermediaries with negative excess market returns.



When an intermediary's VaR threshold parameter increases one basis point, its stock return
increases between 0.71% and 1.64%. Risk-taking is, on average, compensated by larger
returns, as expected. We also consider the following two subsamples. In Columns (2),
(5), and (8), we first include intermediaries with positive excess market returns. Second,
Columns (3), (6), and (9) contain intermediaries with negative excess market returns. When
intermediaries succeed, their market returns are increasing in risk-taking. However, their
returns are decreasing in risk-taking when they fail.
    Figure 6 provides descriptive evidence supporting the prediction that high risk-taking
financial intermediaries lose more than others if bad states occur. In Table 4, we test this
hypothesis by interacting the estimated risk-taking behavior ln i,t with dummies indicating
financial crises at t + 1 in regression equation (7). As expected, the estimated coefficients of
the interaction term are significantly negative. Risk-taking predicts excess returns but also
larger volatility of returns and their pattern over the business cycle. All this is consistent
with the conventional view of risk-taking and returns. Note that even though we did not use
any information on returns or additional business cycle variables to estimate i , our measures

5.     Systemic Risk and Concentration of Risk

     In this section, we use our structural measures of risk-taking to generate a simple aggregate
measure that is indicative of risk in the financial sector as a whole. We depart from our
individual measures of risk-taking, and although we could in practice use information from
the entire set of moments of the distribution, we take a simple approach and provide a
scalar index of systemic risk. To do so, we simply weigh the risk-taking parameter of each
intermediary by its balance sheet size. Intuitively this corresponds to the ex-ante probability
that a certain proportion of assets are in the hands of distressed intermediaries.
     Using equation (5), observed leverage i,t and the set of estimated parameters ^ t , we

can recover the implied empirical distribution of ^ i,t and calculate measures of systemic risk
such as AW
        t  , the asset-weighted mean of VaR parameters. We can of course also recover

                Our benchmark measure of systemic risk is the asset-weighted mean of risk-taking AW

which takes into account the size of each intermediary in the macroeconomy. For example,
an economy with one safe and one very risky intermediary will not have the same amount of
macroeconomic risk if the risky bank only holds 5% of assets or holds 95% of the assets. A nice

                                                                                                                                          21
feature of our framework is that we have a direct mapping between the underlying parameters
of our VaR framework and different relevant definitions of systemic risk such as "ex-ante
probability that a certain percentage of assets are in the hands of distressed intermediaries"
or "ex-ante probability that the entire leverage sector (or x% of it) is distressed".
   In Figure 7, we present the time series of the asset-weighted mean of estimated risk-taking
AW
t  which is the asset-weighted (ex-ante) probability of distress (VaR parameter) of the
entire sample of intermediaries. We compare it in each panel to an alternative measure of
systemic risk taken from the literature. We estimate AW
                                                     t  from the Compustat Fundamentals
Annual data using the methodology described above. As is clear from the figure, our estimates
suggest a significant increase in systemic risk between 2000 and 2008 as liquidity conditions
in the global economy were loose and regulation were lax, and a significant decline after 2008
and as banking regulations tightened. In the next section, we provide counterfactual exercises
in which we explore further these different factors.
   Figure 7 also compares our measure to 3 different alternatives. In the left panel, we
compare it to a simple asset-weighted mean of leverage. This illustrates the usefulness of
the structural model, as asset-weighted leverage completely misses the increased systemic
risk during the European sovereign debt crisis and seems to be relatively flat almost until
2008 when the crisis actually hits. This delayed rise is also there to an even greater extent
with the CoVaR measure, which dramatically rises in 2008 but gave no early warning signs
to a policymaker observing the measure in the preceding years. This is a common problem
with price-based measures: when they predict a crisis, it is too late. Credit growth (middle
panel) seems to exhibit the most similar pattern to our measure, but it would also miss the
European sovereign debt crisis and peak a couple of years before the crisis.
   In order to explore further the role of heterogeneity in risk-taking across intermediaries we
decompose our systemic risk measure AW
                                    t  into a representative average component and an
heterogeneous component. Using the definition of leverage, we express assets as ai,t = i,t i,t ,

                                Here, the first and second components represent the
contribution of average and heterogeneous financial intermediaries, respectively. Intuitively,
the average component considers the risk-taking of a representative intermediary with mean
risk-taking, while the heterogeneity component is the sum of the additional contributions
arising from the deviations of each intermediary from the representative agent's behavior.
            Figure 8 highlights the importance of heterogeneous financial intermediaries in macro-
finance research. The first panel of Figure 8 shows that the average component plays a limited

    Alternatively, we can decompose the systemic risk measure as AW

                                                                                  (^                                                             j =1   aj,t )],
which does not yield significant difference from our decomposition in equation (8).



                                                                                        23
role in the fluctuations of our systemic risk measure, though it accounts for about 28.6% of
the measure on average.22 . However, the heterogeneous component drives the vast majority of
the dynamics and peaks exactly around the crisis, while the average component peak would
happen post-crisis and even seems to fall slightly in the run-up to the crisis. The correlation
coefficients of the systemic risk measure with the average and heterogeneous terms are 0.390
and 0.991, respectively. Considering heterogeneity is therefore extremely important, not only
in the estimation procedure but also for the dynamics and level of the systemic risk measure.
      The right panel of Figure 8 illustrates the concentration of risk and its changes over
time, showing the time series of systemic risk for the top 5% quantile of risk-taking behavior,
i,t . The top 5% of intermediaries contribute to 71.0% of systemic risk over the sample.23
Moreover, high quantiles are positively correlated with the aggregate systemic risk measure.
The correlation coefficient between aggregate systemic risk and contributions of the top 5%
is 0.817. The peak of the contribution of the lower 95% occurs in the aftermath of the crisis,
while the top 5% peaks in 2008. In Panel B of Table A1 we list the 20 institutions with
the largest asset-weighted  in 2008 and their respective values in 2006 and 2010. These
intermediaries, whether investment banks or universal banks, were highly levered and featured
very large balance sheets before the crisis. This highlights the disturbing fact that several
systemically important banks were engaging in significant risk-taking before the crisis.
      It is clear that risk-taking does not rise and fall across the board, but that there are
important cross-sectional patterns that would be missed by simply looking at averages or
aggregate variables. Modeling and tracking heterogeneity in the financial sector is important
as financial instability often arises from large, high risk-taking intermediaries.
 22
      The maximum and minimum share of the average component are 24.7 and 33.7%, respectively.
 23
      The maximum and minimum share of the top 5% quantile contribution are 44.6 and 78.8%, respectively.

6.       Counterfactual Analysis: Central Bank Policy

       This section presents two counterfactual exercises that provide insight into the impact
of banking regulation and monetary policy (cost of funds) on financial instability and their
contribution to our systemic risk measure dynamics.
       In the first, we perform a counterfactual exercise on the tightness of financial regulation
by fixing the right tail parameter R,t of our risk-taking distribution.24 Since regulatory
policy imposes limits to the risk-taking of intermediaries, it is natural to model changes in
regulatory policy by changes in the right tail parameter as it describes the behavior of the
riskiest players. A cap on leverage, for example, would affect the right tail parameter. We
estimate the extent to which increases in regulatory tightness affect the degree of systemic
risk. For our second exercise, we calculate counterfactual systemic risk measures by changing
the value of the ratio of expected returns on assets to the costs of funds t .25 In Coimbra
and Rey (2020), an expansionary monetary policy (low policy rate) directly lowers the cost
of funds but also compresses spreads through its impact on asset prices. Thus, our second
counterfactual exercise allows us to investigate the contribution of monetary policy to the
evolution of systemic risk.
       The counterfactual systemic risk measures are straightforward to calculate:

     · Step 0: Set the counterfactual parameter: ~ t .26

     · Step 1: Recover the the risk-taking behavior (VaR parameter) from the estimates of
  24
      As an alternative exercise, we could also fix both the left and right tail parameters. Because variations in
the left tail shape are small, this exercise would yield close to our benchmark counterfactual analysis with
the fixed right tail. Our counterfactual results with fixed R,t and fixed (L,t , R,t ) are indistinguishable.
Given our interpretation of regulation compressing the top tier of risk-taking, it seems natural to conduct our
counterfactual analysis on L,t .
  25
      The estimated ratio of expected asset returns to funding costs consists of three estimates:                    ^t =
^s,t ( ^c,t )- 1 / ^
                                    ^c,t and -1/   ^p,t are close to one and zero, respectively: 0.99 and -0.01
                    p,t
                        . Note that 
on average between 1993 and 2018. Thus,             ^s,t is the main driver of changes in         ^t over time. The power
                                                                              
parameter p,t is the mirror image of uncertainty: Z,t = /(p,t 3). The scale parameter s,t is the upper
                                        ub
bound of risk-taking behavior: t           = s,t . We set the scale parameter for the counterfactual exercise to be
~s,t =   ~(         1 / ^
              ^c,t ) p,t for given ~ and estimated   ^p,t and   ^c,t .

  26                                ^       ~      ^     ^
      For example, we consider t and t = {p,t , s,t , c,t ,   ^      ^L,t , ^R,2008 } to analyze impact of bank regulation
on systemic risk after the global financial crisis.

Figure 10: Counterfactual Analysis - Systemic Risk and Central Bank Policy: The first
figure plots the estimated right tail parameter (    ^R,t ) and the ratio of expected returns to costs
  ^t =  ^s,t (          ^
              ^c,t )-1/p,t ). The second and third figures plot the estimated systemic risk measure
(
(asset-weighted mean of risk-taking) and its counterfactual values. The solid black lines are implied
from the data and the estimates. The blue dash line with crosses is implied with the fixed value
of the right tail index of risk-taking behavior (  ~R,t =    ^R,2008 ). The red dash line with triangles
is implied with the fixed value of the ratio of the expected returns of asset to the cost of funds

        Figure 10 reports the benchmark systemic risk measures (solid black line with circles) and
their counterfactual counterparts. As the solid black line with circles in the middle and right
panels shows, financial instability measured by systemic risk decreased after the financial
crisis. On the left pane of Figure 10, we also show the evolution of the estimated R,t and
t in this period. The right tail parameter has trended upwards since the financial crisis,
indicating less concentration at the top of the risk-taking distribution. This could be due
to the tightening of the post-crisis regulatory environment, including the implementation of
Basel III. The transition from 2008 to 2018 involves the right tail becoming steadily thinner.
Figure 9 shows that the distributional changes are not due to changes in the class or left-tail
parameter, as the middle and right panel distributions are extremely similar to the estimated
ones in the left panel. Keeping the class or left tail parameters fixed at 2008 levels does not
impact our systemic risk measure. Coming back to Figure 10, the spread t fell steadily in
the years after the crisis and up to 2014. This indicates a loosening of funding conditions


                                                                                                                          27
during this period, at which point it stabilized and even rose slightly but remained at much
lower levels than in 2008.
       In the first counterfactual, we set the right tail parameter that governs risk behavior to
remain after the crisis at our 2008 estimates. The question we ask is therefore: "what would
have happened ceteris paribus to systemic risk if the precrisis lax regulatory policies had
stayed the same post crisis?". The answer can readily be seen on the second panel of Figure 10
which reports the counterfactual systemic risk measure (in blue) next to the benchmark (in
black). With a fixed right tail, systemic risk measures during 2011 and 2018 would be very
similar to that of 2008 and, more generally, consistently above the benchmark. Without
bank regulation, financial markets would struggle with instability which would remain near
their 2008 peak. Financial stability improvements after the financial crisis were thus driven
strongly by changes in the distribution tracked by the tail parameter and concerning high-risk
intermediaries. Banking regulation constraining risk-taking in the right tail has been effective.
       In the second counterfactual, we keep the spread, i.e., the ratio of expected returns on
assets to costs of funds, equal to our 2008 estimates. The question we ask is therefore: "what
would have happened ceteris paribus to systemic risk if the 2008 funding conditions had
stayed the same instead of the very loose post 2009 monetary policy?".29
       The right panel of Figure 10 shows the benchmark measure of systemic risk (in black)
with the counterfactual measure reflecting tighter funding conditions (in red). The 2018
benchmark systemic risk measure is considerably larger than that of 2018 counterfactual.
Without the expansionary monetary policy, financial markets would be more stable, as can
be seen by the counterfactual systemic risk measure being consistently below the benchmark
case. This illustrates the trade-off that monetary policy faces between stimulating the
economy (low-interest rate) and financial stability. A fall in interest rates gives an incentive
for intermediaries to take on more risk, which increases investment but also systemic risk. It
is important to note that our counterfactual systemic risk measure drops below the sample

minimum, which may not be desirable. Financial markets need a healthy degree of risk-taking
to function normally. It is not only possible but likely that financial markets would have been
too risk-averse with both tighter regulation and tighter funding conditions. It is important
to note that we do not believe that the lower values of our measure are always better; rather,
values approaching the higher end of the sample indicate that financial stability concerns
should be taken seriously. These results point to the importance of regulating and monitoring
high-risk financial intermediaries. They also advocate for a degree of complementarity between
monetary policy and macroprudential policies.


7.     Conclusion

     Financial stability and systemic risk have become essential concerns for monetary author-
ities worldwide. Measuring and tracking the financial system's stability requires indicators
that reflect the degree of risk-taking among intermediaries. Although simple observable
measures like leverage or credit growth can already provide meaningful information, they do
not always track balance sheet risk. Credit growth can be driven by many different causes,
such as, for example, more substantial investment opportunities or a fall in the cost of funds.
Given observed aggregate credit and leverage growth, the implications for financial stability
might be very different depending on the main driving cause.
     In this paper, we make use of bank-level leverage data and a structural model to extract
a distribution of intermediary risk-taking parameters. We use a simple Value-at-Risk (VaR)
framework in which intermediaries endogenously choose leverage based on macroeconomic
conditions (cost of funds, expected returns, and their volatility) and their characteristics. By
exploiting the cross-sectional dynamics of leverage in the data, we are able to distinguish
between different types of leverage booms and their implications for systemic risk. This way,
we are able to infer macroeconomic and financial conditions without the need of additional
variables. We show that our structural estimate of uncertainty is consistent with measures of
long-run risk and that our risk-taking measures help predict the probability of intermediary

                                              29
distress/failure as well as its economic performance, including its cyclical and cross-sectional
dynamics.
   Using our estimates, we construct a simple measure of systemic risk by weighting bank-
level risk-taking by its balance sheet size. This measure corresponds intuitively to the
probability that a certain amount of assets are held by distressed investors. The measure
rises significantly in the period before the financial crisis, peaks in 2008 and decreases going
forward except before the euro area crisis. The weights serve an essential function because the
measure reflects that growth in risk-taking among large intermediaries is more worrying than
growth among smaller ones. They also allow us to highlight the importance of heterogeneity
across financial intermediaries, as we can decompose the contribution to systemic risk of
changes in average risk-taking and those arising from the heterogeneity around the mean.
We show that heterogeneity within the financial sector plays a fundamental role in financial
stability. The heterogeneous component drives most of the changes in our systemic risk
measure. In contrast, the average component lags the crisis and is therefore not a good
predictor by itself. Using a similar decomposition, we also show that changes in the systemic
risk measure are driven mainly through banks in the top quantiles, particularly the top 5%
contributing up to 71% of the variance in the recent decades.
   Finally, we explore different counterfactuals in order to highlight the important comple-
mentarity between monetary policy and financial regulation. Our first exercise shows that if
regulation had not compressed the concentration of risk at the top of the distribution after
the crisis, then systemic risk would have been post-crisis at much higher levels due to loose
funding conditions. The counterfactual measure of systemic risk would have been closer
to the 2008 crisis peak throughout the 2010s. In the second exercise, we show that loose
monetary conditions tended to increase systemic risk after 2009; but they did not increase
systemic risk significantly because of tighter macroprudential regulation.
   To conclude, this paper provides empirical estimates of risk-taking at the financial
intermediary level. It then constructs a measure of systemic risk that uses the heterogeneity


                                              30
in the cross-section of leverage to distinguish different types of leverage cycles. It can be used
as an advance warning measure for macroprudential policies. Policy-makers can also use it
to investigate the complementarity between monetary policy and macroprudential policies
by constructing counterfactuals. First and foremost, it reveals the vital interplay between
regulation and monetary policy, which determines financial stability.

Appendix

A.      Data Construction

     We use annual bank (consolidated) balance sheet data from the Compustat Fundamentals
Annual (North America, 1993 ­ 2018) databases via WRDS. Figures A2 ­ A4 in Appendix B
present the number of observations and summary statistics of assets, equity, leverage, returns
on assets and equity for the cleaned data by period.
     We construct the database as follows. First, we keep the following observations.

     · Consolidated: consol = C.

     · USD currency: curcd = USD.

     · Not old entity: bank name (conm) is not tagged by OLD.

     · No major mergers flag: Comparability status (compst) does not equal to AB .

Then, we we exclude financial intermediaries with the following criteria.

     · Leverage is smaller than one: ati,t /(ati,t - lti,t )  1.

     · Extreme leverage (above 200): ati,t /(ati,t - lti,t )  200.

     · Non-positive assets -- total: ati,t  0.

     · Non-positive common/ordinary equity -- total: ceqli,t  0.

     · Non-positive common equity -- tangible: ceqti,t  0.

     · Low assets (below 1 billion USD on average): (1/Ti )        t   ati,t  1000

     · Low equity (below 1 million USD): ati,t - lti,t  1

     · High repurchase agreements ratio to assets (above 0.9) (ceqti,t /ati,t  0.9)


                                                 35
Lastly, for ML estimation, we calculate the bottom ten (or five) percentile of leverage based
on the whole sample of database from 1993 and to 2018 (not each year). Then, we drop all
observations below the bottom ten percentile in our MLE procedure. In measuring systemic
risk and doing counterfactual exercises, we do not exclude the bottom percentile.
   Then, we calculate variables as follows.

   · Assets: at

   · Liability: lt

   · Equity: at - lt

   · Leverage: at/(at - lt)

   · RoA: ib/at

   · RoE: ib/(at - lt)

   To calculate annual stock returns, we collect monthly total returns (trt1m) from the
Compustat Security Monthly (North America, 1992 ­ 2018). Then, we calculate stock returns
in a fiscal year. We merge stock return data using cusip and datadate.

Figure A7: Systemic Risk and Counterfactuals: The figure plots estimated systemic risk
measure (asset weighted mean of risk-taking) and its counterfactual values. The solid black lines
with circles are implied from the data and the estimates. In the first figure, the blue dash lines with
crosses and red dash lines with triangles are implied with the smallest (2008) and largest (1993)
values of the estimated right tail index of risk-taking behavior (  ~R,t ), respectively. In the second
figure, the blue and red dash lines are implied with the smallest (2017) and largest (1999) values of
the estimated the ratio of the expected returns of capital to the costs of funds (   ~t ), respectively.

Note:  p < 0.1,  p < 0.05,  p < 0.01. Standard errors (in parentheses) are clustered at the country-bank
type level. Singleton observations are dropped in all regressions. The estimation is based on equation (7).
The dependent variable is the excess stock return. Other controls are dividend yield, a book to market ratio,
and asset size in logs.
