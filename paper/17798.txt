                                              ABSTRACT

We study the inflation hedging ability of individual stocks. While the poor inflation hedging ability
of the aggregate stock market has long been documented, there is considerable heterogeneity in how
individual stock returns covary with inflation. Stocks with good inflation-hedging abilities since 1990
have had higher returns, on average, than stocks with low inflation betas and tend to be drawn from
the Oil and Gas and Technology sectors. However, we show that there is substantial time variation
of stock inflation betas. This makes it difficult to construct portfolios of stocks that are good inflation
hedges out of sample. This is true for portfolios constructed on past inflation betas, sector portfolios,
and portfolios constructed from high-paying dividend stocks.

1. Introduction
Inflation risk erodes purchasing power, redistributes wealth from lenders to borrowers, and threatens
investors’ long-term objectives which are often specified in real terms. The question of how stocks
covary with inflation has been studied since Irving Fisher’s seminal work in the 1930s and a large
body of work has overwhelmingly documented that nominal stock market returns and inflation
returns are negatively correlated.1 This literature, however, has focused on how the behaviour of
aggregate stock market indices covary with inflation. In this study, we focus on whether portfolios
of individual stocks can adequately hedge inflation risk.
        There are several important reasons to examine the inflation hedging ability of individual
stocks as opposed to broad market indices. First, and most importantly, constructing portfolios
based on individual stocks whose returns covary strongly with inflation has the potential to provide a
much better inflation hedge than the aggregate market. An investor seeking to hedge inflation risk
would optimally hold this firm-level constructed portfolio rather than a market-weighted index.
        Second, there is considerable heterogeneity across firms. Different firms have different
pricing power, which is the ability of a firm to set prices for new or existing goods, or to pass on
price increases to consumers resulting from movements in input prices, such as commodities, labor
costs, and interest rates.       Although the overall stock market may be a poor inflation hedge,
companies in certain sectors or with certain characteristics may have better inflation hedging
properties than other companies. For example, Blanchard (1982) and Bils, Klenow and Kryvtsov
(2003) find that prices of raw materials or goods early in the chain of production (for instance,
gasoline and fresh food) are more flexible than those of processed goods or services. Gautier (2006)
finds that energy prices have the greatest frequency of price changes among different components of
price indices and Bresnahan (1989) finds a wide variety of market pricing power across industries.
        Finally, examining individual stocks also allows us to investigate which types of stocks or
sectors are better inflation hedges than others. Boudoukh, Richardson and Whitelaw (1994) show
that some non-cyclical industries tend to covary positively, albeit not significantly, with inflation,
whereas the contrary is true for cyclical industries. Sadorsky (2001) finds that, contrary to intuition,
natural resource stocks (oil, gold, and other commodities) are not good inflation hedgers, even
though industry practitioners often use allocations to this sector in particular to hedge against
inflation (Ma and Ellis, 1989; Asikoglu and Ercan, 1992; MSCI Barra, 2008; Standard & Poor’s,
2008). In addition to analyzing how different sectors hedge inflation risk, we also examine if good

Wang (2010).


                                                                                                                     3
inflation hedges exhibit any value-growth, size, and momentum characteristic patterns which have
been long documented to produce significant differences in average returns.
       To measure the inflation hedging ability of individual stocks, we compute stock-level
inflation betas following Bekaert and Wang (2010). We group stocks into portfolios ranking on
inflation betas. This is done over the full sample, which allows us to conduct an ex-post analysis of
which companies provided the strongest realized covariation between stock returns and inflation,
and in a tradeable out-of-sample analysis, where the portfolios are constructed using information
only available at the beginning of each month.
       We find substantial variation in how individual stocks covary with inflation. While the
correlation of the aggregate market with inflation is negative, there is a significant subset of stocks
with high, and significantly positive, inflation betas over the sample. We rank stocks into quintile
portfolios based on realized, ex-post inflation betas. The quintile portfolio with the highest ex-post
inflation betas has overweights Oil and Gas and Technology stocks and has an inflation beta of 1.65.
The Oil and Gas sector generally benefits from rising commodity prices while Technology firms
often enjoy an advantage in setting or maintaining prices due to introducing new products. The
remaining quintile portfolios have negative inflation betas. Thus, a non-negligible subset of stocks
has covaried positively with inflation. Moreover, stocks that have been good inflation hedgers have
had, on average, high nominal and real returns.
       We find that the inflation betas exhibit pronounced time variation. As many as 20% of
stocks, on average, exhibit sign changes in inflation betas from year to year. The large amount of
time variation in inflation betas at the individual stock level makes it hard to construct portfolios of
stocks that have good inflation hedging ability on an ex-ante basis. Moreover, the cross-sectional
dispersion of inflation betas also varies through time. Most recently, the inflation betas for many
stocks flipped sign during the financial crisis changing from positive before 2008 to negative over
2008-9. The instability of inflation betas extends to sector portfolios and portfolios comprising high
dividend paying stocks.
       By focusing on how inflation affects individual stock returns, our paper is related to a
literature on cross-sectional asset pricing models which include inflation as a factor. An early
reference is the factor model of Chen, Roll and Ross (1986) which includes unexpected shocks to
inflation. This literature also includes papers which use interest rates or interest rate spreads as
cross-sectional determinants of expected returns like Hahn and Lee (2006) as inflation and inflation
risk account for a large part of the variation of interest rates and spreads (see Ang and Piazzesi,
2003). We place a special focus on the differences in average returns of stocks with inflation betas,



                                                                                                      4
while controlling for other systematic factor risk. This is not usually separately highlighted in the
cross-sectional asset pricing literature.


2. Inflation-hedging measures
We use the beta of a stock return with respect to inflation as a measure of individual securities’
inflation-hedging abilities. We construct portfolios sorted on inflation betas using both ex-ante and
ex-post measures.


2.1 Inflation betas
Following Bekaert and Wang (2010) and others, our definition of inflation hedging is the how
strongly a security’s nominal return covaries with inflation in the following time-series regression:
         Rit     t   t ,                                                                                      (1)

where Rit is the monthly nominal return of a stock i,  t the monthly rate of inflation, and  t the

residual of the regression measuring the part of the nominal return that is not explained by inflation.
We require at least 60 observations for each stock. Our results are almost unchanged if we augment
equation (1) with the aggregate market and other systematic factors.
        If  =1, we say that the stock is a perfect hedge against inflation. Note that a perfect inflation
hedge does not imply that the correlation between the stock return and inflation is one due to
idiosyncratic risk. The inflation beta allows investors to compute a hedge ratio; given a sufficiently
diverse portfolio of stocks, the idiosyncratic risk disappears and only the systematic covariation
between inflation and stock returns remains. This cannot be done for correlation measures, as
correlation measures are not additive and do not take into account the magnitude of the stock’s
response to a given inflation movement. A negative inflation beta implies that a stock has poor
returns when inflation is high.
         There are other definitions of inflation-hedging capabilities in the literature.2 Bodie (1976)
defines the inflation-hedging capabilities of stocks by measuring how much the variance of real
returns of a bond portfolio can be reduced using an equity portfolio. Fama and Schwert (1977),
Schwert (1981), and Schotman and Schweitzer (2000) define an asset as a perfect hedge if it has a
beta of one to expected inflation (or alternatively to both unexpected and expected inflation).
Inflation hedging can also be defined in terms of covariance with a real rate (which can be

2
 We have also examined the ability of stocks to hedge expected inflation on the right-hand side of (1), similar to Kolluri
and Wahab (2008), using median inflation forecasts from the Survey of Professional Forecasts. We find similar results
across quantile portfolios using expected inflation, although there is a positive but insignificant relationship between
S&P500 returns and expected inflation over 1989-2010, which confirms Kolluri and Wahab’s findings.


                                                                                                                        5
instrumented by TIPS, but this is only possible after the late 1990s and TIPS embed a non-negligible
liquidity component) or with conditional inflation (which is unobserved and must be specified
through a time-series model). Our measure is direct and only involves the covariation with actual,
observed inflation.


2.2 Data
Our sample of firms consists of all companies that have been constituents of the S&P500 over the
sample period October 1989 to May 2010. For all common stocks present each month in the index,
we obtain the monthly closing total return (cumulative stock price accounting for dividend gains and
splits) and market capitalisation from Datastream (Thomson Reuters). We start in October 1989 as
that is the date from which the dynamic composition of the S&P is available from Datastream.
           We focus on the S&P universe as this is a typical universe for large institutional investors
like pension funds and sovereign wealth funds, many of whom are concerned with inflation risk and
consider the S&P universe investable. We also examine inflation and stock returns using the broader
CRSP universe over 1962-2010, which contains 22,776 stocks, and find similar results. We allude
to some of these results below, but concentrate on the S&P sample in this article. The full CRSP
results are available in an internet appendix.
           We use the U.S. consumer price index (headline CPI) from Datastream as the measure of
inflation. We graph inflation over the sample in Figure 1. Inflation during the sample was moderate,
averaging 2.7%, with a low volatility of 1.2%. The sample includes a peak of inflation of 6.3%
during October and November 1990, after which inflation remained around 2-3%. Inflation again
rises during 2007 reaching 5.6% in August 2008. Both of these events reflected rising commodity
prices, especially for oil. There was also a period of negative inflation during the subprime mortgage
crisis, with a trough of -2.1% in July 2009. We also use CPI data at the time of the release (“real
time” CPI series), as provided by the Federal Reserve Bank of Saint Louis for the out-of-sample
portfolio construction.3


2.3 Portfolio construction
To construct inflation hedging portfolios, we sort firms into quintile portfolios ranked on their
inflation betas. We construct five portfolios (Quintiles 1 through 5, from the highest inflation beta to

                                                                                                      6
the lowest) weighted at each date by market capitalisations.4 We construct a self-financed, dollar-
neutral Q1-Q5 portfolio by buying the Q1 portfolio securities and shorting the Q5 portfolio
securities. We record the returns of each portfolio as well as the portfolio inflation betas. We first
construct in-sample portfolios, selecting the securities on the basis of betas calculated over the entire
study period from October 1989 to May 2010 in Section 3.
         We construct out-of-sample portfolios in Section 4. By using five-year rolling betas, we
construct a dynamically rebalanced portfolio consisting of stocks selected on the basis of their past
inflation betas, which is rebalanced monthly. The exercise is repeated every month for the October
1994-May 2010 period. Since the CPI series is not announced until the middle of the subsequent
month, we omit the most recent month in the regressions. We also take “real time” CPI for the out-
of-sample analysis.
        After constructing quintile portfolios, we run monthly regression tests on the quintile
portfolios sorted by inflation betas to check their Fama-French (1993) loadings and, following
Carhart (1997), also include Jegadeesh and Titman (1993) momentum loadings:
         R pt   p   p MKTt   p SMBt   p HMLt   p MOM t   t ,                                             (2)

where R pt is the monthly excess-return of portfolio p over the risk-free rate. The three factors MKTt

SMBt and HMLt constitute the usual Fama and French (1993) market, value and size factors, and

MOM t is the momentum factor. We refer to these factors as the FFC factors and obtain them from
Kenneth French’s website.5 All returns are at a monthly frequency. We compute standard errors and
t-statistics using the estimator in Newey and West (1987) with the number of lags equal to the
recommendation in Newey and West (1994).


3. Which stocks have hedged inflation best?

3.1 The best realized inflation hedging stocks
We first examine the in-sample behaviour of how stocks have covaried with inflation. By measuring
inflation betas over the entire sample, this ex-post exercise reveals which stocks have provided the
best inflation hedges over the period.
         Table 1 lists the 20 stocks with the highest inflation betas in the S&P500, along with their
sectors, annualized nominal and real return, abnormal return above FFC factors and inflation beta.

  Note that as a robustness check, we have also constructed equally weighted quintile portfolios, with very similar results
not reported here.

                                                                                                                           7
For comparison, we include the coefficients for the S&P500. The top 20 inflation betas range
between 15.63 for Enterasys Network (Technology) and 5.09 for Adobe Systems (Technology). In
comparison, the S&P500 inflation beta is -0.52 and statistically insignificant. Thus, there are
certainly stocks that have covaried strongly with inflation even though the typical stock and the
aggregate market portfolio covary negatively with inflation. The best inflation-hedging stocks do not
display particularly high abnormal returns above the FFC factors; only three stocks out of these 20
have a significant FFC alpha coefficient.
       Within the top twenty inflation-hedging stocks, the best-represented sector (five of the top 20
stocks) is Basic Materials (companies engaged in the exploration or mining of metals, minerals and
other commodities, development and processing of raw materials), followed by the Oil & Gas sector
(four of the 20 stocks). Thus, almost half of the best inflation-hedging stocks are involved in
commodity extraction or processing. The other sectors represented are Technology, Consumer
Goods and Services and Healthcare, each represented by three companies. Note that two sectors are
completely absent: Financials and Utilities.


3.2 In-Sample Portfolios
We sort stocks at time t based on the full-sample inflation beta and hold the portfolio from t to t+1.
We reiterate that we are using forward-looking information of the covariation of inflation and stock
returns over the whole sample, so our results have look-ahead bias and find the best realized
inflation hedgers. Quintile 1 (Q1) stocks, the stocks with the higher inflation betas, have had the
highest average performance while in quintile 5 (Q5), the stocks with the lowest inflation betas,
stock returns tend to decrease when inflation is high.
       Table 2 presents descriptive statistics on returns obtained for the five quintile portfolios, the
self-financed Q1-Q5 portfolio, and the S&P500 over the entire sample. Real returns for the five
portfolios are all positive, and monthly annualised real returns for the first three portfolios (quintiles
1 to 3) range between 6.34% and 7.36%, well above those of the last two portfolios (5.38% and
2.57%). Thus, stocks that have been good inflation hedgers have had, on average, high nominal and
real returns. It is noteworthy that the last portfolio (Q5) and to a lesser extent the first portfolio (Q1)
have more volatile performance than the middle ones (Q2-4): Q5 and Q1 have volatilities of 30.0%
and 19.1%, respectively, compared with volatilities around 14-15% for the middle quintile
portfolios. The Q5 portfolio also has much higher extreme risks, with kurtosis of 12.7 (compared to
the portfolios Q1 to Q4 having a kurtosis between 3.8 and 4.5) reflecting distribution tails that are
much fatter than normal. Equities with large negative inflation betas (and to a lesser extent those



                                                                                                         8
with large positive betas) thus appear much riskier than the others. The portfolios’ success rates
(percentage of months in which a portfolio’s nominal return was higher than inflation) range from
58% to 63%, with an average of 62% for the S&P500.
       Table 3 presents the results of the regression of monthly returns for each portfolio against
inflation. The explanatory power of these regressions is very small, as shown by the very low R2 and
significant intercepts. By construction, Q1 portfolio has the highest inflation beta: 1.65 over the
entire period, but this is not significant. All the other portfolios have negative betas, which range
from -0.34 for Q2 to -2.22 for Q5, compared with the S&P500’s inflation beta of -0.52. Thus, only a
small subset of stocks has covaried positively with inflation and the average stock has been a poor
inflation hedge. The long-short Q1-Q5 portfolio exhibits attractive inflation-hedging properties over
the full sample, with a significantly positive inflation beta of 3.87. Not surprisingly, with the larger
and longer CRSP sample starting in 1962, the Q1-Q5 inflation beta is even larger at 6.82 (not
reported).
       Table 4 breaks down the effects of exposure to the FFC factors for each portfolio. In Panel A,
we report the S&P sample. There is some evidence that good inflation hedgers have higher returns
than poor inflation hedgers, with a difference in alphas between Q5 and Q1 of 0.81% per month, and
this is statistically significant. Q2 stocks have the highest 0.20% abnormal positive monthly return
over the traditional factors and Q5, which contains stocks with the lowest inflation betas, has the
lowest alpha, which is significantly negative at -0.72% per month. The most extreme quintiles Q1
and Q5 have higher market exposure than the others, with betas of respectively 1.1 and 1.5. Note
that these quintiles also have higher total volatility (see Table 2). For the Q5 portfolio, the size effect
is positive and significant, which means that stocks with negative inflation betas earn significant size
premiums. This is consistent with smaller firms lacking the ability to raise their prices when the
general inflation level rises compared with large firms; the best inflation hedgers have been the
largest firms.
       The coefficient of the HML factor is positive and significant for Q3-5 portfolios. The HML
loading is particularly large for Q5 at 0.54. Thus, the best inflation hedgers tend to be growth stocks.
The fact that the poorest inflation hedgers tend to be value stocks is consistent with the low prices of
value stocks in some cases reflecting low market power and the reduced ability of the products of
these firms to command premium prices. The momentum factor is insignificant both for the S&P500
and for most of the quintile portfolios (the only exception being Q1 with a significantly negative
sign). It is striking that the Q5 portfolio, which contains the worst inflation hedgers, has the lowest
performance, yet it is the only portfolio to earn both the size and value premiums. Its strong and



                                                                                                         9
significantly negative FFC alpha means that other systematic factors play a large role in explaining
the differences of returns in stocks sorted by realized inflation-hedging properties.
       We consider the larger CRSP universe from 1962 in Panel B of Table 4. Over the full
sample, the best inflation hedgers have had almost identical risk-adjusted performance to the worst
inflation hedgers with the difference between the Q1 and Q5 alphas being only 0.04% per month.
There is one notable difference when very small stocks in the CRSP universe are included: the best
inflation hedgers over the full sample have large, positive, and highly significant SMB coefficients.
Thus, the best inflation hedgers have been the smallest stocks – which are excluded in the S&P500.
The inclusion of these very smalls stocks does not improve out-of-sample performance (see the
internet appendix).


3.3 Best in-sample inflation-hedging industries
We examine the sector composition of each of the quintile portfolios. Figure 2 compares the sector
breakdown of the Q1 to Q5 portfolios (the percentages are calculated in terms of market
capitalisation) to the S&P500. In Q1, the best inflation-hedging stocks have come from two types of
industries: the Oil and Gas and Technology sectors are highly overrepresented (16.3% and 32.0%,
respectively) relative to their weighting in the S&P500 (8.5% and 13.5%). Oil and Gas stocks tend to
benefit from commodity price increases. This result is not surprising, given that episodes of inflation
during the sample were largely related to major commodity price surges (the first episode, in late
1990, was linked to the Gulf War; the second, in the mid-2000s reflected the commodity price run-
up amid speculation on very strong demand from emerging countries). The Technology sector
contains companies which often create new, high value-added products that are differentiated from
those already on the market, and can thus raise prices.
       The worst inflation hedgers in Q5 include mainly Financial sector companies (34.6% of the
quintile), in which it is very heavily overweighted relative to the S&P500 (15.3%). To a lesser
extent, Q5 is also overweighted in Consumer Goods and Telecommunications. Financials’ poor
performance in inflationary periods has been documented in a number of studies which have shown
that rising inflation reduces assets’ real return and leads to increased demand for bank financing (see
Boyd, Levine and Smith, 2001; Boyd and Champ, 2006). Most assets held by financial firms are
nominal loans: as inflation increases the real value of these assets drops. The drop in real returns is
associated with deteriorating average quality of borrowers and leads to credit rationing (Azariadis
and Smith, 1996). The financial sector lends less, resource allocation is less efficient and
intermediation activity decreases. Boyd and Champ (2006) also demonstrate a threshold effect,



                                                                                                    10
where banks’ real net interest margins increase when inflation is moderate and decrease when
inflation is high.



4. Can we predict inflation hedgers?
Given the strong in-sample relation between certain types of stocks and inflation, we now examine
whether it would have been possible to pick good inflation-hedging stocks on an ex-ante basis.


4.1 Out-of-sample portfolio construction
We sort stocks based on the realized inflation betas over the last 60 months prior to time t.6 We omit
the current time t observation as inflation is not announced until the middle of the month and use
“real time” inflation data. We hold this portfolio for one month from t to t+1 and then rebalance
monthly. Table 5 presents the performance of the out-of-sample portfolios. In contrast to the in-
sample portfolios in Table 2, there is no evidence that stocks with high past inflation betas have, on
average, higher real or nominal returns than stocks with low past inflation betas. In fact, each of the
portfolios has a success rate around 60% (meaning that for 60% of the months in the study period,
real returns were positive) and annualized real returns for the period as a whole are still positive,
varying from 4.36% to 9.21%. In contrast to the preceding in-sample results, the risks of each of the
five portfolios (Q1 to Q5) are nearly equivalent, with volatility ranging from 14.6% to 19.6%.
Skewness and kurtosis do not significantly differ across the portfolios. The success rates for the
larger post-1962 CRSP sample are even lower, ranging from 57% from Q1 to 53% to Q5 (see the
internet appendix).
         Table 6 reports the inflation betas on each portfolio from regression (1). The inflation beta of
the Q1 portfolio is positive at 0.06, but much lower than that of the previously constructed in-
sample portfolio (1.65), and not significant. Moreover, this portfolio has a beta lower than that of
portfolio 5 (0.95), which is made up of the stocks with the lowest inflation betas. Clearly, stocks
with high past covariation with inflation do not imply these stocks will have future high covariation
with inflation.
        In Table 7, exposure to the FFC factors reveals that the out-of-sample quintile portfolios have
similar factor loadings for the market and SMB factors. Exposures to the value factor are positive
and significant for the Q2-4 portfolios. Q4 and Q5 portfolio have positive significant exposure to the
momentum factor. The difference in alphas between the Q1 and Q5 portfolios is 0.27% per month

  Note that as a robustness check, we conducted the same analysis based on rolling inflation betas calculated on 36 and
84 months, with no significant difference in the results. We only present results based on 60-month betas.


                                                                                                                    11
and is statistically insignificant. Note that although positive, the higher risk-adjusted alpha for Q1 is
not due to this portfolio’s ex-post inflation hedging ability, as Table 6 shows the inflation beta is
only 0.06. For the post-1962 CRSP sample, the difference between the Q1 and Q5 FFC alphas is
very similar at 0.33% per month and is also statistically insignificant (see the internet appendix).
         Overall, Tables 5-7 are disappointing for finding good inflation hedging stocks on an ex-ante
basis.   While there is good inflation hedging ability for some stocks ex post, there is severe
deterioration in ex-ante forecasting. The past covariation with inflation has little persistence and
provides little predictive ability for a stock’s future inflation hedging ability. We now further
investigate the instability of these inflation loadings over time.


4.2 Inflation beta instability
Inflation betas on individual stocks vary substantially over time. They have low persistence, with
high variability. Figure 3 shows the percentage of S&P500 stocks that flipped sign over one year
during the October 1995 to May 2010 period. This graph illustrates the high inflation beta instability:
on average during the whole sample period, 23.7% of the S&P500 stocks had inflation betas that
changed sign over one year.7 The recent period was particularly unstable. Whereas during the 1990s
and early 2000s, an average of 22.1% of the stocks changed the sign of their inflation betas over one
year (and the proportion was lower before the subprime mortgage crisis), once the crisis broke, the
proportion exploded to nearly 68% of the stocks. Indeed, this period coincided with a sharp rise in
most stocks’ inflation betas, which switched from negative to positive. This phenomenon is linked to
the subprime crisis. During this period there was a simultaneous decrease in inflation (with monthly
inflation rates of -0.9%, -1.8% and -0.7% from October to December 2008, respectively, which were
the months with the largest monthly decline in inflation since 1950) and a decline in equity markets
(returns of -8.9%, -16.8% and -7.2% for the S&P500 during the same months).8
         Figure 4 shows the average rolling five-year inflation beta of the S&P500 stocks during
1994-2010. We see the high instability of the inflation beta, which alternated between periods when
on average it was sharply negative (mid 1990s), others when it was near zero (late 1990s and early
2000s), and the recent period of the financial crisis when it turned positive. Another interesting
observation is that the cross-sectional standard deviation of inflation betas also varies substantially
over time. Figure 5 shows the beta distribution of S&P500 stocks at two selected dates within the

7
  Previous authors have documented that factor loadings for stock returns with respect to systematic factors vary over
time (see for example, Ang and Chen, 2007; Lewellen and Nagel, 2006; Ang and Kristensen, 2010). The variation in
inflation loadings is an order of magnitude larger than the variation in Fama-French loadings.
8
  This may be a regime switch. Inflation and inflation risk exhibit regime-switching behavior, as Evans and Lewis
(1995) and Ang, Bekaert and Wei (2008) show.


                                                                                                                   12
study period, July 1999 and December 2008. Figure 5 clearly illustrates that inflation beta dispersion
was much lower in 2008 than in 1999. Moreover, in 1999 the distribution was nearly symmetrical,
but it became highly asymmetrical with a positive skew in 2008. The percentage of firms having an
inflation beta greater than zero increased from 63% in July 1999 to 80% in December 2008.
           Changing economic conditions, starting with the low macroeconomic volatility in the early
1980s (the “Great Moderation”) and the changing nature of inflation shocks – from countercyclical
to procyclical – have been stressed as the two main factors affecting the risk of stocks and its
correlation with inflation in the US. The correlation changed from strongly negative in the late 1980s
to mildly negative in the late 1990s (Li, 2002; Lettau, Ludvigson and Wachter, 2008; Brière and
Signori, 2012). The same instability is observed in various countries: Bekaert and Wang (2010)
demonstrate the unstable relationship between equity markets and inflation for a panel of some 50
countries. In addition to these macroeconomic factors, we note other sources of instability at the firm
level related to firms’ microeconomic characteristics. A company’s pricing power may vary over
time, reflecting such factors as its market positioning and competitive environment. Finally, the late
1990s saw a wave of mergers and acquisitions, which may also have contributed to changes in
market power and the ability to raise prices (Kim and Singal, 1993; Prager and Hannan, 1998;
Focarelli and Panetta, 2003).


4.3 Can we forecast time-varying inflation betas with stock characteristics?
Given the instability in the inflation betas, are there any variables that can help predict their variation? To
answer this question we run monthly cross-sectional regressions of five-year rolling inflation betas on
firm-specific characteristics, which include the book-to-market ratio, dividend yield, price-earnings
ratio, and return volatility, which is computed using the past six months of daily returns prior to date
t. We also include past return measures: momentum, which we define as the previous 12-month return
of stock i at date t) and reversal, which is the return over the previous month. To test the hypothesis
that the coefficient in the regression is zero, we follow the Fama and Macbeth (1973) and report the time-
series average of the monthly cross-sectional coefficients, but our standard error accounts for possible
heteroskeasticity and autocorrelation as we use Newey-West (1987) standard errors.
           Table 8 reports the average cross-sectional coefficients, with t-statistics in parentheses, using
stocks within each quintile and across the whole S&P500 universe. Not only do the inflation betas vary
substantially over time, but this time variation is very difficult to forecast. In Table 8, there is not one
firm characteristic that has a statistically significant coefficient.9               The largest point estimates in

    All variables are also insignificant in univariate regressions (not reported).


                                                                                                                13
magnitude are for the momentum characteristics: stocks with higher past returns tend to have lower
inflation betas, but the relationship is insignificant.



5. Inflation hedging performance of sectors and high dividend stocks
We finally investigate how sectors and high dividend paying stocks hedge inflation risk. The
preceding analysis suggests that the oil and gas and technology sectors are overrepresented in the
first quintile of stocks, which have had the best inflation hedging performance over the full sample.
Thus, sector-level portfolios may have good inflation hedging properties. Recently, it has been
suggested that high dividend paying stocks may offer better inflation protection than other stocks.


5.1 Inflation hedging properties of S&P 500 sectors
We measure the inflation-hedging capacity of the ten S&P500 sectors. Table 9 presents the results of
regression (1) of returns for each sector against inflation. All of the sector inflation betas were
negative during the period, except for Basic Materials, whose beta was positive at 0.08 but not
significantly different from zero. The Oil and Gas sector had the lowest inflation beta of -1.27, a
surprising result in the light of the Section 3 findings that the best inflation hedges over the sample
were overweight the Oil and Gas sector. Similarly, technology stocks were over-represented in the
best ex-post inflation hedging firms, but the Technology sector has a negative inflation beta of -0.48
(not significant).
        These aggregate results mask great variability over time and significant disparities among
individual stocks. Figure 6 depicts sector inflation betas and their standard deviations over time. We
graph the rolling five-year inflation beta averaged over all firms in that sector. Figure 6 shows that
sectors, just like individual stocks, exhibit pronounced instability in inflation betas. For example,
Financials—which over the whole sample have tended to be poor inflation hedges—have negative
inflation betas only up to the late 1990s. During the financial crisis, the average financial inflation
beta was positive; during this time Financials performed poorly and inflation was negative. Strong
inflation beta variability is also noticeable for the Oil and Gas, Basic Materials, and Industrials
sectors, with betas for all three sectors moving closely together (but with different amplitude) during
the sample period. They moved from strongly negative in the mid 1990s to strongly positive
(especially for Oil and Gas and Basic Materials) between 1999 and 2001.
        Dispersion of inflation betas for stocks within sectors can also very high and varies
substantially over time. As an example, Figure 7 presents the cross-sectional distribution of the
Technology sector’s inflation betas in July 1999 and December 2008. In this sector, which has


                                                                                                      14
historically experienced the highest average beta dispersion, 40% of the stocks had negative betas in
July 1999. This individual dispersion was compressed very sharply in December 2008, where only
8% of the stocks had negative betas.


5.2 Inflation hedging properties of high dividend-paying stocks
It is often argued in the financial press that high dividend stocks have appealing inflation-hedging
properties.10 In this section, we compare the inflation hedging properties of our out-of-sample
quintile portfolios with the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats over its period of availability
(since January 2000). This index, launched in November 2005, is designed to measure the
performance of the highest dividend-yielding S&P Composite 1500 constituents which have
followed a managed dividend policy of consistently increasing dividends every year for at least 25
years.
         Over January 2000 to May 2010, the High Dividend index generated exceptional
performance compared with the S&P 500: an annualized real return of 6.16% versus -4.75% for the
S&P500, with slightly lower volatility (15.8% versus 16.1%). But, the High Dividend index’s
inflation-hedging properties are disappointing. Its inflation beta was -0.45 compared with the S&P
index’s positive inflation beta of 0.47 (see Table 10). During this period the first quintile of stocks
with the highest past inflation betas (out-of-sample) had an inflation beta of 0.08. The high returns
on the highest dividend stocks are not because they are good inflation hedges. Rather, in a FFC
regression (2), the High Dividend index has an especially low exposure to the market factor (market
beta of 0.68), very significant exposure to value (HML loading of 0.71), and momentum (MOM
loading of 0.23) factors. The FFC alpha of the High Dividend index is close to zero at 0.13% per
month and insignificant. Thus, it is tradable systematic factor loadings, not inflation-hedging ability,
which account for the high returns of high dividend stocks.
         High-dividend paying stocks may be inflation hedges in the sense that their dividends
comove highly with inflation, rather than their returns.11            Table 11 shows that there is weak
statistical evidence for this argument. We compute the average inflation beta over a longer sample,
October 1989 to May 2010, of the price and dividend components of the 42 high dividend stocks in
the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats index in May 2010. Interestingly, while quarterly dividend
growth shows a positive covariation with inflation (average inflation beta of 0.68, although it is
insignificant), the opposite is true for the price return component (average inflation beta of -0.94,

also insignificant). Both components tend to cancel each other, which explains why the total returns
on high dividend stocks show no inflation hedging ability.


6. Conclusion
A large literature has documented the poor inflation hedging properties of the overall stock market.
However, certain individual stocks have the ability to be good inflation hedges, even if the overall
aggregate market has poor inflation hedging properties. Since the 1990s the top 20 stocks with the
highest realized inflation betas have inflation betas exceeding five. If stocks are ranked into quintile
portfolios based on realized inflation betas over the sample period, the top quintile portfolio with the
highest ex-post inflation betas has an inflation beta of 1.65 over the sample. This portfolio
overweights Oil and Gas, which benefits from rising commodity prices, and Technology, a sector
where the products of many firms command premium prices due to technological innovation. For
comparison, the average beta of S&P500 stocks was -0.52 over the sample period. Thus, although a
non-negligible subset of stocks has covaried positively with inflation, inflation betas are widely
dispersed across individual stocks. Stocks with good inflation hedging properties have, on average,
earned higher nominal and real returns than others.
       However, trying to forecast ex-ante inflation betas at the individual stock level is not easy.
Portfolios constructed on an ex-ante basis, where stocks are ranked on past inflation loadings, have
little differences in next-month returns and exhibit little differences in inflation-hedging ability. The
reason for the poor out-of-sample performance is due to the large time variation of inflation betas:
approximately 20%, on average, of realized stock inflation betas change sign in the course of a year.
The substantial variation of inflation betas makes it difficult to find stocks that are good ex-ante
inflation hedges. Time-varying inflation betas make sector portfolios and indices holding only high
dividend-paying stocks even worse inflation hedges than those constructed using firm-level
information.
       While we have used a simple and intuitive method to measure inflation hedging capabilities,
by examining the covariance of a stock’s return with inflation, there are other, more complicated
measures. Another interesting extension might be to separate inflation into temporary and persistent
components. We have also used CPI as the inflation measure. While the Billion Prices Project @
MIT has shown that CPI closely tracks a measure of inflation computed from hundreds of online
retailers, an open question is whether another inflation measure – for example, a measure of inflation
more closely tied to monetary aggregates, producer inputs, or some combination of many price series




                                                                                                      16
– is reflected in the cross section of stock returns.12 Nevertheless, the inability to select firms that
hedge CPI inflation on an ex-ante basis points to the need for investors to consider other asset
classes as better inflation hedges.
