                   SHOULD NATIONS LEARN TO LIVE WITH INFLATION?


                                     ABSTRACT




     It is often argued that the most important tosts of inflation can be
                                               Yet governments in moderate
substantially mitigated by indexing reforms.
inflation countries have generally been very reluctant to promote
institutional changes that would reduce the costs of inflation.     Capital
income continues to be taxed on a noainal basis, indexed bonds are a rarity,
                                         rather than real payments constant,
typical mortgage contracts keep nominal
and interest is not paid on required reserves.
     This paper examines the welfare consequences of inflation mitigation

          Economists  regularly advocate a variety of reforms including the
  indexation    of tax brackets and transfer payment programs, the measurement
  of   capital incoae on an inflation adjusted basis,      the issuance of
                                                                           government
  indexed bonds,     the introduction of new
                                                  instruments, and the payment
                                             mortgage
  of interest on money, on the
                               grounds that these policies reduce the costs of

  inflation.     Indeed it is often argued that the most
                                                         important costs of
  inflation    are "almost entirely avoidable"
                                                  (Fischer. 1981)   ,   because of the
 possibility of enacting these inflation—cost

        Indexationis of course widespread in
                                             high inflation economies.                But
 despite their experience     of non—negligible   inflation, most industrialized
 economies     do relatively little to mitigate its adverse
                                                            effects.          Mortgages

not an accident. Policies directed at
                                      mitigating the effects of inflation
are often seriously put forward. For
                                      example, the original Reagan

Administrationproposal for tax reform called for the use
                                                                    of   indexing     in

quickly discarded.

calls for explanation.      One set of explanations,    favored   by    economists,
ascribes the failure to index to the transitional costs

inflationary reputation.         It is easy to construct examples in which the

costs of the extra inflation that results from inflation palliation outweigh

the direct benefits        of the lower cost oL   a   given inflation rate.   Second,

that foregoing        indexation is to some extent a substitute for developing a

reputationfor pursuing anti—inflation policies.             Nations with strong anti—

inflationary      reputationscan more easily afford indexation policies than

other nations without such reputations.

        Section   I   lays out the basic argument     in the context of the Barro—

Cordon      (1983) model of inflation determination.       Section II considers how

the government's incomplete control of the inflation rate and alternative

representationsof the inflation loss function affect the results.                Section

III examines issues relating to inflation mitigationand reputation.

Section IV concludes by discussingsome implications of the results and

directions for extension.



I.    The Basic Argument.



       We   follow Barro and Cordon (1983).       Suppose that there is a short run

Phillips     curve

(1)      U_U*_a.(w_re)
where U is the unemploymentrate, U* the natural rate of unemployment, x the

inflation     rate, and   m   the inflation rate expected at the beginning of the

period.

        The governmentis able to determine the actual inflation rate, a, which

it sets to minimize       the loss function
                                                   —4—




(2)     L — (U — kU*)2 + hr2             ,   kC    I
This loss function           is assumed to reflect the preferences of both government

and society.           The parameter b reflects the costs of inflation, while k

                                                            incentive     to create unexpected
determines the strength of the government's

inflation.           Such an incentive will be present as long as kcl.             Note also

that (2) implies that it is actual as opposed to unexpected inflation that

has welfare costs.             We commenton the effects of distinguishingbetween the

costs of actual and unexpected inflation below.

       A    myopic government that ignores the effects of its choice                of   inflation


rate   on expected inflation             smts the inflation rate:



(3)     x — a[U*(l—k) + a             re]/(az +   b)


implying when expectations               are fulfilled with    iv   —




(4)        iv   —   (a/b)   U*(l—k)


At the fulfilled expectations equilibrium, the value of the loss function is


(5)    L' —         [1 + (a2/b)]



       Equations         (4) and (5) imply that an increase in a both increases the

inflation rate and reduces social welfare.                   With higher a, the Phillips

curve is less steep, and the government                  is more tempted to try to create

                                                      in terms of lower
unanticipatedinflation, which now gives a bigger bang
                                                                        inflation has to rise to
unemploymentper point of inflation.                    Accordingly,

a higher level before the government is no longer tempted to try and create

unexpected inflation.
      A more striking result is that the value of the loss function (5) is

 decreasing    in b.    Since the parameter   b measures the social cost of

 inflation,    this implies that policy measures that reduce the marainal cost

of inflation end uo increasine the total cost of inflation to society.

Inflation     mitigationpolicies, although they reduce the costs associated

with a given level of inflation, may end up making inflation more costly to

society.      With the quadratic coat function considered here, inflation

protectionis always counterproductive,         because the extra      inflation that

results has costs that exceed the direct benefits of protecting against

inflation.

     Interpretingthese results in terms of indexation, wage indexation

reduces a (make the Phillips       curve steeper) and thereby increases economic

welfare.      Other forms of indexation such as tax and social security

indexationcan be interpretedas reducing b, and thereby increasingthe

social costs of inflation.       Another interpretation is that b can decline with

result of the removal of controls on interest rates.             Portfolio—holders      move

out of money into the now higher—yielding        as.ets,   b   declines,    the inflation

tax becomes less distortionary,       and in the new equilibrium the private

sector becomes worse off.

     The example       in this section suggests that policymakers'         suspicions

about mitigating the costs of inflation may welt be warranted.                At any given

level of inflation reducing       the marginal cost of inflation improves welfare.

However it may make things worse once the induced effects on policy and

consequent adjustment of expectations is considered.            Avoiding    inflation

mitigationmeasures       is one way of committing,   albeit imperfectly, to low
future inflation rates.      In the example here, the reduced commitment           to low

inflation associatedwith inflation mitigation exceeds its direct benefits.

Indeed, equation     (5) implies that measures     which artificially increased the

costs of inflation as reflected        in b would be desirable1.    The next section


explores    the robustnessof this conclusion.




II. Extensions




      We consider here two extensions of the example in the previous section.

First, we examine the implications of government's          inability   to perfectly

control the inflation rate.      Second,     we explore alternatives to    the

quadratic    inflation loss function       that we have maintained so far.       Both

extensions demonstrate the unsurprising          result that under circumstances,

some forms of inflation mitigationwill be desirable.




Imperfect    Inflation Control


      We have so far maintainedthe assumption that the government can

precisely    determine the rate of inflation;        experience suggests otherwise.

Suppose the actual rate     of inflation, a equals      (r*+c), where      is the

intended rate of inflation,      and   c   is a random error term, with variance

Then if the government optimizes, the expected value of its loss function

is:

(6)          L'   — U*2(l_k)2
                            [l+(a2/b)] + be2



        Rogoff's argument (1986) that the appointment of conservative
central bankers can improve economic welfare reflects this fact.
Now the government can consider setting the optimal level of inflation

mitigation,    choosing    that level of b which minimizes       L'      It is given by:

(7)          b*_ a[l/a2]1/2

         The optimum level of inflation mitigation trades off the adverse

effect of mitigationon the government's intended level of inflation,

against the costs of accidental inflation.              As the variance of uncontrolled

inflation increases,       the optimal b decreases, or equivalently,          the optimal

degree of inflation cost mitigation (including some forms of indexing)

rises.     By contrast, as k decreases,           the benefits for the government of

trying to create unanticipated            inflation increase, and "dynamic

       Uncertain,    or more accurately, uncontrollable,        inflation thus provides

one rationale for inflation protection.              Note though that the argument    of

by a   demand shock since output expands with the uncontrollable               inflation).

difficult.     This tends to weaken the argument           in favor of indexation as a

means of mitigating the costs of uncontrollable             inflation.

      The loss function L(          )    in   equation      (2) penalizes   only the      1   level

of inflation.        Alternatively        the loss function can penalize both the actual

level of inflation and unanticipated                     inflation.   Losses   from unanticipated

inflation might for example include the social welfare loss from the

capricious redistributions           associatedwith unexpected inflation, or the

increases        in uncertainty created by large deviations of actual from expected

inflation.

      In this case we can generalize the loss function to

(8)   LL   '-
                 (U — kU*)2+ b     it2   + c   (it
                                                     —   me)2

We assume as        earlier that the inflation rate equals (w*+c), where                w*    is the

intended        inflation rate.     It should be clear chat the inclusion of the extra

term has no effect on the equilibrium inflation rare, x* that the government

aims for.        Nor does ir have any effect on the calculationof the optimal b

in equation (7), assuming that b and c are independent.

       If b and c can be manipulated separately, then in the presence of

uncontrollable        inflation, equation            (8) implies that social welfare is

improved    by reducing c as        much as possible.             To the extent that indexation

measures        can be found that protect only against unanticipatedor

uncontrolled inflation, without affecting the costs of anticipated

inflation, welfare will be enhanced.                      An example of such a   measure might be

the indexarion of Social Security benefits.                      On the other hand, policies

affecting b, the costs of actual inflation not unanticipatedinflation might

include the measurement           of capital income on a real rather than a nominal

basis, the removal of controls on interest                      rates, or the introductionof

tilted mortgages.

Alternative        Loss     Functions


        A first generalization of the loss function employed so far would

involve allowing for the possibility                         that the optimal inflation tate is non-

zero.    Rewriting the inflation cost function in tetms of the deviation of

inflation from its optimal level ,r_,r**, does not altet the conclusions                          of

our analysis at all3.

       A second and more               significant generalizationof our analysis would

involve relaxing our assumption                       that the costs of inflation are quadratic        in
the inflation tate.                  While quadratic       costs can be justified if inflation

causes Harberger            triangles, more general formulations             are plausible   as well.

Suppose that instead of (2) there is an additivelyseparable4 loss function,

(15)             B — V(U — kU*) + bW(r)

The marginal costs of both unemployment and inflation are assumed to be

positive     and increasing, and we assume that indexationhas no consequence

when the inflation rate is 0.                    That is:

        V'   >    0,   U'   >   0,   V"   >   0, U"   > 0,    W(0)—O

       The coefficientb represents the effects of changes in the extent of

inflation mitigation on utility: h falls as mitigation increases.                            We


        In this case the equilibriuminflation rate rises by ir**           to           relative
its level in (4) and the value of the loss function is exactly the same as
in (5).
         Since we will be showing that the effects of a change in b are
ambiguous even when the utility function is separable, there seem to be no
further insights to be gained by using a non—separable function.
                                                       —10—




therefore     concentrate          on the effects of a change in b on the infLation rate

and on welfare.

       The first order condition for the optimal rate of inflation is

(16)          aV'(IJ*(l—k)) —         bW'(r)
An increase in b        thus results in a lower rate of inflation

                           —   —
                                   (W'/bW') C     0
(17)          (dm/db)

       The effecra of a change in b                   on welfare may   be calculated from:


(18)          (dH/db) — 14(m) +           b.W'(w)      (dw/db)

                  — 14(w) —        (4'(w)2/tJ'l(w))
       Whether or noc increases fn b reduce welfare depends on the

where    (sgn) means "of the same sign as".

        In this example dll/db     is   negative   for low rates of inflation and


positive    for high rates of inflation.           Thus increased   indexationwould

worsen welfare at low rates of inflation and improve it at high rates of

inflation.     The former result is a general proposition.           Given the

restrictions    on the   17(r)   function, that it equal zero at zero inflation and

have a positive derivative,         it is impossible     to produce a function     such that

indexation    improves    welfare at rates of inflation close        to zero6

        The results in this section suggest that as a general propositionlow

inflation countries       where the governmentcan closely control the inflation

rate will find inflation mitigation           counterproductive,    but that the

situation is more ambiguous for high inflation countries.              This seems to

conform reasonably well with observed patterns of governmentbehavior.

function;

                             i
(20) Mt_XoTht+i/(l+5)

We assume that if the government fails to produce the expected inflation

rate this period, the private sector expects the discretionary             inflation

rate next period.       If the government produces the expected inflation rate

this period, it is expected           to do so again next period.    As before, the

discretionary      inflation rate is given by:

      —     (a/b) U*(l_k)
       We begin by consideringwhether a zero inflation rate can be sustained

as an equilibrium.          If the government has established credibility to the

point where a zero inflation           rate is anticipated,    it can gain, at least in

the short run by creating unexpectedinflation, and reducing unemployment.

With zero expected inflation,           (3) implies that government's   short run


optimal strategy      is to set:


(21) ,r—aU*(l—k)/(a2+b)

The    temptation for the government to "cheat" and           inflate is given by the
difference between the loss associatedwith (21) and the               loss associated

with following the anticipatedzero inflation strategy.                That is:


       Temptation — Lp.Lc        —
(22)                                 L(a2/b/(l÷a2/b)
where         is the -loss when the rate of inflation is expected        to be and is in

fact equal to 0, and Lc is the smaller loss that results when the government

cheats.

          The punishment faced by the government if it cheats, is the increase in

                                 to their one period discretionary    level.     Since the
inflation expectations
                                          —14—




punishment occurs one period after the gain from increasing                the inflation

tate, it has to be discounted.        Thus the government's    gain from cheating

starting    in a zero inflation equilibrium is:

(23) Cain—Teaptation—Loss/( l+d)


            —(a2/b)L[ (8—a2/b),/[(1÷8) (l+a2/b)
The zero inflation equilibrium is sustainable only if 8<a2/b, a condition

that is mote likely to be satisfied       if inflation mitigation provisions are

put in place and b is small.

       The explanation for the puzzling result that indexation solidifies a

commitment to zero inflation is that it is the feat of punishment that keeps

the governmentfrom producing unexpected inflation.            Since    indexstion makes

the discretionary       equilibriumworse, as we saw in Section        1,    it raises the

punishment for deviating from the zero inflation equilibrium.

       Pethaps the more realistic case to consider is where reputational

considerations    enable the government to have lower inflation rates             than

would otherwise be sustainable, but where they are not strong enough to

permit attainment of the first best.         In this case    8>a2/b.        Let Lt denote

the loss when the governmentis expected to and does produce a positive

inflation rate wt that is less than       lid.
                                                 The loss in this case is:

                                             —15—




        If the government cheats, the loss that occurs in the
                                                              succeeding period
 is:

 (26) Loss_bord2_5r2)

 The equilibrium    inflation rate rr can he solved for by equating        the

 temptation   to cheat in (25) to the present value of the loss in (26): This

 is the lowest inflation rate at which the government is not
                                                             tempted to

produce surprise inflation.          It is given by the solution to:

(27) r_A(l_k)U*

       b252[2+6+a2/b]   — 2ab(l+6)         —o


Real solutions     to this pair of equations exist only if 6a2/b<l,        that is if

the government is not too impatient. Otherwise the government is unable to
establish any sort of reputation, and goes to the one period discretionary
solution.     In the interesting case, where a reputationcan be established,

but zero inflation cannot be attained, the consistent inflation rate is

between 0 and

       Inspectionof (27) reveals that b and A enter the same way so that an

increase in b is offset      by an    equal proportionate   change in A and hence in

the consistent   inflation    rate.    Equivalently   the elasticityof A with

respect to b is minus one.       Thus an increase in inflation mitigationwhich

reduces b, increases the equilibriuminflation rate.              Since the welfare loss

from inflation in each period is given by
                                                    br2, it   follows that increases in

b reduce the total cost of inflation, a result paralleling our discussion in

it is that the governmentcan sustain a zero inflation rate.             But, if we

reduced unemploymentas argued by Tobin             (1972), or some fora of desirable

redistribution     as argued   by Creider   (1987).       Policymakers   who believed   that

inflation had desirable       side effects would want to run higher rates of

inflation     than those who thought it did not have any benefits.             They would
therefore have a greater incentive to mitigate the distortions created                  by
inflation.      Decisions   to adopt inflation mitigationstrategies might then be

interpreted by the private sector as signalling              an intention on the part of

the government     to pursue inflationist policies.



Political    Considerations




     In commentingon Barro and Cordon (198Th), John Taylor raises an

important question about dynamic consistency approaches to the analysis                 of

inflation:    "In other well recognized time inconsistency             situations society

seems to have found ways to institute the optimal policy.                For example

patent laws are not repealed       each year to prevent holders of patents from

creating monopolist inefficiencies.         .   .. It   is difficult   to see why the zero

inflation policy would not be adopted in much a [Barro—Cordon] world."                  One

explanation    for governmentm'    success in solving the patent problem,          and its

failure in other areas       such am the frequent payment of ransom to kidnappers,

is their tendency to respond to concentrated intense interests, rather than

more diffuse groups.        The small group of patent holders can prevent

expropriation    of their patents, but the diffuse group of potential future

kidnap victims cannot prevent the payment of ransom on behalf of today's

highly visible victims.

      This line of argument suggests that cettain forms of inflation

                                                                  from being
mitigation such as measures that protect Social Security benefits

eroded by increased inflation, or that prevent inflation from causing sharp

increases in business     tax burdens, may significantly       inctease equilibrium

inflation rates and reduce welfare by eliminating         important sources of

            oppositionto inflation.        On the other hand, measures        like the use
political

of inflation accounting or the issuance of indexed bonds, that do not

undercut important anti—inflation       lobbiea may have less pronounced inflation


enhancing effects.                                             -




      The reputation,    signalling,   and political   considerations       considered

here all suggest that inflation mitigationpolicies may well lead to

increases   in inflation and potentially to reductions in welfare. There is

however an important contrast between theae results and the ones in the

preceding section.      There we argued in the context of one—shot game models

that indexationwas least likely to be attractiveat low rates of inflation.

Our analysis here suggests that successful development of a reputationcan

mubsritute for foregoing inflation mitigation.          To the extent that aome

nations enjoy low inflation, because their anti—inflation               reputations   are

secure, there is an incentive to index, patticulatlyif the rate of

inflation cannot be accuratelycontrolled.




IV.   Conclusions.




      Our main conclusion is that governments whose ability to aaintain low

totes of inflation is uncertain may end up by increasing            inflation and
                                              —19—




reducing welfare    If they attempt to reduce the costs       of   actual   must ion.
Measures which reduce the cost of anticipated           inflation, or undercut

opposition    to it are particularly likely to be pernicious.           Governments

with impeccable anti—inflationary       credentials    have little reason to

fear iodexation, snd some reason to favor it, particularly            if they cannot

control the inflation rate precisely.           Of course, at very low rates of

inflation,    the transaction costs associatedwith the introduction            and use of

indexationmay weight against doing so.

     The analysis    raises a number of questions        that could usefully be

explored in further work.        First, are our conclusions     empiricallyvalid?

One implication of the approach would seem to be that the extent of

indexation    is U—shaped    in relation to the inflation rate: governments with a

reputation    allow indexstion;    governments without a reputation with high b

have mediuai inflation; and governments without a reputationand low b have

high inflation and much indexation.           The descendingportion of the U

probably    does not exist in practice,       but that may be because of the costs of

indexation.     It is certainly    true that indexation and inflation mitigation

measures    are much more common in high than in medium inflation countries.

But it is difficult to think of a model in which this would not be true.

     If a government can commit to not mitigating inflation, why can't it

commit to keeping the inflation rate low?            Probably the answer lies in the

different    structure of monetary    and inflation mitigationpolicies.          A

commitment to not index government debt is credible, since if nominal bonds

are issuS, there would be no incentive to index them ex—post.               Similarly,   tax

rules cannot be changed ex—post to reflect distortions in measured income

caused by inflation,        More generally,    the fact that monetary   policies are
                                          —20—




                                        whereas fiscal institutions can only be
subject to continuous alteration,

            intermittently   allows greater commitment    with respect to these
adjusted

institutions.

     What about private sector inflation mitigationefforts?             To the extent

that these efforts are dependent on governmentdeterminedregulatory rules,

                                                      private sector responses    to
the preceding analysis       applies.   Recognizing

                                                                  relevant
inflation raises an interesting and perhaps empirically                      possibility

of an inflationary shock setting off a spiral.           If the private sector can

                                                 of any given inflation rate
adapt to inflation it is plausible that the cost

                                                  inflation rate.     (For example,    the

inflation raises the equilibriumrate of inflation,             further reducing the


coat of subsequent inflation,       and so the inflation rate may ratchet

would represent Pareto improvements if behavior were unchanged by their

implementation,   may be undesirable once their incentive effects are

recognized.   Thus, a better tax system may lead to more wasteful   spending,

better cars to more speeding, and better inflation protection to more

inflation.
