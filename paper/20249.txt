                                                ABSTRACT

Research on intellectual property has focused on formal legally recorded rights that we call deeded,
most often measured by granted patents. Meanwhile, other “defacto” IP (mainly purposive secrecy
and natural excludability) has become more important because of the increasing closeness of commercial
technologies to cutting edge science. A “corporate-academic” model has developed and become institutionalized
over the last three decades which emphasizes attracting the best and brightest scientists, providing
them with a commensurate increase in autonomy including initiation of bench-level collaborations
with top university scientists in which valuable tacit knowledge is transferred in both directions. We
provide suggestive evidence that both firm and university scientists learn from these collaborations,
e.g., both types of scientists experience sharply higher patenting rates once they have engage in university-firm
collaborations. We propose and test two indicators of adoption of the corporate-academic model, whether
or not the firm has ever: (a) co-authored an article with a university scientist and (b) applied for (an
eventually granted) patent with non-patent references, where these references are used importantly
to cite scientific articles and other scientific materials. Both were robustly positive and statistically
significant across four measures of U.S. high-tech firm success (publishing, patenting, obtaining venture
capital, and going public) for six broad S&T areas (bio/chem/med, information technology, nanotechnology,
semiconductors, other science, and other engineering). Star scientists publication as or with firm employees,
SBIR grants received, and citation-weighted patents and articles all played comparatively supporting
roles in the empirical estimates. We concluded that the most successful high-tech firms have adopted
a strategy of operating near the edge of the scientific envelope where high levels of tacit knowledge
provide substantial natural excludability reducing or preventing entry of imitators.

1        Introduction
        Are basic science and industrial innovation growing closer to each other? There is some
evidence that it is in the research reported here, and in a number of other recent studies. But most
of the evidence from other work comes from the patent side – focusing recently especially on the
inclusion of scientific articles under “Other References” on patents. However, this focus on
deeded intellectual property leaves out a range of defacto intellectual property including natural
excludability, which firms have increasingly used, as well as trade and actual secrecy. These
intellectual property rights, or IPRs, prevent imitators from competing away the rents necessary
to induce sufficient investment in inventions to bring the successful ones to market as the
innovations which ultimately drive growth in wages, GDP, and our standard of living. We
present evidence here that as technology has moved closer to cutting edge science, defacto IP has
become increasingly important in practice and has long been more important than deeded IP in a
number of industries. We believe we make a case for broadening our understanding of
intellectual property beyond the proverbial lamppost of patents.
        Why study emergent technology areas where scientific breakthroughs have just been
made? The creative destruction that takes place under these conditions is one fundamental reason
(Schumpeter 1942, Aghion and Howitt 1992), but we propose that more attention should be
focused on the “creative construction” part: the emergence of new structures and mechanisms,
primarily in new firms but also in transformed existing firms (Romanelli 1991, Liebeskind,

Oliver, Zucker and Brewer 1996, Zucker and Darby 1996, 1997). These are the building blocks
of emerging firms and, in some cases, new industries that incorporate very different
technological bases and activities, even when end products have a similar function.
        We start our story here with the biotechnology revolution that replaced chemically-based
pharmaceuticals with biologically-based ones, using radically different drug discovery tools and
adding new, fermentation-based, manufacturing technologies. It was in the course of this
revolution that many of the significantly new structures and mechanisms we examine here were
either initially or further developed. From the experience of the formation/reconstitution of this
industry, a more fundamental understanding was developed of how to source highly tacit
external knowledge both effectively and with acceptable risk. This is difficult to accomplish
when transmission generally requires face-to-face joint research, most often at the lab bench.
One indicator of the risk is that joint ventures between firms rarely engage in basic research. 1
        In the research reported here we show that two mechanisms identified as important early
in the development of the biotechnology industry – but not frequently found at that time in other
high technology firms and areas – have become increasingly important for most, though not all,
areas of high technology: First, hands-on involvement of university faculty and stars in
collaborations, and often leadership of research teams, in the firm (Zucker, Darby and Armstrong
1998, 2002, Powell, White, Koput, Owen-Smith 2005, Oliver 2004, Kreiner and Schultz 1993,
Pisano 1990), and second, integration of highly tacit knowledge into patents via non-patent
references including research articles. Non-patent references yield arguably stronger protection
of the broader knowledge now embedded in the patent (Branstetter 2005, Branstetter and Ogura
2005, Narin, Hamilton and Olivastro 1997). 2 Validating the decisions to adopt these
mechanisms more widely across industries, we provide evidence in the results section below that
private firms gain significant competitive advantage from one or both of these mechanisms
across most science and technology areas. 3
        Before turning to a more detailed discussion of the two mechanisms we have just briefly
introduced and their effect on firm success, we will now outline a few concepts that we will
return to often in the course of discussing the research reported here. Information refers to
separable pieces of knowledge that do not require further information of any type to use that bit
or byte of data. There seems to be an implicit assumption that cumulative and/or complex
information is simply more of the same, and thus readily accessible to others rather than an
excludable good. Knowledge is defined as either: (1) The result of cumulative, sequenced

team science.
2
  We also predict by implication, but do not test here, that there is some protection for IP in
related research articles cited in the patent’s “Other References” section, by serving to widen the
scope of patent protection. These articles may contain knowledge not yet protected by patents.

  Clusters of six areas, comparable across science and technology structures and activities that
include journal articles, patents, grants, and measures of firm success, as defined in Darby and
Zucker 1999.

learning, required to acquire and use the information in practice, and also to use this information
and its implications to further develop the body of knowledge, and/or (2) Highly complex,
interrelated information that is difficult to parse out and understand by reducing it to its
components. This “embedded” type of knowledge may implicitly define the relevance of
different pieces of information for each other and also define relevance to the whole body of
related knowledge. In both cases, the sum is greater than the parts because the interrelation of the
different pieces of information, as well as an understanding of how to use it in practice, is crucial
to developing the body of knowledge further.
        Thus, we define knowledge as distinct from information. We have asserted with some
evidence that knowledge is often naturally excludable due to its tacitness and also by virtue of its
social production that is often bounded by teams, professions, organizations, and cultures
(Zucker, Darby and Brewer 1998, Zucker, Darby, Brewer and Peng 1996, Zucker, Darby and
Torero 2002). We expect our findings to hold under the following two conditions: first, when
firms working in a new area of technology face similar organizational challenges in developing a
knowledge stream and, second, when that knowledge stream is similar in both moderate to high
degree of tacitness and in expected value. Tacit knowledge, whether conscious or not, is difficult
to communicate effectively: Parts of tacit knowledge with low value are probably never
communicated to others, while new tacit knowledge with high value will generally be
communicated with a lag due to competing, higher value, uses of that knowledge. Highly tacit
knowledge is best transmitted after partial codification – concepts, formulae, machines – are
developed to help transmit it (Zucker, Darby and Armstrong 2002 and Figure 5 below).



2      Motivation
        Our research is motivated by a desire to understand the development and routinization of
two primary mechanisms. The first mechanism, shown on the right side of Figure 1, is a set of
practices that encourage close working relationships among scientists who are part of a wider
“invisible college” of scientists (Crane 1969, 1972), and, if the area is ripe for
commercialization, yields many university-firm joint articles. This mechanism is amplified by
adoption by firms of a variant of the academic university model, grafted on when knowledge
discovery, as well as commercialization, is a central function of the firm (Liebeskind, Oliver,
Zucker and Brewer 1996, Oliver and Montgomery 2000, Baker, Miner and Eesley 2003, Oliver
2004; Kreiner and Schultz 1993; Powell, White, Koput, Owen-Smith 2005).
        In what we will term the “corporate-academic” form, scientists working in the firm often
face few restrictions on their research activities and output: they may initiate collaborations with
outside scientists, may send out for publication within three months or so after discovery (with




                                                 3
corporate lawyers filing for patents within these time constrains), and can propose research
agendas and continue along the approved research path with low oversight. 4

      In this “corporate-academic” model, scientists have a great deal of control over their own
work and the conditions under which it is performed. This new model contrasts sharply with

 These internal firm proposals are typically 3-5 page documents that replace the 20-50 page and
more research proposals to external granting agencies in the pure academic organizational form
(Source: authors’ own interviews with start-up firms, analysis of data in the BioScan directory
1989-1997, and Oliver 2009). These projects usually continue to be funded until the firm and/or
science advisory panel evaluates progress as insufficient or the research path as not promising.

earlier “scientists in industry” models, where scientists were employed under non-scientist
bureaucrats who controlled their research agendas and goals but were without necessary science
or engineering training and experience, giving the scientists little voice in the content of their
own work (Marcson 1960 and 1961; Kornhauser 1962). Outside scientific collaborations were
few and were subject to this same heavy control, often unattractive to external top scientific
talent.
         A large body of research that we and others have published builds a strong foundation for
inference about the importance of top scientists and about the kind of knowledge transfer that
can only occur with frequent, close working relationships, most commonly identified through
jointly published research articles or jointly invented patents (Zucker, Darby and Armstrong
1998, 2002, Mansfield 1995, Azoulay, Graff Zivin and Wang 2010, Azoulay, Graff Zivin and
Sampat 2014, Powell, White, Koput, Owen-Smith 2005, Zucker, Darby and Torero 2002). We
believe that this need for close working relationships with university faculty – who are
compensated in various ways – accounts for the geographic localization of knowledge found by
Jaffe (1989) and his many followers. 5
         The second mechanism, found on the left side of Figure 1, is an elaboration and
institutionalization of a legal practice to incorporate highly tacit knowledge, possibly expanding
the range/scope of a largely codified patent by listing relevant research articles and other
scientific materials (e.g., GenBlast searches) under “Other References” on the patent’s front
page.
         Figure 2 provides strong evidence of evolution in the content of patents towards more
widespread use of scientific articles and other non-patent references across all areas of science
except for semiconductors. Between 2004 and 2010, the percentage of all patents which have
non-patent references rose by another 8.5 percentage points to over 65 percent, which is 4.4
times the rate observed in 1975. Bio/Chem/Med has the same upward trend as Computing/IT,
Nanotechnology, Other Science and – to some degree – Other Engineering, but these last four
areas collectively accounted for most of the recent increase in the use of non-patent references,
including research articles.
         Figures 3 and 4 provide preliminary, striking evidence of the micro-processes that
underlie the change in practices and success of scientists who work across the boundaries
between firms and universities, using data from our large database, COMETSandSTARS. 6 These
two sets of nested graphs visually present our initial results from a wider quantitative study of the
micro-processes that underlie the effects of star scientist-firm and university-firm co-publishing
that we report below in our tables. While nearly 10 million scientists publish and/or patent in the

  Zucker, Darby and Armstrong (1998) is focused on developing this argument and providing
evidence for market-based diffusion of tacit knowledge. The spillovers (correctly, positive
externalities) from academic research come through articles and patent disclosures which do not
imply geographic localization (unless published only in an obscure language).

        Specifically, in Figure 3 we find preliminary evidence that firm scientists who cross
university-firm boundary through co-authoring or co-inventing patent more. Moving to the next
figure, we also see that boundary spanning has the same effect on patenting by university
scientists as we see in Figure 3 for firm scientists: Figure 4 shows that the probability of
patenting for university scientists is substantially higher if they have prior firm co-publishing or
co-patenting ties, compared to those without. So this is not simply sorting out university
scientists who are better than firm scientists, or the firm scientists that are better than university
scientists, but rather provides evidence of a more general effect of crossing the university-firm
boundary on patenting. This is in line with some earlier results that show increased publishing
for university biotech stars during and after firm ties (Zucker and Darby 2007).

        Figure 5 sketches the basic model. Knowledge tends to evolve from new, highly tacit to
codified, and finally to taken for granted where it is once again highly tacit. Thus, we embed our
understanding of tacit knowledge in dual literatures that seldom cross-reference each other: one
on work contexts and, more specifically, on technology transfer from science to industry, and the
other on culture and society, spanning organizations, professions and groups. Knowledge
codification processes, including new vocabularies (terms, phrases), mathematical formulae, and
machines, 7 can be initiated for tacit knowledge at both ends, yielding the middle highly codified
state.

  Machines often encode part of the discovery, making use of the new methods routine and
simple, allowing entry of non-discovering scientists and initiating a higher rate of diffusion
commensurate with the value of the methods made routine (Baird 2004:Ch.6). Examples in
biotechnology include gene splicing machines and in nanotechnology scanning probe
microscopes, and later atomic force microscopes.


                                                                    8
         Highly tacit knowledge dominates at both high and low degrees of institutionalization.
Both are of interest for the research reported here. At one end of the continuum, there is a
discovering scientist who, when the discovery is initially made, may be the only one who really
understands fully what the discovery is, how it was produced and how to proceed in order to
make the next related discovery8. At the other end is the team, sharing at least some of the tacit
knowledge involved in the discovery, but bounded from other groups operating at that end such
that explaining or sharing the discovery with them is not simple and perhaps not even possible, at
least initially.
         Tacit knowledge can be viewed as at least partially rivalrous and excludable information
and thus “appropriable” as long as it remains difficult to learn it. Therefore, the scientists who
hold this knowledge become the main resource around which firms are built or transformed (in
biotechnology, see Zucker, Darby, and Brewer 1998, Zucker, Darby, and Armstrong 1998, 2002;
in nanotechnology, see Darby and Zucker 2005). This has a number of important implications:
    • Diffusion occurs slowly, from one of the discoverers to his/her research team. Tacit
         knowledge, not yet codified, is transmitted best at the lab bench. In biotechnology, from
         1969 to the end of our data set in 1992, 81 percent of new authors reporting genetic-
        sequence discoveries for the first time in articles recorded in GenBank were writing as
        co-authors with previously published discoverers (Zucker, Darby and Torero 2002, pp.
         632-633). Some of this effect is due most likely to training postdoctoral students, but the
         percentage is too high for training new entrants to be the primary explanation.
    • The discovery is not alienable from the scientists as long as it remains tacit. The tacit
         knowledge is part of their intellectual human capital. Due to the naturally excludable
         nature of tacit knowledge, this human capital earns supernormal returns to investment
         until the diffusion level drives the return to that knowledge down to the cost of learning it
         from others (Zucker, Darby and Torero 2002).
    • Even if the university is assigned a patent to the discovery most of the value accrues to the
         discoverers since without their cooperation the patent cannot be used. Our fieldwork for
         biotechnology and more general studies by Jensen and Thursby (2001) and Thursby and
         Thursby (2002) support the natural excludability hypothesis. For example, in the Jensen
         and Thursby survey of Technology Transfer Office managers (2001, p. 243): “For 71
         percent of the inventions licensed, respondents claim that successful commercialization
         requires cooperation by the inventor and licensee in further development.”

  This constitutes personal knowledge and excludes others (Polanyi 1962). If a person dies
without communicating the knowledge, then it is lost. Similarly, knowledge is lost if a research
line ends and all retire or die, as happened in Russia when physicists with knowledge of nuclear
weapons construction retired (MacKenzie and Spinardi 1995).

4      Defacto and Deeded Intellectual Property: Two Definitions
        Before turning to some examples of the operation of informal, naturally excludable,
intellectual property across emerging industries and all high technology industries, we will
define and distinguish more clearly among types of intellectual property.
        Deeded intellectual property rights are straightforward in their meaning: rights of control
or exclusion stated in a deed that enumerates specific rights belonging to the holder of the deed. 9
For a U.S. patent (from “letters patent”—in clear words) or registered copyright, 10 the holder of
the deed is the inventor(s) or creator(s) unless his or her rights have been re-granted, or
“assigned,” to another. In patents, if such an assignment has been made by the time the patent is
issued – usually several years after the invention – the “assignee at issue” is listed as such on the
patent front page, often but not necessarily the organization, or one of the organizations, where
the inventor works.
        Figure 6 summarizes the major types of intellectual property (IP) which provide
protection from unlicensed use and hence incentive for innovation in the U.S. and many other
advanced economies. Patents and registered copyrights provide formal rights to sue for damages
and/or injunctive relief from unlicensed users of inventions and other forms of creation. These
are the most important deeded IP for innovation. Registered trade and service marks can play a
supplementary role in extending some protection with respect to some consumers after patent
protection has expired. The scientific literature can be used to establish priority of invention,
implicitly broaden claims while aiding required disclosure, and establish prior art in challenging
a patent held by another firm (see Web of Science, maintained by Thomson Reuters -- as
successor to the Institute for Scientific Information or ISI – and Google). Scientific articles can
also serve purposes of disclosure (required for a valid patent) and, paradoxically, stake out
broader claims with less full disclosure than might otherwise be allowed.
        Deeded intellectual property rights are systematically measurable indicators of specific
innovative activities by identifiable actors and have become central to empirical research on
innovation. Unfortunately, a narrow focus on the readily measured deeded IPRs to the exclusion

9
  Deeds to land specify the boundaries and content, such as mineral rights, that are controlled by
the owner. In the same way, a patent’s “claims” section describes the boundaries and specific
“claimed” content of the invention controlled by the owner of the patent. References to related
prior patents are included to specify and exclude technologies that belong to the owners of the
referenced patent(s) and excluded from any claims granted by this patent. It may be necessary for
the owner to obtain a license from, ownership of, or expiration of the referenced patent(s) in
order to practice the technology described in the patent.
10
   Unregistered copyrights operate like defacto IPRs discussed below, rather than deeded IPRs. It
is possible to sue for infringement though no copyright notice is required, and does not have to
be filed to be enforceable. Unregistered copyrights transfer only to heirs, and are valued by
damage awards. Potential problems around the broad power of unregistered copyright are clear,
and challenges likely.

the lamppost because the light is best there, even though the keys were dropped over in the dark.
Other forms of intellectual property are rarely if ever recorded and serve as both substitutes and
complements to the deeded forms of IP. We call these unrecorded forms “defacto” IP (for IP “in
fact,” if not in law).

       The first group of defacto IP is those associated with conscious strategies of and
investments in secrecy and concealment. One strategy is to take the steps necessary to establish
and maintain trade secrets which are enforceable in court although the need to do so may mean
the end of their value to their creator. An alternative or complementary strategy is to use actual
secrecy as with the Coca-Cola formula or much earlier obstetric forceps. Since the most effective
use of these strategies means that there are no markers other than persistent firm success,
empirical research in innovation is hard pressed to deal with these methods. Although the forceps
and Coca-Cola secrets are known to have been maintained for a century or more, in industries in
which lead times are long relative to the product cycle or the learning curve is very steep secrets
need not remain so for more than a year or two to offer effective protection for innovation.
Klevorick, Levin, Nelson, and Winter (1995, pp. 793-798) report survey results that secrecy, lead
time, and learning curve are each regarded as more important than patents for most industries.
Among the generally more high-tech oriented firms participating in the U.S. Commerce
Department’s Advanced Technology Program, patents were a primary intellectual property


                                                                    11
strategy for 61 percent compared to 51 percent for trade secrets, with about three quarters of the
firms reporting use of patents and secrecy as either a primary or secondary strategy (Powell
1997). Cheung (1982) provides a rare analysis of the use of trade and actual secrecy. While
discussing the Coca Cola formula and other successful uses of secrecy, Cheung was apparently
not aware of obstetrical forceps which were closely held as a trade secret for over 150 years
because English law did not permit patenting such life-saving inventions (Dunn 1999, U.K.
Patent Office 2004).
         The most important source of latent IP derives from the tacit knowledge that surrounds
almost every scientific and technological breakthrough. 11 Generally, only the discoverer or
discovering team possesses the full knowledge of how to do what has been achieved for the first
time. There is a great deal of tacit knowledge of exactly what all is involved in the procedures
outlined in a scientific article or patent. Indeed what are necessary steps or environment is
usually not known until much later when simplifications are tested as part of codification
process. The small number per year of successful new learners in a single laboratory
compounded by keeping the best on one of his or her mentor’s teams, 12 creates a slow spread of
knowledge which can be tracked in a chain of mentors/mentees that can span decades (Zucker,
Darby and Torero 2002). In Zucker, Darby, and Brewer (1998) we argued and provided initial
evidence that this “natural excludability” of most breakthrough scientific and technological
innovations made it difficult for imitative rivals to compete away the high returns of the
discoverers and the early mentees and the firms that they found and guide. In Zucker, Darby and
Armstrong (1998, 2002) and Zucker and Darby (2001) we showed that co-authorship of
scientific articles was evidence of working together sufficient to transfer tacit knowledge.
         Breakthrough tacit knowledge is embodied in and travels through people to impact
positively on firms’ success. The underlying mechanisms engendering impact, while shared to
some degree between other forms of intellectual property rights, are inherently part of
intellectual human capital, and require transmission from person to person. Note that the various
types of rights are not exclusive but often combine. For example, we have discovered through
interviews with scientists, firm executives, and firm and university intellectual property lawyers
that it is fairly common to combine two or more types of rights to strengthen protection, and also
common (but far from universal) to progress from defacto to deeded rights as codification
occurs.

11
   There is one other type of IP which is not actively concealed (as a rule) but neither is it
reported in any systematic way accessible for empirical research: it also remains latent,
indicative of its unconscious or incidental hidden nature as opposed to active concealment. Thus,
unregistered copyrights, trademarks, and service marks belonging to innovative firms are
unregistered primarily because the additional protection afforded by registration is deemed not
worth the cost except for a few specifically identified items for which deeded IPRs are obtained.
12
   For example, as late as the mid-1990s a distinguished university bioscientist who made a
former student rich by hiring him for the biotech firm founded by the professor denounced a rival
professor-entrepreneur who “tried to steal my best cloner.”

       The data are all derived from the on-line public libraries Nanobank.org and
kauffman.org/comets/ which we and our team have created as a public resource or from the
source data in the COMETSandSTARS database at UCLA for on-site use by qualified
researchers with approval of the commercial licensors. The database is documented in Zucker,
Darby and Fong (2014). This empirical analysis is limited to U.S. firms during the period of
Nanobank data 1981-2004. We plan to extend Nanobank to at least 2012 as a component of
COMETS and COMETSandSTARS databases, but those data are not yet completed.

Notes: a. Knowledge stocks are calculated by adding the two-year-window-citations-weighted count of
articles or patents to 0.8 times the previous year’s knowledge stock value (reduced by a conventional
20%/year depreciation rate).
         b. Patents refer to all patents that were granted by the end of 2005 which were applied for in the
current year.
         c. The amounts of venture capital investment and SBIR grants received are measured as 3-year
moving averages dated by the last of the 3 years. After lagging this is the average amount over the 3
years prior to the current year.

       The analysis is based on concepts of region and science and technology (S&T) areas that
are conveniently coded in the databases above. The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis defines
179 functional economic areas such that each U.S. county is assigned to a region which includes

the major metropolitan center for which commuting, shopping, and newspaper readership
predominate (Johnson and Kort 2004). These “BEA areas” are used to define the local regions
in which firms operate. We use “establishment” to refer to the operations of a given firm in a
given region. A firm can have 1 or more establishments. The analysis data set comprises a panel
of observations for establishments and year. Summary statistics for the full sample are reported
in Table 1 and Table 2 reports these statistics for the sample restricted to private firms. 13

Notes: a. Knowledge stocks are calculated by adding the two-year-window-citations-weighted count of
articles or patents to 0.8 times the previous year’s knowledge stock value (reduced by a conventional
20%/year depreciation rate).
         b. Patents refer to all patents that were granted by the end of 2005 which were applied for in the
current year.
         c. The amounts of venture capital investment and SBIR grants received are measured as 3-year
moving averages dated by the last of the 3 years. After lagging this is the average amount over the 3

        Darby and Zucker (1999) attempt to specify a set of seven area clusters which can be
used to compare activity in journal articles (Institute for Scientific Information 1981-1997),
university doctoral programs (National Research Council 1995), and patents (Zucker and Darby
1999). These seven clusters are used here with two exceptions: First, the humanities and the
social sciences are dropped for this study because they have little specific applicability to
particular high technology industries. Second, we subtract those articles and patents identified
for NanoBank.org from the area in which they would have been previously classified. Thus, we
obtain 6 S&T areas: Biotechnology/Chemistry/Medicine, Computing/Information Technology,

13
     Corresponding tables of correlations for these variables are in Appendix Tables A1 and A2.


                                                                                                    14
Nanotechnology, Semiconductors/Integrated Circuits/Superconductors, Other Engineering, and
Other Sciences. A given establishment is assigned to the one or more S&T areas in which it has
patented, published, and/or received Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grants.
        Articles are counted by pro-rating among the reported research addresses in the
ThomsonReuters Web of ScienceTM (WoS) database. Patents from COMETS are located in
regions in proportion to the residences of the inventor(s) and attributed to the firm assignee’s
establishments in the same regions. As a quality control, patents are counted weighed by their
citations by other patents in the year granted and the next year. Articles are counted weighed by
their WoS citations in the year of publication and the next year. When used as regressands in
poisson regressions any fractional counts for articles or patents are rounded up to the next
integer. We also create knowledge stocks for citation-weighted articles or patents, with the prior
year’s knowledge stock depreciated by a conventional 20 percent and added to this year’s
citation-weighted count of articles or patents, respectively.
        Star scientists are defined at the 5,401 stars as identified in ISIHighlyCited.comSM; see
Zucker and Darby (2014) in this issue for a detailed discussion and validation of this definition
of stars. The COMETSandSTARS articles data were queried to count the number of star
scientists on each WoS article in a given year which includes the establishment’s address as an
author’s address. The sum of these counts over all the establishment’s articles for the year gives
the total number of times stars appear in the year as or with the establishment’s employees, also
known as its star article ties for the year. These counts provide a gauge of the extent of star
involvement and breakthrough tacit knowledge transfer that has proven valuable in predicting
firm success measures such as new products, employment growth and patents (Zucker, Darby
and Armstrong 1998, 2002; Zucker and Darby 2001).
        The COMETSandSTARS articles data also were queried to determine whether or not
each establishment has ever through a given year had an author on an article which also had a
university author. This provides an indicator that the establishment is both open to university
collaborations and has scientists capable of engaging in them and thus receiving tacit knowledge
flows.
        Data on venture capital investments in firms was obtained from the VentureXpert
database, currently available from ThomsonReuters. SBIR grants to firms will soon be available
on-line from COMETS. SBIR grants received by a firm are prorated over the term of the grant
and among the firm’s known establishments.
        The establishments in the analysis data set are those which appeared at least once through
authorship, patenting, venture capital investments, or SBIR grants. For the purpose of identifying
firms, articles and patents are not weighted so that even 0-citation documents count. Firms are
classed as private until they are traded a U.S. exchange NASDAQ or listed as trading over the
counter. Initial public offerings are identified using four primary sources: Compustat, EdgarPro
Online, SDC's Global New Issues database, and VentureXpert. These sources mostly agreed on
whether and when (at least to the year) initial public offerings occurred, but in numerous cases a
process of hand-coded reconciliation across the sources was used.

6          Empirical Results
       In this section we report empirical evidence on the determinants of patenting and article
publication by high-tech firm establishments, on the amounts of venture capital investments
which they receive, and on the timing of their initial public offering if any. Our estimates are
made using STATA 13 and standard methods so we will describe them with the results.
6.1        Citation-Weighted Articles
        We report our estimates for publication of citation-weighted articles by U.S. high-tech-
firm establishments in Table 3. Since the publication of a WoS article by a firm establishment is
generally a rare event, particularly one that gains any WoS citations in the first two year, it is
appropriate to use poisson regression or one of its variants for estimation. To deal with concerns

         Estimates are for poisson regressions with firm fixed effects (unreported constants for each
establishment) and with robust standard errors. The regressands are two-year-window-citations-
weighted-counts of articles with author(s) giving the establishment’s address in the article. Observations
for establishments with all 0 dependent variables are dropped due to the establishment-specific
constants.
         a. Knowledge stocks are calculated by adding the two-year-window-citations-weighted count of
articles or patents to 0.8 times the previous year’s knowledge stock value (reduced by a conventional
20%/year depreciation rate).
         b. Patents refer to all patents that were granted by the end of 2005 which were applied for in the
current year.



                                                                      16
         c. The amounts of venture capital investment and SBIR grants received are measured as 3-year
moving averages dated by the last of the 3 years. After lagging this is the average amount over the 3
years prior to the current year.
         d. All regressions also include the control variables (coefficients not reported here but available
from first author): entry dummy (1 in year firm enters, otherwise 0), establishment age, year dummies for
2003, 2004, 2005 (controls for patents applied for but not granted by the end of 2005).

of reverse causation and limit the effects of any omitted establishment-specific variables, we lag
all the explanatory variables by one year and estimate with establishment fixed effects and robust
standard errors. 14 We also exclude the articles knowledge stock as reflecting past history of what
is being predicted. Two measures of scientific strength of the establishment – the patenting
knowledge stock and star scientists’ involvement – are robustly positive and significant across all
6 S&T areas with the exception of the star variable for Other Engineering. We interpret the
similar robustly positive and significant coefficients on appearance of non-patent references in
the establishment’s patents and a demonstrated openness to and capability of collaboration with
university scientists as indicators that movement toward the university campus institutional
model indeed predicts publishing more cited articles. We estimate generally positive coefficients
for the two resource variables – venture capital and SBIR grants received – but only two of these
reach conventional statistical significance.

   For these estimates and those in Table 4 using the same methodology, STATA drops
observations for establishments with all 0 dependent variables since the establishment fixed
effect constants fit them perfectly.


                                                                      17

         Estimates are for poisson regressions with firm fixed effects (unreported constants for each
establishment) and with robust standard errors. The regressands are two-year-window-citations-
                              b
weighted-counts of patents assigned to the establishment's firm with inventor(s) in the same region as
the establishment. Observations for establishments with all 0 dependent variables are dropped due to
the establishment-specific constants.
         All firms with no US patents at any location over the entire period are dropped before estimation.
         a. Knowledge stocks are calculated by adding the two-year-window-citations-weighted count of
articles or patents to 0.8 times the previous year’s knowledge stock value (reduced by a conventional
20%/year depreciation rate).
         b. Patents refer to all patents that were granted by the end of 2005 which were applied for in the
current year.
         c. The amounts of venture capital investment and SBIR grants received are measured as 3-year
moving averages dated by the last of the 3 years. After lagging this is the average amount over the 3
years prior to the current year.
         d. All regressions also include the control variables (coefficients not reported here but available
from first author): entry dummy (1 in year firm enters, otherwise 0), establishment age, year dummies for
2003, 2004, 2005 (controls for patents applied for but not granted by the end of 2005).

        Surprisingly to us, the same two campus-model indicators – non-patent reference on any
of establishment’s patents and history of establishment-university collaboration – were the only
variables with uniformly significant effects for all 6 S&T areas. The science-base variables of
articles knowledge stock and star scientists publishing as or with establishment employees were
significant for both Bio/Chem/Med and Computing/IT and either Other Engineering or Other
Science, respectively. The amount of venture capital was significantly positive for three S&T
areas while SBIR grants were significantly positive for one area but significantly negative for
another.

6.3     Venture Capital Investments in Private Firms
        Given the prominent role of venture capital in the U.S. national innovation system, we
investigate what sorts of firms are most likely to receive investments from venture capital firms
as reported in Table 5. If venture capitalists in this period had a checklist of criteria, they seemed
to apply pretty equally across high-tech areas: an impressive patenting track record and the
corporate-academic model as evidenced by non-patent references on those patents and
collaborations with university scientists on articles. The coefficients for all three of those
variables were universally significantly positive. Venture capitalists also seemed to like to invest
in firms that received SBIR grants (5 significantly positive coefficients), but were not too much
impressed with star ties (2 significantly positive coefficients). Of the five statistically significant
coefficients for the articles knowledge stock, only the one for other science was positive.
Apparently, venture capitalists view articles written by firm scientists as a labor cost unless they
are with university scientists and/or produce sufficient patents.

         Estimates are for Tobit regressions with robust standard errors. The regressands are amounts of
investments by venture capital firms in the establishment in the year, with multi-establishment firm
investments divided equally among known establishments.
         a. Knowledge stocks are calculated by adding the two-year-window-citations-weighted count of
articles or patents to 0.8 times the previous year’s knowledge stock value (reduced by a conventional
20%/year depreciation rate).
         b. Patents refer to all patents that were granted by the end of 2005 which were applied for in the
current year.
         c. The amounts of venture capital investment and SBIR grants received are measured as 3-year
moving averages dated by the last of the 3 years. After lagging this is the average amount over the 3
years prior to the current year.
         d. All regressions also include the control variables (coefficients not reported here but available
from first author): entry dummy (1 in year firm enters, otherwise 0), establishment age, year dummies for
2003, 2004, 2005 (controls for patents applied for but not granted by the end of 2005).


6.4        Private Firms Going Public
        If venture capital firms are efficient allocators of capital, one would expect the same
predictors to do well for both obtaining venture capital and for going public, the biggest source
of payoff for venture capitalists. However, only one of their apparent main criteria – non-patent
references on the establishment’s patents – have significantly positive coefficients for all six
S&T areas as reported in Table 6. The only other similarly strong predictor is the amount of
money invested by the venture capitalists. In addition, the patent knowledge stock and tied stars
scientists have three significantly positive coefficients and the university co-authorship has two.


                                                                       19
All other coefficients are not significantly different from zero. However, we had to drop either
venture capital investments or SBIR grants to get the estimator to converge, presumably due to
multicollinearity not apparent in the low bilateral correlations. Venture capital had the better fit
and was selected as the included variable. We are left with a puzzle: Venture capitalists or their
money seem to do a good job at enabling firms to go public, but the criteria that they appear to
use to allocate those funds are only loosely connected to those that predict when and if a firm
will go public.

***Significant at the 0.1-percent level.
         Estimates are for probit regressions with robust standard errors. The regressands are an indicator
variable =1 in the year the firm makes its initial public offering and 0 otherwise. The data consists of all
US establishments of firms not listed on any US exchange in the prior year.
         a. Knowledge stocks are calculated by adding the two-year-window-citations-weighted count of
articles or patents to 0.8 times the previous year’s knowledge stock value (reduced by a conventional
20%/year depreciation rate).
         b. Patents refer to all patents that were granted by the end of 2005 which were applied for in the
current year.
         c. The amounts of venture capital investment and SBIR grants received are measured as 3-year
moving averages dated by the last of the 3 years. After lagging this is the average amount over the 3
years prior to the current year.
         d. All regressions also include the control variables (coefficients not reported here but available
from first author): entry dummy (1 in year firm enters, otherwise 0), establishment age, year dummies for
2003, 2004, 2005 (controls for patents applied for but not granted by the end of 2005).

7      Conclusions and Implications
        In the analyses reported in Tables 3-6, we examined across six S&T areas the effects of
lagged values of seven explanatory variables on four different measures of high-tech firm
success: publishing scientific articles, obtaining patents, attracting venture capital investments,
and going public. Referring back to the visual summary in Figure 1, three of the four firm
success variables are used in lagged or lagged-accumulated form in explaining the other success
variables. Among the other four variables, whether or not the firm has yet applied for patents
with non-patent references, whether or not the firm has a history of ever publishing with
university co-authors, and the number of stars authoring as or with firm employees are
significantly positive and never significantly negative for all or some of the S&T fields. The use
of non-patent references is the most robust of these three variables, with a history of firm-
university co-authorship a close second. In contrast, receiving SBIR grants is only robustly
positive for attracting venture capital investments. The accumulated citation-weighted patents
knowledge stock increases publishing, venture capital investments, and the probability of going
public, but the accumulated citation-weighted articles knowledge stock does so for venture
capital and going public only as it is reflected in a higher citation-weighted patents knowledge
stock.
        We interpret the non-patent reference and university co-authorship variables as indicators
of whether the firm has adopted the new model with more autonomy to firm scientists and more
openness to transfers of tacit knowledge from and to university scientists via working together.
Although we have defined them as “if ever before” variables, there is inevitably an element of
indication of actual tacit knowledge transfer if their value is 1 so some ambiguity in our
interpretation cannot be avoided. On the other hand, star articles are not only an indicator of
scientific strength, as we have argued, but also indicate a new model for firms. We only hope
that the results presented here are persuasive evidence that it is worth searching for better
variables that can more definitively distinguish between scientific strength and adoption of the
model that promotes that strength.

7.1    Implications
               We all see signs of increasing closeness between basic science and industrial
innovation, but then use the mechanisms that increase this closeness as mere signals or indicators
rather than what they are: institutionally-situated devices for evolutionary reconstruction of these
very different forms of intellectual property to provide the kind of cross-support that alters, and
possibly strengthens, both kinds. We find especially strong support for quality enhancement of
the highly codified patents from incorporating basic science – which contains more tacit
knowledge - via non-patent references to scientific articles and scientific materials (e.g., the
report of GenBlast search results). But tacit knowledge travels in people, and not well otherwise,
and thus co-authoring by firm scientists with any university scientist who works with relevant
tacit knowledge – and sometimes with stars also - is the main mechanism for importing tacit


                                                21
knowledge that is close to academic discovery, and also independently boosts firm success
across most science and technology areas (Darby and Zucker 1999).
        We find, as have others earlier, that patenting increases publishing (Azoulay, Ding and
Stewart 2009), even for those academic scientists directly involved in commercialization with
firms (Zucker and Darby 2007). Confirming Mansfield’s (1995) survey results on the importance
top scientists place on their work with firms as a source of ideas for their government-funded
basic research, Evans (2010) finds that increased contact between universities and firms
stimulate the production of new ideas, ideas which are different enough – and diverge from
accepted theory enough – that they would otherwise have trouble gaining traction in the
academic and related grant world. That is why firm-university collaborative articles are more
likely to be highly cited (Powell, White, Koput, Owen-Smith 2005).
        When we received our first NSF grant in the late 1980s to explore biotechnology start-
ups, we thought, along with most of academe, that these firms would be a black hole for novel
science – ideas would be fed into the firm but never come out publicly again. Our hypothesis was
completely refuted by the data, firm-university collaborations were mutually strengthening and
our hypothesized implosion was instead an explosion of scientific advance that is still going
strong: a virtuous circle instead of a vicious one (Zucker and Darby 2007). Here we also found
intriguing traces of new micro-institutional mechanisms for combining tacit and formally deed
knowledge in transformative ways: the tacit in research articles, the deeded in patents.

Notes: a. Knowledge stocks are calculated by adding the two-year-window-citations-weighted count of articles or patents to 0.8 times the
previous year’s knowledge stock value (reduced by a conventional 20%/year depreciation rate).
        b. Patents refer to all patents that were granted by the end of 2005 which were applied for in the current year.
        c. The amounts of venture capital investment and SBIR grants received are measured as 3-year moving averages dated by the last of the
3 years. After lagging this is the average amount over the 3 years prior to the current year.

Notes: a. Knowledge stocks are calculated by adding the two-year-window-citations-weighted count of articles or patents to 0.8 times the
previous year’s knowledge stock value (reduced by a conventional 20%/year depreciation rate).
        b. Patents refer to all patents that were granted by the end of 2005 which were applied for in the current year.
        c. The amounts of venture capital investment and SBIR grants received are measured as 3-year moving averages dated by the last of the
3 years. After lagging this is the average amount over the 3 years prior to the current year.
