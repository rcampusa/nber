                                           ABSTRACT

We develop and estimate a model of student study time on a social network. The model is
designed to exploit unique data collected in the Berea Panel Study. Study time data allow us to
quantify an intuitive mechanism for academic social interactions: own study time may depend on
friend study time in a heterogeneous manner. Social network data allow us to embed study time
and resulting academic achievement in an estimable equilibrium framework. We develop a
specification test that exploits the equilibrium nature of social interactions and use it to show that
novel study propensity measures mitigate econometric endogeneity concerns.

1       Introduction
Peer effects are widely believed to be important for determining academic achievement. Much
of the existing research in this context has focused on establishing a causal link between
peer characteristics and academic outcomes, in an effort to provide evidence about whether
peers matter. However, though crucial for policymaking, direct evidence on the mechanisms
generating peer effects is limited. In this paper we exploit unique data on college students
from the Berea Panel Study (BPS) to study peer effects in an academic setting. We focus
on what is likely the most relevant set of peers in our higher education context, a student’s
friends.
    The goal of this paper is to better understand how peer effects are generated. One step
is to provide direct evidence about a mechanism underlying peer influences in our context.
This is in the spirit of Manski (2000), who stresses that, in order to understand relation-
ships between own and peer outcomes, it is important to clearly define mechanisms and to
obtain direct evidence about their relevance. Motivated by recent research hypothesizing
that student effort is likely to be an input that is readily influenced by peers in the short
run (Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner (2006), Calvó-Armengol et al. (2009), Cooley Frue-
hwirth (2013), and De Giorgi and Pellizzari (2014)), we focus on study time as an explicit
mechanism through which peer effects could arise in college.1
    Another step is to better understand the role social networks play in the propagation
of peer effects. Not only may student i’s study time be influenced by i’s peers, but i’s
peers’ study time may be influenced by i. Moreover, these types of feedback effects could
work indirectly through students in the social network who are not directly connected to
student i. We focus on how the distribution of feedback effects depends on three interrelated
components. First, the graph describing links in a social network, which we refer to as
the “network structure”, may be important in and of itself (Calvó-Armengol et al. (2009),
Jackson and Yariv (2011)). Second, students with different characteristics may differ in
how much they are affected by their peers (Sacerdote (2011)). Third, students may form
links based on these characteristics. In particular, students may link to others with similar
characteristics, i.e., the network may exhibit “homophily.” Together, the network structure
and the specific manner in which heterogeneous students are arranged on the network may
determine how changes in behavior propagate throughout the network and affect equilibrium
outcomes.
    To take these important next steps, we estimate an equilibrium model of study time
    1
    For a non-education (financial) example of research that is interested in understanding why peer effects
exist, see Bursztyn et al. (2014). Richards-Shubik (2015) separates supply and demand mechanisms in a
model of sexual initiation.

choice and resulting grade determination, given a social network. Estimating such a model
entails substantial data challenges. First, we need student-level data on study time. Unfor-
tunately, because collecting reliable time-use information is very difficult in annual surveys,
available data sources typically do not contain this type of information. Second, equilibrium
outcomes depend on the entire social network, necessitating data characterizing the full set of
peer connections as well as data on characteristics that likely determine study time choices.
Among existing sources of social network data, perhaps only one, the National Longitudinal
Survey of Adolescent Health (Add-Health), could potentially provide a full view of a social
network in an educational setting where academic outcomes and student characteristics are
also observed. Unfortunately, because the Add-Health dataset has a primary focus on ado-
lescent health and risk-related behaviors, it does not contain information about time spent
studying. Thus, to the best of our knowledge, there is no other data source that is able
to both fully characterize a social network of students and provide direct evidence about a
central input in the grade production function that has been hypothesized to generate social
interactions.
    Our project is made possible by unique data from the Berea Panel Study (BPS), which
were collected specifically to overcome these current data limitations. The BPS surveyed
full cohorts of students at Berea College, which allows us to characterize the entire social
network. The BPS is also unique in its high frequency of contact with students each year,
allowing the collection of eight time-use diaries, which allow us to characterize study time,
and the measurement of friendships in each semester, which we use to define peers. We
combine these survey data with administrative data that include pre-college characteristics
and college grades.
    We develop our model to exploit these unique data. The social network is known at the
beginning of a period. Subsequently, all students in the social network simultaneously choose
their study time to maximize their own achievement, net of studying costs. A student’s
studying cost depends on her own study time and friend study time, e.g., it may be more fun
to study if your friends are studying (alternatively, students may conform to their friends).
Cost functions are allowed to be heterogeneous across students. Achievement depends on
a student’s own study time and may also be heterogeneous across students, conditional on
own study time.
    The social interactions literature has paid close attention to the endogeneity problem
that is present if there exist correlated unobserved variables, that is, unobserved information
related to both peer group membership (in our context, friendship choices) and outcomes
of interest (Manski (1993), Moffitt (2001), Epple and Romano (2011)). In our case, where
we focus on a social interaction in study time choices, a relationship between friends’ study


                                              3
times could arise because friends influence each other (peer effects) or because students
with similar unobserved determinants of study time become friends (correlated unobserved
variables). Institutional details, together with empirical checks we conduct, suggest that
correlated shocks arising through, e.g., coursework and dormitories, are not the most salient
type of correlated unobserved variables. The most relevant type of correlated unobserved
variable would seem to be an unobserved individual characteristic, which could be thought
of as a student’s propensity to study.
    We adopt a two-step approach for dealing with this endogeneity problem. First, we
take advantage of a unique opportunity to directly measure students’ propensities to study.
Specifically, the day before freshman classes began, we collected information about how much
a student actually studied in high school and how much the student expected to study in
college. We find that both high school study time and expected college study time have
strong correlations with study time in college and are also strongly related to friendship
patterns in our data.
    One cannot know a priori whether our study propensity data address the above endo-
geneity concern in a satisfactory manner, meaning we need some way to assess how well
our data have measured typical correlated unobserved variables. Given the importance of
this assessment, our second step is to develop a specification test based on our model. Our
specification test is designed to detect unobserved determinants of study time, exploiting the
fact that the equilibrium nature of social interactions implies that such unobserved deter-
minants would generate cross-sectional dependence in residuals. Crucially, our test is useful
even when unobserved determinants lead to inconsistently estimated parameters.
    We estimate the model using data from two semesters. Under the baseline specification,
in which we use our study propensity data to estimate the model, we find no evidence of the
cross-sectional residual correlation described above. However, we do find significant cross-
sectional residual correlations when we re-estimate the model excluding our study propensity
data, i.e., using only measures of student characteristics that are typically available to re-
searchers. This suggests that our specification test has the power to detect unobserved deter-
minants of study time. Therefore, these findings provide evidence that our study propensity
measures play an important role in addressing endogeneity concerns.
    Our estimates provide strong evidence that friend study time has a substantial effect on
one’s own study time. We also find that one’s own study time is an important determinant of
one’s own achievement. We estimate students to have different best response functions, i.e.,
they react differently to changes in friend study time. Hereafter, we will often refer to this as
heterogeneity in reactiveness. This heterogeneity potentially has equilibrium implications,
as it implies complementarities in students’ choice of study time. We estimate that two


                                               4
students with 75th percentile reactiveness, when paired with each other, would study almost
twice as much as would two students with 25th percentile reactiveness, when paired with
each other.
    The extent to which heterogeneity in reactiveness affects total production depends on
the relationship between own and friend reactiveness. Therefore, it is also important to take
into account the social network to understand social interactions.2 We use our estimated
model to perform two counterfactual exercises. First, we examine how the network struc-
ture, combined with homophilous sorting into friendships, affects the response to changes
in friend study time. We exogenously increase (shock) the study time of each student and
assess how study times and achievement change for other students in the social network.
There is substantial heterogeneity in study time responses depending on which student is
shocked, with larger impacts associated with more central students and students connected
to more reactive peers. The specific manner in which students with different characteristics
are arranged on the network is important for responses. This exercise also provides a natural
framework for quantifying the importance of equilibrium interactions. On average, equilib-
rium responses produce a network-wide aggregate response that is 2.7 times larger than
their partial equilibrium counterparts, which only consider a shock’s effect on immediate
neighbors.
    Our framework allows us to provide further evidence about the importance of homophily
in determining outcomes. As Golub and Jackson (2012) note, despite a large amount of work
documenting the existence of homophily and a smaller literature examining its origins, the
literature modeling the effect of homophily is in its infancy.3 In our second counterfactual,
we examine how achievement would differ if friend characteristics were identically distributed
across students, instead of being strongly correlated with one’s own characteristics, or ho-
mophilous, as in the data. On average, women, blacks, and students with above-median high
school GPAs have high propensities to study and tend, in the data, to sort into friendships
with students similar to themselves. Therefore, these groups tend to see declines in their
friends’ propensities to study in the counterfactual. However, these groups’ losses are not
offset by the gains of their complements. Intuitively, the estimated heterogeneity in best
response functions means that total study time (and hence, achievement) is highest when
students with high propensities to study are friends with others with high propensities to

parameters and the equilibrium effects of social interactions.

     Jackson (2008) provides a discussion of work documenting the existence of homophily; see Camargo
et al. (2010) for a specific example. For theoretical models of homophily’s origins see Currarini et al. (2009),
Currarini et al. (2010), and Bramoullé et al. (2012). Badev (2013) allows for homophily in his empirical
study of friendship formation and smoking behavior.

study, as is on average the case in the data. In contrast, there is a lack of such assortative
matching in the counterfactual networks, meaning the economy does not take advantage of
the game’s supermodular structure.
    The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses related literature.
Section 3 contains a description of the BPS data. Section 4 presents our model. Section 5
presents our empirical specification. Section 6 develops our specification test and Section 7
discusses estimation results. Section 8 presents the results from our counterfactual exercises
and Section 9 concludes.


2    Related Literature
Academic Peer Effects and Social Interactions Models There is an extensive litera-
ture on academic peer effects, which has been recently surveyed by Epple and Romano (2011)
and Sacerdote (2011). As discussed in Sacerdote (2011), papers in this literature typically
do not directly examine mechanisms through which peer effects are generated. Cooley Frue-
hwirth (2013), Calvó-Armengol et al. (2009), De Giorgi and Pellizzari (2014), and Tincani
(2016) all stress the importance of equilibrium models of students’ effort choices, but lack
direct data on student effort. Cooley Fruehwirth (2013) and Calvó-Armengol et al. (2009)
estimate parameters of their respective models, identifying effort through residual variation
in peer outcomes. De Giorgi and Pellizzari (2014) and Tincani (2016) test the implications
of different theoretical models of social interactions using student achievement data.
    In terms of goals, perhaps the paper closest to ours is Calvó-Armengol et al. (2009). As
in that paper, we develop a model that takes the social network as given to understand how
effort choices, made on the social network, affect academic achievement. Calvó-Armengol
et al. (2009), lacking direct input data, consider an environment in which a socially deter-
mined input choice is linked to network topology. This provides a behavioral foundation to
the Katz-Bonacich centrality measure. Our contribution is the direct measurement of an
input that likely affects achievement (study effort) and variables that likely are related to
sorting into friendships and the choice of this input (study propensity measures, like high
school study time and expected study time). These data are crucial for thoroughly investi-
gating the mechanism considered in this paper. They allow us to examine how the input of
interest (study effort) influences the output of interest (achievement). They also allow us to
quantify how the input of interest is influenced by peers. Our theoretical model differs from
that in Calvó-Armengol et al. (2009) in potentially important ways that are testable. We
allow for heterogeneous best response functions, which our data on input choices allow us to
identify. We also allow for nonlinearity in best response functions, which would break the

                                               6
connection between network topology and equilibrium outcomes required in Calvó-Armengol
et al. (2009).
    Our approach complements that of Calvó-Armengol et al. (2009) by allowing for a richer
understanding of social interactions. In our framework, someone concerned about a student’s
low effort level may have an incentive to get the student to have more studious friends. Be-
cause we allow inputs to depend on student characteristics, there may be winners and losers
from changes in peer group composition. Moreover, potentially heterogeneous reactiveness
would allow total achievement to change, depending on the type of sorting in the baseline.
Such questions could not be assessed using the framework of Calvó-Armengol et al. (2009),
where counterfactuals are limited to changes in link structure.
    There is a growing literature studying peer effects that has focused on modeling the
formation of social networks, an important and notoriously difficult problem (see Christakis
et al. (2010), Mele (2013), Badev (2013), de Paula et al. (2016), Sheng (2014), and Hsieh
and Lee (2016)). We cannot study how the network would change in response to a policy
because we do not model how friendships are formed. Therefore, in our counterfactuals,
we examine fully-specified networks of interest, such as those in the data and randomly
generated networks, in which student and friend characteristics are independent.

Specification Test The specification test we develop is informative about the presence of
unobserved determinants of study time of the sort discussed in the introduction, even when
parameter estimates are biased. Our specification test exploits the fact that, in equilibrium,
all unobserved determinants of study time will typically enter all students’ outcome equa-
tions. This type of error structure has precedent in a social interactions context (see, e.g.,
Calvó-Armengol et al. (2009) and Blume et al. (2015)).4 Our contribution is that we develop
a specification test designed to detect unobserved variables of interest and show how it can
have the power to do so, even in the presence of inconsistently estimated parameters.
    Goldsmith-Pinkham and Imbens (2013) posit a model of network formation and, within
this model, derive a testable implication of endogenous network formation (see Boucher
and Fortin (2016) for further discussion). In contrast, we do not test for a specific model
of network formation. Rather, the goal of our specification test is to detect unobserved
determinants of study time that we believe to be relevant to our context, taking as given
the network. Therefore, we view our work as complementary to that of Goldsmith-Pinkham
and Imbens (2013).

3       Data
The BPS is a longitudinal survey that was designed by Todd Stinebrickner and Ralph Stine-
brickner to provide detailed information about educational outcomes in college and labor
market outcomes in the early post-college period. The BPS survey design involved col-
lecting information about all students who entered Berea College in the fall of 2000 and
the fall of 2001. Baseline surveys were conducted immediately before the start of first year
classes and students were subsequently surveyed 10-12 times each year during school. As has
been discussed in previous work that uses the BPS, caution is appropriate when considering
exactly how results from the BPS would generalize to other specific institutions (e.g., Stine-
brickner and Stinebrickner (2006, 2013)). At the same time, from an academic standpoint,
Berea has much in common with many four-year colleges. It operates under a standard
liberal arts curriculum and the students at Berea, which is in central Kentucky, are similar
in academic quality to, for example, students at the University of Kentucky (Stinebrickner
and Stinebrickner (2008b)).
    Our study is made possible by three types of information that are available in the BPS.
First, the BPS elicited each student’s closest friends. Our analysis utilizes friendship obser-
vations from the end of the first semester and the end of the second semester. The survey
question for the end of the first semester is shown in Appendix A.1. The survey question
for the end of the second semester is identical (except for the date). Our friendship survey
questions have a full-semester flavor to them, as they asked students to list the four people
who had been their best friends that semester. Second, the BPS collected detailed time-use
information eight times each year; for our sample, this was done using the twenty-four hour
time diary shown in Appendix A.1. Finally, questions on the baseline survey reveal the
number of hours that a student studied per week in high school and how much the student
expects to study per week in college. We refer to these variables as our study propensity
measures. The survey data are merged with detailed administrative data on race, sex, high
school grade point average (GPA), college entrance exam scores, and college GPA in each
semester.
    This paper focuses on the freshman year for students in the 2001 entering cohort.5 We
focus on understanding grade outcomes during the freshmen year for two primary reasons.
First, under the general liberal arts curriculum, students tend to have similar course loads
    5
       We focus on this cohort because the survey contains more comprehensive time-use and friendship
information for them. Information about time use was collected using time diaries for the 2001 cohort,
while, for the 2000 cohort, this information was collected using questions that asked respondents to “think
carefully about how much time was spent studying” in the last twenty-four hours. First semester friendship
information was collected at the end of the first semester for the 2001 cohort, while, for the 2000 cohort,
first semester friendship information was collected retrospectively during the second semester.


                                                    8
in their first year. Second, we are able to characterize the network most completely in the
first year both because survey response rates are very high in the first year and because over
80% of friends reported by students in their freshman year are themselves freshmen.6 These
advantages tend to fade in subsequent years as friendships change (in part, due to dropout
after the first year) and students’ programs of study specialize.


3.1     Sample Construction
Our focus is on students who stayed in school for the full first year. There were a total of
331 students who fit this description. Our estimation sample consists of the 307 students
(i.e., 93% of the 331) with friends in each semester. A student j is deemed to be a friend
of student i if either i lists j as a friend or j lists i as a friend. This means that a student
can have friends in a particular semester even if the student did not complete the friendship
question in that semester. However, pooling the two semesters, we find that about 85% of
the students in our final sample reported friendship information directly, via the friendship
survey.


3.2     Descriptive Statistics
Tables 1-3 contain descriptive statistics for the sample. Table 1 shows descriptive statistics
of student characteristics. The first row in each of the six panels shows overall descriptive
statistics for the variable of interest described in the first column. Forty-four percent of
students are male, 18% of students are black, the mean high school grade point average
for the sample is 3.39, the mean combined score on the American College Test (ACT) is
23.26, and, on average, students studied 11.24 hours per week in high school and expect to
study 24.96 hours per week in college. The subsequent rows in each panel show descriptive
statistics for the variable of interest in the first column for different groups. For example,
the third panel shows that, on average, males have lower high school grade point averages
than females (3.24 vs. 3.51) and blacks have lower high school grade point averages than
nonblacks (3.14 vs. 3.45). The fifth panel shows that blacks studied more, on average, in
high school than other students (15.29 vs. 10.36).7
    Table 2 shows descriptive statistics of outcomes during the first year. The first rows of
panels 1 and 2, respectively, show that, on average, students study 3.49 hours per day in the
   6
     Approximately 88% of all entering students in the 2001 cohort completed our baseline survey, and
response rates remained high for the eleven subsequent surveys that were administered during the freshman
year.
   7
     The first two differences in means are significantly different at the 0.001 level. The averages of high
school study time for blacks and nonblacks are significantly different at the 0.01 level.


                                                     9
first semester and 3.5 hours per day in the second semester.8 The subsequent rows of the first
two panels show that, on average, males study less than females, blacks study more than
nonblacks, and students with above-median high school GPAs study more than students
with below-median high school GPAs.9 The first rows of panels 3 and 4, respectively, show
that the average first semester GPA is 2.89 and the average second semester GPA is 2.93.
The subsequent rows of the third and fourth panels show that males, blacks, and students
with below-median high school GPAs all have lower average GPAs than their counterparts.10
    As described at the beginning of this section, we define friendship as the union of reported
links between two students that semester.11 Table 3 summarizes friend data for those who
have at least one friend in each semester, stratified by the same characteristics as in Table 1.
The top panel shows that students have 3.3 friends on average. The mean masks considerable
variation: the minimum number of friends is one, while the maximum number of friends is
10. The second and third panels show that male and black students (and, therefore, female
and nonblack students) sort strongly towards students with the same characteristics. For
example, 74% of the friends of male students are male, while only 18% of the friends of
female students are male. Similarly, 69% of the friends of black students are black, while
only 7% of the friends of nonblack students are black. The fourth and fifth panels show
that male and black students have friends with lower incoming GPAs and lower combined
ACT scores. The sixth and seventh panels show that males have friends who studied less
in high school and expect to study less in college (compared to females), while blacks have
friends who studied more in high school and expect to study more in college (compared to
nonblacks).
    The last panel of Table 3 describes friend study time. Consistent with own study time
in Table 2, the first row shows that, on average, friend study time is 3.5 hours per day. The
second and third rows of the last panel show that average friend study time is much lower

      Descriptive statistics about study time outcomes presented in Table 2 are computed at the level of
individual study time reports, of which there may be up to four in each semester, for each student. When
computing other descriptive statistics (including regressions), we use the semester-specific average (over the
study time reports) for each student The two measures are very similar, other than the larger variance of
the individual-report-based measure. As we make clear when we describe our estimation procedure, we use
individual study time reports when estimating the structural parameters of our model.

      Pooling observations from both semesters, the first and last differences in means are significantly different
at a 0.05 level and, given the relatively small number of black students, the middle difference in means is
significant at a 0.10 level.

      Pooling observations from both semesters, all of these differences are significant at a 0.05 level.

      Therefore, the number of friends may exceed that elicited in the survey in Appendix A.1.

umn) and GPA (right column), pooling observations over both semesters. The study time
regression shows evidence of significant partial correlations of one’s own study time (com-
puted as the average amount the student reports studying in the time diaries within a
semester) with own sex and own high school GPA. As for our study propensity measures,
we estimate a positive, significant partial correlation between own study time and own high
school study time. We do not estimate a significant correlation between own study time and
expected study time when both propensity measures are included. However, when expected
study time is the only study propensity measure included, we find that it has a positive, sig-
nificant partial correlation with own study time (t-statistic of 2.2). The overall contribution
of these two variables is substantial, with their omission reducing R-squared from 0.169 to
0.087 (see Table 13 in the appendix). Our novel measures of the propensity to study clearly
have content. One’s own study time also has a significant positive partial correlation with

4       Model
Students are indexed by i = 1, . . . , N and time periods (semesters) by t = 1, 2. We denote
the study time of student i in time period t as sit and let St define a column vector collecting
all students’ study times during that period. We treat the adjacency matrix representing the
network of friendships as pre-determined. This matrix in period t, denoted At , has a main
diagonal of zeros and an (i, j) entry of one if student i has j as a friend and zero otherwise.12
The average study time of i’s friends during period t is
                                           PN
                                               j=1 At (i, j)sjt
                                    s−it = PN                   .                            (1)
                                                j=1 At (i, j)

Taking into account their friends, students make decisions about how much to study in
a particular semester by considering the costs and benefits of studying. The benefits of
studying come from the accumulation of human capital. The production function for human
capital, which we will also refer to as achievement, y(·), is:

                                       y(sit , µyi ) =β1 + β2 sit + µyi ,                                     (2)

where µyi is a “human capital type” which allows the amount a person learns in school to
vary across people, conditional on her own study level. As will be discussed in Section 5, in
practice, this type will be constructed using observable characteristics that have consistently
  12
     Other than its being full rank, we impose no restrictions on At . Though in our baseline empirical
specification we use the union of reported links (i.e., At (i, j) = 1 if either i reports being friends with j, or
vice versa), the model could also accommodate non-reciprocal links (i.e., i may link to j without j linking
to i).

evolution of human capital, i.e., the human capital type is assumed to be a sufficient statistic
for the history of prior inputs.
    The cost of studying, c(·), is determined by:

where friend study time enters the cost function by reducing the cost of one’s own studying,
with curvature given by the exponent τs . As we show below, this cost function produces a best
response function with desirable properties. Studying may be less arduous when one’s friends
are studying. We discuss below how this specification of the cost function is observationally
equivalent with one in which social interactions are instead driven by conformity forces. The
term µsi is i’s “study type,” which allows the disutility from studying to vary across students,
conditional on own and friend study levels. As will be discussed in Section 5, in practice,
this type will be constructed from observable characteristics that help explains one’s study
time choices. Study types enter the model through γ(·). We define

which allows the cost function to have intercepts and slopes that vary across people of
different study types. We refer to γ(µsi ) as the “effective study type”. We do not include a
fixed cost of studying because very few students report zero study time over the semester.

Remark 1. Before solving the model, it may be useful to include a brief discussion of what
may seem to be the somewhat spare specification laid out thus far. When developing our
model, we leaned on our intuition about what would be most important for generating social
interactions in academic achievement in the first-year college context that we study, our pro-
posed mechanism being that friends’ study time choices affect one’s own choice of study time
and, thus, achievement. That being said, one strength of our unique data is that we are able
  13
    The alternative assumption, where students know only the current adjacency matrix when choosing their
study times and calculate expectations over the future adjacency matrix, would have identical predictions
in our model. See Section 4.1.

to test this specification against others that have received attention in the academic context,
e.g., those including direct effects of peer characteristics in the production of achievement
(contextual effects) and those including production complementarities. We discuss alterna-
tive specifications in Sections 4.2 and 7.1. As described in Section 7.1, our extensive testing
of other specifications supports the parsimonious one we develop here.


4.1     Model Solution
Each student’s decision problem is additively separable across time periods, meaning each
student can solve each period’s problem separately.14 Student i’s best response to friend
study time in t is given by:

                               sit = arg max {y(s, µyi ) − c(s, s−it , µsi )},                             (6)
                                       s∈[0,24]


with the natural constraints that study time is nonnegative and cannot exceed 24 hours per
day. The first order condition of (6) with respect to own study time yields ∂y
                                                                            ∂s
                                                                                 ∂c
                                                                               = ∂s , i.e., the
utility-maximizing study time equates the marginal return for increasing study time with
the marginal cost. Expanding the first order condition gives:

                                                        1            γ(µsi )      sit
                          β2 = θ1 + θ2 γ(µsi ) + θ3           + θ4           + θ5 τs .                     (7)
                                                      sτ−it
                                                         s             τs
                                                                      s−it       s−it

Solving for own study time yields the best response function, which expresses student i’s
study time as a function of friend study time, at an interior solution:

                                 θ3 θ4         (β2 − θ1 ) τs   θ2
                       sit = −     − γ(µsi ) +           s−it − γ(µsi )sτ−it
                                                                          s
                                                                             .                             (8)
                                 θ5 θ5             θ5          θ5
Equation (3) shows that the term associated with θ5 introduces curvature into the student’s
cost function. If θ5 were zero, the student’s objective in (6) would be linear in own study time
and there would not exist an interior best response to friend study time. Equation (8) also
shows that one of the preference parameters θ must be normalized. Therefore, we normalize
θ5 to one, which has the advantage of clearly showing that we allow for the possibility of
finding no evidence of endogenous social interactions, which would occur if we estimated
that both (β2 − θ1 ) = 0 and θ2 = 0. The resulting final form of the student best response
  14
     If utility were nonlinear in semester achievement or the argument of the cost function were study time
over the whole year, the problem would no longer be separable across time periods. We assume student
utility is linear in achievement because non-linearity of utility in achievement would be difficult to separate
from non-linearity in the cost function without relying on functional form restrictions.

function for an interior solution is:

                sit = −θ3 − θ4 γ(µsi ) + (β2 − θ1 )sτ−it
                                                      s
                                                         − θ2 γ(µsi )sτ−it
                                                                        s
                                                                           ≡ ψ(s−it , µsi ).             (9)

    Note that while best response functions depend on study type µsi , it is sometimes no-
tationally convenient to suppress the study type and write the best response function as
ψi (s−it ). Own study time is increasing linearly in the productivity of own study time β2
and may also be increasing in own effective study type, µsi , depending on θ2 and θ4 . We
restrict parameters so that own study time has a strictly positive intercept and is a weakly
increasing and weakly concave function of friend study time.15
    As shown in Section 4.1.1, concave best response functions ensure existence of a unique
equilibrium for the study time game. As shown in equations (8) and (9), the separable
form we adopt for the cost function has the benefit of producing a closed-form solution for
the student best response function. We show in Appendix B.1 that concavity of the best
response function would result from any cost function possessing the natural properties of
being strictly convex in sit and weakly concave in s−it .

4.1.1      Equilibrium

Definition 1 (Period Nash equilibrium). A pure strategy Nash equilibrium in study times
S ∗ = [s∗1 , s∗2 , · · · , s∗N ]0 satisfies s∗i = ψ(s∗−i , µsi ), for i ∈ N , given adjacency matrix A.

Claim 1. Let k be a number strictly greater than 24. There exists a unique pure strategy
Nash equilibrium if ψi : RN 7→ R are weakly concave and weakly increasing, ψi (0) > 0, and
ψi (k) < k for i ∈ N .

       We compute the equilibrium by iterating best responses.


4.2       Model Discussion
4.2.1      Friend Study Time

We define friend study time as the average study times of one’s friends. Our framework could
also accommodate specifications where friend study time was defined to be the total study
  15
      The strictly positive intercept restriction corresponds to mini∈N {−θ3 − θ4 γ(µsi )} > 0. The weakly
increasing restriction corresponds to mini∈N {(β2 − θ1 ) − θ2 γ(µsi )} ≥ 0. Weak concavity corresponds to
further requiring τs ≤ 1. These restrictions, combined with sit ≤ 24, are sufficient to have the well-behaved
equilibrium described in Section 4.1.1. In practice, however, we are able to estimate the model using weaker
restrictions, described in Section 5.


                                                     18
time of one’s friends. Indeed, we previously estimated a specification of our model in which
the denominator of (1) was α N
                               P
                                  j=1 At (i, j) + (1 − α), where α ∈ [0, 1], α = 1 corresponds
to the average of friends’ study times, and α = 0 corresponds to the total of friends’ study
times. We define friend study time to be the average of friends’ study times because we
found α to be 1.

4.2.2    Other Mechanisms Generating Endogenous Social Interactions

Conformity Our specification of the cost function allows friend study effort to reduce
one’s own cost of studying. Others have allowed social interactions to emerge from a cost
of deviating from peer actions, i.e., from a force producing conformity (see, e.g., Brock and
Durlauf (2001), Moffitt (2001), Blume et al. (2015)). We show in Appendix B.3.1 that such
a specification would be observationally equivalent to the one we adopt.

Production Complementarities Another proposed mechanism is that social interac-
tions arise through production complementarities, where increases in peer inputs increase
the marginal product of one’s own input (e.g., Calvó-Armengol et al. (2009)). From a con-
ceptual standpoint, the decision to specify our model without production complementarities
was informed by the notion that friends in the first year of college may spend relatively little
time talking about coursework, with some empirical support for this provided by Stinebrick-
ner and Stinebrickner (2006).16
    That being said, we show in Appendix B.3.2 that in the typical case, where one only
had data on either the input (e.g., study effort) or output (e.g., achievement), our cost-
reduction-based specification (or, equivalently, a conformity-based specification) would be
observationally equivalent to a specification exhibiting production complementarities. This
point is also made by Blume et al. (2015). Therefore, because we measure both inputs
and outcomes, we are in the unique position to examine the potential roles played by cost
reductions and production complementarities. As we discuss in Section 7.4, we do not find
evidence for such a mechanism in our context.

4.2.3    Dynamic Behavior

We assume the human capital type is constant between the periods. Though it is feasible
to extend our static framework to a dynamic framework allowing the human capital type
to evolve between periods, the benefits of doing this are mitigated by two facts: (1) each
  16
    Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner (2006) find that students spend very little time talking about coursework
with their roommates; it is not a big leap to imagine the same would be true of students and their friends.



                                                     19
model period corresponds to a semester, which is shorter than the period typically con-
sidered when estimating value-added production functions in an educational context (see
Hanushek (1979) and Todd and Wolpin (2003) for discussions of issues related to the esti-
mation of education production functions), and (2) we study students during their freshman
year, which, under the liberal-arts curriculum at Berea, is typically before they start taking
specialized course material (meaning second semester coursework does not build heavily on
first semester coursework). Consistent with these facts, as we discuss in Section 7.5, we find
that out-of-sample outcomes, simulated from parameters estimated on only first-semester
data, fit second-semester data quite well.


5        Estimation
The model provides a mapping from the adjacency matrix At and all the students’ types
                                                                                               ∗
{(µsi , µyi )}N
              i=1 to a unique equilibrium in study times for all students, St . The equilibrium
study times St∗ generate achievement in equilibrium yit∗ , via the production function y(si , µyi ).
The model is operationalized by parameterizing a student’s types as linear combinations of
observable characteristics collected in a vector xi . That is, µsi = x0i ωs and µyi = x0i ωy ,
where the parameter vectors ωs and ωy respectively determine study and human capital
types.17 The vector xi includes indicators for being black and being male, along with high
school GPA, combined ACT score, average hours per week of study time in high school,
and expected hours per week of study time in college. This allows us to express each
student’s equilibrium study time and achievement as a function of At and all students’
characteristics, which we collect in a matrix X. Given the full set of (model) parameters
Γ = (β1 , β2 , θ1 , θ2 , θ3 , θ4 , ωs , ωy , τµ,1 , τµ,2 , τs )0 , we write these outcomes for individual i as

                                      s∗it = ψ(s∗−it , µsi ) = δis (At , X; Γ)                           (10)
                                         and
                                      yit∗ = y(s∗it , µyi ) = δiy (At , X; Γ),                           (11)

where s∗−it is defined by applying equation (1) to St∗ and At .
    Our measure of achievement, denoted yeit , is the student’s semester grade point average
(GPA), which is measured on a four-point scale. In our data, 7% of student-semester obser-
vations have a GPA of four and 1% have a GPA of zero. Therefore, we take a Tobit approach
to modeling GPA. We define latent GPA as yit∗ + ηyit , where ηyit is a Gaussian measurement
error that is IID and independent from A and X. Our Tobit model, with censoring at zero

       We set coefficient on high school GPA in the study type ωs,HS GPA = 1 to identify γ(·).

    The likelihood function also takes into account study time outcomes. Our measures of

We use Rit to denote the set of reports for student i in semester t. Study time report r
for student i in semester t is denoted s̃rit , and is allowed to be a noisy measure of s∗it .18
Because approximately 5% of our study time observations are zero, we use a Tobit approach
for reported study time. Defining latent study time as s∗it + ηsrit , reported study time is

     Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner (2004) document how reported study time varies within semesters.
  19
     We allow for dependence within student when computing standard errors.
  20
      Note that the theoretical model assumes best response functions are strictly positive, nondecreasing, and
weakly concave. These restrictions are difficult to directly impose in terms of restrictions on the parameter
space when there is heterogeneity in best response functions. Therefore, we adopt an indirect approach, of
verifying whether best response functions derived from posited parameters satisfy the restrictions. Specif-
ically, when estimating the model, we use the weaker restrictions that the 75th percentile effective study
type’s best-response function is nonnegative and that equilibrium study times are strictly positive; we also
impose the natural upper bound on daily study time (24 hours a day). As we show in Section 7, none of
these restrictions are close to binding at our estimated parameters.


                                                               21
6     Specification Test
This section develops a specification test that has power against alternative data generating
processes that have unobserved determinants of study time. It presents the test statistic,
shows how to calculate the residuals used to compute it, and shows how to decompose these
residuals in a way that facilitates our analysis of when the test has power. We develop the
test assuming there is one study time report and one period, which allows us to drop the
corresponding subscripts, and that there is no censoring in observed study times. We show
how we implement our test using more than one study time report and more than one period
in Section 7.2.
    Let Γ
        b denote the vector of estimated parameters and let s̃i denote i’s reported study
time. The study time residual for student i is

                                       ηbsi = sei − δis (A, X; Γ),
                                                               b                                   (17)

and the average of i’s friends’ residuals is
                                               PN
                                                  j=1   A(i, j)b
                                                               ηsj
                                      ηbs,−i = PN                    .                             (18)
                                                    j=1 A(i, j)

    Consider the following regression of a student’s own residual on the average of her friends’
residuals:
                                     ηbsi = a + bb
                                                 ηs,−i + ξ.                                 (19)

Under the null hypothesis of proper specification, the error terms in our study time regression
are IID, so the true value of b is zero. Our test statistic is simply the t-statistic for a test of
b = 0 in regression (19), bb/SE(bb), which has a limiting standard normal distribution under
the null.
    Our claim is that this specification test will have power against alternatives where omitted
variables are present. Intuitively, if there are important unobserved variables influencing
students’ decisions, they will generally induce cross-sectional correlation across students
because they will enter students’ best responses in equilibrium. Therefore, an absence of
correlation in residuals across students is consistent with a lack of omitted variables. We
show this more formally now.
    Consider the following scenario with an (potentially) omitted variable. We examine the
special case with τs = 1. As we show in Section 7, this case is consistent with our baseline
empirical results, where we find that best response functions are linear.
    Using a composite parameter c ≡ [β2 − θ1 ], define the subset of parameters identified
by just equation (9), the student’s policy function, as Γ2 = (c, θ2 , θ3 , θ4 , ωs , τµ,1 , τµ,2 )0 . To

                                                   22
simplify notation, we refer to the terms in (9), [−θ3 − θ4 γ(µsi )] and [(c − θ2 γ(µsi )) s−i ],
as f1 (xi ; Γ2 ) and f2 (xi ; Γ2 ), respectively. As in Section 5, xi contains student i’s observed
characteristics, which enter the policy function through effective study type γ(µsi ). The
equation for an individual student is

                                     si =f1 (xi ; Γ2 ) + f2 (xi ; Γ2 )s−i .                             (20)

    In order to represent the system of equations for all students in a vector S, use F1 (X; Γ2 )
to denote a column vector stacking the f1 (xi ; Γ2 ) for all i. We use the notation W (X; Γ2 )
for a matrix that has zeros in the same positions as the zeros in A and nonzero entries in
locations where A has ones. In place of the ones in row i of A, W (X; Γ2 ) contains
                                               1
                                        PN               [f2 (xi ; Γ2 )].                               (21)
                                           j=1 A(i, j)

The system of equations is thus:

                                     S = F1 (X; Γ2 ) + W (X; Γ2 )S.                                     (22)

Note that (22) is simply a re-written version of the baseline model we developed in Section
4. Solving for S, we obtain the equilibrium vector of study times

                                 S ∗ = (I − W (X; Γ2 ))−1 [F1 (X; Γ2 )],                                (23)

where the right side corresponds to the vector stacking δis (A, X; Γ) for all students.21
    Incorporating our measurement error ηs , we obtain the data generating process for ob-
served study time Se under the null hypothesis of correct specification:

                               Se = (I − W (X; Γ2 ))−1 [F1 (X; Γ2 )] + ηs .                             (24)

   Now consider an alternative in which the model was misspecified. In particular, suppose
a vector of characteristics V was omitted by the econometrician but was observed by all
students, entering the best response system in the following manner:

                                  S = F1 (X; Γ2 ) + W (X; Γ2 )S + V.                                    (25)

Again solving for S, the equilibrium system of equations has the following form:

                              S ∗ = (I − W (X; Γ2 ))−1 [F1 (X; Γ2 ) + V ].                              (26)
  21
     Note that, as it expresses outcomes as a reduced form in terms of X and A, the specification test would
not be affected by the inclusion of “contextual effects” entering in the typical additively separable manner.


                                                      23
In general, the matrix (I −W (X; Γ2 ))−1 will have many non-zero entries because students will
typically be directly or indirectly connected to many other students. Therefore, many, if not
all, elements of V will influence a given student’s equilibrium study time in this alternative.
     Decompose V into two components according to:

                                           V = Π(X) + u,                                    (27)

where we assume that u is mean independent of X (and, hence, F1 (X; Γ2 )) and W (X; Γ2 ).
We are agnostic about correlation patterns in u across students; in particular, friends may
have correlated u. Consider, for example, a scenario where male and female students have
the same expected value of u, but where a (mean-zero) sex-specific shock induces correlations
among students of the same sex, who are likely to be friends with each other. Substituting
this expression for V into (26) and incorporating our measurement error ηs gives the data
generating process for observed study time under the alternative hypothesis:

            Se =(I − W (X; Γ2 ))−1 [F1 (X; Γ2 ) + Π(X) + u] + ηs
              =(I − W (X; Γ2 ))−1 [F1 (X; Γ2 ) + Π(X)] + (I − W (X; Γ2 ))−1 u + ηs .        (28)

It is convenient to re-write (28) with a composite error :

                        Se =(I − W (X; Γ2 ))−1 [F1 (X; Γ2 )] + ,                           (29)
               where  =(I − W (X; Γ2 ))−1 Π(X) + (I − W (X; Γ2 ))−1 u + ηs .

    By definition, residuals must be computed using estimates of Γ2 , rather than the true
value. To derive the residuals e    , consider the least squares estimator of Γ2 in the study
time regression, Γ2 , i.e., the estimate of Γ2 that minimizes 0  in (29). The fitted values
                    b
for Se using Γ b2 are (I − W (X; Γ  b2 ))−1 [F1 (X; Γ
                                                    b2 )]. Let Γ

b2 . In large samples, the fitted values of Se based on our estimator would then be (I −

The first term (“prediction bias”) in e    is due to the omission of Π(·), i.e., it represents a
mean misspecification in (30). As we show below, there will not necessarily be a prediction
bias. The second term is due to the influence of u upon equilibrium study effort. This second
term is what our specification test is designed to detect. Γ   b2 will, in general, be inconsistent
for Γ2 if Π(·) 6= 0.
    In general, our test will have power, i.e., the ability to detect the type of alternative (25),
because the error e   will exhibit cross-sectional correlation when V 6= 0. We show this by
considering cases (i) without prediction bias and (ii) with prediction bias.
    There would be no prediction bias (i.e., we would be in case (i)) if there exists a Γ̈2 such
that F1 (X; Γ̈2 ) nests F1 (X; Γ2 ) + Π(X).22 In principle, this nesting could be accomplished by
adopting a sufficiently flexible functional form for F1 (·; ·). Therefore, in this case, although
elements of Γ2 may be inconsistently estimated (i.e., plim Γ        b2 6= Γ2 ), residuals obtained
from (30) would only include components based on u and ηs . That is, bias in Γ        b2 would not
pervade to the residuals.23 Of course, in practice, it may be necessary to impose restrictions
on F1 (X; ·), meaning there may potentially be prediction bias in study time. We discuss this
in case (ii).

Case (i): No prediction bias: Consider first the case with no prediction bias, leaving
us to focus on the u component of e   in (31). In general, the term (I − W (X; Γ2 ))−1 u will
exhibit cross-sectional dependence because its elements are linear combinations of many of
the components of u.
   In order for there to be no cross-sectional covariance in (I − W (X; Γ2 ))−1 u, the shocks u
would need to have a covariance matrix that was orthogonalized by (I − W (X; Γ2 ))−1 . For
example, consider the case where u was generated according to

                                        u = (I − W (X; Γ2 ))e,                                       (32)

with e IID and E [ee0 ] = I. For reasonable ranges of W (X; Γ2 ) in our application, such
a u process would possess strong negative correlations among closely linked students. For
example, consider our point estimate for Γ2 , which we present in Section 7, and our baseline
adjacency matrix for the first semester, A1 . For the process in (32), in order for u to be
orthogonalized by (I − W (X; Γ2 ))−1 , the ratio of the average covariance of u between friends
to the average variance across students would have to be -0.31.
  22
     This is because the u are mean independent from X and W (X; Γ2 ), which means that the least-squares
estimate of Γ2 , which minimizes 0 , would minimize the prediction bias component of e
                                                                                       .
  23
     For example, this would be true in the commonly considered case where we can write F1 (X; ∆1 ) = X∆1
and Π(X) = X∆2 , where ∆1 and ∆2 are matrices of parameters, in which case the estimated ∆  b 1 would have
plim ∆1 = ∆1 + ∆2 .
       b


                                                   25
    The main focus of the literature is on the case of positive assortative matching.24 There-
fore, we believe such a negative correlation is not the most salient one. Further note that the
necessary orthogonalization could not occur when u are independent in the cross section.
Moreover, even in the presence of negative cross-sectional correlations in u, only specific
correlation structures could produce the necessary orthogonalization. In our example above,
negative covariances in u that were either larger or smaller than -0.31 would generate corre-
lated residuals (e
                 ). In summary, our test will have power to detect the omitted variables u
as long as they do not have very specific covariance structures.

Case (ii): Prediction bias: In the case where there is a prediction bias in study time
(which can only occur if there is an omitted variable bias, i.e., Π(·) is nonzero), our test
would not have power if the first term in equation (31), the prediction bias term, offset
cross-sectional correlations in (I −W (X; Γ2 ))−1 u, such that there would be no cross-sectional
covariance in . For example, negative covariances in the bias term could, in principle, exactly
cancel with the positive covariances that we anticipate in (I − W (X; Γ2 ))−1 u. Our strong
prior is that this scenario is implausible, due to the positive covariances across friends in
their values of xi and the bias term being a smooth function of xi . Intuitively, because
friends have similar observed characteristics (xi ), the prediction errors of students and their
friends—which would only exist due to the inability of F1 (X; ·) to fit study time for students
with certain observed characteristics—will likely be positively correlated. Most importantly,
prediction bias would have to exactly cancel out the u component to not have power against
the alternative hypothesis. Such a problematic scenario would be a knife-edge case.
     To make the test developed above more concrete, in Appendix E we develop an example
environment with dyadic, separate networks with homogeneous best responses. In addition
to simplifying notation, the specification developed in Appendix E corresponds to case (i),
i.e., there is no prediction bias.


7      Estimation Results
Table 6 contains parameter estimates. The top panel presents the parameters that enter the
achievement production function. The key parameter is the marginal product of own study
time on achievement, β2 . The point estimate of 0.254 implies that increasing own study
time by one hour per day increases achievement by about a quarter of a GPA point, ceteris
  24
    Epple and Romano (2011) contains a thorough discussion of sorting in the presence of peer effects. Zeitlin
(2011) studies peer effects in a social learning context, finding that own and friend information shocks are
negatively correlated. This finding is unsurprising in a learning environment, where one may gain more when
one’s friends have different information.

paribus. It is reassuring that this result is quantitatively similar to that from Stinebrickner
and Stinebrickner (2008a), who estimate that, for freshman at Berea, an extra hour per
day of studying would increase GPA by 0.36 points (with a standard error of 0.183 points),
using whether a randomly assigned roommate brought a video game as a shifter for one’s
own study time. Table 6 shows that students with high GPAs in high school and high ACT
scores have significantly higher human capital, and black students have significantly lower
human capital.

 and re-estimated.

     As can be seen in equation (9), the curvature in the best response function is given by
τs , the exponent on s−it . We estimated the model allowing τs to be in the set [0,1], nesting
the assumption of a linear best response function (i.e., that τs =1).25 However, because our
initial estimation provided evidence that τs is indistinguishable from 1, we re-estimated the
model fixing τs =1.
     Estimates of the parameters in the study cost function appear in the second panel of
Table 6. To ease their interpretation, we substitute them into the best response function,
yielding

The first bracketed term in equation (33) represents the intercept of the best response func-
tion for student i, i.e., how much this student would study even if her friends did not study
at all. This term consists of −θ3 =0.907, the common component of the intercept across
students, and −0.096b   γ (c
                           µsi ), the component characterizing variation in the intercept across
students. Likewise, the second bracketed term in equation (33) reveals the slope, or reac-
tiveness, of the best response function, that is, how a student’s choice of study time depends
on the study time of her friends. This term consists of (β2 − θ1 ) = 1.328, the common com-
ponent of the slope across students (we estimate the composite parameter (β2 − θ1 ) to have
a standard error of 0.1804), and −0.874b     γ (b
                                                µsi ), the component characterizing variation in
the slope across students. The negative point estimate for θ1 means that the common slope
component of student study times was higher than could be explained by only the marginal
product of study time in producing achievement (β2 ). With γ(µsi ) = exp(τµ,1 µsi1 +τµ,2 µ2 ) , the
                                                                                          si
latter component in both the first and second bracketed terms depends on the estimated
values of τµ,1 = 0.105 and τµ,2 = −0.003, which indicate that γ(·) is decreasing and convex
in one’s study type, µs . In turn, the value of one’s study type, µs , is determined by the
cost function parameters ωs . As seen at the end of Table 6, study type is increasing in high
school GPA and high school study time, but is smaller for males.26
    To provide a better sense of the total effect of peer study effort in the best response
functions, Figure 1 plots best response functions for several effective study types, γb(b
                                                                                        µs ): the

      See Blume et al. (2015) for an extensive discussion of linear social interactions models. We have verified
that (the row-normalized) At are not idempotent, facilitating estimation of linear best response functions.
   26
      Though black students study considerably more than nonblack students, the coefficient on being black
is negative. Black students have much higher high school study levels, which we find to be an important
determinant of study type.

in equation (33)) in the top row and the coefficient on friend study time (i.e., the second
bracketed term in equation (33)) in the bottom row. The first row shows that there is
little heterogeneity in the intercepts of best response functions. The second row shows that
reactiveness to peer study time is increasing in effective study type. The effect of peer study
time is significantly positive for all effective study types, including the lowest effective study
type (lower dotted green line, or first column of the table).27 Combining the slope and
intercept terms, one’s optimal study choice is increasing in study type. That is, the best
response is always increasing in s−it and is often substantial.28
     To get a sense of whether the estimated heterogeneity in reactiveness is significant, in
Table 7 we present 95% confidence intervals for differences in best response slopes for dif-
ferent groups of students. Females have significantly steeper best response functions than
males, students with above-median high school GPAs have significantly steeper best response
functions than those with below-median high school GPAs, and students with above-median
high school study time have significantly steeper best response functions than those with
below-median high school study time.

    In addition to describing individual heterogeneity in best response functions, Figure 1
provides evidence about the implications of this heterogeneity. To see this, note that the
intersection of each best response function with the identity function indicates the equilib-
rium study outcome in a hypothetical scenario in which a student and someone of the same
effective study type were paired. Therefore, by comparing where the different types’ best
response functions intersect the identity function (solid black line), we can identify equilibria
  27
      The flexible specification we have developed to allow for heterogeneity in best response functions makes
it difficult to discern whether the slopes of best response functions are significantly positive via direct
examination of parameters in Table 6. Therefore, we adopted a conservative approach to assess statistical
significance. We computed the 95% confidence interval for the best response slope for each student and then
examined whether any of these confidence intervals contained zero; the lower bound on the union of these
confidence intervals is 0.11.
   28
      As noted in Section 5, we did not need to impose that best response functions are increasing in estimation.

when each student is matched with someone of her respective study type. When two 75th
percentile effective study types are paired they would study almost 5 hours each, almost twice
the amount two 25th percentile types would study when paired. Our estimates indicate that
the game exhibits a complementarity. If matched by study type, students may study more
in total, and therefore, have higher total achievement. However, whether students will take
advantage of this complementarity depends on how they sort into friendships.

between own and friend study time is not explicitly targeted (i.e., friend study time outcomes
do not enter the likelihood), the model also closely captures this relationship. Figure 3 plots
own versus friend study time, for both the data (solid red line) and simulated outcomes
(dashed blue line).
   In the remainder of this section we discuss potential endogeneity problems, present the
results from our specification test, and present evidence about the robustness of our esti-
mates.


7.1     Endogeneity
Our primary endogeneity concerns arise from the potential for the relationship between a
student’s study effort and that of her peers to be due, in part, to friendships being formed on
the basis of potentially unobserved determinants of study time. One possible concern is that
the relationship between own and friend study time is driven by institutional factors. One
prominent example is that if students in science courses tend to study more and befriend
students in their courses, there may be a spurious relationship between own and friend study
time. We find that a version of the descriptive regression in Table 5, including both own
and friend fraction of courses which are science, does not appreciably change the partial
correlation between own and friend study time (0.166 vs. 0.160).30 This is not surprising
given that students may make friends outside their classes, the large majority of curriculum
choices for freshman are required general or introductory classes, and there is not much
variation in the number of classes taken.31 In the same vein, dormitories are not specialized
at Berea (e.g., there are not “study” dormitories or separate dormitories for student athletes).
    Perhaps a more important concern is that students arrive at school with differing propen-
sities to study, which affects how they sort into friendships. We address this concern by
taking advantage of our survey collection to obtain direct measures of students’ propensities
to study. Our baseline survey elicited information about: 1) how much a student expected
to study in college and 2) how much a student studied in high school. As we discussed
in Section 3.2, these measures of the propensity to study clearly have content, as they are
strongly correlated with how much a student studies. We stress a crucial feature of this
information on study propensity is that our survey design allowed this information to be
collected immediately after students arrived on campus, before students could be influenced
by their friendships at Berea.
    As is always the case, it is difficult to know a priori whether observable characteristics
  30

  31
    On average, students take about one additional course in their area of specialization per semester in
their freshman year.


                                                   32
can address potential endogeneity concerns. Therefore, we next present results from our
specification test, which was designed to detect a wide variety of unobserved determinants
of study time, in particular, those underlying endogeneity concerns.


7.2     Specification Test Results
To simplify exposition, in Section 6 we developed our specification test for one period and
one study time report. This section starts by showing how we implement the test using
our data for two periods (semesters) and multiple study time reports. Recall that predicted
                                                                   b 32 We define i’s semester-t
equilibrium study time for student i in semester t is δis (At , X; Γ).

                                                          b = seit − δ s (At , X; Γ),
                                                                       i
                                                                                  b         (34)

where seit is i’s average study time over reports r in semester t. To implement the test,
we average student’s residuals over both semesters, i.e., ηbsi = ηbsi1 +b 2
                                                                            ηsi2
                                                                                 . We then compute
the average
          PN
               of friends’ average residuals for each student in each semester according to

                             .
             j=1    t
     Our test statistic is the t-statistic for a test of zero slope in a regression of ηbsi on ηbs,−it ,
pooled across semesters. Under the baseline specification, in which our new measures of
study propensity (high school study time and expected study time) enter students’ study
types, our test statistic has a p-value of 0.716, corresponding to a correlation between own
and friend study time residuals of 0.017.33 Thus, our test results suggest that our model
is well-specified. There is no evidence of an endogeneity problem arising from students
positively sorting into friendships based on unobserved determinants of study time.
     In the presence of an omitted characteristic that generates an endogeneity problem, our
test should indicate a positive relationship in own and friends’ residuals. To demonstrate
that our test can detect a relationship in such a scenario, we construct an example where
there is likely an endogeneity problem, by estimating a restricted version of our model in
which we purposefully omit our novel measures of study propensity. Notably, this restricted
specification uses only measures of student characteristics that are typically available to
researchers. Because our empirical results show that these measures are both determinants
of study time and also related to our measures of incoming human capital and friendship
  32
     To be consistent with our specification test, we also re-estimate Γ
                                                                       b assuming there is no censoring in study
time and then use this estimate to compute the test statistic. Given the very small number of observations
that were censored, the estimated Γ  b (and corresponding test statistics) are virtually identical between the
censored and non-censored versions. Details are available upon request.
  33
     We use a distribution approximation for this test that allows correlation within students.

                                                      33
choices, their omission should generate a correlation across friends’ residuals. The estimated
correlation in this scenario is 0.208, and the test statistic for a slope coefficient of zero has a
p-value of 1.12e-6, providing strong evidence against the null hypothesis of a slope of zero.
    Taking these two residual correlations together, our test results suggest that our new
measures of study propensity play a crucial role in addressing endogeneity concerns in our
context.
    Note that failing to reject the null model does not imply that we perfectly predict ob-
served student study effort. Rather, failing to reject the null hypothesis means there are not
significant determinants of study time that would introduce detectable correlations between
own and friend residuals. For example, independently distributed reporting errors, e.g., of
the type we assume in Section 5, would create a divergence between model and reported
study time.


7.3    Human Capital Spillovers (“Contextual Effects”)
We have focused on a mechanism wherein friend study time may affect one’s own study
time, which in turn may affect one’s achievement via a production function. An alternative
mechanism often considered in the literature involves peer characteristics directly entering
the achievement production technology (“contextual effects”). For example, friends with
high human capital may provide quick and reliable answers to questions, or may know more
about specific course requirements, generating human capital spillovers.
    Our a priori belief that a model without such spillovers may be quite natural is directly
related to the mechanism for social interactions that we examine. In the short run that we
study, it seems reasonable to believe that the primary reason a student’s academic perfor-
mance would be related to a particular observable characteristic of her friends is that the
student’s time-use is influenced by the good (or bad) study habits of friends with these char-
acteristics. Models estimated without study time information would label this relationship
as “contextual effects”. In contrast, in our approach, which is made possible by the collection
of time-use information, this relationship would be explicitly accounted for by our proposed
mechanism in which one’s study time is influenced by the study time of one’s peers, thus
removing a channel that would otherwise be labeled as “contextual effects”.
    Nevertheless, because, in theory, there could be spillovers not captured by our pro-
posed mechanism, it is prudent to thoroughly examine whether friend characteristics explain
achievement, even after accounting for our mechanism of interest. As a starting point, we
augment the GPA prediction regression in Table 5, which regressed own GPA on own char-
acteristics and own study time, by adding friend characteristics. Consistent with the results


                                                34
shown in Table 5, own study time remains a significant predictor of own GPA. However,
friend characteristics are not significant predictors of students’ own GPAs; adding friend
characteristics increases the adjusted R2 of the regression from 0.246 to 0.247.34
    Given the literature’s interest in the direct transmission of peer characteristics and our
ability to separately identify them from endogenous social interactions, it is worthwhile to
look beyond the prediction equation described above, and estimate specifications allowing
for friend characteristics to directly affect one’s achievement, i.e., human capital spillovers in
the production function. To this end, we re-estimated the model using two alternative spec-
ifications. First, since a human capital spillover would naturally emerge from friend human
capital types, we extend the technology (2) to allow for direct achievement transmission via
human capital types:

                              y(sit , µyi ) =β1 + β2 sit + β3,cont µy,−i,t + µyi ,                     (35)
                  PN
                    j=1 At (i,j)µyj
where µy,−i,t ≡ P     N            , i.e., the average of period-t-friend human capital types. This
                      j=1 At (i,j)
specification’s parsimoniousness makes it attractive from a practical level, but it is also
conceptually attractive, as one would naturally expect friends with higher-than-predicted
achievement (i.e., those with higher own human capital types, µyj ) to be those who would also
transmit more achievement to their friends. In this specification, a human capital spillover
in the production of student achievement would correspond to β3,cont 6= 0. As discussed
in detail in Appendix C.1, we fail to reject that β3,cont is zero, with a point estimate of
βb3,cont = 0.111 that has an accompanying standard error of 0.138.
     Second, to examine the importance of the restriction implied by (35), that the determi-
nants of one’s own human capital type and one’s human capital spillovers on one’s friends are
the same (to scale), we also re-estimated the model allowing for a more flexible specification
based on a “contextual human capital type”. Specifically, we define student i’s contextual
human capital type according to µy,cont,i = x0i ωy,cont , where ωy,cont is a vector containing six
new parameters (one for each characteristic entering human capital and study types), and
extend the technology (2) to be

                               y(sit , µyi ) =β1 + β2 sit + µyi + µy,cont,−i,t ,                       (36)
                       PN
                              At (i,j)µy,cont,j
where µy,cont,−i,t ≡ j=1PN            , i.e., the average of period-t-friend contextual human
                         j=1 At (i,j)
capital types. In this more flexible specification, a human capital spillover in the production
of student achievement would correspond to one of the parameters in ωy,cont 6= 0. As dis-
  34
    For example, the partial correlation coefficients for friend high school GPA, friend combined ACT score,
and friend high school study have t-statistics of 0.75, .286, and -0.5, respectively.


                                                      35
cussed in Appendix C.1, we fail to reject that the vector ωy,cont is zero at any conventional
significance level (the likelihood ratio test statistic has a p-value of 0.368). The element of
ωy,cont with the most explanatory power is the parameter related to the share of male friends,
which has a point estimate of ω by,cont,M ale = 0.189, though its standard error of 0.123 renders
it statistically indistinguishable from zero.
    Because we have data on both inputs and outcomes, there is more than one place in
which contextual effects could enter our model. We chose the above extensions instead of,
say, including a direct effect of friend characteristics in the cost function (3), because the
results from our specification test do not provide strong evidence of omitted characteristics in
the determination of study time choices.35 These results lead us to conclude that mechanisms
involving a direct role of friends characteristics in explaining achievement are not motivated
in our application.36 Given our a priori belief that this would be the case, we have thus chosen
to retain the specification without human capital spillovers as our baseline specification.


7.4     Production Complementarities
As we show in Appendix B.3.2, our data on study time inputs and achievement outcomes
allow us to separately identify production complementarities from cost-based mechanisms
(which, as we show in Appendix B.3.1, are observationally equivalent to conformity-based
mechanisms). As we discussed in Section 4.2.2, prior research suggests that production
complementarities may not be very large, because students are not obliged to talk about
coursework with their friends. However, given our unique ability to separately identify them
from other proposed mechanisms, it is prudent to examine the potential role they play in
determining study time and achievement. Our starting point is to add an interaction of
own and friend study time to the GPA prediction regression in Table 5. We find that the
estimated interaction between own and friend study time is insignificant and very small,
with a partial correlation coefficient of 0.005 and standard error of 0.01.
    Going beyond the above prediction regression, we also re-estimated the model using a
specification that extends the technology (2) to be
                                                                           sit
                           y(sit , µyi , s−it ) = β1 + β2 sit + β3,comp        + µyi ,                   (37)
                                                                          s−it

      Moreover, from a conceptual standpoint, it is a priori not obvious why friend characteristics, such as
their high school GPA, would relate to one’s own study time choices, after taking into account how much
friends study.
   36
      This is consistent with other work in which authors have noted that it may not be reasonable to expect
large effects in the short run, given that students may not be taking the same classes and given that students
often to not spend a large amount of time studying together.

where sit is own study effort and s−it is friend study effort. If β3,comp. < 0, then increases in
peer effort increase the marginal product of one’s own effort.
     As we discuss in Appendix C.2, we fail to reject that β3,comp is zero, with a point estimate
of βb3,comp = 0.904 that has an accompanying standard error of 0.633. This estimation result
led us to retain the specification without production complementarities in the technology as
our baseline.


7.5    Dynamic Behavior and Model Validation
We discussed in Section 4.2.3 why it seemed reasonable to assume that the human capital
type µyi was constant across semesters. In principle, however, first-semester achievement
could increase students’ human capital coming into the second semester, in which case, a
model estimated using first-semester data may have difficulty fitting second-semester out-
comes. On the other hand, if the out-of-sample fit turned out to be good, this would suggest
a limit to the potential improvement in model fit from the addition of first-semester human
capital or other dynamic considerations. Indeed, such an exercise could also be useful in dis-
cerning, more generally, whether the assumed micro-structure of our model (e.g., functional
form assumptions, etc.) does a reasonably good job of capturing the key moving parts in
our context.
    Based on the above reasoning, we conducted an out-of-sample validation exercise by
re-estimating our model using only data from the first semester and seeing how well it fit
second-semester outcomes. As discussed in Appendix C.3, the second-semester fit is good.
Therefore, we conclude that the static model may be appropriate for the relatively short
time frame we consider in this paper.


8     Quantitative Findings
How much does it matter who your friends are? We use our estimated model to conduct
two counterfactual exercises. First, we characterize how students respond to changes in
friend study time by exogenously increasing (shocking) the study time of each student and
measuring how outcomes would change for other students in the network. In addition to
providing evidence about how network structure and student characteristics jointly determine
how students are affected by their peers, this exercise provides a natural framework for
quantifying the importance of equilibrium effects as well as the importance of heterogeneity
in the effect of peers. Second, because peer effects are a function of not only how students
respond to changes in peer inputs but also who is friends with whom, we examine how


                                               37
outcomes would differ if, instead of sorting into friendships as shown in Table 4, students
were randomly assigned friends. This exercise provides a natural comparison point from
which we can assess the importance of homophily in friendships.
    Throughout this section, we compare outcomes between baseline and counterfactual sce-
narios for achievement, own study time, and friend study time. We use scf               baseline
                                                                                it and sit         to
denote student i’s study time in the counterfactual and baseline scenarios, respectively. We
define the treatment effect on achievement for student i in period t as ∆yit ≡ y(scf    it , µyi ) −
y(sbaseline
   it       , µyi ). Treatment effects for own and friend study time are defined analogously.


8.1    Network Structure, Student Characteristics, and the Response
       to Peer Input Changes
To provide quantitative evidence about how students respond to changes in peer study time,
we estimate the impulse response to an impulse of increasing study effort. Specifically, we
increase (shock) the study time of a single student by one hour per day in a particular
semester and examine the responses of all other students in the network in that semester.
We summarize our findings when we perform this exercise 614 times (once for each of the
307 students in each of the two semesters).
    The averages in the first row of Table 8 show how the mean effect of the study shock
evaluated at the new equilibrium, i.e., taking into account the full set of feedback effects
in the network, varies with a student’s distance from the shocked student. For example,
to obtain the number in the second column we first compute, for each student j in each
of the two semesters t, the mean response in achievement for all students who are one link
away from j when j is shocked in semester t. Averaging this mean response over all shocked
students j and both semesters shows that students who are one link away from the shocked
student have an average achievement gain of 0.078 GPA points. Similarly, the third, fourth,
and fifth columns, respectively, show that students who are two links, three links, and four
links away from the shocked student, respectively, have average achievement gains of 0.022,
0.006, and 0.002 GPA points, respectively. The final column involves first computing, for
each student j in each of the two semesters t, the total response in achievement, i6=j ∆yit ,
                                                                                   P

for all students (other than j) who are in the network when j is shocked in semester t.
Averaging this total response over all students and semesters shows that, on average, the
total effect of the shock is 0.52 GPA points.
    Effects evaluated at the new equilibrium will be larger than partial equilibrium effects,
which only take into account how the shock to a student influences students who are directly
linked to her (i.e., iterating best response functions once). To quantify the importance of


                                                 38
this difference, the second row of Table 8 shows the partial equilibrium effects. The average
effect on students who are one link away from the shocked student is about 1/4 smaller
under partial equilibrium than when than under the new equilibrium (0.059 vs. 0.078 GPA
points), while, by definition, the effect on the (typically) large number of students who are
two or more links away from the shocked student is zero in the partial equilibrium case. The
last column shows that, on average, the total response of the shock is only 0.19 GPA points.
Therefore, if we considered only partial equilibrium effects we would, on average, understate
the achievement response by 64%.

   Note: The top row presents the mean effect on achievement (averaging over shocked students and
   semesters) at the new equilibrium, by distance from shocked student, where the shocked student
   has distance 0. The bottom row presents the mean effect on GPA immediately due to the impulse,
   by distance from shocked student. The mean total response, in the last column, is the average
   GPA response to   shockingstudents j over periods t, excluding the effect on the shocked student,

   We next examine how much the total response             i6=j ∆it varies, depending on which
student j is shocked in t. We find that the total response in achievement varies substantially
depending on which student is shocked. For example, the first quartile, median, and third
quartile of the total increase in achievement at the new equilibrium are 0.33, 0.49, and
0.66 GPA points, respectively. To get a better sense of why shocking different students
can produce such different gains, the left panel of Figure 4 shows the relationship between
the centrality of the shocked student and the total response at the new equilibrium.37 As
before, this calculation excludes the mechanical gain in achievement experienced by the
shocked student. Each dot records the total achievement response (y-axis) by the percentile
centrality that semester, i.e., by how central the shocked student is (x-axis). The size of each
(blue) dot shows the degree (i.e., number of friends) of the shocked student. Larger dots are
concentrated at the top-right, and smaller ones at the bottom-left. That is, students with
more friends tend to have higher centrality indices and larger achievement gains. Intuitively,
because the effects of effort changes are stronger the closer students are, the total response is
higher when the shocked student is more centrally located.38 The right panel of Figure 4 plots
  37
     We use what is called a “closeness” centrality measure, given by the reciprocal of the sum of short-
est distances between that student and every other student in the graph. Average distance to others for
unconnected students is set to the number of students (Csardi and Nepusz (2006), Freeman (1979)).
  38
     The notion that certain students may disproportionately affect other students is related to the concept

partial equilibrium effects (red dots). We can see here that, though shocked students have
the same degree (dot sizes), the average response is not as strongly increasing in centrality
of the shocked student. This is the case because the equilibrium effects play a larger role the
more densely connected the shocked student is to the rest of the network.
    Figure 4 evinces variation in the total achievement response (i.e., the y-axis) to shocking
different students who are similarly central (i.e., the x-axis) and who also have the same
number of friends (i.e., dot sizes). We use two examples to illustrate how the structure of
the social network interacts with the distribution of best response functions to determine
how changes in students’ actions affect other students.
    The left panel of Figure 5a shows the subgraph containing students within three degrees
of the student whose shock creates the largest total achievement response (1.29 GPA points).
The right panel shows the subgraph containing students within three degrees of the student
whose shock creates the smallest total achievement response (0.087 GPA points). In each
case, the shocked student is denoted by a red star. Squares represent males and circles
represent females. Shapes corresponding to black students are shaded and those correspond-
ing to nonblacks are unshaded. The area of the circle or square representing a student
other than the shocked student is proportional to the slope of that student’s best response
of a “key player”, studied in Ballester et al. (2006).


                                                                                                               40
function, where larger shapes correspond to more reactive students. Both subgraphs show
homophilous sorting: black students tend to be friends with other black students (and non-
blacks with nonblacks), males tend to be friends with males (and females with females). In
general, students with steeper best response functions tend to be friends with each other.
    Differences in the total response can be due to differences in link structure and how
heterogeneous students are arranged on the network. The link structures of the subgraphs
are very different. The shocked student in the left panel has more friends (6 vs. 1) and more
students within three degrees (39 vs. 12).39 In addition to the structure of links, how the
heterogeneous students are arranged on the network matters. Although the average slope of
best response functions is roughly similar between the subgraphs, 0.759 in the left vs. 0.698
in the right, the friends of the shocked student in the left panel have steeper best response
functions than the friend of the shocked student in the right panel. In the right panel,
the shock is immediately dampened by being passed through the student’s only, relatively
nonreactive friend.
    Figure 5b shows the analogous plot, where the area of the shape is now proportional to
the achievement gain for that student. The effect of the shock dies off in the same pattern
illustrated by the first row of Table 8, that is, shapes further from the star tend to be smaller.
Friends of the shocked student in the left subgraph gain much more than the friend of the
shocked student in the right subgraph. Due to the much steeper best response functions of
the shocked student’s friends, the impulse dies out much less quickly in the left subgraph.
Indeed, the gains for students who are two links from the shocked student in the left subgraph
are about as large as the gain for the student directly connected to the shocked student in
the right subgraph. This persistence comes from both the steeper best response functions
of direct friends of the shocked student and the fact that many of them are also connected
to each other, further augmenting the effects of the shock through feedback. This implies
the effectiveness of policies targeting students may depend critically on how they fit into the
arrangement of the social network.40


8.2     The Effect of Sorting into Friendships
Section 8.1 studied how students respond to the input choices of others, taking into account
the baseline network, which exhibits homophily. To directly examine homophily and, there-
fore, provide further evidence about the importance of peers, we compare achievement under
the baseline social network with achievement under a counterfactual where friends are homo-
  39
     We limit this illustration to students within three degrees based on the first row of Table 8, which shows
the total impact dies off quite quickly in distance from the shocked student.
  40
     See Fryer Jr (2011) for an example in which students are incentivized based on inputs to achievement.

Note: Red star indicates shocked student, males are square (females are circles), blacks are shaded (nonblacks

geneously distributed across students. In this counterfactual, for each semester, we maintain
the marginal distribution of friends per student observed in the data, but replace reported
links with random draws from the entire sample of students. We then form a counterfactual
symmetrized A matrix in the same manner as it was formed for the actual data, as described
in Section 3. Repeating this process 300 times for each of the two semesters produces 300
pairs of simulated adjacency matrices.41
    Table 9 summarizes changes in model outcomes between the baseline and counterfactual,
averaged over all 300 simulated networks. Achievement is measured in GPA points and
study times are in hours per day. The first column shows the average change in study time,
across all students and all simulated networks, that results from moving to homogeneous
(i.e., randomly assigned) friends. The first row shows that, on average, moving to this
counterfactual would reduce own study time by 0.10 hours. Intuitively, students who in
reality (i.e., under the baseline) have friends with high study types are most harmed by the
move to a homogeneous distribution, which makes them much more likely to have lower
study type friends. This explains why females, blacks, and students with above-median high
school GPAs, who tend to be high study types and are seen in Table 4 to often have friends
with high-study-type characteristics under the baseline, see own study time fall by 0.20,
0.25, and 0.15 hours, respectively. Conversely, males, who have less studious peers under
the baseline, tend to study more when friends are homogenized. Importantly, the estimated
complementarities, which arise due to the heterogeneity in best response functions combined
with sorting into friendships based on effective study type, imply that the gains of lower
study types are smaller than the losses of the higher study types. This explains the overall
decrease in own study time. Removing the sorting in the manner of our experiment does not
merely re-allocate output, but also lowers total output. Accordingly, the standard deviation
of own study time drops by 30%. A similar story drives both the overall results and the
stratified results associated with changes in friend study time in the second column of Table
9.
    The third column of Table 9 shows the average change in achievement across all students
and all simulated networks that result from the changes in study time found in the first
column. The first row shows that, on average, moving to the counterfactual would reduce
achievement by 0.02 GPA points. However, as expected given the findings of study time, the
declines are largest for black students, female students, and students with above-median high
  41
     For example, in the first semester the algorithm starts with IID draws of counterfactual “friends per
student” from the empirical marginal distribution of friends per student in A1 , divided by two and rounded
to the nearest integer, because A1 has been union-symmetrized. The number of directed links per student
is set to the student’s “friends per student” draw. Directed links are IID draws from the whole set of other
students.



                                                    43
school GPAs. As before, the losses to these groups are not offset by the gains to other groups.
Homogenizing the distribution of friends’ characteristics would increase the baseline GPA
gap between nonblack and black students of 0.5 GPA points by 14%, reduce the baseline
GPA gap between female and male students of 0.31 GPA points by almost 20%, and reduce
the baseline GPA gap between students with above-median and below-median high school
GPAs of 0.60 GPA points by 7%. Overall, homogenizing friends would reduce the standard
deviation of achievement by 5%.
    To gauge whether the effects reported above are significantly different from the baseline,
we also report the range of the change in mean achievement, by group discussed above,
across simulations. Figure 6 illustrates the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the mean change
for each group, along with the average mean changes presented in Col. (3) of Table 9.
Intervals for black students, females, and students with above-median high school GPAs are
all well below zero, as is the interval for the total change in achievement; only the group with
below-median high school GPAs has an interval that contains zero. The significant effects
indicated by these intervals reinforce our finding that sorting significantly affects student
achievement.42

     We have also obtained results that incorporate the estimated uncertainty in our parameters. Even here,
95% confidence intervals for black students, females, and students with above-median high school GPAs are
all below zero, as is the interval for the effect over all students (“total”), reinforcing the finding that sorting
significantly affects student achievement. The reason that females and black students lose significantly more
when friendships have been homogenized is that these groups have other characteristics associated with
higher estimated study types (as do their friends). For example, Table 1 shows that females have high school
GPAs that are, on average, over half a standard deviation higher than males, while having similar average
high school study time. On average, black students have over 40% of a standard deviation higher high school
study time than nonblack students.

9     Conclusion
This paper presents an equilibrium model of student study time choices and the production
of achievement. Social interactions are present because costs of study time for a student
depend on the study times of that student’s peers. We estimate this model and provide
evidence that this mechanism is important in the production of academic achievement. Our
approach was made possible by three key features of the BPS: direct measurements of study
time, measurements of a social network for a cohort of Berea students, and measures of
student propensities to study. We develop a specification test that can detect unobserved
determinants of study time.
    We use the structural model to examine counterfactuals that are informative about the
role of network feedback effects and sorting in peer characteristics. Heterogeneity in student
characteristics and how students are interconnected determine the distribution of responses
to changes in a student’s study time. Our structural approach provides a very clear and in-
tuitive interpretation for quantities of policy interest. For example, we estimate substantial
best response heterogeneity, wherein the most reactive student has a best response function
slope more than twice as steep as that of the least reactive student. Our results indicate
that equilibrium effects, mediated by the whole social network, are quantitatively impor-


                                                                                     45
tant in determining the responses of network-wide study time and achievement to shocks in
study time. In addition, our results indicate that homophily, or sorting in peers’ characteris-
tics, plays an important role in the production of achievement. For example, homogenizing
friends would reduce average achievement by 0.02 GPA points and the standard deviation of
achievement by 5%. The results of our specification test suggest that our study propensity
measures play a crucial role in addressing endogeneity concerns.

B.1    Concavity of Best Response Function
The optimal choice of study time for the period game solves the function G(s, s−i ) =
∂c
∂s
   −β2 = 0. To find how s varies with friend study time, use the Implicit Function Theorem:
                                            ∂G          ∂2c
                                  ∂s     ∂s       ∂s∂s
                                      = − ∂G−i = − ∂ 2 c−i .
                                 ∂s−i     ∂s       ∂s2

If friend study time decreases the cost of increasing one’s own study time, the numerator is
positive. If the cost of studying is convex in own study time, the denominator is negative,
meaning the overall sign is positive. Moreover, if friend study time enters c(·) in a weakly
concave manner, e.g., τs ≤ 1, the numerator is weakly smaller in absolute value for larger
values of s−i , i.e., study time is weakly concave in friend study time.


B.2    Proof of Existence and Uniqueness of Equilibrium
Claim 2. Let k be a number strictly greater than 24. There exists a unique pure strategy
Nash equilibrium if ψi : RN 7→ R are weakly concave and weakly increasing, ψi (0) > 0, and
ψi (k) < k for i ∈ N .

Proof. Define S = [0, k]N , i.e., a compact and convex set. Define a function Ψ:
                                                           

                                   Ψ : S 7→ S = 

                                                           
                                                  ψN (x−N )

   Existence: Ψ(·) is a continuous self map on the compact set S, so an equilibrium exists
by Brouwer’s Fixed Point Theorem.
   Uniqueness: If Ψ(·) is strictly concave and weakly increasing we can apply Kennan
(2001). Next, consider the case where Ψ(·) is linear, in which case we can prove Ψ(·) is a
contraction. Write the linear form of Ψ(·) as

B.3     Other Mechanisms for Social Interactions
B.3.1   Conformity Specification of Cost Function

We refer the cost function specification in (3) as the “cost-reduction model”. Consider the
alternative effort cost function, which we refer to as the “conformity model”:
                                                      δ3 2 δ4                           2
           c(s, s−i , µsi ) = (δ1 + δ2 γ(µsi )) s +     s +   s − (1 + δ5 γ(µsi )) sτ−is .   (38)
                                                      2     2
Solving the student’s problem results in the best response function
                       β2 − δ1      δ2                δ4            δ4 δ5
               si =            −         γ(µsi ) +         sτ−is +         γ(µsi )sτ−is .    (39)
                       δ3 + δ4   δ3 + δ4           δ3 + δ4         δ3 + δ4
If we make a similar normalization as was performed for the cost-reduction model, by setting
δ3 = 1, we obtain
                       β 2 − δ1    −δ2               δ4            δ4 δ5
                si =            +        γ(µsi ) +        sτ−is +        γ(µsi )sτ−is .      (40)
                        1 + δ4    1 + δ4           1 + δ4         1 + δ4
                       | {z } | {z }               | {z }         | {z }
                          −θ3          −θ4             (β2 −θ1 )      −θ2


That is, we can represent the parameters in equation (38) above in terms of parameters
in (3), which are in braces beneath their counterparts in the conformity model in (40).
Therefore, the distinction between the different formulations of the cost function—a cost of
deviating from friend behavior vs. a cost (reduction) from studying with ones friends—has
no empirical content.
    What matters, then, is interpretation and intuition of the two cost specifications. The
cost-reduction model captures the intuitive notion that friends studying more, i.e., a higher
s−i entering the denominator in the last three terms of equation (3), would reduce the cost
of studying by making it more enjoyable. At the same time, it also makes intuitive sense
that there would also be a private component to the cost of studying (the first two terms in

                                                      50
the expression). Note that τs also has an intuitive meaning in the cost-reduction model, as
it represents the degree to which the utility gains from friends’ studying diminish. If friends
studying more reduces your marginal cost of studying because you enjoy spending time with
them, then it would be natural to allow this benefit to decrease the more they study, i.e.,
τs < 1.
    Now consider the conformity model, first setting τs = 1 and δ5 = 0. The interpretations
of δ1 and δ2 are quite natural: students have private costs of studying, which may be het-
erogeneous. The interpretation of δ4 is also quite natural: if positive, this creates a force
inducing friends to behave similarly by conforming in their choice of study time.
    Now consider τs < 1 and assume δ4 > 0 (but maintain δ5 = 0). We believe the inter-
pretation in this case for the conformity model is less clear than it is in the cost-reduction
model. If s > s−i for a particular student then reducing τs would create a bigger cost of
deviating. On the other hand, if s < s−i then reducing τs would decrease the cost of devi-
ating. The interpretation of δ5 6= 0 (maintain τs = 1) is also slightly less clear, for similar
reasons: The thing one is conforming to is not the same as one’s choice: A student might
choose to study four hours a day to “conform” to her friends who study five hours, not due
to the private cost of studying. (Note that instead having the heterogeneous term outside
the quadratic term (i.e., added to δ4 ) would break the observational equivalence of the two
cost functions.) Therefore, though in the homogeneous, linear model it does appear that
conformity has a nice intuition, we believe the cost-reduction specification is a bit more
intuitive when considering nonlinear and/or heterogeneous best response functions.

B.3.2     Production Complementarities

Suppose we did not have achievement data. For simplicity, consider the homogeneous, linear,
best response specification (i.e., θ2 , θ4 = 0); the following result also obtains when using the
more general specification of the cost function. Consider the following specification of our
achievement equation:
                                                                           sit
                           y(sit , µyi , s−it ) = β1 + β2 sit + β3,comp        + µyi ,                   (41)
                                                                          s−it
where sit is own study effort and s−it is friend study effort. If β3,comp < 0, then increases in
peer effort increase the marginal product of one’s own effort.43 The student’s problem would
  43
     Note, one could instead have defined the production complementarity according to β3,comp sit s−it , where
β3,comp > 0 would correspond to production complementarities. Though such a functional form would
technically produce identification in the cost-reduction model we consider, it would not in the conformity
model (where the interaction above, β3,comp sit /s−it , for similar reasons, would produce identification via
functional form).



                                                      51
still be separable across periods, resulting in the best response function

                             sit = (β3,comp − θ3 ) + (β2 − θ1 )s−it .                     (42)

It is obvious from (42) that we cannot separately identify β3,comp and θ3 without having
data on the marginal product of inputs (i.e., data on achievement outcomes). Indeed, this
is the same argument that, without data on achievement, we could not identify the extent
to which students study because it is enjoyable (θ1 ) versus doing so because it affects their
achievement (β2 ). On the other hand, having both study time and achievement data would
clearly allow one to identify the extent to which production complementarities underlie social
interactions.


C     Additional Estimation Results
C.1     Human Capital Spillovers (“Contextual Effects”)
Table 10 presents the estimation results of our specifications allowing for contextual effects
in achievement, or human capital spillovers, described in Section 7.3. Specification (1)
presents the baseline estimates (i.e. those where friend characteristics do not directly affect
achievement), specification (2) presents results obtained when we re-estimated parameters
allowing for contextual effects generated by human capital type, as in (35), and specification
(3) presents results obtained when we re-estimated parameters allowing for achievement
contextual effects generated by the more flexible technology described in (36).
    In specification (2), we obtain a point estimate on the achievement contextual effect pa-
rameter of βb3,cont = 0.111, which has a standard error of 0.138. Similarly, in specification
(3), none of the estimated coefficients in ωy,cont , reported in the bottom six rows of the top
panel, are significantly different from zero. The coefficient on friend HS GPA (ωy,HS GPA ),
which would seem to be the most likely source of direct achievement spillovers, is one-tenth
the value of the (significant) coefficient on HS GPA in one’s own human capital type and
not significantly different from zero. The contextual characteristic with the most explana-
tory power for achievement is the share of male friends (ωy,Male ), although this too is not
a significant determinant of achievement. Based on a likelihood-ratio test, we would not
reject the baseline model for that in specification (3) at any conventional significance level
(the likelihood ratio test statistic has a p-value of 0.3673). We further note that there is a
striking similarity between the point estimates and statistical significance of common param-
eters estimated under the baseline and under both specifications allowing for achievement
contextual effects. This means the inclusion of such effects would not appreciably change

                                               52
our quantitative (or qualitative) results.
    Our a priori belief was that our direct collection of study time data would diminish the
potential role played by contextual effects. Because we do not find evidence supporting the
direct transmission of peer characteristics in academic achievement, we have retained our
baseline specification for the exposition of our results.


C.2        Production Complementarities
Table 11 presents the estimation results of our specification allowing for production com-
plementarities, as described in Section 7.4. Specification (1) is the baseline estimates (i.e.
those without production complementarities) and specification (2) allows for production
complementarities, as in (37). Unlike the extensions including achievement contextual ef-
fects, extending the model to allow for production complementarities results in a different
best response function:44

                    sit = (β3,comp − θ3 ) − θ4 γ(µsi ) + (β2 − θ1 )s−it − θ2 γ(µsi )s−it .     (43)

    We obtain a point estimate on the production complementarity parameter of βb3,comp =
0.904, which has a standard error of 0.633. Although this estimate may have a surprising sign,
wherein increases in friend study time reduce the marginal product of one’s own study time
(potentially due to friends goofing off when studying together), the statistically insignificant
estimate does not provide evidence supporting production complementarities in achieve-
ment as the source generating social interactions in our application; rather a cost-based (or,
equivalently, conformity-based) mechanism seems to generate the data. As suggested by
inspection of (43), the parameter most affected by this extension is θ3 , the intercept of the
best response function. Notably, parameters governing best response function slopes (θ1 , θ2 ,
and the study type parameters ωs ), which determine the level and distribution of the effects
of social interactions in study time, are relatively unaffected.


C.3        Out-of-Sample Validation
Table 12 presents the baseline parameter estimates (Col. (1)) and those obtained when
using only first-semester data (Col. (2)). The sets of parameters are strikingly similar
between the two columns; this is confirmed by their having very similar (first-semester-only)
log likelihoods, which are presented at the bottom of each column. This suggests that the
out-of-sample fit of second-semester outcomes may be reasonable when based on parameters
 44
      As in the baseline specification, we have set the best response function to be linear.

                  estimates from baseline model and the log likelihood in the first
                  semester. Col. (2) presents results when parameters were esti-
                  mated using only first-semester data and the log likelihood in the

    To further investigate, we compare model fit for the first-semester data, which was used
to estimate model parameters, and the validation data from the second semester. We can
see that the out-of-sample fit for study time (Figure 9), GPA (Figure 10), and own-vs.-friend
study time (Figure 11) all seem quite good.

Example 1 (Dyadic, separate networks with homogeneous best responses). Consider the
following special case, with

                                              F1 (Γ2 ) = Xλ1                                        (44)
                                          Wt (X; Γ2 ) = W λ2                                        (45)
                                               Π(X) = Xλ3 ,                                         (46)

where λ1 , λ2 are scalars, λ3 is a matrix of parameters, and W = IN ⊗ I2 is a block diagonal
matrix with I2 (i.e., two-by-two Identity matrices) along the diagonal, representing the fact
that each student is friends with exactly one other student. Then (31) would become

                  e2 )−1 [X(λ1 + λ3 )] − (I − W λ
       ≈ {(I − W λ
      e                                         e2 )−1 [X λ
                                                          b1 ]} + (I − W λ2 )−1 u + ηs .            (47)

Note that plim λ b1 = (λ1 + λ3 ), i.e., where will be no prediction bias, meaning we are in
Case (i) above. Because W is block diagonal, it is sufficient to consider the top-left 2 × 2
block, representing the first friendship dyad. The expression (47) for these students then,
eliminating the ηs , which are independently distributed from all other variables and therefore
qualitatively immaterial in the following calculation, is
                "     #           "        #"       #           "            #

                   2
                   e       1 − λ22 λ2 1         u2       1 − λ22 λ2 u1 + u2
                                                                     2
                                                                  1
giving the product of residuals for students in the first dyad: 1−λ 2    (λ2 u21 + (1 + λ22 )u1 u2 + λ2 u22 ) .
                                                                    2
Under the maintained assumption that λ ≥ 0, the expectation of this product can only be zero
if u1 u2 < 0, i.e., own and friend errors u are negatively correlated, and in exactly the right
way.
