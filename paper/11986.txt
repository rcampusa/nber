                                            ABSTRACT

This paper analyzes a marked change in the evolution of the U.S. wage structure over the past fifteen
years: divergent trends in upper-tail (90/50) and lower-tail (50/10) wage inequality. We document
that wage inequality in the top half of distribution has displayed an unchecked and rather smooth
secular rise for the last 25 years (since 1980). Wage inequality in the bottom half of the distribution
also grew rapidly from 1979 to 1987, but it has ceased growing (and for some measures actually
narrowed) since the late 1980s. Furthermore we find that occupational employment growth shifted
from monotonically increasing in wages (education) in the 1980s to a pattern of more rapid growth
in jobs at the top and bottom relative to the middles of the wage (education) distribution in the
1990s. We characterize these patterns as the “polarization” of the U.S. labor market, with
employment polarizing into high-wage and low-wage jobs at the expense of middle-wage work. We
show how a model of computerization in which computers most strongly complement the non-
routine (abstract) cognitive tasks of high-wage jobs, directly substitute for the routine tasks found
in many traditional middle-wage jobs, and may have little direct impact on non-routine manual tasks
in relatively low-wage jobs can help explain the observed polarization of the U.S. labor market.

   Much research (surveyed in Lawrence F. Katz and David H. Autor [1999] and Daron

Acemoglu [2002]) documents a substantial widening of the U.S. wage structure since the late

1970s, largely driven by increases in educational wage differentials and residual (within-group)

wage inequality. The growth in overall wage inequality was most rapid during the 1980s, and

involved a spreading out of the entire wage distribution. Rapid secular growth in the demand for

skills, partly driven by skill-biased technical change (SBTC), combined with a sharp slowdown

in the growth of the relative supply of college workers (starting in the early 1980s) help to

explain these wage changes. The erosion of labor market institutions protecting low- and middle-

wage workers—the minimum wage and unions—further contributed to rising wage inequality,

especially during the 1980s.

   Recent work challenges these conclusions emphasizing a slowdown in the growth of U.S.

wage inequality over the last fifteen years (David Card and John DiNardo 2002; Thomas

Lemieux 2006). This “revisionist” literature views the surge in wage inequality of the 1980s as

an “episodic” event driven by institutional forces and argues that the more “modest” inequality

growth in the 1990s is inconsistent with a key role for SBTC and other market forces.

    In this paper, we reconsider this revisionist view, focusing on a marked change in the

evolution of the U.S. wage structure over the past 15 years: divergent trends in upper- and lower-

tail wage inequality. In Section I, we document that wage inequality in the top half of the

distribution has exhibited an unchecked secular rise for the last 25 years (since 1980), but it has

ceased growing since the late 1980s (and for some measures narrowed) in the bottom half of the

distribution. In Section II, we show that the pattern of employment growth differed sharply in the

1990s versus the 1980s with more rapid growth of employment in jobs (occupations) at the

bottom and top relative to the middle of the wage (and skill) distribution. Borrowing the
terminology of Maarten Goos and Alan Manning (2003) from work on Britain, we characterize

this pattern as the “polarization” of the U.S. labor market, with employment polarizing into high-

wage and low-wage jobs at the expense of traditional middle-skill jobs. We document that

quantity and price changes covary positively throughout the distribution of earnings—both in the

1980s, when the wage structure was spreading monotonically, and in the 1990s, when the wage

structure was polarizing. These patterns suggest a central role for labor demand shifts in

explaining wage structure changes of the last twenty-five years. We show in Section III how a

simple model of computerization (based on Autor, Frank Levy, and Richard Murnane [2003]) in

which computers complement non-routine (abstract) cognitive tasks, substitute for routine tasks,

and may have little impact on non-routine manual tasks, can help explain the observed

polarization of the U.S. labor market. Section IV concludes.



I. Divergent Upper- and Lower-Tail Wage Inequality

    Figure 1 displays the evolution of the 90-50 and 50-10 log hourly wage differentials for all

workers (males and females combined) from 1973 to 2004 using (hours-weighted) wage data

from the Current Population Survey (CPS) May samples (for 1973-78) and Merged Outgoing

Rotation Group (MORG) samples (for 1979 to 2004).1 The plot shows similar substantial

increases in upper-half (90-50) and lower-half (50-10) wage inequality from 1979 to 1987,

expanding the 90-10 log wage differential by 21 log points. But the trends in top-half and

bottom-half inequality diverge after 1987 with upper-half wage inequality continuing to rise

steadily over the last 15 years while the growth in lower-half inequality ceased in the late 1980s


1
  All of our sample selection and data processing steps for CPS wage data are the same as those described
in the Data Appendix of Autor, Katz, and Melissa S. Kearney (2005a) extended to cover wage data for
2004.



                                                                                                        2
(with an actual contraction in the 50-10 log wage differential of 4 log points from 1987 to

2004).2 The net effect has been a slower growth of only 4 log points in the 90-10 log wage

differential since 1987. These trends are robust across numerous samples and data sources.

Monotonic rising wage inequality in the 1980s and diverging upper- and lower-tail wage

inequality since the late 1980s are observed for males and females separately, for hourly wages

(based on annual earnings divided by hours worked in the previous calendar year) from the CPS

March Samples, and for the weekly wages of full-time workers in both the March and MORG

CPS samples (Autor, Katz, and Kearney 2005a).3

    Figure 2 illustrates more precisely where in the wage structure the divergence of upper- and

lower-tail wage inequality trends has occurred. Figure 2 plots cumulative log hourly real

earnings growth (indexed using the Personal Consumption Expenditures implicit price deflator)

by wage percentile for 1973 to 1988 and for 1988 to 2004. The figure shows an almost linear

spreading out of the entire wage distribution (from the 3rd to 97th percentile) in the first half of

the sample (driven by changes in the 1980s). In contrast, wage growth has polarized since 1988,

with faster wage growth in the bottom quartile than in middle two quartiles and with the most

rapid rise and a continued spreading out of the wage distribution in the top quartile.

    The divergence of upper- and lower-tail wage inequality since the late 1980s also holds for

residual wage inequality and is robust to (and even reinforced by) adjustments for labor force

composition (demographic) changes (Autor, Katz, and Kearney 2005b).4 Similar patterns are



2
  This divergence in trends in the 90-50 and 50-10 log hourly wage differentials using CPS data has also
been emphasized by Lawrence Mishel, Jared Bernstein, and Sylvia Allegretto (2005).
3
  The magnitude of wage inequality growth is larger for both males and females when analyzed separately
than for the overall sample (given the narrowing of the gender gap), and wage inequality grew by more
over the last fifteen years using March rather than the MORG CPS samples.
4
  Between-group wage inequality similarly shows a faster growth in the top-half than the bottom-half of
the distribution since the 1980s. For example, Lemieux (2005) documents the growing “convexifiation”


                                                                                                       3
found for total employee compensation in the micro data from Employment Cost Index (Brooks

Pierce 2001) and for annual wage and salary earnings based on Internal Revenue Service (IRS)

micro data (Ian Dew-Becker and Robert J. Gordon 2005). Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez

(2003) further document the persistent divergence of annual earnings in the very upper-end of

distribution (the top 1%) relative to other workers since the 1970s using IRS tax-return data.

    Some researchers speculate that the growing skewness of the upper part of the wage

distribution reflects changes in social norms (Piketty and Saez 2003), and others (Card and

DiNardo 2002; Lemieux 2006) argue that the slowdown of 90-10 wage inequality growth in the

1990s speaks in favor of institutional factors (especially the minimum wage) and against SBTC

and other market mechanisms for changes in the wage structure. But the time pattern of changes

in the minimum wage does not do much to explain the evolution of wage inequality even in the

bottom half of the distribution outside the 1979 to 1987 period (Autor, Katz and Kearney 2005a).

The ‘social norms’ explanation—while potentially promising—needs further refinement to be

directly testable.

    We examine how a more nuanced view of technological change than the usual SBTC model

(based on a single-index view of skill) may contribute to an explanation for observed wage

inequality trends. Building on Autor, Levy and Murnane (2003), our conceptual framework

observes that the first-order impact of computerization is to displace (substitute for) a set of

‘middle skilled’ routine cognitive and manual tasks, such as bookkeeping, clerical work and

repetitive production tasks.5 If these routine tasks are more complementary to high-skilled,

abstract tasks (problem-solving, management and coordination) than to ‘non-routine manual’

of U.S. returns to schooling over recent decades with the returns to post-secondary schooling (especially
post-college training) rising sharply and returns to lower levels of education remaining largely unchanged.
5
  Levy and Murnane (2004) provide a rich elaboration and extension of these ideas. In earlier work,
Chinhui Juhn (1994) discusses evidence and explanations for a decline in demand for ‘middle-skill’
workers.


                                                                                                         4
tasks (such as those performed by truck drivers, waiters and security guards), the

computerization of routine work can lead to a polarization of the structure of employment and

earnings. The model predicts that a period of wage structure polarization should be accompanied

by employment polarization, a pattern that is strongly supported by our analysis below.



II. Job Polarization Trends

    We examine trends in the “quality,” skill content, and task content of U.S. jobs since 1980.

We follow Goos and Manning’s (2003) analysis of the U.K. in exploring how U.S. employment

growth by occupation has been related to skill (or job quality) proxied by initial wages or

educational levels.

    We first sort occupations into percentiles by their median hourly wage in 1980 (actually

based on 1979 earnings) using data from the 1980 Census Integrated Public Use Microsample

(IPUMS). Figure 3 plots employment growth, measured as a share of total hours worked in the

economy, from 1980-1990 and 1990-2000, against 1980 occupational wage percentile using

employment data from the 1980, 1990, and 2000 IPUMS.6 For the 1980s, the figure shows

declining employment at the bottom end of the occupational distribution and rather monotonic

increases in employment shares as one moves up the wage structure (with a little dip from the

55th to 80th percentile). In sharp contrast, employment growth in the 1990s appears to have

polarized. We observe rapid employment growth in low-wage and high-wage jobs in the 1990s

and slow growth in the middle of the wage distribution.

6
  We employ a consistent set of occupation codes for Census years 1980, 1990 and 2000 developed by
Peter B. Meyer and Anastasiya M. Osborne (2005). We use a locally weighted smoothing regression
(bandwidth 0.8 with 100 observations) to fit the relationship between decadal growth in occupational
employment share and occupations’ initial skill percentile in the 1980 skill distribution, measured by
median occupational wages or average years of schooling. Figures 3 and 4 plot the fitted values from
these regressions.



                                                                                                         5
    This pattern of job growth (and possible labor demand shifts) corresponds well with the

observed pattern of wage structure changes shown in Figure 2. In a comparison of the 1980s to

the 1990s, we find that employment growth is more rapid in the 1990s below the 25th and above

the 65th percentiles of the occupational wage distribution and declined in the middle (from the

25th to the 65th percentiles).

    We test the robustness of these patterns by utilizing an alternative skill definition: the mean

years of schooling in an occupation in 1980. Figure 4 displays the analogous plot of U.S.

occupational employment growth in the 1980s and 1990s by 1980 occupational education

percentiles. Using this skill measure, we find near-monotonic (almost linear) increases in

employment growth moving up the education distribution in the 1980s. We also find that

employment growth has polarized in the 1990s, with more rapid employment growth in the

bottom end of the education distribution than in the middle. The most rapid (and diverging)

employment gains are concentrated in the top part of the education distribution.

    Acemoglu (1999) also finds U.S. job polarization from the mid-1980s to early 1990s using

more aggregated industry-occupation cells, and Goos and Manning (2003) document job growth

polarization by detailed occupations from 1979 to 1999 for Britain—another country with a large

increase in wage inequality. Furthermore, Spitz-Oener (2006) reports job polarization in West

Germany, a labor market where wage inequality has been rather quiescent until recently. These

similar patterns of recent employment growth polarization for several rich countries are

suggestive of similar market demand shifts favoring jobs at the top and bottom relative to the

middle of the skill (wage) distribution. But the much larger growth in wage inequality in the

United States and Britain than in Germany in recent decades also suggests that differences in




                                                                                                      6
labor market and educational institutions may greatly affect how such demand shifts translate

into wage structure changes.

   A third methodology for measuring U.S. employment structure trends is to directly examine

changes in job task content. Autor, Levy, and Murnane (2003) take this approach using data on

detailed tasks from the Dictionary of Occupational Titles aggregated to 3-digit Census

occupations. Though not depicted, we have extended their data analysis of employment growth

in industry-gender-education cells using CPS data through 2002. We find that employment

growth was most rapid in the 1990s for cells intensive in non-routine cognitive tasks (those most

complementary with computerization), was declining and decelerating in the 1990s for cells

most intensive in routine cognitive and manual tasks (those most substitutable for computers),

and ceased declining in the 1990s for (typically low-wage) jobs intensive in non-routine manual

tasks.

   These patterns of employment growth by wages, education, and task intensity suggest that

labor demand shifts have favored low- and high-wage workers relative to middle-wage workers

over the last fifteen years. This pattern stands in contrast to the shifts in labor demand evident

during the decade of the 1980s, which appear to have been monotonically rising in skill. We now

offer a conceptual framework for interpreting these trends.



III. A Model and Interpretation

   Our framework, building on Autor, Levy, Murnane (2003), considers how a decline in the

real price of computing power may lead to a polarization of work, as measured by traditional

skill measures. The model builds on four observations that we believe are well-supported by the

case-study and representative evidence (see Levy and Murnane [2004]). First, computer




                                                                                                     7
capital—denoted by K in our model and measured in efficiency units—is a close substitute for

human labor in routine cognitive and manual tasks, such as bookkeeping, clerical work and

repetitive production tasks. Second, routine task input—embodied in either computer capital or

human labor—is a complement to workers engaged in abstract reasoning tasks such as problem

solving, coordination, and other high-level management activities. Third, there exists a panoply

of non-routine manual tasks for which computers currently neither directly substitute nor

strongly complement, such as the job tasks performed by truck drivers, security guards, waiters

and janitors. For brevity, we refer to these three categories of tasks as Abstract ( A ), Routine ( R )

and Manual ( M ), and we consider them to roughly correspond to high, intermediate and low

skilled occupations as measured by earnings or education.

    We observe that workers’ ability to engage in specific tasks is partially contingent on their

education. For simplicity, we assume that there are two types of workers: College workers, who

can perform Abstract tasks, and High School workers who can freely substitute between Routine

and Manual tasks.

    The exogenous driving force in our model is the well-documented precipitous decline in the

price of computing power of recent decades. Computerization—by which we mean the falling

price of computer power—lowers the price of Routine task input and increases demand for

Routine tasks. We sketch the formal model here and refer the reader to the Theory Appendix for

full details.

    Output in this economy, priced at unity, is produced using the aggregate Cobb-Douglas

production function Y = Aα R β M γ with α , β , γ ∈ ( 0,1) , α + β + γ = 1 , and where A, R and M

denote the three tasks above. Abstract and manual tasks are performed by workers who supply

labor inputs, LA and LM . Routine tasks can be performed either by workers who supply LR or by



                                                                                                      8
computer capital, K , measured in efficiency units, which is a perfect substitute for LR .

Computer capital is supplied perfectly elastically to Routine tasks at price ρ , which is falling

over time at an exogenous rate.

    There are a large number of workers with educational supplies assumed exogenous. A

fraction θ ∈ ( 0,1) are High School workers and the remaining 1 − θ are College workers. Each

College workers is endowed with one efficiency unit of Abstract skill, which she supplies

inelastically to Abstract tasks. Each High School worker i is endowed with one efficiency unit

of skill in Manual tasks and ηi efficiency units of skill in Routine tasks, where η is continuously

distributed on the unit interval with positive probability mass at all points η ∈ [ 0,1] . High school

workers do not possess Abstract skills.7

    The supply of High School labor to Routine and Manual tasks is determined by self-

selection. Let wm and wr each the wages paid to Manual and Routine tasks. Each High School

worker i chooses to supply either one efficiency unit of labor to Manual tasks if ηi < wm / wr or

supplies ηi efficiency units of labor to Routine tasks otherwise. Thus labor supply to Manual

(Routine) tasks is weakly upward (downward) sloping in wm / wr .

    Equilibrium in the model occurs when: (1) the economy operates on the demand curve of the

aggregate production function; (2) each factor is paid its marginal product ( wA = ∂Y / ∂A ,

wR = ∂Y / ∂R and wM = ∂Y / ∂M ); and (3) the labor market clears so that no worker wishes to

reallocate labor input among tasks.

7
  A more complete version of this model would allow for endogenous longer-run educational supply
responses to college versus high school earnings opportunities, endow college workers with routine as
well as abstract skills, endow high school workers with some abstract skills, and allow for heterogeneity
in abstract skills among college workers. Heterogeneity in abstract skills among college workers will
tend to reinforce the spreading out of the top end of the wage distribution in response to declining real
computer prices. Endogenous education responses could eventually work to offset some of the impacts of
computer price declines on wage inequality.


                                                                                                         9
   Because computer capital is a perfect substitute for routine labor input, it is immediate that

wr = ρ . Hence, a decline in ρ reduces wr one for one. We are interested in the effect of a

decline in ρ on: (1) the equilibrium quantity of Routine task input; (2) the allocation of labor

between Routine and Manual tasks; (3) the wage paid to each task; and (4) the observed wage in

each job type—which, in the case of Routine tasks, may differ from the wage paid per efficiency

unit of Routine task input.

   Since own-factor demand curves are downward sloping, a decline in ρ raises demand for

Routine tasks. This demand can be supplied by either additional computer capital or additional

Routine labor input. Due to worker self-selection, the additional demand will be supplied by

computer capital. The reason, as we demonstrate formally in the Theory Appendix, is that

Manual and Routine tasks are q-complements—a rise in Routine input (spurred by the fall in ρ )

raises the marginal productivity of Manual task input.

   Note, however, that when ρ (and thereby wr ) falls, a subset of workers—those with

relatively low η —self-select from Routine to Manual tasks. This additional labor supply works

against the beneficial effects of computerization on the Manual wage. In fact, it is possible for

both wm and wr to fall when ρ declines. Nevertheless, the wage of Manual relative to Routine

tasks ( wm / wr ) unambiguously rises.

   We distinguish, however, between the wage of Routine tasks measured in efficiency units

and the observed wages of workers in routine tasks, which are affected by composition. As

workers self-select out of Routine tasks, the remaining Routine workers have above average

Routine skills, meaning that the observed Routine wage can either rise or fall (both overall and

relative to wm ) as ρ declines.




                                                                                                    10
   As with Manual workers, workers in Abstract tasks benefit from a rise in Routine task input

due to q-complementarity. In the case of Abstract tasks, however, there is no countervailing

labor supply response to buffer the positive impact of computerization on the Abstract wage.

Consequently, computerization unambiguously raises wa , both absolutely and relative to wr and

wm . A more realistic production function would reinforce this pattern by allowing for greater

complementarity between Routine and Abstract tasks than between Routine and Manual tasks.

   In what sense does this stylized framework represent a polarization of work? The key

observation of the model is that computers do not appear to directly substitute for the lowest

skilled workers; rather they appear to displace a set of ‘middle skilled’ routine tasks. Displacing

this ‘middle’ generates polarization through three mechanisms. First, it directly lowers the wage

of middle-skill tasks. Second, it raises the wage of high-skilled (Abstract) tasks through q-

complementarity. Finally, it has ambiguous effects on the wages of low-skilled (Manual) tasks

due to offsetting impacts of q-complementarity and additional labor supply emanating from

workers displaced from Routine tasks. Thus, computerization always raises ‘upper-tail’

inequality in our model—that is the, wage gap between Abstract and Routine tasks. But it can

either expand or compress ‘lower-tail’ inequality—that is, the wage gap between Routine and

Manual tasks—depending on whether the q-complementarity or labor supply effect dominates.

   It is potentially useful to think of the model as moving successively between two equilibria

as the price of computer capital declines. In the initial equilibrium, computerization displaces

workers from Routine and into Manual tasks, thus depressing wages in both the ‘middle’ and

(potentially) the ‘bottom’ of the distribution even as the Abstract wage increases. When ρ falls

sufficiently far, however, the model exhibits a second equilibrium in which Routine tasks are

performed exclusively by K . In this equilibrium, only the q-complementarity effect is operative;



                                                                                                   11
further declines in ρ raise wages in both Manual and Abstract tasks. Thus, the model is

heuristically consistent with an initially ‘monotone’ wage impact of computerization followed by

a polarization of the earnings distribution as job tasks performed by workers ‘hollow out’ to

encompass only Abstract and Manual tasks.8 A similar (complementary) impact of international

outsourcing could arise from the declining international communication and coordination costs

associated with improvements in information technology (see Levy and Murnane [2004] and Pol

Antras, Luis Garicano, and Esteban Rossi-Hansberg [2006]).



IV. Conclusions

    In our view, the key new wage structure ‘facts’ documented by recent analyses are the

smooth, secular rise in upper-tail inequality over the last twenty five years coupled with an

expansion and then compression of lower-tail inequality. These facts are not easily explained by

standard institutional stories. For example, the minimum wage explanation for trends in lower-

tail inequality only fits the data well to 1987 (Autor, Katz, and Kearney 2005a) and cannot

explain why employment in low-wage occupations fell precipitously as the minimum wage

dropped (nor why upper-tail inequality has risen steadily). The changing ‘social norms’

explanation for the remarkable skewing of the upper-reaches of the income distribution since the

early 1970s, while intriguing, needs to be formulated in more precise manner with clear testable

predictions.



8
  The computerization of relatively low-wage, routine jobs (such as those in lower-wage manufacturing
industries and some clerical work) might be easier to initially envision and implement than for other
work. And it may be that only with further improvements in software and computer-based technologies
does the re-organization of more middle-wage, middle-skill tasks (high-paid precision production work
and middle management work) become possible. This process could reinforce a pattern of the
substitution for workers by computers moving up the wage (skill) structure over time.



                                                                                                        12
   Our analysis offers surprisingly unambiguous evidence that demand shifts are likely to be a

key component of any cogent explanation for the changing US wage structure. In particular, we

find that quantity and price changes covary positively throughout the entire distribution of

earnings—and this is true in the 1980s, when the wage structure was spreading monotonically,

and in the 1990s, when the wage structure was polarizing. We believe that a conceptual

framework focused on the changing distribution of job task demands, spurred directly by

advancing information technology and indirectly by its impact on international outsourcing, goes

some distance towards understanding the recent polarization of the U.S. wage structure. The

similarity across several countries (the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany) in

employment growth polarization combined with some differences in wage structure changes

suggests the need to seriously consider the roles of market forces, institutional factors, and their

interactions in explaining the evolution of national wage structures.

                              1
1     Motivation
Motivating ideas:

    1. Workplace tasks may be usually subdivided into three broad groups:

       (a) Abstract problem-solving and managerial tasks. These tasks are not well structured and
              require non-routine cognitive skills.
       (b) Routine tasks. These may either be cognitive or physical tasks that they follow closely
              prescribed sets of rules and procedures and are executed in a well-controlled environment.
        (c) Manual tasks. These tasks (which ALM call non-routine manual) do not require abstract
              problem solving or managerial skills but are nevertheless di¢ cult to automate because they
              require some ‡exibility in a less than fully predictable environment. Examples include:
              truck drivers, security guards, unskilled medical personnel, janitors and house-cleaners,
              high speed check-keyers, construction workers, many in-person servers.

    2. Routine tasks are complementary to Abstract tasks and perhaps also to Manual tasks (though
      probably less so).

    3. Routine tasks are readily substituted with computer capital. The continually falling price of
      computer capital drives this substitution.

    4. The falling price of computer capital generates an incentive for workers engaged in Routine tasks
      to switch to other tasks.

    5. It is more di¢ cult for workers displaced from Routine tasks to shift ‘up’to Abstract tasks than
      it is for them to shift ‘down’to Manual tasks.


2     Model
2.1    Production
Aggregate output in this economy (priced at unity) is given by the Cobb-Douglas production function

                                               Y =A R M ;

where A; R and M are Abstract, Routine and Manual tasks, with exponents            ; ;   2 (0; 1) respec-
tively, and     +   +    = 1. Abstract and manual tasks can only be performed by workers who supply
labor inputs, LA and LM : Routine tasks can be performed either by workers who supply LR or by
computer capital, K, measured in e¢ ciency units, which is a perfect substitute for LR :




                                                      2
2.2      Factor supplies
Computer capital is supplied perfectly elastically to Routine tasks at price                    per e¢ ciency unit. The
secularly declining price of computer capital is the exogenous driving force in this model.
       There is a large number of income-maximizing workers in this economy, each endowed with a
vector of three skills, Si = (ai ; ri ; mi ), where lower-case letters denote an individual’s skill endowment
for the three production tasks.
       Workers are of two types. A fraction      2 (0; 1) are High School (H) workers and the remaining 1
are College (C) workers. For simplicity, all college workers are assumed identical. Each is endowed
with one e¢ ciency unit of Abstract skill: S C (a; r; m) = (1; 0; 0).1 The labor supply of each college
worker is LC = (1; 0; 0).
       All high school workers are equally skilled in Manual tasks but di¤er in their ability in Routine
tasks. We write the skill endowment of high school worker i as SiH (a; r; mi ) = (0;                      i ; 1),   where     is a
continuous variable distributed on the unit interval with positive probability mass at all points                                2
(0; 1). The labor supply of High School worker i is           LH
                                                               i   (a; r; m) = (0;   i i ; (1      i ))   where       i   2 [0; 1].
Each High School worker chooses          i   to maximize earnings.

2.3      Equilibrium concept
Equilibrium in this model occurs when:

   1. Productive e¢ ciency is achieved— that is, the economy operates on the demand curve of the
         aggregate production function for each factor.

   2. All factors are paid their marginal products.

   3. The labor market clears; no worker wishes to reallocate labor input among tasks.

2.4      Productive e¢ ciency
The wage of each factor is given by:
                                                    @Y
                                          wa =         = A 1R M ;
                                                    @A
                                                    @Y
                                             wr =      = A R 1M ;
                                                    @R
                                                    @Y
                                         wm =          = A R M 1:
                                                    @M
   1
    It would be a very minor matter to instead assume that LC (a; r; m) = (1; 1; 1) with wa > wr ; wm for all relevant
cases. This would ensure that college-workers always supply Abstract labor— and of course this tendency would only be
reinforced by a falling price of computer capital.




                                                          3
2.5      Self-selection of workers to tasks
The supply of College labor to Abstract tasks is inelastic.
      The supply of High School labor to Routine and Manual tasks is determined by self-selection. Each
High School worker i chooses to supply one e¢ ciency unit of labor to Manual tasks if                i   < wm =wr ,
and supplies   e¢ ciency units of labor to Routine tasks otherwise. We can write the labor supply
                   i
                                                                P
functions to Manual and Routine tasks as LM (wm =wr ) =          i 1 [ i < wm =wr ] and LR (wm =wr ) =
  P
    i i 1[ i  wm =wr ], where 1 [ ] is the indicator function. Observe that L0M ( ) 0 and L0R ( ) 0.

2.6      Equilibrium and comparative statics
Since computer capital is a perfect substitute for routine labor input, it is immediate that wr =              and
hence a decline in        reduces wr one for   one.2
      We are interested in the e¤ect of a decline in          on:

   1. The equilibrium quantity of Routine task input

   2. The allocation of labor between Routine and Manual tasks

   3. The wage paid to each task

   4. The observed wage in each job type (which in may di¤er from the wage per e¢ ciency unit in
        Routine tasks)

      A decline in       raises demand for Routine tasks, since own-factor demand curves are downward
sloping   (R0 (   ) < 0). This demand can be supplied by either additional computer capital or Routine
labor input. Due to worker self-selection, the additional demand will be supplied by computer capital.
      To see this, let       equal the Manual skill level of the marginal worker, such that              = wm =wr .
Rewriting         using the marginal productivity conditions:
                                                       wm        R
                                                   =      =           :
                                                       wr      LM ( )

Di¤erentiating with respect to          (a decline in the price of K) gives

                   @           @     RL0M ( )          @R=@            LM ( ) @R=@
                         =                     2              =                         > 0:                    (1)
                   @           @     LM ( )            LM ( )        LM ( )2 + RL0M ( )

A decline in       raises the relative Manual/Routine wage.
  2
    Technically, only binds wr from above. In an earlier period, when computer capital was far more expensive, it’s
plausible that wr < : For the period under study, we assume that this constraint binds.

A decline in the price of computer capital lowers the wage of Routine labor input, raises the wage
of Abstract labor input through two channels of q-complementarity— increased use of Routine task
input and increased labor supply to Manual task input— and has ambiguous implications for the wage
of Manual task input (due to the countervailing e¤ects of q-complementarity between Routine and
Manual tasks and increased labor supply to Manual tasks).
      Though, as established above, a decline in                 yields a larger proportionate fall in the wage of
Routine than Manual tasks ( @ (wm =wr ) =@ > 0), the observed log wage di¤erential between workers
in Routine and Manual jobs may rise despite the fall in wr =wm . The reason is that a decline in wr
leads to marginal workers with lower values of             to exit Routine jobs, inducing a positive compositional
shift in the pool of workers in Routine occupations ( @E [ j >                   ] =@ > 0).
      Summarizing:

  1. A decline in the price of computer capital causes an increase in demand for Routine task input.

  2. This increase is entirely supplied by computer capital as the price decline causes a corresponding
        reduction in labor supply to Routine tasks and an increase in labor supply to Manual tasks.

  3. The reduction in the price of computer capital has the following implications for wages levels
        measured in e¢ ciency units:
                                       @wr          @wm            @wr =wm         @wa
                                           < 0;         7 0;               < 0;        > 0:
                                        @            @               @              @

  4. The reduction in the price of computer capital has the following implications for observed wage
        levels:
                                       @w^r         @w^m           @wr =wm         @w^a
                                            7 0;         7 0;              7 0;         > 0;
                                        @            @               @              @
        where ‘hats’over wage variables denote observed values that do not adjust for changes in occu-
        pational skill composition (e.g., @E [ j >            ] =@ ).3

      For Manual and Abstract tasks, compositional shifts are nil by assumption.

     Remark 1: The model does not pin down the ranking of wages in Abstract, Routine and Manual
tasks; these levels depend on labor supplies and . For workers who switch from Routine to Manual
tasks as    falls, the manual wage must be higher than the Routine wage (wm >        i wr ).   But for
inframarginal Routine workers, it must be the case that the Routine wage is higher than the Manual
wage. This observation has an important empirical implication: if there are any workers remaining in
the Routine job, their observed wage (i.e., not accounting for composition) must be higher than the
wage in the Manual job since there is no skill heterogeneity in Manual tasks. Hence, even in cases
where wr < wm , it will be true that w
                                     ^r > w
                                          ^m provided that LR (wm =wr ) > 0.
     Remark 2: In an equilibrium in which H workers supply both Routine tasks and Manual tasks,
K is a direct substitute for some H workers and a complement to others. In this setting, a decline
in    causes a ‘widening’of wage inequality by lowering wm relative to wa (moreover, wm may fall in
absolute terms). In an equilibrium with      su¢ ciently low such that no workers remain in Routine
tasks (wm =wr > 1), further declines in   unambiguously bene…t both High School and College workers
and hence do not augment inequality. (Given the Cobb-Douglas form, both groups bene…t equally, so
this has no e¤ect on wa =wm .)
