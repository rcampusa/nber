Administrative Data Linking and Statistical Power Problems in Randomized Experiments
Sarah Tahamont, Zubin Jelveh, Aaron Chalfin, Shi Yan, and Benjamin Hansen
NBER Working Paper No. 25657
March 2019, Revised November 2019
JEL No. C1,C12,K42

                                          ABSTRACT

Objective:
The increasing availability of large administrative datasets has led to a particularly exciting
innovation in criminal justice research, that of the “low-cost” randomized trial in which
administrative data are used to measure outcomes in lieu of costly primary data collection. In this
paper, we point out that randomized experiments that make use of administrative data have an
unfortunate consequence: the destruction of statistical power. Linking data from an experimental
intervention to administrative records that track outcomes of interest typically requires matching
datasets without a common unique identifier. In order to minimize mistaken linkages, researchers
will often use “exact matching” (retaining an individual only if all their demographic variables
match exactly in two or more datasets) in order to ensure that speculative matches do not lead to
errors in an analytic dataset.

Methods:
In this paper, we derive an analytic result for the consequences of linking errors on statistical
power and show how the problem varies across different combinations of relevant inputs,
including the matching error rate, the outcome density and the sample size.

Results:
We show that this seemingly conservative approach leads to underpowered experiments and
potentially to the failure of entire experimental literatures. For marginally powered studies, which
are common in empirical social science, exact matching is particularly problematic.

Conclusions:
We conclude on an optimistic note by showing that simple machine learning-based probabilistic
matching algorithms allow criminal justice researchers to recover a considerable share of the
statistical power that is lost to errors in data linking.

1       Introduction

Despite several important limitations, experimental evidence continues to serve as the gold
— or at the very least the bronze (Berk, 2005) — standard on the evidentiary hierarchy
in the social and behavioral sciences (Banerjee and Duflo, 2009; Imbens, 2010; Weisburd,
2010).1 The fact that random assignment creates comparable treatment and control groups
and gives us insight into the counterfactual world is a feature that has been appreciated
since at least the 18th century (Dunn, 1997) but which was popularized in the early 20th
century by the work of Jerzy Neyman and R.A. Fisher (Fisher, 1936; Splawa-Neyman et al.,
1923). Recently, the foundational importance of experiments has been bolstered by concerns
about the limitations of observational research, with an array of evidence from econometrics
and statistics suggesting that experimental treatment effects cannot be reliably recovered
using some of the most ubiquitous types of observational research designs (LaLonde, 1986;
Smith and Todd, 2001, 2005; Rubin, 2008; Gordon et al., 2019) even when analysts have
a rich set of covariates upon which to condition (DiNardo and Pischke, 1997; Arceneaux
et al., 2010). Reflecting these concerns, Weisburd (2010) has, channeling a sentiment found
in McCord (2003) suggested that “whenever possible, evaluation studies should employ
random assignment.”
    Within criminology, a number of reviews by Farrington and colleagues (Farrington,
1983, 2003; Farrington and Welsh, 2006) and Lum and Mazerolle (2014) among others
have shown a general growth in experimental research since the 1950s. Over the last two
decades, an appreciation for the importance of randomization has led to the formation of
the Campbell Collaboration, the Academy of Experimental Criminology and ultimately
the creation of the Journal of Experimental Criminology, a peer-reviewed journal dedicated
to the publication of experimental evidence.2 Indeed, an appreciation for the power of
randomization to generate valid causal estimates has inspired a host of highly influential

      For important reviews of the limitations of experimental research especially with respect to external
validity, see Berk (2005); Deaton (2010); Heckman and Smith (1995) and Sampson (2010). Also see Nagin
and Sampson (2019) for a wonderfully nuanced and equally important discussion of the inherent challenges
in identifying a policy-relevant counterfactual in an experimental design. For reviews of the ethical and
legal considerations that are attendant in randomized experiments, we refer readers to thoughtful reviews
by Boruch et al. (2000) and Weisburd (2003).
    2
      As recently as the mid-1990s, Sherman et al. (1997) noted that experimental evidence accounted for only
a small share of the evidence base in empirical criminal justice research. The appreciation for experimental
evidence has likewise led to a prioritization for randomization among key funders of empirical research in
criminology including the National Institute of Justice and Arnold Ventures (formerly known as the Laura
and John Arnold Foundation).


                                            1
randomized experiments in areas such as hot spots policing (Sherman and Weisburd, 1995;
Braga et al., 1999; Braga and Bond, 2008), physical and social disorder reduction (Keizer
et al., 2008; Branas et al., 2018; Ridgeway et al., 2019) and in evaluating social programs
in domains such as youth delinquency (Powers and Witmer, 1951; Tremblay et al., 2003;
Petrosino et al., 2003; Heller, 2014; Heller et al., 2017), prisoner re-entry (Duwe, 2012, 2014;
Farabee et al., 2014; Cook et al., 2015), drug courts (Gottfredson et al., 2006; MacDonald
et al., 2007; Rossman et al., 2011) and domestic violence (Sherman and Berk, 1984; Sherman
et al., 1992; Davis and Taylor, 1997), among others.
    A central challenge to planning and successfully carrying out a randomized experiment
is statistical power (Britt and Weisburd, 2010). Primary data collection is a costly endeavor
and, as such, resource constraints typically limit the size of experiments and, as a result, the
amount of data that are available to analyze. Since the power to detect a given treatment
effect is, in principle, a function of the sample size, it is not uncommon for randomized
experiments to be marginally- or even under-powered (Moher et al., 1994; Sedlmeier and
Gigerenzer, 1989; Sherman, 2007).3 Indeed, a common rule of thumb when planning an
experiment is to fix statistical power at 80 percent, meaning that a researcher is willing
to make a Type II error and fail to detect a real treatment effect 20 percent of the time
(Cohen, 1992).
    Given the the time and risk involved in planning an experiment, Type II errors tend
to be extremely costly for researchers as well as partners in the policy world. Moreover,
since null findings may be less likely to be published (Braga and Apel, 2016; Gerber and
Malhotra, 2008; Rothstein, 2008), Type II errors can have dire consequences not only for
individual papers but also for the entire research literature. Indeed this form of publication
bias (filing papers in the desk drawer) is thought to have contributed to the “replication
crisis” in empirical social science (Camerer et al., 2016; Gilbert et al., 2016; Pridemore
et al., 2018; Vivalt, 2017).4 Since experimental evaluations inform the evidence base about
the effectiveness of programs and interventions, the impact of Type II errors can extend
beyond the ivory tower, jeopardizing the viability of a diverse set of effective interventions

    3
       Statistical power is, in large part a function of the available sample size but also depends on the amount
of variation in the treatment and outcome variables. As was noted by Weisburd et al. (1993) some twenty-
five years ago and noted recently by Nelson et al. (2015), small N studies are not necessarily more poorly
powered than larger N studies empirically though, other things equal, this will be the case.
     4
       Concerns over the misuse of researcher degrees of freedom and specification searching have likewise
spurred recommendations which include the use of very small α levels (Benjamin et al., 2018), which increases
the probability of Type II errors even more.


                                              2
(Doleac et al., 2019). Therefore, it is critical to preserve statistical power to the greatest
extent possible.
    One of the more exciting recent developments in empirical social science research is
the increasing availability of large administrative databases, often referred to colloquially
as “big data” (Lane, 2018; Lynch, 2018; O’Brien and Sampson, 2015; Smith et al., 2017)
With respect to experimental research, big data has enabled a new (and oncoming) wave
of “low-cost randomized trials,” in which observations from an experimental intervention
are linked to administrative data in order to minimize the need for costly primary data
collection and keep the costs of experimentation tolerably low.5
    Administrative data linking has been a feature of a number of recent and highly influen-
tial empirical criminology and criminal justice papers. Indeed administrative data linking is
a mainstay of any experimental — or quasi-experimental — research that studies criminal
justice contact as an outcome including recent research on the effects of pre-trial deten-
tion (Mueller-Smith, 2016; Dobbie et al., 2018), the deterrent effects of sanctions (Hansen,
2015; Lattimore et al., 2016), life-course criminology studies (Farrington, 2006; Liberman
et al., 2014; Loeffler, 2013; Sampson and Laub, 2003; Stewart et al., 2015; Van Schellen
et al., 2012), research on the perpetrator-victim relationship (Broidy et al., 2006), prisoner
re-entry programs (Cook et al., 2015; Duwe, 2012, 2014; Farabee et al., 2014) and inter-
ventions that are designed to affect the behavior of delinquent or at-risk youth (Tremblay
et al., 2003; Petrosino et al., 2003; Heller, 2014; Heller et al., 2017). Administrative data
linking is particularly valuable when researchers are interested in studying the impact of a
program on multiple domains — each of which draw on data from different administrative
agencies. For example, data linking is used by Heller et al. (2017) and Heller (2014) to link
experimental subjects across multiple domains — in order to study the effects of the exper-
imental intervention on both criminal justice contacts and education outcomes. Similarly,
Gelber et al. (2016) use administrative data linking to jointly study the impact of sum-
mer employment for youth on imprisonment as well as mortality outcomes. Administrative
data linking is likewise an issue that looms large in studying the intergenerational effects of
delinquency from parents to children (Chalfin and Deza, 2017; Comfort et al., 2011; Dobbie

    5
     A second advantage of administrative data is that it avoids the inherent challenges involved in working
with self reported data (Bertrand and Mullainathan, 2001), which is not to minimize the fact that there
are certainly trade-offs to using administrative data relative to self-reports. For empirical evaluations of the
validity of self-reported data see: Lauritsen (1999), Morris and Slocum (2010) and Roberts and Wells (2010)
among others.

et al., 2018; Hjalmarsson and Lindquist, 2012; Laub and Sampson, 1988; Wildeman and
Andersen, 2017).
    In this paper, we point out that linking a sample of interest to administrative data,
which greatly reduces the cost of experimentation by relying on existing data sources in
lieu of primary data collection can have an unfortunate consequence: the destruction of
statistical power. Most administrative datasets are not designed to be linked to others,
and therefore do not have a common and reliable identifier. Likewise, many individual-level
identifiers, such as fingerprints in law enforcement or patient identifiers in hospitals, are
internal, system-specific and, in many cases, unknown to outside researchers and agencies.
Even when unique identifiers are, in principle, available across systems (e.g. a social security
number) they can have reliability problems due to errors in recording or non-reporting
(Curb et al., 1985; Sampson and Laub, 2003).6 As a consequence, researchers often have to
link individuals across datasets in the absence of a unique identifier (Hovde Lyngstad and
Skardhamar, 2011; Taxman and Caudy, 2015). In the vast majority of cases, researchers
have to try to link individuals using their demographic characteristics, such as name, date
of birth, race, gender, and address. This process is often difficult and fraught with error;
particularly with respect to criminal justice, because the nature of the data makes them
especially susceptible to recording errors (Ferrante, 1993; Geerken, 1994; Orchowsky and
Iwama, 2009). In this paper, we show that data linking errors can have dire consequences
for statistical power and the validity of downstream estimates from analyses from linked
data, because bad data linkages introduce noise that obscures the relationship between the
outcome variable and the treatment variable (Enamorado et al., 2019). In the presence of
noisy data linking, even a perfectly-executed randomized controlled trial will fail to deliver
an unbiased estimate of the effectiveness of an intervention.
    In this paper, we show analytically that linking errors will attenuate estimates of the
treatment effect in a randomized experiment — or, notably, in a quasi-experiment of equiv-
alent sample size. Critically though, while attenuation is an unwanted outcome, the most
insidious result of linking errors are the effects on ex-ante statistical power and, therefore,
on a researcher’s ability to detect a true treatment effect when one exists (Type II errors).
While modest linking errors will lead to modest attenuation, given that few experiments
     6
       When a unique identifier is available in all of the datasets that require linking and the data are of
sufficient quality, linking can, in some cases, be fairly trivial. These types of cross-system unique identifiers
are frequently available in Scandinavian countries (e.g. Black et al., 2005; Dahl et al., 2014; Hovde Lyngstad
and Skardhamar, 2011; Wildeman and Andersen, 2017) and occationally in South America.


                                              4
are overly well-powered, even small amounts of linking error can have large effects on Type
II error rates.
    Linking errors are particularly problematic for rare outcomes (e.g. Gelber et al., 2016)
and small sample sizes (e.g. Fischbacher et al., 2001), both of which are common and even
typical in randomized experiments. Researchers who conduct ex-ante power analyses, and
subsequently link to administrative data to detect the presence of their outcome of interest,
will therefore overestimate their power to detect effects, often by a considerable margin. A
particularly salient example of this problem can be found in a replication paper by Doleac
et al. (2019) who note that a large number of experiments in the area of prisoner re-entry
programs are underpowered, thus leading to lost opportunities as well as to potentially mis-
leading conclusions about the viability of interventions for formerly-incarcerated or justice
involved individuals.
    How can this destructive problem be abated? Naturally, the solution lies in minimiz-
ing linking errors. Despite the existence of a number of proposed data linking methods
(Enamorado et al., 2019; Lahiri and Larsen, 2005; Scheuren and Winkler, 1993, 1997),
we observe that researchers in practice often use “exact matching” criteria when linking
datasets, considering an individual to be a match only if his or her demographic identifiers
(name and date of birth, etc.) match exactly across datasets (e.g., Cesarini et al., 2016;
Hill, 2017; Khwaja and Mian, 2005; Mueller-Smith, 2016). The rationale for researchers to
impose such a stringent linking criterion is to minimize false positive links and to ensure
that speculative links do not lead to errors in the analytic data set. This popular approach
to administrative data linking is therefore regarded as conservative, as it keeps the analytic
data as “pure” as possible.7 Although such an argument appears logical at first glance,
stringent character match requirements will, by definition, increase false negative link rates
(Enamorado et al., 2019). Therefore, “exact matching” can lead to a higher total error
rate—the sum of false positive and false negative links—and, critically, to a reduction in
statistical power.
    The paper proceeds as follows. First, we briefly review the literature on linking errors in


   7
     A large literature considers the implications that measurement error can have for econometric models
but, to our knowledge, there is considerably less formal guidance with respect to how bad data linking can
confound randomized experiments. It is also worth noting that when scholars need to link datasets without
a common identifier there is no “ground truth” to assess the quality of the match. Likewise, there is often
no prior about what the match rate should be, rendering it difficult to diagnose whether the matching
procedure employed is sufficient or not.


                                           5
empirical social science. Next, we derive an analytic result for the consequences of linking
error on treatment effect estimation and show that the sum of false positive and false
negative error rates is what matters, not either of these error rates in isolation. We then
present numerical estimates to demonstrate how the attenuation of treatment effects and
the corresponding erosion of statistical power varies across different combinations of relevant
inputs including the 1) the sum of false positive and false negative error rates, 2) the outcome
density, and 3) the sample size. We proceed with an empirical example that shows the
difference between exact matching strategies and data linking using probabilistic matching
algorithms augmented by machine learning.
   Our results suggest that the problem of bad data linkage is not trivial in many empirical
applications. Even in a relatively large experiment (n = 750) with a relatively dense outcome
(Ȳ = 0.5), the Type II error rate — the failure to detect a true effect of an experimental
intervention — would be twice as high (0.4 instead of 0.2) in the presence of a realistic
amount of linking error. In other words, researchers who believe that they will fail to
detect a false null hypothesis only 20 percent of the time will, in fact, fail to detect it 40
percent of the time. Given the generally high costs of experimentation, a Type II error
rate of this magnitude is a clear and present danger to the feasibility of a great deal of
experimental investigations, because the beneficial effects of promising interventions may
go undetected. Not limited to randomized experiments, these results apply just as strongly
for quasi-experimental research designs which seek to mimic randomization by using a
natural experiment or a control function approach.
   That said, we conclude on an optimistic note, observing that researchers can mitigate
the consequences of linking errors in most cases using a simple machine-based probabilistic
linking algorithm — including those that are available in most commercial software pack-
ages. In a majority of applications, more than half of linking errors introduced by using
exact matching can be “overturned” with the use of a simple probabilistic linking algorithm,
thus preserving a large share of statistical power that is lost due to data linking issues and
thus maintaining the long-term viability of experimental and quasi-experimental evidence
that capitalize on administrative data linking.

2       Motivation and Context

2.1     Methodological Context for Administrative Data Linking

In this section, we provide a high-level conceptual overview of the essentials of record linking
in social sciences. Our purpose is not to recommend the best algorithm or package, though
we note that recent scholarship offers helpful recommendations (Enamorado et al., 2019;
Karr et al., 2019). Scholarly consideration of the implications of data linking dates back to
the early days of computerized record linkage itself (Fellegi and Sunter, 1969; Neter et al.,
1965; Newcombe et al., 1959). Researchers from multiple disciplines have recognized that
linking errors have implications for subsequent analyses (Berent et al., 2016; Campbell,
2009; Khwaja and Mian, 2005; Lahiri and Larsen, 2005; Neter et al., 1965; Scheuren and
Winkler, 1993, 1997). At the inception of computerized data linkage, the key conclusion
from Neter and colleagues was that “the consequences of even small mismatch rates can
be considerable” (Neter et al., 1965, p. 1021). Moreover, researchers have recognized that
linking errors, as a special case of classical measurement error, can lead to downward bias in
effect size estimates (Aigner, 1973; Campbell, 2009; Khwaja and Mian, 2005). For example,
Khwaja and Mian (2005, p. 1379, emphasis original) cautioned the readers that “when
[their] algorithm matches a firm to a politician, but the match is incorrect ... estimates
of political corruption are likely to be underestimates of the true effect.” However, until
recently, scholars working with empirical applications have devoted relatively little attention
to describing the techniques used to link data, to evaluating the quality of the matches in
linked data, or to determining how their study conclusions might have varied based on the
use of different data linking strategies.
    Record linking refers broadly to the practice of identifying records from different datasets
that correspond to the same individual.8 In some circumstances, linkages can be generated
using biometric indicators, such as fingerprints or fingerprint-associated ID numbers (see
Freudenberg et al., 1998; Taxman and Caudy, 2015).9 However, in the vast majority of
cases, databases to which experimental subjects are matched often do not share a unique
identifier. As a result, researchers have to rely on available demographic information, such

    8
      For narrative clarity, we limit our discussion to the linking of data containing records on persons. This
discussion would extend to groups or firms, but the characteristics available for linking might be different.
    9
      We acknowledge that biometric data are susceptible to misidentification as well. However, the literature
generally considers linking using biometric indicators as more accurate than the text-based demographic
identifiers that we discuss below (Watson et al., 2014).


                                             7
as name (including first and last names, and sometimes a middle name or middle initial),
date of birth, social security number, gender, race, and ethnicity. The linking enterprise is
necessarily imperfect for a variety of reasons, including typographical errors, nicknames,
changes in names, the commonness of certain names, geographic mobility and sometimes
due to the intentional provision of inaccurate information (Christen, 2012; Harron et al.,
2017).
    There are two primary approaches to automated record linkage (Enamorado et al., 2019;
Harron et al., 2017; Winkler, 2006). The first, deterministic matching, refers to the practice
of developing a set of criteria a priori, and considering two records to be a match if and
only if the set criteria are met. The strictest approach of this kind is “exact matching,”
under which a link is recognized only if all variables used are identical across the two records
(which often includes letter-to-letter matches of names). Less stringent deterministic linking
rules require only a subset of letters or digits to match, such as the first three letters of
names, or the month and date digits of dates of birth.
    A second approach is probabilistic linking. Instead of directly defining deterministic rules
manually which lead to binary “link/no link” determinations, probabilistic linking seeks to
estimate the probability that two records belong to the same individual (sometimes known
as “fuzzy linking,” Bowers and Johnson, 2005; Sampson and Winter, 2018).10 The canonical
approach to probabilistic linking — developed by Newcombe et al. (1959) and formalized
by Fellegi and Sunter (1969) — relies on an underlying theoretical model to generate the
probability of observing the set of paired characteristics given that two records refer to
the same person (and vice versa).11 The ratio of these two probabilities can then be used
to define whether a pair of records is a link, nonlink, or requires further manual review.
In general, comparisons of matching algorithms have found that probabilistic matching
algorithms have higher overall accuracy rates than deterministic rules (Campbell, 2009;
Campbell et al., 2008; Gomatam et al., 2002; Tromp et al., 2011), or, at a minimum, have
similar accuracy rates to deterministic rules (Clark and Hahn, 1995).
    There are two types of linking errors: 1) false positives (i.e., treating records as the same

   10
      Operationally, however, the end result of most probabilistic linking processes requires the imposition
of a deterministic threshold to define potential pairs as links, non-links or, in some cases, potential links.
   11
      In the Fellegi-Sunter framework, pairs of records are compared across their identifying characteristics
(name, date of birth, gender, etc) and a comparison vector is computed which encodes whether, for example,
the names in the two records are the same, the name in one record is missing, the date of births are the
same, and so on. Other extensions to this framework include string distance calculations between names
(e.g. levenshtein, jarowinkler, etc.) or phonetic computation (e.g., Soundex, Double Metaphone, etc.).


                                             8
person when they actually belong to different people) and 2) false negatives (i.e., treating
records as different people when they actually belong to the same person). Not surprisingly,
there is an inherent trade-off between false positives and false negatives (Christen and
Goiser, 2007; Zingmond et al., 2004; Moore et al., 2014): raising the stringency of the
criteria used to delineate a link will reduce the number of false positive links at the expense
of increasing the number of false negative links (and vice versa with less stringent criteria).
    Perhaps the sole existing measure of the quality of a data linking procedure is the link
rate, commonly referred to as the match rate, which we define here as the percentage of
records which are matched after the linking process. Link rates are most relevant when there
is a prior expectation of the proportion of the records that should be linked. In general,
higher link rates are seen as indicating higher quality matches (Bailey et al., 2017; Ferrante,
1993), especially when the expectation is that all records in one datset should be linked to
records in another dataset.


2.2     Current Setup

Linking errors can take on many forms depending on the record linkage problem at hand.
In this paper, we study a common but underexplored scenario: when the goal is to estimate
the effect of an intervention by linking datasets to measure outcomes such as whether an
individual was arrested, failed to graduate high school, or visited an emergency room.12 For
ease of exposition, we concentrate on the scenario where the outcome variable is binary.
Our findings are particularly relevant to criminal justice contacts, they also apply to a
vast array of settings throughout the social sciences because binary outcomes are extremely
common.13 We further note that in the context of planning for a randomized experiment,
conducting pre-hoc power analyses on a binary dependent variable is common practice as,
in the absence of available microdata upon which statistical power can be simulated, the
variance of a binary variable can be recovered simply by knowing the mean of the variable.

   12
      In particular, the aim is to estimate the difference, possibly conditioned on covariates, in means between
treatment and control groups in a randomized control trial. In a related paper, Moore et al. (2014) explore
the impact of matching errors on the relative risk ratio. Matching errors bias these two quantities in different
ways. As we show below, false positive and false negative rates have equal impact on bias in our scenario.
Moore et al. show that false positive rates are more influential on the bias in relative risk ratio estimates.
   13
      Recent specific examples from throughout the social sciences include program participation in Sup-
plemental Nutritional Assistance Program (Courtemanche et al., 2018), employment prevalence measured
through unemployment insurance wage records (Johnston and Mas, forthcoming), injuries measured through
hospitalization data (Powell and Seabury, forthcoming), or financial health measured through bankruptcy
or liens (Dobkin et al., 2018).


                                             9
     Another important feature of our scenario where the linking process determines the
observed value of the outcome is that link rates are no longer informative for assessing
linkage quality. To see why, consider a scenario in which a researcher is interested in eval-
uating whether a job training program for those individuals recently released from prison
reduces the likelihood of an arrest. In constructing an analytic data set, individuals whose
records link to the post-intervention arrest file are considered “arrested” and individuals
whose records do not link to the arrest file are considered “not arrested.” There is no prior
expectation that all individuals will be arrested. Additionally, while a researcher could in
principle use historical statistics on recidivism rates to benchmark the expected link rate,
this would only serve as a rough guide since the goal of the experiment is detect changes
in that rate. Not limited to arrest, this issue is applicable to any context in which the goal
of the linking process is to determine the presence of an outcome and there is no prior pre-
diction for how many records should match, or that changes relative to the prior prediction
are the quantity of interest. These points distinguish this linking case from other kinds of
longitudinal record linking cases (Abramitzky et al., 2019; Bailey et al., 2017; Feigenbaum,
2016) but, to our knowledge, this distinction has not been discussed in the prior literature
on administrative data linking.


3        Derivation of Estimated Treatment Effects, Standard Er-
         rors and Statistical Power

In this section we derive the effects of matching errors on the estimated treatment effect,
τ̂ , as well as its standard error, se(τ̂ ), in a randomized experiment with a binary treatment
condition. For the sake of simplicity, we assume, for now, that the effect of treatment is
homogeneous though all subsequent results will hold under heterogeneous treatment effects,
so long as false linkage rates and treatment effects do not both vary across subgroups in
the data.14 The results derived in this section will also hold if false linkage rates vary by
sub-group under homogeneous treatment effects. While there is quite a bit of technical
detail in this section, we hope the benefit of including these details is the satisfaction that
comes from a closed form analytic solution. We show that the effects of linking errors on

    14
    One scenario where this assumption would not hold is if both linking errors and treatment effects vary
by one or more subgroups. In the event that both treatment effects and false linkage rates both vary by
subgroup, the solution is slightly more complex and is explored in Appendix E.


                                          10
both quantities have a closed form solution. The estimated τ̂ will be attenuated and the
degree of attenuation will be proportional to the sum of the false positive and false negative
linking error rates. The effect of linking errors on se(τ̂ ) is more complicated and may result
in an increase or decrease in the estimate of the standard error relative to the no linking
error scenario. In general, relative to the effect on coefficient estimates, standard errors
are not very sensitive to linking errors and, as a result, linking errors will always lead to
a higher rate of failing to reject a false null hypothesis, and in so doing, lead to a higher
likelihood of failing to detect a true treatment effect. As we show, linking errors can be very
detrimental to statistical power in all but the largest randomized experiments. It is worth
noting that we focus on experiments here, not because they are the only design affected
by linking errors, but because we are able to analytically demonstrate the consequences of
linking error in the unconfounded case. This is not to suggest that linking errors will not
have ramifications for analyses which are not cleanly identified, just that the precise form
of those ramifications is currently unknown.


3.1   Estimated Treatment Effect

We begin by showing that, in a randomized experiment, linking errors lead to attenuated
estimates of an average causal effect in absolute terms. Consider a randomized control trial
with a study sample of n units of which a fraction, p, are assigned to treatment and the
remaining (1 − p) are assigned to a control condition. Information on this experimental
sample is stored in a dataset, E. We are interested in estimating the average treatment
effect of our intervention on an outcome, y. In this case, the outcome measure is stored in
an administrative dataset, D, where the number of individuals in D is much larger than n.
In order to estimate the average treatment effect, we need to match our experimental sample
to the outcomes stored in administrative dataset. If a record in E links to a record in D
then observed y = 1 and otherwise observed y = 0. The realized outcome for an individual
in E is given by the potential outcomes corresponding to the treatment condition:
                                          
                                           y (0) if T = 0,
                                             i        i
                                 yi (Ti )                                                  (1)
                                           y (1) if T = 1
                                             i        i




                                      11
As such, the average treatment effect of the intervention, τ can be computed as:


              τ = E[yi (1) − yi (0)] = P (yi = 1|Ti = 1) − P (yi = 1|Ti = 0)                (2)


where T is a treatment indicator. The process of linking the experimental data to the
outcome data can lead to two types of errors:

   • False positive link (F P ): An instance in which an individual i has the true outcome
      yi∗ = 0, but was incorrectly linked to some other individual’s record in D with yj∗ = 1
      where i 6= j, such that in this case, the observed value of y after the linking process
      is equal to 1.

   • False negative link (F N ): An instance in which an individual i has the true outcome
      yi∗ = 1, but was not linked to a record in D. In this case, the observed value after the
      linking process is y = 0.

   It is important to note that since we are trying to match observations in E to a given
outcome in D, linking errors are only driven by whether the correct outcome is observed,
and not that the link refers to the same person in both datasets. Specifically, this means
that it would not be considered an error with respect to measuring the outcome if a record
in E is linked to the wrong person in D, provided the linked record had the same outcome
value as the true match. When records are matched to erroneous outcomes this will lead to
the following biased estimate of τ :


                        τ̂ = P (yi = 1|Ti = 1) − P (yi = 1|Ti = 0)                          (3)


To further characterize the nature of the bias in τ we introduce the following four definitions:

   • True Positive Rate (T P R): P (yi = 1|yi∗ = 1), or the probability that an individual
      with outcome y = 1 will be linked to an individual in D yielding an observed outcome
      y ∗ = y = 1.

   • True Negative Rate (T N R): P (yi = 0|yi∗ = 0), or the probability that an individual
      with outcome y = 0 will not be linked to an individual in D yielding an observed
      outcome y ∗ = y = 0.



                                       12
   • False Negative Rate (F N R): P (yi = 0|yi∗ = 1), or the probability that an individual
      with outcome y ∗ = 1 will not be linked to an individual in D, yielding an observed
      outcome y ∗ 6= y. F N R is equivalent to 1 - T P R.

   • False Positive Rate (F P R): P (yi = 1|yi∗ = 0), or the probability that an individual
      with outcome y ∗ = 0 will be incorrectly linked to an individual in D, resulting in an
      observed outcome y ∗ 6= y. F P R is equivalent to 1 - T N R.

   Then the observed, and potentially biased, treatment effect can be written as:

              τ̂ = P (yi = 1|Ti = 1) − P (yi = 1|Ti = 0)
                    X                                  X
                 =        P (yi = 1, yi∗ = j|Ti = 1) −   P (yi = 1, yi∗ = j|Ti = 0)
                    j∈{0,1}                                    j∈{0,1}
                     X
                =             P (yi =   1|yi∗   = j, Ti = 1)P (yi∗ = j|Ti = 1)
                    j∈{0,1}
                     X
                −             P (yi = 1|yi∗ = j, Ti = 0)P (yi∗ = j|Ti = 0)
                    j∈{0,1}

                = T P RT P (yi∗ = 1|Ti = 1) − T P RC P (yi∗ = 1|Ti = 0)

                + F P RT P (yi∗ = 0|Ti = 1) − F P RC P (yi∗ = 0|Ti = 0)                     (4)


T P RT and T P RC are the true positive rates for the treatment and control groups, respec-
tively. Similarly, the false positive rate for the treatment and control groups are F P RT
and F P RC . In the case where linking error rates are equivalent for both treatment and
control groups, as is expected under random assignment, we let T P RT = T P RC and
F P RT = F P RC . We can then re-write the expression more compactly:

                          τ̂ = T P R [P (yi∗ = 1|Ti = 1) − P (yi∗ = 1|Ti = 0)]

                               + F P R [P (yi∗ = 0|Ti = 1) − P (yi∗ = 0|Ti = 0)]            (5)


which can, in turn, be written as:

                          τ̂ = T P R [P (yi∗ = 1|Ti = 1) − P (yi∗ = 1|Ti = 0)]

                               − F P R [P (yi∗ = 1|Ti = 1) − P (yi∗ = 1|Ti = 0)]            (6)


The bracketed term in (6) is simply τ , the true treatment effect, which leads to the following
final form in the case of equivalent matching error across treatment and control:


                                          τ̂ = (T P R − F P R) τ                           (7)

                                                 13
We note that if the error rates were known, the true treatment effect could be recaptured:

                                                 τ̂
                                       τ=                                                             (8)
                                             TPR − FPR

Non-zero linking error will always attenuate the absolute value of the true treatment effect.15
Finally, we can re-write the denominator as 1 − (F N R + F P R) and generate two critical
insights. First, bias will be proportional to the total matching error rate. The finding that the
sum of false positive and false negative error rates drives the bias is particularly important
given the tendency toward “exact matching,” which is thought to minimize error, but, in
fact, reduces the number of false positive links while increasing the number of false negative
links. Second, under reasonable assumptions on the magnitude of the error rates (i.e. when
F N R + F P R < 1), τ̂ will be attenuated towards zero — that is, the estimated treatment
effect will be too small.


3.2    Estimated Standard Errors

In Section 3.1 we showed that linking error leads to an attenuated estimate of the average
treatment effect and we further posited that bias introduced by linking errors will reduce
statistical power. However, in order to draw conclusions about the effect of linking errors
on statistical power, we must also consider the effect of linking error on estimated standard
errors. To see how linking error affects στ , note that the variance of τ is given by:

                                                   1     σ2
                                        στ2 =                                                         (9)
                                                p(1 − p) N

where p is the proportion of the study sample enrolled in treatment, N is the sample size,
and σ 2 is the residual outcome variance from a regression of y on the treatment indicator,
T . Taking the square root of the quantity on the right-hand side of (9) yields the estimated
standard error around τ .
    The only remaining step is to estimate the residual variance. We note that in the case
of linear regression, σ 2 can be defined via the residual sum of squares, and, with a binary
outcome and a binary treatment, results in the following form where yT and yC are the
number of individuals in the experimental group linked to records in the administrative

  15
     If T P R = F P R then the previous equation is undefined and the observed treatment effect will equal
zero, but that situation is unlikely to occur in practice as it implies a random match.

data for the treatment and control group, respectively (see derivation in Appendix B).

                        X
                                      2           yT            yC
                             (yi − ŷi ) = yT 1 −      + yC 1 −                                          (10)

                         i


    While attenuation in the treatment effect depends only on the the sum of false positive
and false negative error rates, linking error affects the standard errors through the control
group mean, the treatment effect, and the distribution of false positive and false negative
links. To see how the distribution of linking error types affects the standard errors, consider
a scenario where there is no treatment effect. When the false positive rate is greater than
the false negative rate, the number of instances where y = 1 will increase and the outcome
density will also increase. Conversely, when the false negative rate is higher the number of
instances where y = 0 will increase and the outcome density will decrease. The outcome
density that maximizes the variance is ȳ = 0.5.16 Whether the standard errors increase or
decrease depends on the extent to which the errors move the outcome density toward or
away from 0.5. For example, if the overall mean is 0.4, but the matching algorithm produces
more false negatives than false positives, then the observed treatment group mean will be
less than 0.4 and the resulting standard error will shrink. The situation is slightly more
complicated when there is a treatment effect, but we show in Appendix C that Equation
10 is maximized when the control group mean plus the treatment effect equal 0.5.
    The interplay between these factors means that there will be scenarios in which matching
error will produce smaller standard errors when compared with the no error case. But in
the next section we show that even in these situations, matching error compromises a
researcher’s ability to detect a true treatment effect.


3.3     Implications for Statistical Power

While attenuation of coefficients can be troublesome, the effect of matching errors on sta-
tistical power is a far greater concern. Due to resource constraints, few randomized experi-
ments are overpowered, so modest matching errors can have an outsize effect on statistical
power.17 We begin by noting that since there is a closed form solution for the effect of
   16
     To see this, consider the scenario where there an equal
                                                            number of individuals in the treatment and
                                                        yC
control groups, then Equation 10 simplifies to 2 yC 1 − NC . It is straightforward to show that this quantity
is maximized when yC = N2C .
   17
      Ioannidis et al. (2017) show that the median statistical power for a large body of studies in economics,
most of them observational, is just 18%.


                                            15
matching errors on the estimated average treatment effect and its standard error, there is
also a closed form solution for the effect of matching errors on statistical power (1 − β). To
see this, consider that, for a given Type I error rate (α) and a standard error around the
average treatment effect, the probability of a Type II error is given by:
                                            "                           #
                                                    −1 α         τh
                                                       
                                     β=Φ −         Φ           −                                          (11)
                                                         2       σ τh

where τh is the hypothesized treatment effect, στh is the standard error, and Φ is the
cumulative distribution function for the normal distribution.18 One minus this quantity is
statistical power. If the following condition holds, then power will always be lower under
matching error:

                                                   τh    τ̂
                                                       >                                                  (12)
                                                   στh   στ̂

Since the true treatment effect will be adjusted according to 1 − (F N R + F P R), Equation
12 can be re-written as:
                                                                
                                     τh       1 − (F N R + F P R) τh
                                          >
                                     σ τh               στ̂
                                                                
                                      στ̂ > 1 − (F N R + F P R) στh


   As we discussed in the previous section, there will be situations in which στ̂ < στh , but
in Appendix D we show that even in these situations the shrinkage in the standard errors is
never enough to offset the consequences of coefficient attenuation, and, therefore, statistical
power always decreases under linking error.
   In the next section we show that even with modest linking errors, there can be large
declines in statistical power. Since, in the context of a randomized experiment, researchers
tend to set 1 − β on the basis of their relative tolerance for the risk of an underpowered
finding, the result is that researchers will undertake randomized experiments that are un-
derpowered relative to their desired power thresholds.




  18
       For smaller samples, Φ would be replaced by the cumulative distribution function for the t distribution.

4         Analytic Results

In order to provide a sense for the degree to which linking errors lead to attenuation in
experimental estimates, incorrect standard errors, and corresponding declines in statistical
power, we compute the Type II error rate over a range of reasonable parameter values.
We focus specifically on the outcome density for the control group ȳC , the hypothesized
treatment effect τh , the sample size N and the linking error rates. Our goal here is to
demonstrate the dynamics of this problem and the contexts in applied research for which
it is likely to be especially pernicious.


4.1        Setup

In order to explore the effect of linking errors under a range of different parameterizations,
using the analytic results in Section 3, we derive closed form solutions for τ , se(τ ) and,
ultimately, the Type II error rate, β, in two potential scenarios: one in which there are no
linking errors and another in which linking errors are present. While it is the sum of false
positive and false negative error rates (FPR+FNR) that dictates the degree of attenuation
in τ̂ , as we have shown, the extent to which linking errors affect the standard error around
this estimate and, relatedly statistical power, will also depend on the ratio of false positive
to false negative match rates. We motivate our setup using a dichotomous outcome, y and
a binary treatment, T where, as before, p is the proportion of the sample that is treated
and the remaining 1 − p are untreated.19

4.2        Main Results

Figure 1 contains four panels that report ex ante power calculations with and without
matching errors, corresponding to four control mean-effect size combinations (ȳ ∗ = 0.3,
0.5 and τh = 15%, 25%) that are typical of power calculations in planning a randomized
experiment. In each panel, the total linking error rate — that is the sum of the false negative
and false positive link rates — is plotted on the X-axis while the Type II error rate (β) is
plotted on the Y -axis. The lines plot Type II error rates for a given sample size, N .


    19
         The computational details of this exercise are described in Appendix A to this paper.


                                              17
   We begin our discussion with Panel (a) which corresponds with ȳ ∗ = 0.5 and τ =
25%, the parameterization which is best powered for a given sample size. Consider, for
example, a very large experiment in which N = 2,000. In such an experiment, a Type II
error will be extraordinarily rare — approximately zero — in the absence of linking errors.
Even when the linking error rate is as high as 30%, the probability of a Type II error will
be approximately 3%, meaning that such an experiment will have a 97% probability of
detecting a treatment effect of 25%. This is sensible as linking errors have little effect on
statistical power when an experiment is extremely overpowered. However, due to resource
constraints, overpowered experiments are rare. A more realistic scenario is an experiment
in which N = 500. This sample size corresponds with the solid, red line in Panel (a). In the
absence of linking errors, this study has a Type II error rate of approximately 20% which
is considered by many researchers to be a reasonable default rule in conducting ex ante
statistical power calculations (Moher et al., 1994). Under even a relatively modest linking
error rate of 10%, Type II error rates rise to approximately 28%; with a 20% linking error
rate, the probability of a Type II error nearly doubles to 39%.
   Another way to understand the impact of linking errors is to consider how much larger
the study would have to be to maintain a given Type II error rate, β. This too can be seen
in Figure 1. Referring to Panel (a), consider a study of size, N = 500 which has a Type II
error rate of approximately 20% in the absence of linking errors but a 38% Type II error
rate under 20% linking error. Here, it would take a 50% increase in the size of the study
(from N = 500 to 750) to return to the desired Type II error rate of 20%. As resource
constraints are often binding, increasing the size of a study by 50% is most often infeasible.
   The effects of linking error on statistical power are even more dramatic with a less dense
outcome and a smaller treatment effect of interest. In Panel (b), ȳ ∗ is fixed at 0.5 but now
we are interested in being able to detect a smaller treatment effect, τ = 15%. Now, even in
the absence of linking error, we will need a larger sample size to detect a treatment effect
of this magnitude (e.g. for N = 500, the Type II error rate at zero linking error is greater
than 60%). Focusing on the sample size (N = 1,500) that roughly yields the default Type
II error rate of 20% in the absence of linking errors. In this case, we see that when the sum
of false positive and false negative errors is at a reasonable level (15%) Type II error rates
will increase by approximately 50%, from 20% to around 30%. We see a similar relationship
when the treatment effect of interest is 25% but the outcome is less dense (Panel c). Finally,


                                     18
we turn to Panel (d) in which we have both a less dense outcome ȳ ∗ = 0.3 and a smaller
treatment effect of interest 15%. Here, even a very large experiment will sometimes fail to
detect a true treatment effect as the Type II error rate for a study of size N = 3,000 is
approximately 25% in the absence of matching errors. In this case, a reasonable matching
error rate of 15%, takes the Type II error rate to 40%.


4.3   Allowing for Covariate Adjustment

The results reported in Section 4.2 presume that researchers do not have access to or,
at least, do not use pre-test covariates in estimating τ̂ . While a healthy debate exists
about the wisdom of controlling for covariates in a finite sample, it is common empirical
practice in analyzing randomized experiments to condition on covariates and estimate an
average treatment effect by regressing y on both T and a vector of covariates, X (Angrist
and Pischke, 2009; Duflo et al., 2007). The wisdom behind controlling for covariates is
straightforward. Given that the treatment is randomized, X will be unrelated to T but
may be helpful in explaining y. The result is that residual variation will shrink and so too
will estimated standard errors. Thus, controlling for covariates will increase a researcher’s
power to detect treatment effects and, in expectation, will not bias the estimated treatment
effect. Given that the primary purpose of controlling for covariates in an experimental setup
is to increase statistical power, a natural question is whether doing so has implications for
the effect of linking errors on statistical power.
   In order to answer this question, we generate a covariate, X, that is correlated with y ∗
but which, by construction, is uncorrelated with T . For simplicity, we generate a dichoto-
mous X which is found in equal proportions in the treatment and control groups (though
all of the analytic results will also hold in the case in which X is continuous). The setup
is the same as before with the exception that we specify an imbalance parameter, r, which
governs the strength of the relationship between y ∗ and X. Specifically, r is difference in
the proportion of the sample for which y ∗ = 1 when X = 0 and when X = 1. In other
words, r represents the amount of imbalance in the outcome density between individuals
who possess characteristic X and those who do not. For example, if ȳ ∗ is 0.5, when r = 0.1,
ȳ ∗ = 0.4 for the X = 1 group and 0.6 for X = 0 group, or vice versa. When r is large, y ∗
and X will be highly correlated and standard errors shrink by a relatively large amount. In
the demonstration below, we fix r =0.1. However, the choice of r does not have a first order


                                      19
effect on the extent to which linking errors lead to Type II errors.20 We present findings
in Figure 2 in which Panels (a)-(d) correspond with the same parameterizations shown in
Figure 1.

                                      [Insert Figure 2 About Here]

Referring to Panel (a) in which ȳ ∗ = 0.5 and τ = 25%, we see that, compared to Figure 1,
the y-intercept has shifted downwards reducing the probability of Type II error when a
covariate is added to the model. Without matching error, a sample of N = 500 yielded a
Type II error rate of approximately 20% in the absence of a covariate, conditioning on a
reasonably predictive covariate reduces the Type II error rate to just over 15%. In the case
of this marginally powered sample (N = 500), a reasonable error rate of 15% doubles the
Type II error. Referring to Panel (b) where the researcher would like to detect a treatment
effect of 15%, we see that the consequences of linking errors continue to be severe in the
presence of a covariate with Type II error rates typically increasing by between 50% and
75% with a relatively modest linking error rate of 15%. The key takeaway is that despite
the statistical power gains from covariate adjustment, linking error remains a concern for
experiments with marginally palatable Type II error rates.


5     Empirical Example

Having established that matching errors can lead to a considerable number of Type II errors
in empirical applications, we next consider how to mitigate this problem. In Section 3,
we established that it is the sum of false positive and false negative error rates (rather
than either the false positive or false negative match rates individually) that controls the
degree of attenuation of parameter estimates and therefore, statistical power. While exact
matching will reduce the number of false positive links, it will, in general, not minimize
the sum of false positive and false negative error rates since the number of false negative
links grows because of the stringency of the matching criteria. There is, therefore, promise
    20
       The parameter r captures the strength of the relationship between X and y ∗ . Therefore, as r increases in
magnitude, statistical power increases, both in the absence and the presence of matching errors. However, the
relative gain statistical power is slightly larger when we do not condition on X. Across the parameterizations
we examine, in the absence of a covariate, the average loss of power under matching errors is 8.4%. When r
= 0.1, the loss of power is 8.8% when X is conditioned on. When r = 0.3, the average loss of power under
matching errors is 11.9% when X is conditioned on. Hence while a larger r is uniformly power enhancing, it
does mean that controlling for a covariate will be slightly less helpful in maximizing statistical power than
it otherwise would be.

in testing the performance of more flexible strategies as an alternative to exact matching.
These alternative strategies allow for linkages between records that have discrepancies in
demographic attributes, a common feature of real world data. Even though allowing records
to link that do not match exactly is likely to increase false positives, we show below in our
empirical example that the reduction in false negatives links reduces the false negative rate
by a much larger amount than the new erroneous links increase the false positive rate.
Indeed, in most cases below the increase in the false positive rate is negligible.21
    In order to explore the potential gains from probabilistic matching with machine learn-
ing, we need an empirical example. The reason for this is that while we can solve for the
bias that accrues from a given error rate, sample size and effect size, the extent to which
we can reduce bias via a given matching strategy requires empirical data — names, dates
of birth and addresses, etc. which can be used to generate candidate matches.


5.1     Empirical Simulation

For this study we use identified administrative records on 3 million charges filed in Oregon
courts during the 1990-2012 window, maintained in the Oregon Judicial Information Net-
work (OJIN). These data have been used previously to show how legal access to alcohol
affects criminality. Hansen and Waddell (2018) measured recidivism by recording whether
individuals appeared in a dataset multiple times using exact matching. The individual
records in the OJIN data contain the following relevant variables: name, date of birth, race,
incident date, and a unique identification number that links the same individuals across
rows in the dataset.22
    In order to simulate the linking scenario described above, we first randomly sample

   21
       The probabilistic matching approaches we deploy in this section also take advantage of the latest ad-
vancements in the field of machine learning for two primary reasons. First, administrative datasets often
span hundreds of thousands and often millions of records. Probabilistic techniques involve computing sim-
ilarity metrics across a number of identifying characteristics such as name and date of birth. It becomes
prohibitively, computationally expensive to perform these calculations for each potential record pair as the
administrative dataset size grows. Ideally, we would only perform these computations for records with high
prior probability of referring to the same person. Techniques for detecting approximate nearest neighbors
(Sadosky et al., 2015) allow for fast detection of likely matches that drastically reduce the number of com-
parisons that need to be made in the linking process. Second, the adaptivity of machine learning models
for learning non-linear functions and the practice of assessing performance on out-of-sample data lead to
predictive accuracy that outperforms linear models such as logistic regression.
    22
       There are situations where the two rows in the dataset will match on all relevant variables save for the
unique identifier. As it is ambiguous whether these rows refer to different individuals or if there is an error
in the unique identifier, we drop these records from the empirical simulation. This reduces the number of
records to 2.6 million.


                                            21
80% of the data to treat as the dataset from which we will simulate various administrative
datasets, which we refer to as D. The remaining 20% will serve as the dataset from which
we will sample various experimental datasets, which we refer to as E. While D is at the
record level, meaning a person can appear multiple times, in our simulations we convert E
to be at the person level.
   While there a number of factors which dictate how well any particular matching strategy
performs, in our simulation we focus on the most common in the literature by constructing
different versions of D and E according to the following:

   • Size of the administrative data set: As the number of records in a data set grows,
     the number of ways in which a typographic error can be introduced can also grow. The
     end result is that an algorithm will need to learn more patterns that distinguish true
     positive from true negative links. (Johndrow et al., 2018). We consider administrative
     data sets of 10,000, 100,000 and 1,000,000 records.

   • Size of the experiment: The size of the experiment is crucial to understanding
     the effect of linking errors on subsequent analyses. To explore variations in statistical
     power, we construct experimental data sets of the following sizes: 500, 750, 1,000,
     2,000, and 3,000 individual observations.

   • Share of true matches containing typographic errors: Similarly, the number
     of true matches which contain typographic errors can increase the number of patterns
     that must be learned by a matching algorithm. It is clear that an exact match strategy
     will perform worse when there are fewer exact matches to be found. We vary the share
     of true matches that are not exact matches between 10% and 40% in 10% increments.

   • Overlap between data sets: A small overlap between data sets being linked, which
     in our scenario would correspond to a low base rate for the outcome, can lead to poor
     results in the Fellegi-Sunter framework, which is the seminal model for probabilistic
     record linkage (Yancey, 2004). In order to account for variations in the proportion of
     true matches to be found in the administrative data set we set the share of E that
     exists in the administrative data to be between 10% and 50% at 10% intervals.

   • Presence of ground truth labels: The standard approach to implementing the
     Fellegi-Sunter model for linking does not require information on whether two records


                                     22
        actually refer to the same person, or what we will refer to as ground truth data.
        Prior work in record-linkage has demonstrated the improved performance of record
        linkage when this data is available (Winkler, 2002). With respect to incorporating
        ground truth information, we deploy two types of modeling approaches. Note that the
        Fellegi-Sunter model does not rely on human labeling of data, an approach referred
        to as unsupervised learning. A recent augmentation of this unsupervised approach in
        probabilistic linking is the use of active learning (Enamorado, 2018; Bilenko, 2004).
        With this approach, the linking algorithm will identify a small number of hard to
        adjudicate cases and query a human reviewer to provide a match status. By incor-
        porating just a small number of manually labeled data in this manner, the learning
        algorithm can greatly reduce matching error (Sariyar et al., 2012). In the simula-
        tions here, we explore the performance of active learning with the dedupe library for
        the Python programming language.23 To do so, we use the RecordLink functionality
        of Dedupe, which means that the data used to train the underlying model is from
        both the experimental an administrative data set.24 Another approach we explore in
        this paper is supervised learning, or the use of large quantities of ground truth data
        (Price et al., 2019). Our algorithm works by identifying instances in the training data
        where two records are known to either refer to, or not refer to, the same person. We
        then compute similarity measures between these known pairs. A random forest model
        (Breiman, 2001) run on these data produces probabilities for whether two records
        refer to the same person.25 We use a cutoff threshold pc and we consider record pairs
        with predicted probabilities above pc to be links.26 For both the supervised and active
   23
      https://github.com/dedupeio/dedupe
   24
      RecordLink works by identifying potential matches across the two data sets and asking for human
labels for pairs which the algorithm is most uncertain about. This information is then incorporated into
the learning algorithm to improve predictions. A user providing labels has the option to stop at any point
and have dedupe produce predictions based on the current version of the algorithm. To simulate a human
providing responses, we modified dedupe’s code so that ground truth labels would be provided until either
of the following conditions was met: the number of labels provided was equal to 50% of the experimental
data set size, or the number of labels which identified a true positive links was greater than or equal to 75%
of the number of true matches. For 95% of simulations, the number of labels provided was greater than 50%
of the experimental data set size, and in 15% of simulations the number of labels provided was greater than
75% of the experimental data set size.

   26
      While ground truth data for record linkage is often hard to come by, in the context of low-cost RCTs
it may actually be likely that the administrative data set being linked to will meet the conditions needed to
deploy a supervised approach. In particular, the conditions that are needed for supervised learning are that
the administrative data set contains a unique identifier (such as an agency identifier assigned by a police
department, public hospital, or school system) and that a person can appear multiple times in the data set
with the same unique identifier but with discrepancies between records in identifying characteristics.


                                            23
      learning algorithms, we provide the following fields with which to compute similarity
      metrics: first name, last name, date of birth, race, and indictment date. We report
      all results on heldout data that reflects the same simulation settings (administrative
      data sample size, share overlap, share non-exact match, experimental sample size) as
      was used for training the model.

                                [Insert Table 1 About Here]

Table 1 compares the performance of the machine learning algorithms against exact match-
ing by name and date of birth when linking E to D. As expected, the true positive rate for
exact matching is lower than that achieved by probabilistic matching, but imperceptibly so.
On the other hand, exact matching is significantly more likely to introduce false negatives.
Most importantly, as Table 1 shows, we substantially reduce the sum of false positive and
false negative error rates by using a machine-learning strategy. For the supervised learning
approach, there is about a 60% reduction in total error and for active learning there is
about a 36% reduction.

                                [Insert Table 2 About Here]

   Table 2 provides a more detailed view of how error rates varied with simulation pa-
rameters for active and supervised learning. The share of non-exact matches was strongly
predictive of higher total error rates for both schemes, but was relatively more influential
for active learning. A greater overlap between the experimental and administrative datasets
was associated with lower error for active learning but was not related to error for super-
vised learning. The size of the administrative dataset was also positively associated for both
approaches, but more influential for active learning. The size of the experimental dataset
had a very small negative association with error rates for both approaches. Finally, the
number of human labels provided had negligible impact on error rates.


5.2   Empirical Simulation Results

To simulate matching error bias we follow the same procedure as in Section 4, this time
using empirical linkage rates from exact matching as well as probabalistic matching. We
explore the comparative performance of exact matching versus two flavors of probabilistic
matching: active learning as proxied by the ubiquitous Dedupe library for Python and

                                     24
supervised learning using the probabalistic matching algorithm created by the authors.
For each ȳ ∗ , τ and n combination and each of the two probabalistic matching strategies,
we compute the share of linking errors in the empirical data that are abated by using
probabalistic matching instead of exact matching. In other words, we compute the share of
linking errors under exact matching that are corrected using probabalistic matching. Results
are presented in Figure 3 which contains two histograms: the performance of active learning
is summarized in Panel 3a and the performance of supervised learning is summarized in
Panel 3b. The histograms plot the distribution of the share of linking errors overturned
across a range of ȳ ∗ , τ and n combinations, focusing exclusively on the combinations that
result in power of between 0.6 and 0.8. These are the studies that are marginally powered
an are precisely the studies for which linking errors are most pivotal.

                                    [Insert Figure 3 About Here]

    Referring to the figure, we see that across all pivotal parameterizations, using an active-
learning based matching algorithm overturns, on average, 37 percent of the linking errors
under exact matching. Using our supervised matching algorithm, we can overturn an average
of 62 percent of linking errors. In both cases, the degree to which probabalistic matching is
power enhancing varies and depends on the specific ȳ ∗ , τ and n combination in the data.
Under supervised learning, the 95 percent confidence interval runs from 50 percent to 77
percent, indicating that, in nearly all cases, probabalistic matching can overturn between
one half and three quarters of linking errors. Active learning, as proxied by Dedupe is, on
average less successful (95 percent confidence interval: 10 percent to 71 percent). However,
given the relative simplicity of implementing an active learning algorithm and the wide
availability of canned software packages that do so, in most empirical applications, this will
be an excellent option to retain a large share of statistical power that would otherwise be
lost due to exact matching.27




   27
      We note that in a very small number of parameterizations, the share of errors overturned is negative
indicating that exact matching leads to fewer linking errors than active learning. Common features of
these parameterizations include low exact matching error rates, low overlap between the experimental and
administrative datasets, and/or larger administrative datasets.


                                          25
6        Conclusion

We have shown that linking errors, even when they are random, can have serious conse-
quences for the evidence base in empirical criminal justice research — in particular, by
creating potentially enormous challenges for developing evidence from randomized experi-
ments. Our reading of the prior literature is that scholars sometimes favor stringent linking
criteria (i.e., exact matching) in an effort to minimize false positive links with the goal
of generating an analytic data set with as few errors as possible. However, a key insight
from this research is that the the sum of false positive and false negative error rates is the
parameter that drives the attenuation bias from linking errors, which means that strin-
gent linking criteria will increase, rather than minimize linking error bias. This is because
while stringent criteria minimize false positive links, they substantially increase false neg-
ative links. As linking error affects coefficient estimates, there are descriptive as well as
inferential consequences.
     In the presence of linking errors, for any sample size, coefficients will be underestimated,
with degree of attenuation being proportional to the error rate in the linkage.28 While at-
tenuation is unwelcome, linking errors have far more destructive consequences for statistical
inference. This is because researchers who plan randomized experiments rarely have an ex-
cess of the statistical power they need to detect an effect. The result is that a small degree
of attenuation can easily make an effect size (that was thought a priori to be detectable)
undetectable. As we show, this problem can be especially severe in experiments with small
samples or with larger samples and small effect sizes. Taken study by study, this issue might
be dismissed as trivial, but because studies with “null results” are plausibly less likely to
be submitted and accepted for publication, as “low-cost randomized trials” gain traction,
this problem stands to erode the quality of the social scientific evidence base — perhaps
substantially.
     While our analytic results apply specifically to randomized experiments where the treat-
ment is allocated randomly, we note that our findings — and advice — also hold for a great
deal of quasi-experimental research which implicitly seeks to mimic randomization using
either natural experiment or a control function. Likewise, although we specifically focus on
binary outcomes, continuous variables measuring outcomes like program utilization, earn-

    28
     It is worthwhile to note that the descriptive consequences of linking error cannot be resolved by in-
creasing sample size.


                                          26
ings, or duration could all suffer from similar problems when derived from administrative
data. In fact, linking errors might even be more problematic if the absence of a link is a
recorded as a zero, a common mass point in those types of continuous variables.
   On an optimistic note, we find that probabilistic linking via machine learning algorithms
vastly outperforms exact matching and, in fact, in many scenarios approximates a zero error
scenario. We argue that these results provide compelling evidence that exact matching
should be abandoned in favor of probabilistic linking and that applied researchers should
pay greater attention to the way in which data linking is done more generally.

Note: This table displays three different error rates (false positive rate, false negative rate, and the sum
of the two error rates) from simulated matches for each share of non-exact matches between the input
experimental data set E and the administrative data set D. We simulate matches for each of the matching
schemes, estimating an error rate for each of the combinations of the following parameters: administrative
data set (10,000, 100,000 and 1,000,000); experimental data set (500, 750, 1,000, 2,000, and 3,000); and
share non-exact matches (.1, .2, .3, and .4). The error rates presented in Columns (1)-(3) are averaged
across simulations for each matching scheme.

Note: This table presents the coefficient estimates from ordinary least squares regressions of the sum of
the false positive and false negative rates from the simulated matches on the attributes of the simulation
(N=450). Standard errors are in parentheses. The results are shown separately for active learning and
supevised learning. The goal here is to decompose the sum of false positive and false negative error rates to
demonstrate the relative contributions of the different components of the match. Statistical significance is
indicated by asterisks according to the following: ∗ p<0.1; ∗∗ p<0.05; ∗∗∗ p<0.01.

A      Computational Details
In this appendix we provide additional details for how statistical power can be computed
under two possible states of the world: 1) in the absence of linking errors and 2) in the pres-
ence of linking errors. We use the derivations in this appendix to empirically demonstrate
the effect of linking errors on statistical power in a hypothetical experiment in Section 5 of
the paper.
    We motivate the derivation by introducing a framework — a confusion matrix — that
governs the incidence of linking errors in a generic dataset. Each row of the confusion matrix
represents the incidence of an actual class while each column represents the instances in a
predicted class. The matrix thus allows an analyst to understand the extent to which the
algorithm is successful in classifying observations. In our context, we use a confusion matrix
to see how a matching algorithm has performed in correctly determining the presence of an
individual in a dataset.
    In the following confusion matrix, y ∗ represents the true state of the world and y repre-
sents the observed state of the world after linking. The cells provide counts of the number
of true negatives, false negatives, false positives and true positives, respectively in linking
the data.

                                        True state of the world

                                                 y∗ = 0     y∗ = 1
                                       y=0        TN         FN
                                       y=1        FP         TP

The diagonal entries of the matrix correspond to an alignment of the true and observed
states of the world — observations for which y ∗ = y = 0 are true negatives and observations
for which y ∗ = y = 1 are true positives. The off-diagonal entries provide us with the number
of linking errors. In particular, the 2,1 element of the matrix provides the number of false
positive links — this is the number of times in which an observation which is truly y ∗ = 1 is
mistakenly linked to y = 0.29 Similarly, the 1,2 element of the matrix provides the number
of false negative links where an observation that is truly y ∗ = 0 is mistakenly linked to a
record for which y = 1.
    The table allows us to compute several quantities that are instrumental in deriving the
impact of linking errors on statistical power. We begin by noting that the matrix allows
us to compute four different rates which allow us to measure the success of a given linking




  29
     For consistency, we describe this as a mistaken link, when in practice, it is often the case that these
records would be non-links that are then assumed to have the value y = 0.

                                    FNR = 1 − TPR

The true positive rate (T P R) is defined as the number of linked positives divided by the
number of true positives (T P +F N ). Likewise the true negative rate (T N R) is the number
of linked negatives divided by the number of true negatives (T N +F P ). The corresponding
false positive and false negative link rates are obtained by subtracting each of these quan-
tities from 1. As we show in Section 3 of the paper, estimated treatment effects will be
attenuated under linking errors and the attenuation will be proportional to 1-F P R-F N R.
So long as F P R+F N R < 1, this will be strict attenuation towards zero but if F P R+F N R
exceeds 1 then there can be a change in the sign of the bias.
     Overall, there are T P + F N actual failures and T P + F P observed failures. This
aspect of the table motivates our first step in deriving a statistical power computation. In
particular, we can write down an expression for the number of failures in the control group
in the absence and presence of linking errors as follows:

                             yT∗ =0 = (T P + F N ) × (1 − p)
                             yT =0 = (T P + F P ) × (1 − p)

yT∗ =0 is the true number of failures in the control group and yT =0 is the observed number
of failures where p is the proportion of the sample that receives the treatment.
     Next, we consider how many successes there will be in the treatment group, with and
without matching errors. In order to compute these quantities we introduce a treatment
effect, τ which, for simplicity, is expressed in percent (rather than percentage point) terms.
For our purposes, τ will be negative but this choice is trivial. The number of failures in the
treatment group will then be given by:


                                          yT∗ =1 = (T P + F N )(1 − τ ) × p
                                     "                               #
                 yT =1 = (T P + F P ) 1 − [τ (1 − F P R − F N R)] × p


    In the absence of linking errors, the number of observed failures will be equal to the
number of actual failures in the data multiplied by the proportion treated and one minus
the treatment effect. When linking errors are present, the treatment effect will be multiplied
by 1 − F P R − F N R to account for attenuation.
    To appreciate how this works, consider a dataset of size N = 900, fix P = 0.5 and
τ = 0.1 (10%) and use the following confusion matrix:




                                      2
                                            y∗ = 0     y∗ = 1
                               y=0         T N =280   F N =100
                               y=1         F P =20    T P =500

                                     500                                  280
In this dataset, the FPR = 1 − 500+100     = 0.167 and the FNR = 1 − 280+20    = 0.067.
Accordingly, we will have the following numbers of failures in the treatment and control
groups in each of our two states of the world:

                                       yT∗ =0 = (T P + F N ) × (1 − p) = 300
                                      yT∗ =1 = (T P + F N )(1 − τ ) × p = 270
                                       yT =0 = (T P + F P ) × (1 − p) = 260
                                  "                             #
              yT =1 = (T P + F P ) 1 − [τ (1 − F P R − F N R)] × p = 240


In the true state of the world, there are 300 failures in the control group and 270 in the
treatment group, reflecting the fact that τ = 0.1. With linking errors, the observed number
of failures in the control group is 260 and in the treatment group is 240. The observed
treatment effect is smaller than 10%.
    In order to compute statistical power to detect a given potential treatment effect, we
need to compute a standard error which is computed according to:

                                                  1    σ2
                                 var(τ̂ ) =                                             (13)
                                              p(1 − p) N

The square root of this quantity is the standard error around the estimated treatment effect.
N and p are simply the sample size and the proportion treated but we will need to compute
σ 2 which is the mean square error from a regression of either y ∗ or y on D, depending on
which state of the world we are in. We show how to compute σ 2 in absence and presence
of linking errors in Appendix B.
    We can then compute statistical power according to:
                                      "                   #
                                         −1 α       τh 
                                            
                              β=Φ Φ             −
                                              2   se(τh )

Carrying through the numerical example from our confusion table, power to detect a treat-
ment effect of 10% in these data are 90 percent in the true state of the world and just 67
percent in the state of the world with linking errors. What would have been an exceedingly
well-powered experiment is no longer well-powered in the presence of modest linking errors.

B      Deriving Outcome Variance
In this section we show how to compute the residual sum of squares with a binary outcome
and binary treatment in order to compute the σ 2 . Let ȳC equal the control group mean and
τ the treatment effect:
                           X                  X
                               (yi − ŷi )2 =   (yi − ȳC − τ Ti )2
                                 i                   i

   We can decompose the above equation into four mutually exclusive groups determined
by whether an individual is in the treatment or control group, and whether their associated
outcome is y = 0 or y = 1.
     X                       X                        X                          X

i∈{i|yi =0,Ti =0}         i∈{i|yi =1,Ti =0}                   i∈{i|yi =0,Ti =1}                 i∈{i|yi =1,Ti =1}
           2                 2

= nC,1 (1 − ȳC ) + nT,1 (1 − ȳT )




                                              4
C     Maximizing RSS
We now show why Equation 10 is maximized when the control group mean, ȳC , plus the
treatment effect, τ , equal 0.5. Let NT,1 equal the number of individuals in the treatment
group with y = 1 and NT,0 equal the number of individuals in the treatment group with
y = 0. Note that NT,1 = (ȳC + τ )NT and NT,0 = NT (1 − (ȳC + τ )).
                            X                  X
                                (yi − ŷi )2 =   (yi − (ȳC + τ Ti ))2
                              i                  i

For a given control group mean we will take derivatives with respect to τ , which means
we will only consider individuals in the treatment group. We can decompose the previous
equation into:
         X
            (yi − ŷi )2 = NT,0 (−ȳC − τ )2 + NT,1 (1 − ȳC − τ )2
          i∈T
                        = NT (1 − (ȳC + τ ))(−ȳC − τ )2 + NT (ȳC + τ )(1 − ȳC − τ )2
                        = NT (1 − ȳC − τ )(ȳC + τ )2 + NT (ȳC + τ )(1 − ȳC − τ )2
                        = NT (1 − ȳC − τ )(ȳC + τ )(ȳC + τ + 1 − α − τ )
                        = NT (1 − ȳC − τ )(ȳC + τ )

    Let κ(τ ) = NT (1 − ȳC − τ )(ȳC + τ ), then taking derivatives with respect to τ :

                                     dκ
                                        = NT (−2ȳC − 2τ )
                                     dτ
Setting the previous equation to zero and solving for τ leads to

                                            ȳC + τ = 0.5

D     Proof for Power Attenuation
In this section we show that even when the standard error estimated under linking error
is smaller than the standard error estimated under no error, statistical power will still be
larger for the latter scenario. Let κ be True Positive Rate and ω be the False Positive Rate.
                                             τh      τ̂
                                                  >
                                             σ τh   στ̂
                                             τh     (κ − ω)τh
                                                  >
                                             σ τh       στ̂
                                              στ̂ > (κ − ω)στh
                                στ̂ − (κ − ω)στh > 0

We can replace στ̂ and στh with just the residual sum of squares components since all
other terms in their respective computations cancel out. Here Nj,1     ∗ represents the number
                                                     ∗              ∗
of observations for which the true value of y, y = 1 and Nj,0 represents the number of
observations for which the true value of y, y ∗ = 0. This allows us to write the last inequality
above as

E       Treatment Heterogeneity Correlated With Matching Er-
        ror
In this section we demonstrate how treatment effect heterogeneity that’s correlated with
linking error can impact coefficient estimates. Consider a dichotomous covariate G which
takes on two values M and F . We assume that linking error rates within group are equal
across treatment and control but that T P RM 6= T P RF and F P RM 6= F P RF . Further,
assume that τM 6= τF . We rewrite Equation 4 as:

        X       X
τ̂ =                      P (yi = 1, yi∗ = j, Gi = g|Ti = 1)
       j∈{0,1} g∈{M,F }

  − P (yi = 1, yi∗ = j, Gi = g|Ti = 0)
      X      X
  =                  P (yi = 1|yi∗ = j, Gi = g, Ti = 1)P (yi∗ = j|Gi = g, Ti = 1)P (Gi = g|Ti = 1)
       j∈{0,1} g∈{M,F }

  − P (yi = 1|yi∗ = j, Gi = g, Ti = 0)P (yi∗ = j|Gi = g, Ti = 0)P (Gi = g|Ti = 0)
  = P (M )(T P RM − F P RM )τM + P (F )(T P RF − F P RF )τF


    When both τM and τF are in the same direction, then linking error will only attenuate
the pooled treatment effect in absolute value. However, if the signs of τM and τF are
different, then the observed treatment effect may be greater than the true average treatment
effect in absolute value.
