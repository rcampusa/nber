Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drug advisory committee members sometimes have financial
interests tied to drug companies. Congress and the public have become concerned that these financial
interests lead to conflicts of interest. They conclude that the conflicts bias committee recommendations,
and lead to unsafe or ineffective drugs being approved for public consumption, or, conversely, delays
in approval of safe and effective drugs. Our paper provides empirical evidence, based on an event
study methodology, that advisory committee meetings lead to weak or statistically insignificant effects
on stock prices and hence equity values of regulated companies assumed to be affected by the particular
matters coming before committee meetings.

I.      Introduction



        Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advisory committee members sometimes

have financial interests tied to companies whose products are evaluated by their

committees. Congress, public interest groups, and the press have become increasingly

concerned about these financial interests.1 They worry that the advice offered by advisory

committee members may be biased; thus undermining the integrity of the processes that

FDA uses to solicit outside advice to inform regulatory decisions. Our paper provides

financial market evidence of weak or statistically insignificant effects of advisory

committee actions on stock market values, an accepted measure of the value of a

company (and a measure of the potential direct benefits to committee members holding

stocks in these companies as well as potential indirect benefits to committee members

with other financial ties to these companies).

        Our analysis distinguishes between two types of meetings and finds evidence

suggesting different stock price effects.          Product-specific meetings may deal with such

things as approval or labeling of an individual product. Meetings on general topics

address regulatory issues affecting many firms, as many as the entire pharmaceutical

industry. We find no evidence of effects of general topic meetings on stock prices. We

do find, however, evidence of some statistically significant but mostly weak negative

effects of product specific advisory committee meetings on stock prices of affected firms.

           In the rest of the paper we discuss the institutional and legal background of

conflicts of interest and FDA’s advisory committees, measurement of the effects of

advisory committee meetings, a description of the results, and then our conclusions.

II. Background

           FDA advisory committees play a vital role in furthering FDA’s mission to protect

and promote public health. Through advisory committees, FDA obtains independent,

expert advice on issues relating to human drugs, animal drugs, biological products (such

as vaccines and blood products), medical devices, and food. In general, drug advisory

committees include consumer representatives, a patient representative, industry

representatives (who do not vote) and at least two technically qualified experts who

specialize in the drug or disease.

           FDA advisory committees have been subject to increased scrutiny. In particular,

members of the public, Congress, and consumer groups have focused attention on

advisory committee members’ potential conflicts of interest and how FDA reviews and

grants waivers of conflict of interest.

           Federal law2 requires that individuals invited to attend an FDA advisory

committee meeting as a special government employee (SGE) or regular government

employee (RGE) report to the agency all financial interests relevant to the topics to be

discussed at the advisory committee meeting. Individuals are required to report personal

financial interests, such as stock in a regulated company and consulting fees received

from a regulated company.               In addition, individuals must report financial interests

imputed to them through their spouse, minor children, employer, prospective employer,

general partner, and organizations in which they serve as an officer, director, trustee, or

general partner. The law considers a financial interest to be a potential conflict of interest

if the discussions and potential outcomes of the advisory committee meeting will have a

direct and predictable effect on the financial interest.3

        If an individual has a potential conflict of interest, he or she may not participate in

the meeting unless the agency determines that the criteria for a waiver of conflict of

interest are met and such waiver is granted. Under current law and FDA policy, FDA

grants a waiver only if it is necessary to afford the advisory committee essential

expertise, the aggregate amount of potentially conflicting personal financial interests is

$50,000 or less, and granting the waiver would be consistent with the statutory cap on the

number of waivers that may be issued for the year.4

        Individuals with substantial or closely related financial interests are either

excluded from the committee meetings or not allowed to vote. Those with moderate to

small or more remote financial interests sometimes are given waivers and allowed to

participate because of their unique expertise. For example, a committee member could

hold $25,000 worth of a drug stock or have earned a $10,000 consulting fee from a drug

company and still be selected for the committee and allowed to vote. As of March 1,

2009, FDA operated 48 advisory committees and panels (16 for drugs), and, collectively,

these committees had 592 members.

        For the above mentioned reasons, Congress, the public, and regulators have been

understandably concerned that some advisory committee members’ financial interests are

conflicts of interest that could lead to bias. They worry that FDA’s decisions to grant

conflict of interest waivers to some experts with financial interests undermines the

objectivity of the advisory committees’ recommendations5. A widely cited study of FDA

drug advisory committee members’ conflicts of interest found that 73 percent of advisory

meetings involved at least one member with a conflict (Lurie et al., 2006). The

researchers found well over 60 percent of the conflicts consisted of members owning

drug company stocks or receiving consulting fees from drug companies. They further

found that conflicted members typically voted in favor of drug approvals more frequently

than non-conflicted members.6

         In that study, a member was defined to be conflicted if he had any financial

interest in a potentially affected drug firm, not just the firm whose drug was up for

approval. For example, a member who had a financial interest in a firm that makes a

competing product to the subject drug was considered to be conflicted, as was a member

who had a financial interest in the subject drug firm. An assumption underlying this

definition is that financial benefits generated from any drug firm make or identify a

committee member more favorably predisposed to the drug industry in general, and more

likely to vote in favor of drug approvals. This assumption is common in the

Congressional record, the popular press, and the academic press. FDA has previously

articulated flaws with this study. An FDA paper published by the Center for Medicine in

the Public Interest (also described in Biotechnology Law Report 25:5 (2006) describes

flaws in the methodology used in the Lurie et al. paper (2006). Specifically, the FDA

paper stated the following:

 Lurie, P., et al., “Financial Conflicts of Interest Disclosure and Voting Patterns at Food and Drug
Administration Drug Advisory Committee Meetings,” JAMA, 295: 1921-1928 (Apr. 26, 2006).


                                                     6
“Rather than asking whether having a financial tie to any pharmaceutical company tends
to increase votes in support of a drug (a notion inconsistent with conventional
interpretations of conflict of interest), we ask whether having a financial interest tends to
increase votes in favor of that interest.”

The FDA study’s re-interpretation of the Lurie et al. results suggests that committee

members with a financial interest in a particular company were less likely to vote in favor

of that pharmaceutical company’s interests than members without any financial ties. The

paper also determined that committee members with financial ties to competing firms (for

whom a vote of “yes” on a particular drug could be interpreted as a vote against the

financial interest of the firm with which the member has financial ties) were more likely

to vote against the financial interest of the companies with which they have financial ties

compared to committee members with no financial ties. Finally, the FDA study reiterates

the Lurie et al. finding that if all members of the advisory committees had been excluded

from voting, not a single outcome of the 76 advisory committee meetings would have

been altered.

III. Measuring the Effects of Advisory Committee Meetings

       Previous studies on conflicted advisory committee members have focused on

member qualifications and meeting outcomes. In this paper, we use stock returns to

measure the effects of committee meetings on firms’ financial interests. As described

above, the legal standard for identifying conflicts of interest is whether the particular

matter (i.e., advisory committee meeting topic) in which the federal employee

participates would have a direct and predictable effect on the federal employee’s financial

interests. Thus, the existence of measurable stock price effects suggests such effects are

direct and predictable, and the absence of measurable stock price effects would raise

questions about the directness and predictability of such effects. In the absence of



                                             7
measurable stock price effects, companies--and the interests of committee members in

such companies--may still gain, but only insofar as the effects of the committees’

deliberations were either anticipated by the market so that there is no “surprise” or so

small that no effect was measurable. In the finance literature, use of stock prices to

evaluate effects of events on market value is called an “event study.”7

           Our tests avoid having us decide which new drugs merit approval. They rely on

the assumption that stock prices are set efficiently; a widely held view in the finance

literature. The idea is that all publicly available information relevant to valuing a

company’s stock is reflected in its price. This view seems appropriate here because

information on potential new drugs attracts a great deal of attention from investors and

Wall Street investment firms hire many drug industry experts to assist them in valuing

drug stocks.8 If a stock is priced too high (low) given what investors know about its

prospects, investors sell (buy) the shares, thus forcing down (up) its price until it returns

to its proper price. Thus, drug companies’ stock prices should reflect all publicly

available information about the likelihood of a new drug being recommended for

approval by an advisory committee.

           The relative rarity of event studies in the medical literature suggests further

explanation is merited.9 Simply stated, the result of an event study is the portion of a

stock’s return caused by an information surprise. An example of a surprise is when

traders expect an advisory committee to recommend approval of a drug but instead they

recommend against approval. The surprise or “abnormal” portion of the associated drug

stock’s return is computed by subtracting the company’s normal (expected) return from

what the stock actually earned over the days surrounding the announcement of rejection.

Stock return data is obtained from The Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP),

the most common source used in the finance literature. The appendix provides the more

technical details of the event study method.

        Our sample of events covers most of the FDA advisory committee meetings that

occurred in 2006. Some meetings involved companies that are privately held or whose

stocks are solely traded on foreign exchanges. The CRSP data base does not contain

stock returns for these firms; hence, we could not include these companies in our study.

Nevertheless, the sample is likely to represent the exploitable effects of the events

reasonably well because CRSP covers the foreign pharmaceutical firms whose stocks are

traded in the U.S., and because most of the excluded firms are privately held. Advisory

committee members are unlikely to own shares of private companies because private

stock is not available for purchase on stock exchanges.

        We examined 24 out of the 31 drug advisory committee meetings held during

2006. Ten meetings were product-specific (drug-specific) meetings, and the remaining 14

were general topic meetings.10 Each meeting provides a vote announcement, which is

defined as an event. The FDA provided the names of the firms potentially affected by the

questions voted on at each meeting. We dropped four product-specific meetings and

another three general topic meetings because they did not involve a publicly-traded firm.



10
  Regulations of the Office of Government Ethics refer to particular matters involving specific parties (5
CFR 2640.102(l)) and particular matters of general applicability (5 CFR 2640.102(m)). For simplicity, we
use product specific and general topic meetings to refer to these two types of particular matters.


                                                    9
Two product-specific meetings actually considered two separate drugs, each sponsored

by a different company; hence, these two meetings provide four product-specific events.

       We ran an event study to measure the abnormal return for each of the 12

individual firms potentially impacted by the 10 product-specific meetings. As is common

for event studies, we also formed an equally-weighted stock portfolio of all 12 stocks’

abnormal return to measure an overall average impact of the committee announcements

for the group. We performed the same analysis for each general topic meeting, since each

meeting’s announcement impacted several firms, and then formed a portfolio of all firms

impacted by general meeting announcements to measure an overall average impact for all

of the groups combined.

       Figure 1 illustrates the basic structure of the data used to measure an abnormal

return for each company. The day that the results of the voting are announced is labeled

day 0; that is the event day. One could simply compute the abnormal stock return on that

day to measure the effect of any surprise announcement on a particular company’s stock,

but the typical event study reports the cumulative abnormal stock returns (CARs) for the

event day plus some trading days around the event. For example, the trade day that

occurs 3 days before the event is labeled -3 in the figure. The reason most event studies

include the surrounding days’ abnormal returns is that some information leakage could

occur just before the event, or it could take some time following the event for the

information to be fully digested by the traders. In 2006, FDA generally posted on its

website briefing materials for members of its advisory committee at least 24 hours prior

to the start of the advisory committee.

Figure 1. The Time-Line of Return Data Used to Compute Cumulative Abnormal Returns



        Using a “window” of days around the event is particularly appropriate for FDA

meeting announcements. Furthermore, some meetings take place over two days and

information leaks on the progress of the voting could occur on the first day. To account

for potential information leaks or lags, we report CARs for one day before and one day

after the meeting announcement day (three trading days), five days before and five days

after the meeting announcement day (11 trading days), and 21 days before and 21 day

after the meeting announcement day (43 trading days). The three event windows in the

tables of results are designated by (-1, 1), (-5, 5), and (-21, 21).

        We report results for three different windows for a number of reasons. First,

results for different windows illustrate the robustness of the results. Second, some

meetings cover two days. We set the event day as the second of the two days because

announcements from the meetings are more likely to come on the final day, but

information leakage is possible on the preceding day. Therefore, the three-day event

period is the shortest time period that reasonably covers the event’s effects while

minimizing the chance that some other confounding event occurs during the event period.

Third, the (-5, 5) window allows a greater coverage of leak or lag effects, but increases

the chance that the firms involved are affected by some other event that is then




                                                     11
mistakenly attributed to the FDA meeting. Nevertheless, the chance of this occurring for

many firms during the window is small. Finally, the (-21, 21) window can provide

evidence about whether information is impounded in the affected stocks well before the

meeting is even held. This could indicate early leakage of information before any public

news source is able to obtain and report on the information. Of course, this longer period

is also more likely to contain confounding events.

IV. Description of Results

        We present the separate event results in tables below. Each entry in the table is

either a cumulative abnormal return (CAR) over a particular event window or its

associated t-statistic. The CAR measures the stock or portfolio return after adjusting for

the risk of the stock or portfolio of stocks. The t-statistic can be used to test the

hypothesis that a CAR is statistically different from zero. For our purposes, we employ a

two-tailed test, and take a t-statistic with a magnitude greater than 2 to indicate a

statistically significant CAR at the 5 percent level.

        As shown in Table 1, the CARs for companies affected by general topic meetings

are consistent with what we would ordinarily expect to have happened by chance alone.11

Company names are withheld for privacy reasons. Some firms were named in several

meetings but many firms appear only once; hence, the results are not driven by a few

firms who appear over and over again.

11
  To illustrate the questions put before advisory committees meeting to address general topic, we provide a
an example. On February 9, 2006, the Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee
discussed issues surrounding potency measurements for cellular and gene transfer products. One question
asked of the committee was: In the context of Cellular and Gene Therapy products, what assay design
schemes would be necessary to successfully validate biological assays and allow accurate quantification
and interpretation of the results obtained? In contrast, for the product-specific meeting held by the Anti-
infective Drugs Advisory Committee on March 6, 2006 a question posed was: Do data from the pivotal
study provide substantial evidence of safety and efficacy of [the drug] daptomycin in the treatment of
staphylococcus aureus bacteremia?



                                                    12
       Our hypothesis for the effects of general topic meetings is that they should be

small overall because of the general nature of the topics and therefore the more

unpredictable the effects of committee recommendations on a firm’s profitability. At the

bottom of the table we report the CARs for a combined portfolio of all of the firms in all

14 events. We find that the overall effects for the 14 meetings combined are very small;

over the (-1, 1), (-5, 5), and (-21, 21) windows, the CARs are -0.09, 0.48 and -2.41

percent, respectively. None of these CARs is statistically significant.

       We recognize that combining all of the meetings’ effects could mask a relatively

large effect for a few meetings, or that large positive effects of some meetings could

offset large negative effects of other meetings. To consider this possibility, we measure

and report the effect for each meeting. The CARs measuring the effect of a meeting is

designated as “Portfolio” under the company number column. Given the 14 events

(meetings) and three windows per event, there are 42 CARs to consider. We find that

none of the 42 CARs for the portfolios are statistically significant. Furthermore, the point

estimates of the CARs over the three-day event period are all very small – less than one

percent except for two cases which are less than two percent. And the signs of the CARs

are about evenly distributed between positive (22) and negative (20) CARs.

       Finally, we considered the possibility that these portfolio-level results masked

some large effects of the meeting announcements on individual companies. There are a

total of 279 company-level CARs, but only 5 are statistically significant. If we assume

that we could observe up to five percent statistically significant CARs by chance

(approximately 14 in this case), the 5 statistically significant CARs can easily be

attributed to chance. Furthermore, there are three statistically significant negative CARs




                                            13
and two statistically significant positive CARs. Therefore, our evidence supports our

hypothesis that the announcements of votes from general topic meetings should hold few

large surprises, and therefore, have no substantial overall impact on the companies’ stock

prices.

          Table 2 reports results for the company-specific meeting events using a similar

format. Our hypothesis is that occasionally there will be statistically significant effects of

company-specific meeting announcements on the stocks of companies whose drug

products are under consideration by the committee. We find that the overall effects on the

12 companies involved in company-specific events are larger in magnitude than those

observed for the general topic meeting effects. The CARs for the portfolio of the 12

companies over the (-1, 1), (-5, 5), and (-21, 21) windows are -2.48, -11.15, and -5.91

percent, respectively. The (-1, 1) and (-5, 5) window CARs are statistically significant.

We report a total of 36 company-specific CARs for the 12 companies and find that 5 are

statistically significant. More than ten percent of the CARs are statistically significant,

which indicates that the results are unlikely to be due to chance. Furthermore, four of the

five statistically significant CARs are negative.

          The empirical results in Tables 1 and 2 support our hypotheses. There appear to

be very few surprises in the general topic meetings but a statistically significant number

of surprises (mostly negative) in the product-specific announcements. The results are

based upon one year of meetings; hence, they are not conclusive. An open question is

why the surprises tend to be negative rather than positive for the meetings with product

specific topics.




                                             14
VI. Conclusion

       Overall, this study implies that advisory committee meetings provide little

additional information about a drug product’s expected sales and therefore rarely move

stock prices. The study finds that FDA advisory committee meetings involving general

topics have no statistically significant impact on stock prices. Some FDA meetings

involving company-specific topics produce statistically significant but usually small

negative stock price effects. Assuming that drug stocks are priced reasonably efficiently,

these results show that investors are not surprised by the voting results announced at

general topic meetings, but that such surprises sometimes occur at the product specific

meetings and these surprises are negative. We suggest that the reason for this difference

is that the general topics may have intrinsically less predictable effects on stock prices.

Appendix: Event Study Details



       We computed all event-study results using Eventus software, the CRSP returns

data set, and the market model. The market model is used as part of a common method to

compute an abnormal return. The model defines the return one can expect from a stock

on a particular trading day, given the stock’s risk (beta) and the market return for the day.

A stock’s beta is a measure of its risk relative to the stock market as a whole. By

definition, the market beta has a value of 1. A stock that is twice (half) as risky as the

stock market has a beta of 2 (0.5). On days when the stock market increases (decreases)

by, say, 2%, a stock with a beta of 2 should increase (decrease) by 4%.

        The market model parameters (beta and alpha) for each firm are estimated with

daily returns from a period preceding the event, in this case, starting 46 trading days

before the event and going backward in time at least 63 trading days (three months) and

up to 255 trading days (one year) if a company has 255 days available in the CRSP data

set. The market model is

       Rit = αi + βiRmt + εit                                                        (1)

where Rit is firm i’s daily stock return on day t, Rmt is the market return on day t

represented by the CRSP equal-weighted index return, αi and βi are the market model

parameters measured by ordinary least squares coefficients for firm i, and εit in the error

term for firm i at time t. Here we use up to one year of a firm’s daily stock returns to

gauge its risk. The returns come from a time period before the event windows so that the

event itself does not influence the risk measure.

       The normal or expected return on a particular day t, for stock i is measured as:

                   ^     ^
        E[ Rit ] = α i + β i Rmt .                                                    (2)

The coefficients in (1) are estimated over the 255 trading days before the event window.

They are used to calculate, Ait, the risk-adjusted (abnormal) return on a particular day t

for firm i as,

                                      ^     ^
         Ait = Rit − E[ Rit ] = Rit − α i − β i Rmt .

We compound these abnormal returns over the days of the event window to find the

cumulative abnormal return (CAR) for a single firm.

        When more than one firm is potentially affected by an event, in addition to

reporting the individual firm CARs, we also report an average CAR for the portfolio of

firms potentially affected by the event. We test these CARs for an overall event effect.

This portfolio average CAR is computed by averaging the abnormal returns for the firms

on each event day in the window, and then compounding these average returns over the

event window.

        CARs are measured over three event windows and their statistical significance is

tested with a t-statistic. The CAR t-statistic is computed using the time-series standard

deviation of the returns for either an individual stock or the portfolio of stocks potentially

impacted by the given event. We report results for there event windows: a short window

of (-1, 1), a medium window of (-5, 5), and a long window of (-21, 21).

The meeting on September 7th is unusual because the clinical studies relied upon by the
sponsor to support approval of the drug and indication under discussion were submitted
under Section 505(b)(2) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. (21 U.S.C. section 355(b)(2)). This
section of the Act allows the FDA, in certain circumstances, to base approvals of new drugs
entirely or partially on studies not conducted by the applicant and for which the applicant has not
obtained a right of reference or use. The advisory committee meeting was an unusual
circumstance and was not typical of FDA advisory committee meetings involving specific drug
products.
