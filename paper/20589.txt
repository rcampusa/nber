Valuing Thinly-Traded Assets

                                             ABSTRACT

We model illiquidity as a restriction on the stopping rules investors can follow in selling assets, and
apply this framework to the valuation of thinly-traded investments. We find that discounts for illiquidity
can be surprisingly large, approaching 30 to 50 percent in some cases. Immediacy plays a unique role
and is valued much more than ongoing liquidity. We show that investors in illiquid enterprises have
strong incentives to increase dividends and other cash payouts, thereby introducing potential agency
conflicts. We also find that illiquidity and volatility are fundamentally entangled in their effects on
asset prices. This aspect may help explain why some assets are viewed as inherently more liquid than
others and why liquidity concerns are heightened during financial crises.

                             1. INTRODUCTION


Thinly-traded assets are often deﬁned as investments for which there is no liquid
market available. Thus, investors holding illiquid or thinly-traded assets may
not be able to sell their positions for extended periods, if ever. At best, investors
may only be able to sell in infrequent privately-negotiated transactions. The eco-
nomics of these private transactions, however, are complicated since prospective
buyers realize that they will inherit the same problem when they later want to
resell the assets. Not surprisingly, sales of thinly-traded assets typically occur at
prices far lower than would be the case if there was a liquid public market.
     The valuation of thinly-traded assets is one of the most important unresolved
issues in asset pricing. One reason for this is that thinly-traded assets collectively
represent a large fraction of the aggregate wealth in the economy. Key examples
where investors may face long delays before being able to liquidate holdings
include:

       •   Sole proprietorships.
       •   Partnerships, limited partnerships.
       •   Private equity and venture capital.
       •   Life insurance and annuities.
       •   Pensions and retirement assets.
       •   Residential and commercial real estate.
       •   Private placements of debt and equity.
       •   Distressed assets and ﬁre sales.
       •   Compensation in the form of restricted options and shares.
       •   Investments in education and human capital.

Other examples include transactions that take public ﬁrms private such as a
leveraged buyouts (LBOs) that result in residual equityholders having much less
liquid positions. Many hedge funds have lockup provisions that prohibit investors
from withdrawing their capital for months or even years. Investors in initial
public oﬀerings (IPOs) are often allocated shares with restrictions on reselling or
“ﬂipping” the shares.
     Many insightful approaches have been used in the asset pricing literature
to study the eﬀects of illiquidity on security prices. Important examples include
Amihud and Mendelson (1986), Constantinides (1986), Vayanos (1998), Vayanos
and Vila (1999), Acharya and Pedersen (2005) and others who model the relation
between asset prices and transaction costs. Duﬃe, Garleanu, and Pedersen (2005,
2007) study the role that search costs may play in the valuation of securities in

                                          1
illiquid markets. Gromb and Vayanos (2002) and Brunnermeier and Pedersen
(2009) consider how the funding constraints faced by market participants can
aﬀect market liquidity and security values. Shleifer and Vishny (1992, 2011),
Coval and Staﬀord (2007), and others focus on the eﬀects of ﬁnancial constraints
on security prices in ﬁre sales and forced liquidations. Longstaﬀ (2009) solves for
equilibrium security prices in a model when agents can only trade intermittently.
     This paper approaches the challenge of valuing illiquid assets from a new
perspective. Speciﬁcally, we view illiquidity as a restriction on the stopping rules
that an investor is allowed to follow in selling the asset. This approach allows
us to use an option-theoretic framework to place realistic lower bounds on the
values of securities that cannot be traded continuously. Intuitively, these bounds
are determined by solving for the value of an option that would compensate an
investor for having to follow a buy-and-hold strategy rather than being able to
follow an optimal stopping strategy in selling the asset.
     There are many reasons why having a lower bound on the value of an illiquid
asset could be valuable. For example, the lower bound could serve as a reser-
vation price in negotiations between sellers and prospective buyers. Having a
lower bound on the value of illiquid assets held by ﬁnancial institutions can pro-
vide guidance to policymakers in making regulatory capital decisions. The lower
bound also establishes limits on the collateral value of illiquid or thinly-traded
assets used to secure debt ﬁnancing or held in margin accounts. Recent changes
to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) explicitly acknowledge that
ﬁrms holding illiquid assets may need to base their valuations on unveriﬁable es-
timates.1 These lower bounds provide us a conservative but much more objective
standard for valuing these types of illiquid assets.
      The results provide a number of important insights into the potential eﬀects
of illiquidity on asset values. First, we show that the value of immediacy in
ﬁnancial markets is much higher than the value of future liquidity. For example,
the discount for illiquidity for the ﬁrst day of illiquidity is 2.4 times that for the
second day, 4.2 times that for the ﬁfth day, 6.2 times that for the tenth day,
and 20.0 times that for the 100th day. These results suggest that immediacy is
viewed as fundamentally diﬀerent in its nature. This dramatic time asymmetry
in the value of liquidity may also help explain the rapidly growing trend towards
electronic execution and high-frequency trading in many ﬁnancial markets.
      Second, our results conﬁrm that the values of illiquid assets can be heavily
discounted in the market. We show that investors could discount the value of
illiquid stock by as much as 10, 20, or 30 percent for illiquidity horizons of 1,
1
 For example, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 157 allows
for the use of unveriﬁable inputs in the valuation of a broad category of illiquid
assets that are designated as Level 3 investments.


                                          2
2, or 5 years, respectively. Although our results only provide lower bounds on
the values of illiquid assets, the evidence in the empirical literature suggests
that these bounds may be realistic approximations of the prices at which various
types of thinly-traded securities are sold in privately-negotiated transactions.
For example, Amihud, Mendelson, and Pedersen (2005) report that studies of
the pricing of restricted letter stock ﬁnd average discounts ranging from 20 to 35
percent for illiquidity horizons of one to two years. In addition, Brenner, Eldor,
and Hauser (2001) ﬁnd that thinly-traded currency options are placed privately
at roughly a 20 percent discount to fully liquid options.
     Third, we ﬁnd that the eﬀects of illiquidity and volatility on asset prices are
fundamentally entangled. Speciﬁcally, asset return variances and the degree of
asset illiquidity are indistinguishable in their eﬀects on discounts for illiquidity.
This makes intuitive sense since investors are more likely to want to sell assets
when prices have diverged signiﬁcantly from their original purchase prices. This
divergence, however, can arise both through the passage of time as well as through
the volatility of asset prices. Because of this, assets with stable prices such as
cash or short-term Treasury bills can be viewed as inherently more liquid than
assets such as stocks even when all are readily tradable. This may also help
explain why concerns about market liquidity become much more central during
ﬁnancial crises and periods of market stress.
     Finally, the results indicate that the eﬀect of illiquidity on asset prices is
smaller for investments with higher dividends or cash payouts. An important
implication of this is that investors in illiquid assets such as private equity, ven-
ture capital, leveraged buyouts, etc. have strong economic incentives to increase
payouts. Thus, illiquidity may have the potential to be a fundamental driver of
both dividend policy and capital structure decisions for private-held ventures or
thinly-traded ﬁrms.
      The remainder of this paper is as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature
on the valuation of illiquid assets. Section 3 describes our approach to modeling
illiquidity. Section 4 uses this approach to derive lower bounds on the values of
illiquid or thinly-traded assets. Section 5 discusses the asset pricing implications.
Section 6 extends the results to assets that pay dividends. Section 7 summarizes
the results and makes concluding remarks.


                         2. LITERATURE REVIEW

The literature on the eﬀects of illiquidity on asset valuation is too extensive for
us to be able to review in detail. Instead, we will simply summarize some of the
key themes that have been discussed in this literature. For an in-depth survey
of this literature, see the excellent review by Amihud, Mendelson, and Pedersen


                                         3
(2005) on liquidity and asset prices.
     Many important papers in this literature focus on the role played by trans-
action costs and other ﬁnancial frictions in determining security prices. Amihud
and Mendelson (1986) present a model in which risk-neutral investors consider
the eﬀect of future transaction costs in determining current valuations for assets.
Constantinides (1986) shows that while transaction costs can have a large eﬀect
on trading volume, investors optimally trade in a way that mitigates the eﬀect
of transaction costs on prices. Heaton and Lucas (1996) study the eﬀects of
transaction costs on asset prices and risk sharing in an incomplete markets set-
ting. Vayanos (1998) and Vayanos and Vila (1999) show that transaction costs
can increase the value of liquid assets, but can have an ambiguous eﬀect on the
values of illiquid assets.
     Another important theme in the literature is the role of asymmetric informa-
tion. Glosten and Milgrom (1985) model a market maker who provides liquidity
and sets bid-ask prices conditional on the sequential arrival of orders from po-
tentially informed agents. Brunnermeier and Pedersen (2005) develop a model in
which large investors who are forced to sell are exploited via predatory trading
by other traders, and show how the resulting illiquidity aﬀects asset valuations.
     A number of recent papers recognize that liquidity is time varying and de-
velop models in which liquidity risk is priced into asset valuations. Pastor and
Stambaugh (2003) consider a model in which marketwide systemic liquidity risk
is priced. Acharya and Pedersen (2005) show how time-varying liquidity risk
aﬀects current security prices and future expected returns. Gromb and Vayanos
(2002) and Brunnermeier and Pedersen (2009) develop models in which changes
in the abilities of dealers to fund their inventories translates into variation in the
liquidity they can provide, which in turn results in liquidity risk premium being
embedded into asset values.
     Another recent theme in the literature addresses the eﬀects of search costs
or the cost of being present in the market on liquidity and asset prices. Duﬃe,
Garleanu, and Pedersen (2005), Vayanos (2007, 2008), and others consider models
in which agents incur costs as they search for other investors willing to trade
with them, and show how these costs aﬀect security prices. Huang and Wang
(2008a, 2008b) study asset pricing in a market where it is costly for dealers to
be continuously present in the market and provide liquidity.
     A number of papers in the literature view illiquidity from the perspective of a
limitation on the ability of an agent to trade continuously. Lippman and McCall
(1986) deﬁne liquidity in terms of the expected time to execute trading strate-
gies. Longstaﬀ (2001) and Kahl, Liu, and Longstaﬀ (2003) study the welfare
eﬀects imposed on investors by liquidity restrictions on assets. Longstaﬀ (2009)
presents a general equilibrium asset pricing model in which agents must hold


                                          4
asset positions for a ﬁxed horizon rather than being able to trade continuously.
     Finally, several papers approach the valuation of liquidity from an option-
theoretic perspective. Copeland and Galai (1983) model limit orders as an option
given to informed investors. Chacko, Jurek, and Staﬀord (2008) value immediacy
by modeling limit orders as American options. Ang and Bollen (2010) model the
option to withdraw funds from a hedge fund as a real option. Ghaidarov (2014)
models the option to sell equity securities as a forward-starting put option.
      The papers most similar to this one are Longstaﬀ (1995) and Finnerty (2012)
who present models in which investors are assumed to follow speciﬁc trading
strategies which allows them to derive bounds on illiquid asset values. These
papers, however, result in discounts for illiquidity with counterintuitive properties
such as exceeding the value of the liquid asset, or not being monotonic in the
illiquidity horizon. This paper diﬀers fundamentally from these papers, in that we
allow investors to follow optimal stopping strategies in making selling decisions.
An important advantage of this is that it leads to bounds that are much more
realistic.


                       3. MODELING ILLIQUIDITY

In this section, we present a new approach to modeling thin trading or illiquidity
in ﬁnancial markets. This approach provides a simple framework that can be
used to place lower bounds on the values of illiquid assets. Note that placing a
lower bound on the value of the illiquid asset is equivalent to placing an upper
bound on the size of the discount for illiquidity. For clarity, we will generally
couch the discussion in terms of the discount for illiquidity.
      The concept of a stopping rule plays a central role in how we model illiquid-
ity. Intuitively, a stopping rule can be viewed as a decision rule that determines
the (potentially random) stopping time τ when the asset is to be sold, where τ
depends only on information available in the market up to and including time τ .
For example, a decision rule to sell the asset at a prespeciﬁed date T is a stopping
rule. A decision rule to sell the asset via a limit order which is executed the ﬁrst
time the asset price reaches a value of, say, 50 is a stopping rule. In contrast, a
decision rule to sell the asset when its price reaches its maximum value between
time zero and time T is not a stopping rule since the time at which the maximum
is attained is not known for certain prior to time T .2

2
 More formally, let I = (0, T ], T < ∞, deﬁne the set of times where stopping is
possible in the continuous time framework of this paper. Let (Ω, F, Ft∈I , P ) be
a ﬁltered probability space. A random variable τ : Ω → I deﬁned by a stopping
rule is a stopping time if the event {τ ≤ t} belongs to the σ-ﬁeld Ft for all t in

                                         5
      The key insight underlying this modeling framework is that illiquidity can
be viewed as a restriction on the stopping rules than an investor can follow in
selling the asset. In particular, an investor that purchases a liquid asset can
follow any stopping rule he chooses in selling the asset. In contrast, an investor
that purchases an illiquid asset is restricted to a subset of stopping rules. If the
investor’s preferred stopping rule is not included in the subset, then the investor
must choose a stopping rule that is suboptimal from his perspective. In this case,
the investor suﬀers a welfare loss and may only be willing to purchase the illiquid
asset at a discount relative to what he would be willing to pay for the fully liquid
asset.
      Speciﬁcally, let T denote the horizon over which an investor faces illiquidity
constraints on his holdings of an asset. Let XT denote the value of the investor’s
position at time T if the investor were able to follow his preferred stopping rule in
selling the asset and then reinvesting the proceeds in the riskless asset. Similarly,
let YT denote the value of the investor’s position at time T by following the best
stopping rule allowed him by the illiquidity of the asset and then reinvesting
the proceeds in the riskless asset. Clearly, if an investor has preferences over
stopping rules, then these two outcomes are not equivalent and the investor may
be unwilling to pay as much for the illiquid asset.
      Viewing illiquidity from this perspective suggests a very intuitive framework
for placing bounds on the discount for illiquidity. Recall that ex ante, the investor
would prefer to receive XT at time T , but will only receive YT because of the
illiquidity of the asset. However, if the investor were to be given an option that
allowed him to exchange XT for YT at time T (known as an exchange option),
then the investor would be made completely whole on an ex post basis. In
particular, an investor with a portfolio consisting of the illiquid asset and an
exchange option with cash ﬂow max(0, XT − YT ) at time T would end up with
YT + max(0, XT − YT ) = max(XT , YT ). This cash ﬂow, however, is greater
than or equal to the cash ﬂow XT that the investor would have received had
he purchased the liquid asset instead of the illiquid asset. A simple dominance
argument implies that the investor would prefer the portfolio of the illiquid asset
and the exchange option to owning the liquid asset. In turn, this implies that the
sum of the values of the illiquid asset and the exchange option should be greater
than or equal to that of the liquid asset, or alternatively, that the value of the
exchange option represents an upper bound on the discount for illiquidity.


                4. THE DISCOUNT FOR ILLIQUIDITY

As discussed above, the task of ﬁnding the upper bound on the discount for illiq-
I. For a discussion of stopping times, see Karatzas and Shreve (1988).


                                         6
uidity can be reduced to solving for the value of the exchange option. To do this,
three elements are required. First, we need to specify a valuation framework for
the exchange option. Second, we need to specify the restrictions that illiquidity
places on the stopping rules available to an investor. Third, we need to specify
the unrestricted stopping rule that would be followed by the investor in the fully
liquid case.
     Let St be the price per share of an asset, where the share is fully liquid
and can be traded continuously in the ﬁnancial markets without frictions. Now
imagine that there is a share of the same asset that is less liquid. The value of
this illiquid share can be expressed as γSt , where γ is presumably less than or
equal to one. The diﬀerence between the values of the two shares represents the
discount for illiquidity.
     As the valuation framework for the exchange option, we adopt the familiar
Black-Scholes option-pricing setting. Speciﬁcally, we assume that the dynamics
of St are given by the following geometric Brownian motion process under the
risk-neutral pricing measure,


                            dS = r S dt + σ S dZ,                                (1)

where r is the constant riskless rate, σ is the volatility of continuously com-
pounded returns, and dZ is the increment of a standard Brownian motion. For
simplicity, we assume for the present that the asset does not pay any dividends
or cash ﬂows before time T . This assumption, however, will be relaxed later.
      Since our objective is to solve for the upper bound on the discount for
illiquidity, our approach will be to specify the restricted and unrestricted stopping
rules in a way that maximizes the value of the exchange option. Accordingly,
we will assume the worst case scenario for the eﬀect of illiquidity on the investor
choice of stopping rules. Speciﬁcally, we will adopt the convention that once the
illiquid asset is purchased at time zero, it cannot be sold again until time T .
Thus, the illiquid asset is completely nonmarketable from time zero to time T .
This implies that an investor who buys the illiquid asset at time zero has only
one stopping rule available; selling the asset at time T . As a result, the cash ﬂow
received at time T from following this stopping rule is simply YT = ST .
     Before turning to the speciﬁcation of the stopping rule in the fully liquid
case, we need several preliminary results. First, let τ , 0 ≤ τ ≤ T , denote the
time at which the stopping rule chosen by the investor results in the liquid asset
being sold. The cash ﬂow received by the investor from selling the liquid asset
at time τ and reinvesting the proceeds in the riskless asset is XT = Sτ er(T −τ ) .
     Second, substituting these expressions for XT and YT into the expression
for the payoﬀ from an exchange option implies that the cash ﬂow at time T from

                                         7
the exchange option is given by

                            max(0, Sτ er(T −τ ) − ST ).                        (2)

As shown, this cash ﬂow depends on the asset price at both the stopping time τ
and the ﬁnal date T . An important implication of this is that once the stopping
time τ is reached, the value of Sτ is known and is no longer stochastic. This
means that as of time τ , the exchange option can be viewed as a simple put
option on the asset value with a ﬁxed strike price of Sτ er(T −τ ) . Thus, as shown
in the Appendix (which provides the derivation for this and all other results in
the paper), the value of the option at time τ is given by simply substituting in
the current stock price Sτ and the strike price Sτ er(T −τ ) into the Black-Scholes
formula for puts,
                                               
               Sτ N    2                  2
                      σ (T − τ )/2 − N − σ (T − τ )/2 ,                        (3)

where N ( · ) is the standard normal distribution. This expression for the value
of the option as of the stopping time τ is true for any stopping rule.
     Third, to solve for the initial or time zero value of the exchange option, we
simply take the present value of receiving a cash ﬂow at time τ equal to the value
of the put given in Equation (3),
                                                     
          E e−rτ Sτ N   σ 2 (T − τ )/2 − N − σ 2 (T − τ )/2     ,              (4)

where the expectation is taken with respect to the joint distribution of Sτ and
the stopping time τ . Given this structure, we can now specify the stopping rule
for the liquid case that maximizes the value of the exchange option. This can
be obtained by solving for the stopping rule that maximizes the expression given
above,

                                                       
        max E e−rτ Sτ N   σ 2 (T − τ )/2 − N − σ 2 (T − τ )/2     .            (5)
          τ


      As shown in the Appendix, the stopping rule that maximizes the value of
the exchange option has a surprisingly simple form. The maximizing stopping
rule is simply to sell the liquid asset immediately at time zero. Thus, τ = 0.
The intuition for this result is easily understood. By compensating an investor
for illiquidity in a way that allows them to attain the maximum of XT and YT ,
the investor has a strong incentive to ensure that XT and YT are as diﬀerent
as possible. By stopping at time zero, the exchange option allows the investor

                                        8
to choose between payoﬀs linked to the most divergent values of the asset price
possible: S0 and ST .
     Finally, to obtain the maximized value of the exchange option, we simply
substitute the maximizing stopping rule τ = 0 into Equation (4). It is easily
shown that the resulting value for the exchange option and upper bound on the
discount for illiquidity is given by
                                 √                     √       
                     S0       N        σ 2 T /2       − N − σ T /2
                                                             2        .           (6)

This closed-form solution for the value of the exchange option has a very simple
structure. In particular, the value of the exchange option is an explicit function
of both the length of the illiquidity horizon T and the volatility of the liquid asset
as measured by σ.
     The discount for illiquidity is easily shown to be an increasing function of
both the illiquidity horizon T and the volatility parameter σ. These comparative
statics results are intuitive since an increase in T restricts the stopping rules
available to the investor further, while an increase in σ increases the opportunity
cost of not being able to trade.
    Given the closed-form solution for the exchange option, the lower bound on
the value of the illiquid asset is given by simply subtracting the value of the
exchange option from the value of an equivalent liquid asset.


                                       5. DISCUSSION

These results for the lower bound on the value of illiquid or thinly-traded se-
curities have many interesting asset pricing implications. To illustrate, Table
1 reports the lower bounds for illiquidity horizons ranging from one day to 30
years, and for volatilities ranging from 10 to 50 percent.
     Table 1 shows that illiquidity can have a dramatic eﬀect on asset values. In
particular, the price of an investment could be discounted by as much as 20 to
40 percent for illiquidity horizons ranging from two to ﬁve years. Furthermore,
asset prices could be discounted by more than 50 percent for illiquidity horizons
of ten years or longer.
     Although our results provide only lower bounds on the values of illiquid
or thinly-traded assets, these lower bounds are actually consistent with empiri-
cal evidence about discounts for illiquidity. For example, Amihud, Lauterbach,
and Mendelsen (1997) ﬁnd that when stocks move from an exchange in which
they only traded at discrete points in time to one where they are traded semi-

and Eleswarapu (1998) ﬁnd that when an exchange rule allowing forward trad-
ing was abolished for some stocks, the liquidity of the aﬀected stocks declined
sharply and their prices fell by about 15 percent relative to the prices of stock not
aﬀected. Silber (1991) documents that restricted stocks—stocks that investors
cannot trade for two years after they are acquired—are placed privately at an
average discount of 34 percent relative to fully liquid shares. For a in-depth dis-
cussion of the empirical evidence on the eﬀects of illiquidity on asset prices, see
Amihud, Mendelson, and Pedersen (2005).
     The eﬀects of illiquidity can also be substantial even for relatively short
horizons. Table 1 shows that a one-day illiquidity horizon implies a lower bound
on the value of an illiquid asset ranging from 99.75 to 98.74 percent of the value
of the liquid asset. Similarly, for a one-week horizon, the lower bound ranges
from 99.45 to 97.23 percent of the value of the liquid asset.
     These results imply that the discounts for illiquidity horizons measured in
days are surprising large. For example, an investor who bought an illiquid asset
at a discount of one percent, but was then able to sell a day later at the fully-
liquid price would realize a huge annualized rate of return on the transaction.
This suggests that the value of immediacy (the ability to sell immediately) could
represent one of the large types of risk premia in ﬁnancial markets.
      To explore this, we compute the annualized discounts for illiquidity by di-
viding the discounts implied by the results in Table 1 by the illiquidity horizons.
These annualized discounts are reported in Table 2. As shown, the annualized
discounts for short horizons such as a day or a week can be orders of magnitude
greater than those for longer horizons. For example, the annualized discount for
illiquidity for a one-day horizon is approximately 16 times as large as that for a
one-year horizon.
     As an alternative way of viewing these results, Table 3 reports the marginal
discount of illiquidity as the illiquidity horizon ranges from one to 20 days. Specif-
ically, we report the discount for a one-day horizon, the marginal or incremental
increase in the discount as the horizon is increased to two days from one day, the
marginal or incremental increase in the discount as the horizon is increased to
three days from two days, and so forth.
     As illustrated in Table 3, the discount for illiquidity for the ﬁrst day is much
larger than for the second, third, etc. days. In particular, the discount for the
ﬁrst day of illiquidity is 2.41 times that for the second day, 3.15 times that for the
third day, 8.83 times that for the 20th day, and 32.33 times the discount for the
day one year later. Clearly, liquidity today is worth much more than liquidity
tomorrow.
    These results are consistent with the literature on the value of immediacy.
For example, Demsetz (1968) deﬁnes immediacy as the price concession that

                                         10
would be needed to transact immediately. Our results indicate that this price
concession could be relatively large, particularly for assets with higher return
volatilities such as stocks. Other papers that focus on the valuation of immedi-
acy include Stoll (2000) who develops a regression based model of the price of
immediacy. Grossman and Miller (1988) model market liquidity as being deter-
mined by the supply and demand for immediacy.
     The lower bounds in Table 1 also illustrate an interesting symmetry between
the length of the illiquidity horizon and the volatility of the asset. In particular,
doubling the volatility has essentially the same on the lower bound as quadrupling
the length of the illiquidity horizon. The reason for this symmetry is easily seen
from the expression for the lower bound in Equation (6). As shown, the lower
bound depends on volatility and length of the illiquidity horizon only through
the product σ 2 T .
     From an intuitive perspective, this means that neither volatility nor the
length of the illiquidity horizon are fundamental in determining the lower bound.
Rather, it is the total realized variance σ 2 T before the asset can be traded again
that matters. This implies that volatility and the timing of illiquidity are funda-
mentally entangled in the sense that their eﬀects are indistinguishable from each
other.
     This notion of entanglement may also help explain why some assets such
Treasury bills are viewed as inherently more liquid than stocks even when orders
for either can be executed within seconds. Since stocks have higher volatility,
their lower bounds will always be smaller than is the case for Treasury bills
even when both are tradable at the same frequency. Liquidity is not simply
a function of market microstructure. Rather, it depends also on the inherent
riskiness of the underlying asset. These considerations may help explain why
concerns about liquidity become particularly acute during volatile high-stress
periods in the ﬁnancial markets.


                     6. EXTENSION TO DIVIDENDS

In this section, we extend the analysis to the situation in which the asset pays
dividends, coupons, or other cash payouts over time. This situation diﬀers from
the earlier case in that when an investor sells the liquid asset, the investor no
longer receives the stream of dividends. In contrast, the holder of an illiquid
asset continues to receive dividends until the illiquidity horizon is reached. For
symmetry, we will assume that dividends are reinvested in the riskless asset as
they are received.
     Given this structure, the value XT of the investor’s
                                                      τ position at time T from
following the optimal stopping rule is Sτ er(T −τ ) + 0 ρs er(T −s) ds where ρs is

                                         11
the dividend (assumed continuous). The value YT of the investor’s position at
                                                            T
time T from following the restricted stopping rule is ST + 0 ρs er(T −s) ds. As
before, the upper bound on the discount for illiquidity is given by the value of
the exchange option with cash ﬂow at time T of max(0, XT − YT ).
     Despite the introduction of dividends into the framework, the Appendix
shows that the stopping strategy that maximizes the value of this exchange option
is identical. Speciﬁcally, the maximizing stopping rule is to sell the liquid asset
immediately at time zero, τ = 0. The intuition for this result is the same as
before; the value of the exchange option is maximized when the value of XT and
YT are as divergent as possible.
      The speciﬁc functional form of the exchange option will clearly depend on
the nature of the dividend stream ρt . To provide some examples of the eﬀect
of dividends on the discount for illiquidity, we will make the standard assump-
tion that the underlying asset has a constant dividend yield. Speciﬁcally, we
assume that the dividend is ρSt , where ρ is a constant. Given this assump-
tion, the asset price dynamics in Equation (1) imply that dividends are random
and conditionally lognormally distributed. Sums of lognormals, however, are not
lognormal which implies that the exchange option does not have a simple closed-
form solution. Accordingly, we will solve for the value of the exchange option via
straightforward simulation. Table 4 presents lower bounds for the value of the
illiquid asset for dividend yields ranging from zero to eight percent, and where
volatility is held ﬁxed at 30 percent.
      As shown, dividends can have a major eﬀect on the discount for illiquidity,
particularly for longer horizons. For example, the lower bound for a 30-year
horizon is 41.131 percent when the dividend yield is zero, and 71.604 percent
when the dividend yield is eight percent. Table 4 also shows that discount for
illiquidity decreases as the dividend yield increases. This result is intuitive since
by receiving dividends, an investor in an illiquid asset is able to convert some of
his position into cash sooner than if the asset did not pay dividends. Thus, the
illiquidity constraint is partially relaxed by the payment of dividends.
     These results have many important implications for illiquid investments such
as partnerships, private equity, venture capital, closely-held ﬁrms, etc. Specif-
ically, these results suggest that investors in these types of assets have strong
economic incentives to accelerate the payment of distributions, dividends, and
other cash ﬂows to reduce the impact of illiquidity on their holdings.


                               7. CONCLUSION

We model illiquidity as a restriction on the stopping rules that an investor can
follow in selling asset holdings. We use this framework to derive realistic lower

                                         12
bounds on the value of illiquid and thinly-traded investments.
     A number of important asset pricing insights emerge from this analysis.
For example, we show that immediacy plays a unique role and is much more
highly valued than ongoing liquidity. In addition, we show that illiquidity can
reduce the value of an asset substantially. For illiquidity horizons on the order
of those common in private equity, the discount for illiquidity can be as much as
30 to 50 percent. Although large in magnitude, these discounts are consistent
with the empirical evidence on the valuation of thinly-traded assets. Thus, these
lower bounds could be useful in determining reservation prices and providing
conservative valuations in situations where other methods of valuation are not
available.
     Finally, we ﬁnd that the discount for illiquidity decreases as the cash ﬂow
generated by the underlying asset increases. Thus, investors in private ventures
may have strong incentives to increase dividends and other cash ﬂows to reduce
the impact of illiquidity on their holdings. This implies that the illiquid nature
of investments in partnerships, private equity, venture capital, LBOs, etc. has
the potential to introduce agency conﬂicts as cash ﬂow policy is impacted.

The value of the investor’s portfolio at time T if he is allowed to follow the
optimal stopping rule is XT = Sτ er(T −τ ) . The value of the investor’s portfolio
at time T if he is not allowed to sell until time T is YT = ST . Substituting these
expressions into the payoﬀ function max(0, XT − YT ) for the exchange option
gives Equation (2).
     The Black-Scholes formula for the time-t value of a European put with strike
price K and time until expiration of T − t is given by


                         Ke−r(T −t) N (−d2 ) − St N (−d1 ),                     (A1)

where



                            ln(St /K) + (r + σ 2 /2)(T − t)
                       d1 =                                ,                   (A2)
                                       σ 2 (T − t)
                              
                       d2 = d1 σ 2 (T − t).                                     (A3)


At the stopping time τ , the value of Sτ is known and is no longer stochastic.
Thus, the value of the exchange option as of time τ is simply the present value
of a put option on with strike price Sτ er(T −τ ) and time until expiration of T − τ .
Substituting these values into the Black-Scholes formula above gives the value of
the exchange option at time τ ,

which is Equation (3).
     Standard results now imply that the value at time zero of the exchange
option can be obtained by discounting the value in Equation (A4),

where the expectation is taken with respect to the joint distribution of Sτ and
the stopping time τ under the risk-neutral measure.
     To ﬁnd the stopping rule that maximizes the value of the exchange option
at time zero, we rewrite Equation (A5) as

                                         17
                                                    

     τ


where the inner expectation is taken with respect to the distribution of Sτ con-
ditional on τ . From the dynamics of S given in Equation (1), it is readily shown
that



                   e−rτ Sτ = e−rτ S0 exp (r − σ 2 /2)τ + σZτ ,                  (A7)
                                              2
                              = S0 exp −σ τ /2 + σZτ .                          (A8)


The expression in Equation (A8), however, is an exponential martingale. Thus,
E[e−rτ Sτ ] = S0 for all τ because of the strong Markov property of St .
    Substituting this last result into Equation (A6) gives
                                                                
          S0 max E        N        σ 2 (T − τ )/2 − N − σ 2 (T − τ )/2     .    (A9)
               τ


From the properties of the standard normal distribution function, however, it
is easily shown that N (x) − N (−x), where x > 0, is an increasing function of
x. Thus, the expression in Equation (A9) is maximized when τ takes the lowest
value possible. In turn, this implies that the the stopping rule that maximizes
the value of the exchange option in Equation (A9) is to stop immediately, τ = 0.
Substituting this result into Equation (5) leads to the maximized value of the
exchange option given in Equation (6).
     As an alternative derivation of this last result, we could proceed recursively
to show that at time T − , the value of the exchange option is maximized by
stopping rather than stopping at time T . Similarly, the value of the exchange
option is maximized by stopping at time T − 2 rather than at time T − , and so
forth. This recursive argument again shows that the maximizing stopping rule
is τ = 0.
     Diﬀerentiating the exchange option value in Equation (6) with respect to σ
gives

                                                     √
                                     S0 exp(σ 2 T /8) T ,                      (A10))

which is positive. Similarly, diﬀerentiating the exchange option value with respect
to T gives

    Turning to the case with dividends, the asset price dynamics are given by

This last equation can also be expressed as

                             Sτ Eτ [max (0, 1 − W )] ,                       (A20)

where W is a martingale and is independent of Sτ . It is readily seen that the
variance of W is a decreasing function of τ because of the independence of Brow-
nian increments. From Theorem 8 of Merton (1973), this implies that the value
of the exchange option at time τ is a decreasing function of τ . Following a similar
line of reasoning as above, this implies that the time-zero value of the exchange
option is maximized by setting τ = 0.
