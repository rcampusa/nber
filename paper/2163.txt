                     The International Monetary System:
                           Should It Be Reformed?


                                    ABSTRACT


        This paper addresses the
                                   question of reform of the
                                                               international
  monetary system. It starts by
                                    identifying the sources of
                                                                 disenchantment
  with the performance of
                             the present regime of
                                                     floating exchange rates
  and by Outlining the reasons for the lack of
                                                  convergence of views about
  the characteristics of the desired system. A
                                                     central theme in the dis-
  cussion is that a reform of
                                the monetary system Without a fundamental
  change in macroeconomic policies
                                     may be harmful. The analysis
                                                                     proceeds
 by examining the broader issues and principles
                                                     relevant for an evaluation
 of reform. The key
                       questions are: what should be
                                                         reformed, what are the
 costs of reform and when should
                                    the reform occur. In this context special
 attention is given to the
                             "target—zones" proposal for exchange rate
 management. The paper concludes
                                    with the observation that a reform of
 the system should not be vIewed as an instrument for
                                                        crisis management
 dominated by short—term
                          considerations, but rather should be
                                                                guided by
long—term perspective. It is argued that if the root cause of
                                                                  the current
economic difficulties is fiscal imbalances In the world
                                                           economy, then a
drastic reform of the
                       international monetary system (if one is needed)
might better wait until nations
                                   restore a more sustainable course of
fiscal management.

          A casual glance through the proceedings of past annual meetings of the

 American Economic Association reveals that
                                                     in almost every year during the
 past twenty years presidents of the AEA have devoted at least one session to
 an examination of issues concerning the
                                                    international monetary system.
 Prominent on the agenda has been the question of reform. How should the

 international monetary system be reformed so as to function more effectively?

 The premise underlying this question is that the international
                                                                       monetary system
 has failed and that it must be reformed
                                             by an institutional change. In what
 follows I present some skeptical notes on both the verdict on the failure of

 the system and on some proposals for reform, especially the
                                                             target-zones
 proposal.

         To set the stage it is worth noting that one of the main sources of
 disenchantments with the present monetary system has been the unpredictability

of exchange rates. There has been
                                    nothing more confusing than reading through
the ex-post journalistic    explanations offered for the day-to-day changes in
the U.S. dollar. For example,
                                over the past few years we were told that "The
dollar fell because the money supply grew faster than expected -
                                                                 -           thereby
generating inflationary expectations," but on another occasion we were told
that "The dollar rse because
                                    the money supply grew faster than expected-
thereby generating expectations that the Fed is likely to tighten
                                                                  up and raise
interest rates." On another date we were told that "The dollar fell since the

budget deficit exceeded previous forecasts    -   - thereby   generating inflationary
expectations on the belief that the Fed will have to monetize the deficit,"

but, on another occasion we were told that "The dollar rose since the
                                                                      budget
deficit exceeded previous forecasts - - thereby
                                                      generating expectations that
government borrowing - needs will drive up interest rates since the
                                                                    Fed is be
unlikely to give up its firm stance." On yet another day we were told that
"The dollar fell since oil prices fell - - thereby
                                                          hurting Mexico and other

                                          whose bad fortune may bring about the
debt-ridden oil-producing countries
                                                                      told that
collapse of important U.S. banks," but, on another occasion we were
                 since oil prices fell - - thereby
                                                   helping the debt-ridden oil-
"The dollar

consuming countries whose improved fortune will help the vulnerable position

of important U.S. banks." More recently the dollar changed again, and this
time the explanation was a bit more sophisticated "The dollar changed because

the extent of the revision of the estimated GNP growth rate was smaller than
                                                 of these estimates." One cannot
the expected revision of previous forecasts

but sympathize with the difficulties         shared by newspaper reporters and

financial analysts who feel obligated to come up with daily explanations for

daily fluctuations of exchange rates,         and one can only imagine the deep

frustration that yielded the recent headline in the International Herald
Tribune according to which "The dollar rose on no news."

           The dismal performance of short-term forecasting does not reflect a

 lack of effort. Rather, it is an intrinsic characteristic of efficient asset

markets.     Difficulties in forecasting short-term indices of stock markets

 (like the Dow-Jones index) do not call however, for a reform of the way stock

 markets operate. For similar reasons one should not assess the performance of

 the international monetary system on the basis of short-term forecastability

 of exchange rates.      This does not imply of course that the present monetary

 system is without faults or       that it should not be reformed. It implies,

 however, that if a reform is warranted then it better be justified on dif-

 ferent grounds.
           A second noteworthy observation is that over the years both academics

 and policy makers have made numerous proposals for reform while, at the same

 time, the monetary system itself has been in a constant state of change. It
 evolved from the gold standard to paper money, from the Bretton Woods system
                                        3


  to managed float.     We also had the Gold Commission but
                                                              stayed with floating
  rates and now attention is focused on target zones, with soft or hard margins.

          In spite of the ongoing debate there seems to be little convergence of

 views about the characteristics of the desired system. This lack of conver-

 gence in my view does not reflect lack of effort.
                                                         Rather, it reflects more
 fundamental factors that are unlikely to vanish over time. Several
                                                                    are
 noteworthy. First, participants in the debate have not shared the presumption

 concerning the relevant alternative to the
                                              system they promote. Thus, extreme
 promoters of fixed rates believe that the relevant choice is between a "good

 fix" and a "bad flex"; on the other
                                       hand, extreme promoters of flexible rates
 believe that the relevant choice is between a "bad fix" and a "good flex." As

 is obvious, if these are the alternative choices the outcomes are self-evi-

 dent, for who would not prefer a "good fix" over a "bad flex?" And, by the

 same token, who would not prefer a "good flex" over a "bad fix?" In reality,

however, the choices are much more complex and much less trivial since
                                                                        they
may involve comparisons between a "good fix" and
                                                 a "good flex" or, even more
frequently, between a "bad fix" and a "bad flex." When these are the choices,

one may expect lack of unanimity. Reasonable
                                                 people may also differ in their
assessments of which "good" system is more likely to gravitate toward its
"bad" counterpart.    Furthermore, the likelihood that a given "good" system
would deteriorate and be transformed into its "bad" counterpart depends
                                                                        on the
circumstances and, therefore, it is likely that some countries would be wise

to choose greater fixity of rates while other countries would be
                                                                 equally wise
to choose greater flexibility.

        Second, there are different concepts of the "equilibrium" exchange
rate and not all participants in the debate
                                              share the same concept. A trivial
definition would identify the equilibrium rate as the one that is generated
                                                                         by
the free operation of the market place. A more subtle definition
                                                                 emphasizes
                                     4


the sustainability of policies as the criterion for equilibrium. Accordingly,

if for example, the current exchange rate reflects unsustainable budget
                                                                          it
deficits, then this rate is not viewed as an equilibrium rate even though

reflects equality between demand and supply in the market place. An even more
                                               of the exchange rate as the ul-
subjective view emphasizes the consequences

timate criterion.     Accordingly, if the exchange rate yields undesirable
                                               allocation, unemployment and the
results in terms of growth, export, resource

like, then this rate is not viewed as an equilibrium rate even though it
emerges from the market place and reflects sustainable policies.
        Third, different countries face different shocks. On purely theoreti-

cal grounds it is clear that the appropriate exchange-rate regime depends on

the nature and origin of shocks. Are the shocks real or monetary? Are they

induced by the private sector or by the public sector is their origin domestic
                                    transitory? The list of questions is long
or foreign? Are they permanent or
and circumstances vary across countries and over time.

         Fourth, the cost of mistaken policies       and the ability to correct

 errors differ across countries. They depend on the exchange-rate regime and

 on the structural characteristics of the economy. Countries differ from each
 other in the flexibility of their economic system (e.g., the degree of wage

 jndexation, labor mobility, external and internal debt position) as well as in

 the flexibility of the policy making process (e.g. the speed by which fiscal

 and monetary policies can be assessed and modified).

         Fifth, countries differ from each other according to the various

 criteria governing the choice of optimal currency areas.          These criteria

 include the degree of openness of the economy, the size of the economy, the

 degree of commodity diversification,     the degree of inflation rates among

 prospective members, the degree of capital        mobility, the degree of other

                       of integration (like custom unions), the degree         of
 prevailing   forms
                                         5


  similarities of tax structures and
                                             other fiscal characteristics and the
  degree of similarities of external and domestic
                                                     monetary and real shocks.
          Sixth, views differ about the functions of
                                                          exchange rates in general
  and of market mechanisms in
                                 particular. On the one hand there are those who
 believe that exchange rates are just a nuisance, especially if
                                                                 they move, and
 anything that moves had better be stopped (one only wonders whether
                                                                     proponents
 of this view would also like to
                                  see greater fixity of stock market indices?).
 There are also those who, in
                                spite of the meager evidence, advocate the bubble
 theory according to which exchange rates have "life of their own" unrelated to
 "fundamentals."   On the other hand there are those who
                                                            view exchange rates as
 an important gauge which provides valuable information about current as well

 as prospective policies.       According to this view manipulating the
                                                                          exchange
 rate by intervention and blaming the
                                                volatility, unpredictability and
misalignment on the monetary system makes as much sense as blaming the
messenger for conveying bad news.

         Finally, there are also different views about
                                                              the advisability and
effectiveness of foreign-exchange
                                     intervention. In spite of growing evidence
that the effectiveness of sterilized intervention in exchange-rate
                                                                   management
is very limited (at least        as it operates through the portfolio-balance
mechanism), there are those who are still ready to rely on such intervention.

In principle, sterilized intervention
                                             can be effective by signalling to the
market the intent of policy makers.      Since the credibility, and thereby the

effectiveness, of such signals, depend on the track record of past Policies,
circumstances differ across countries.

        The foregoing arguments explain why views about the need for, and the
desired characteristics of a reform are likely to differ across countries
                                                                          and
are not likely to converge with the passage of time.

policies in the U.S., West Germany and Japan, are at the root-cause of the

will not do any good and may in fact do harm by diverting attention from the

root-cause of the problem to the monetary system.

        There is also the view that the system has failed since it did not

yield current-account balance among          the major trading partners. Taken by

itself, however, this should be viewed as one of the achievements of the

 smooth out consumption in spite of real shocks should not be viewed as a

 failure.
            We may also wish to ask whether the United States could have carried

 out its highly successful disinflation policy of the early l980s while com-

 mitted to fixed exchange rates?            I believe not! The key point that needs

 emphasis is that the volatility and the misalignment of exchange rates may not

 be the source of the difficulties but rather a manifestation of the prevailing

 package of macroeconomic policies. Fixing or manipulating the rates without

 introducing a significant change into the conduct of policies may not improve

 matters at all. It may amount to breaking the thermometer of a patient suf-

 fering from high fever instead of providing him with proper medication. The

 absence of the thermometer will only confuse matters and will reduce the

   information essential for
                                 Policymaking. If volatile events and macropoljcjes
   are not allowed to be         reflected in the foreign
                                                              exchange market, they are
   likely to be transferred
                                  to, and reflected in, other
                                                           markets (such as labor
   markets) where they cannot be dealt with in as efficient
                                                            a manner.
             The preceding
                             argument ignores, however, one of the important charac-
   teristics     of   the gold-dollar    system -    the imposition of discipline.
  Accordingly, it could be         argued that the obligation to
                                                                    peg the rate or to
  follow a predetermined
                             intervention rule would alter

  of policy by introducing discipline. This
                                             view, however, is questionable for
  two reasons.   First, it could equally be
                                            argued that by being highly visible
  flexible exchange rates also impose discipline
                                                          since current and (expected)
  future policies
                      are immediately made transparent to both private and
                                                                           public
  sectors at home and abroad.
                                  Indeed, the G-5 Plaza
                                                     agreement of September 1985
 may be viewed as a manifestation of the disciplinary
                                                        capabilities of flexible
 exchange rates.    Furthermore, it may be argued that national
                                                                 governments are
 unlikely to adjust the conduct of domestic policies
                                                      so as to be disciplined
                                                                              by
 the exchange rate regime. Rather, it is
                                             more reasonable to assume that       the
 exchange rate regime is
                                likely to adjust to whatever
                                                                  discipline national
 governmen5 choose to have.
                                    It may be noted in passing that this is indeed
 one of the more potent
                          arguments against the restoration
                                                               of the gold standard.
 If governmen were willing to follow policies
                                                    consistent with the maintenance
of a gold standard, then
                             the gold standard itself would not be
                                                                      necessary; if,
however, governments
                    were not willing to follow
                                               such policies, then the
introduction of the gold
                               standard per se would not
                                                            restore stability since,
before long, the standard would have to be abandoned.

  monetary policies and may be
                                      very costly in terms of the overall economic
  system.

            An argument favoring target zones is that the
                                                          very process of negotia-
  tions is likely to enhance the degree of international
                                                         policy coordination.
  It must be noted, however,
                                    that successful coordination efforts have also
  occurred during the past decade        (e.g., the U.S. dollar support package of
  November 1978, the Bonn      economic summit of 1978 and
                                                                most recently the C-S
  agreement of September 1985).
                                     Further, it might be argued that coordination
  should not be complete, because
                                     the perception of independent
                                                                      monetary policy
 may be necessary for sustaining confidence that monetary
                                                          policy will not be
 inflationary in the long run.
                                       In addition, there is the danger that the
 processs of negotiating
                             target zones could produce dangerous
                                                                  frictions among
 the negotiating parties     and could lead
                                                 ultimately to a reduced level of
 coordination in this and other areas.

        Every system must have a safety valve which allows some
                                                                flexibility

                                                  every conflict. With misaligned

                               monetary policies geared towards exchangerate

                                   may be forced to exercise their
                                                                      sovereignty by

has been the case under
                           the present system of floating rates with independent
monetary policy. The growing frustration
                                               with the efforts to reduce the U.S.
fiscal deficit by     conventional measures have         brought about new desperate
arguments for the adoption of
                               protectionist measures like import surcharges.
The danger with such recommendations is that they
                                                  might receive the political
support of two otherwise unrelated
                                       groups. They are likely to gain the sup-
port of the traditional advocates
                                      of protectionism who claim to defend local
industry and workers from what they believe is foreign unfair

                                                                 monetary system
  is not complete unless it provides an explicit resolution
                                                            to this n-l problem.
  Therefore, it is essential to ask how the various
                                                      proposals, including those
  for target zones, deal with the extra degree of freedom.

            As a general rule,       a reform of the system should
                                                                      not viewed as an
  instrument for crisis management. The considerations
                                                                appropriate for crisis
 management focus on .hort-term effectiveness.
                                                      In contrast the considerations
 appropriate for designing the
                                    optimal monetary system should be governed by a
 inz-term perspective          The two need not coincide        and it is sensible to
 separate them.        In the present context the short-term crisis
                                                                    concerns the
 fiscal imbalances in the
                              world economy rather than the monetary system. To be
 sure, the existing international
                                        monetary system is not perfect and it
                                                                                might
 benefit from a face lift or even from a more drastic
                                                      reform. But such a
 reform should better wait until nations restore a
                                                   more sustainable course of
 fiscal management.

          A reform of the international
                                             monetary system should be viewed as a
constitutional change that should not be taken lightly.
                                                                The success of a new
monetary arrangement depends on the adoption of a consistent set of
                                                                              policy
tools and on a reasonable
                             understanding of the implications of each course of
action.     In these matters the cost of
                                         delaying the adoption of a new interna-
tional monetary       arrangement until its full implications
                                                                   are understood is
likely to be small relative to the cost of a premature implementation
                                                                                 The
various   proposals   for reform of the present international
                                                                monetary system have

many attractions.   But since they are novel, prudence is clearly called for.

More discussions and critical evaluations can
                                                be highly desirable. In view of

this it may be a good place to conclude with a quote from John Maynard Keynes'
                                                   Bretton Woods Conference held
remarks in his closing speech at the original
                                   the desirability of critical evaluations of
over 40 years ago. Speaking on
the proposed system Keynes said: "1 am greatly encouraged, I confess, by the

critical, sceptical and even carping spirit in which our proceedings have been

watched and welcomed in the outside world. How much better that our projects

should begin in disillusion than that they should       in   it!"
