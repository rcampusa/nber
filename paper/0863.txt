            Rational Expectations and the Foreign Exchange Market




                                  lths   tract

      Many models of exchange rate determination imply that movements in

money supplies and demands should result in movements in exchange rates.

Hence, if rational agents are attempting to forecast exchange rate movements,

they should in the first instance forecast movements in the supplies of and

demands for money balances. Furthermore, if these underlying variables follow

some stable autoregressive processes agents should use those processes to

make their forecasts. If we identify the forward rate with the market's

expectation for the future spot rate, rationality of expectations will imply

testable cross-equation restrictions in a joint model of the autoregressions

and exchange rate forecasting equation. This strategy is implemented in the

paper using data on the   UK/$US and DM/$US exchange rates from the recent

floating rate period.

    In this paper I test the hypothesis that expectations of exchange

rate movements are formed rationally. To do so, I need, in addition to

the hypothesis of rational expectations, a theory of the determinants

of exchange rate movements. I shall first consider a very simple "mone-

tary approach" model of exchange rate determination. A serious defect

of the model considered in this paper is that it ignores the possibility

of a simultaneous determination of the exchange rate along with macro-

economic variables. However, it extends previous models in this genre by

attempting to distinguish the effects of changes in expectations on ex-

change rates from the effects of changes in underlying determining variables

apart from expectations. Furthermore, it does this in a context where the

assumption of rationality of expectations can be tested.

     In the second part of the paper I shall present some results for the

U.S. dollar/German Deutschmark and U.S. dollar/Pound Sterling exchange

rates in the most recent floating rate period. In the final section I

examine a model similar to one studied by Frenkel (l9SI). However, I am

able to test for rationality of expectations where Frenkel could not.

     I have chosen to emphasize the test of rationality in the paper for

two reasons. First the test of rationality, unlike the tests of the re-

strictions implied by the simple monetary model, does not depend on the

validity of the exogeneity assumptions. If we do find a rejection of

the cross equation restrictions implied by rationality this is indeed a

rejection either of the assumption that expectations are formed rationally
                                                                    2.



or that the forward premium differs from the rationally expected depreci—

ation or appreciation by no more than a constant term. Second, I have

tested two alternative models of exchange rate determination and while

both lead to valid tests of rationality (given our assumption on the for—

ward rate) they do not arise from a single simple model.


I. Simple Monetary Approach Model

     Proponents of the monetary approach to exchange rate determination

view the exchange rate as the relative price of two monies. They therefore

argue that variables affecting the supply of and demand for two monies will

affect the rate of exchange between them. Quite a few studies have tested

the monetary approach to exchange rate determination and some of the earlier

ones are collected in Frenkel and Johnson (1978).

     Since money is a durable asset it has been argued that expectations

about the values of variables affecting its future supply of demand ("ex—

ogenous"2 variables) will be important determinants of current demand.

Suppose expectations of future movements in exogenous variables are influ—

enced by current movements in the same exogenous variables.3 Movements in

the exogenous variables would then affect money supply and demand directly,

but would also affect expectations and hence money demand. More signifi-

cantly, it is most probable that anticipated and unanticipated movements

in the exogenous variables will have quite different effects on exchange

rates. Frenkel (1979) has suggested that short run movements in exchange

rates are dominated by the effect of unanticipated movements in the exogenous

variables.

     Many previous tests of simple monetary models have included lagged

exogenous variables among the explanatory variables.   Insofar as the just—
                                                                          3.



ification for including these variables is that they are useful for proxying

expectations, an important source of restrictions on the distributed lags

has been ignored.

        The present study focuses on explaining errors in forecasting exchange

rate movements rather than the exchange rate movements themselves. This is

one way (also used in Frenkel (1979)) to separate out the effect of antici-

pated and unanticipated movements in the exogenous variables. Only unantici-

pated movements in the exogenous variable should lead to unanticipated move-

ments in the exchange rate. Rationality of expectations implies a set of

cross—equation restrictions on distributed lags. The conformity of these

restrictions with the data provides a test of rationality which I shall

implement in this paper.

        The statistical theory I shall use derives from a paper by Abel and

Mishkin (1979) and has been applied to a study of bond yields by Mishkin

(1981).

      Let S = Txl      vector of observations on the one period
                   percentage change in the exchange rate

and            =   Txl vector of observations on the errors in
                   the forecast of one period exchange rate changes
Hence
(1)                      S1 — E(S+il4)

      where        =   information   relevant to the pricing of foreign
                       exchange at time t+l available at time t.

Now suppose we have a theory which predicts


(2)         S1 =              +


where       X = Txk      matrix of observations on variables which
                   determine the exchange rate change S1 (X41 is
                   observed by agents at time t+l but not before)
                                                                       4.



              =    kx]. vector of coefficients.

Suppose the variables X follow a stochastic process

(3)
           X =     ZY   +

where       Z = Txl     matrix of observations on past information
                                       t—l,2,...,T) which is useful
                   z (i.e., z £
                   for predicting the elements of X

            y = lxk     matrix of coefficients

            v = Txk     matrix of errors

Now from (1) and (2)

               =
                   (Xt1
                            —
                                E(X+i$)) +   [u+i —   E(u+iIt)l
(4)
               =
               —   (Xt+l    _xe
                              t+].
                                  )$+ t+l

where I have defined

               =   Txk matrix of the one period ahead optimal
                   forecasts of X

               =   Txl vector of errors with E(c+iI) =            0


Now if expectations are rational then agents should use the process (3)

in forming expectations in (4). In other words we should find

 (5)
               =    (x—zY)8 + C

To test for rationality of expectations we estimate (3) and (5) jointly

and test for the quality of the y coefficients in the two sets of equations.

        An alternative procedure to estimating (3) and (5) jointly would be to

 first estimate (3) and then use the residuals from that regression in (5).

 The joint estimation is preferred for several reasons:

        (i) The two step procedure does not test whether expectations are

             optimal linear forecasts given the data on the right hand side

             of (3).
                                                                               5.



       (ii) The joint estimation will use information in both (3) and (5)

            to estimate               and y and will deliver more efficient estimates

            of these parameters.

      (iii) It is unlikely that the test statistics derived from the two—

            step procedure will be consistent since they do not take account

            of the variance—covariance structure in the regression from which

            the residuals are derived.

       To proceed we need an observable proxy for E(S÷iI), a theory of

exchange rate determination (2) and a forecasting equation (3) for the

right hand variables in (2).

        If traders in the forward foreign exchange market were not risk averse

and    future   prices were known with perfect foresight or were not correlated

with the future level of the exchange rate,4 we would expect to find


            tFt+l =            E(S+i)
where              is the one period forward rate at time t

       To allow for the possibility of risk aversion I shall assume


                       =                   —
                            E(St+iI$)           aS

                 domestic and foreign money demand.                   can be auto—

       However, the model (2)' is not estimated since the interest parity

condition implies that

which is an equation of the form (5). To test for rationality of expect-

ations, we can estimate (3)' and (5)' jointly and require that the y

coefficients in equation (5)' equal those in (3)'.

       It is important to realize that the                               coefficients in (5)' depend

on the forecasting parameters y in (3)', as well as elasticities in the

underlying money demand functions. In particular, therefore, changes in

policy which alter the y parameters in (3)' will alter the                                    parameters

in (5)'. This is a feature of rational expectations models which has been

emphasized by Lucas.8 In the present context it might make us pessimistic

about the chances of getting precise estimates of the                                  parameters in (5)'.

If the forecasting equations (3)' have varied over the sample period and

agents have been aware of these changes, then fitting a single time series

over the whole period will produce at least two sources of imprecision in

the estimates of the                    parameters. First, there will be errors in the

right hand side variables in (5)'. Second, the "true"                                   parameters will

have changed over the period.

     The tests of rationality can be strengthened by estimating the system

(3)' and (5)' jointly for two exchange rates. In this paper, I have jointly

estimated a U.S. do1lar/I sterling equation (5)' along with a U.S. dollar!

German DM equation (5)', If expectations are formed rationally, then the

forecast of U.S. variables agents use to preduct the $/Ja exchange rate should

be the same forecast they use to predict the $/DM exchange rate. Note, however,

that the c's for these two (5)' equations may be correlated. The c's

represent sources of forecast errors apart form errors in forecasting money

and income growths. It is quite likely that the same unaccounted source of

error will affect both exchange rates each period. I report one set of

estimates which do, and another which do not, allow for this correlation

between the c's

     I have been treating the unanticipated money and income shocks as

exogenous with respect to the unanticipated exchange rate error                .   If
monetary policy is varied in response to current innovations in £ then

the v, 's will be correlated with        t
                                             .     This   will bias the estimates
         it
of the        coefficients in (5)'. In fact, it is shown in Abel and Mishkin

(1979) that if          is unknown the           parameters are not identified.

and (5)' is needed to identify the beta parameters. The system (3)' and (5)'

cannot be estimated using standard full information maximum likelihood tech-

niques. The covariance matrix must be constrained if we are to get unique

estimates for the       parameters. In addition, unless the covariance matrix

is restricted, in a test of restrictions on the                 parameters the degrees

of freedom of the test statistic could be seriously over—estimated. In all

the estimates reported below I restricted                 = 0   and if this is invalid

the estimated       coefficients will be biased.

II. Estimation of the Simple Monetary Model

       I used Ml money stocks as reported in the IMP International Financial

Statistics. Data on industrial production were obtained from the same

source   to serve as proxies for Y and Y .                 The   exchange rate data were
taken from the Harris Trust and         Savings   Bank Weekly Bulletin. The monthly
observations    were taken on the last Friday of each month.

       We want a parsimonious set of forecasting equations (3)' to keep the

number of estimated parameters to a minimum. We cannot get much guidance

from   theory on which lags should be included and which excluded from (3)'.
I regressed each exogenous variable on 12 of its own                lagged   values and 12
lagged   values of the other exogenous variable from the same country. In

all cases this produced white noise residuals. Insignificant variables were

then dropped from the regressions. At each point the residuals were checked

to ensure they were still white noise. The forecasting equations arrived at

in this way were not altered after the joint estimation had been completed.

       Appendix 2 sets out the likelihood function for the joint model (3)'

and (5)' for the two exchange rates and discusses the method used to maximize

the likelihood function. If we denote the covariance matrix of the error

terms in (3)'     E   ,   the covariance matrix of the error terms in (5)' Z
and the covariance between v and                          we can distinguish two situations:
                                                  v   ,



       (a) Both           and        are diagonal so that the covariance matrix

             of the system (3)', (5)' is diagonal.

       (b) EV and E£            are unconstrained although E
                                                                   VC
                                                                        is constrained

             to be zero.
       In   (a) the likelihood function can be maximized by iterative non—linear

least squares whereas in (b) an explicit maximum likelihood algorithm is

required. Assumption (b) is more general but alas more expensive to implement.

       The results using the model (a) are set out In Table 1.
                                                                                         10.

            Most of the beta coefficients are not significantly different from zero.

       However, as noted above, the beta coefficients predicted by the. simple monetary

       model will be functions not only of the parameters in the money demand function

       but also the parameters in the forecasting equations for money and income growth.

       The fact that most of the coefficients are not significantly different from zero

       cannot be taken as evidence against the simple monetary model. More explicit

       tests of the simple monetary model will be considered in the next section.

            When the covariance structure is generalized to model (b), and the log

       likelihood function is explicitly maximized,         to   reduce the number of parameters

       to be estimated a more parsimonious parameterization for the forecasting

       equations is required. Hence the results in Table 2 are not directly compar-

       able with those of Table 1.

            As in Table 1, few of the beta coefficients in Table 2 are significantly

       different from zero. Furthermore, the coefficients on errors in forecasting

       U.S. money growth changed sign in moving from Table 1 to Table 2. The most

       robust beta coefficients appear to be those on German money and income fore-

       casting errors. The cross—equation restrictions implied by rationality were

       not rejected in the models of either Table 1 or Table 2.

III. Testing the Simple Monetary Model

       In Appendix 1, a result from Sargent and Hansen- (1980) is used to

express the 8     coefficients   in (5)' in terms of the forecasting para-

meters y in (3)' and the income elasticities and interest semi—elasticity

of demand for money. As long as we restrict the covariance matrix            E
                                                                                 ye

to be zero, the beta coefficients will be identified and the restrictions

on those coefficients implied by the simple monetary model can be tested.

At the same time, we can recover estimates of the income elasticities and

interest semi—elasticity of demand for money which can be compared with

the values of these same parameters obtained from estimates of money demand

functions.

       I attempted to test for the conformity of the simple monetary model

with the data using either the real GNP, or bank clearings divided by the

wholesale price index, as the income variable.9 I also tried estimating                -




the model imposing the requirement that E             and E     be diagonal or leaving

them unconstrained. In all cases I had difficulty getting the algorithms

to converge. The problem appeared to be that the likelihood function was

maximized for values of the interest semi—elasticity of demand for money

                                         A =
                                                a3        approached 1. One example

from   these "results" is reproduced in Table 3. Note that these parameter
estimates are not maximum likelihood estimates as the algorithm was still
diverging    at these values.

       The results must cast considerable doubt on the ability of the simple

monetary model to adequately account for the data I examined. However, it

should be emphasized again that some of the difficulty might be due to

changes over the period in the stochastic processes (3)' governing the

 evolution of the money and income variables.

of the forward rate to test an alternative implication of the model. I show

the lag operator in (3)'. The parameters          and a2 are the income

elasticity   of demand for money in the U.S. and the foreign country (UK
or Germany in our case) while a3 is the common interest semi—elasticity
of the demand for money.
     We can get a test of the simple monetary model by estimating (3)',

(5)' and (8) jointly and   then   testing the restrictions on the coefficients

in (8). The values of the unrestricted coefficients in (8) are of interest

in themselves. If the so—called "overshooting hypothesis" is correct

then we might expect to see the coefficients on unanticipated money growth

change sign as the lag increases from 1 to three periods in equation (8).

The results of jointly estimating the equations (3)', (5)' and (8) are

given in Table 4. No adjustments were made for heteroskedasticity. Although

the constraints on the coefficients in (8) are not rejected, it is apparent

that the beta coefficients in the unconstrained version of (8) are estimated

very imprecisely. The results in Table 4 would give one very little con-

fidence that the model (3)', (5)' and (8) is consistent with the data. As

far as the overshooting hypothesis is concerned, most of the coefficients

in the unconstrained version of (8) follow a pattern

                             /
Exceptions to this pattern are the coefficients on U.S. and German income
in the German 3—month forecasting error equation. Both of these behave

monotonically as a function of the lag but only the coefficients on U.S.

income forecasting errors change sign.

IV. Interest Rate Model

       Following Frenkel (1979) I estimated a model


       1t+l =      si(L)i +   52(L)l + c53(L)?t +


                   (L)i +

                                            t+1 t1t+l
                                                     ) 2+ t+l
       Although this model has a less rigorous theoretical foundation than

the simple monetary model studied in Appendix 1, Frenkel found it was

capable of explaining part of the exchange rate forecasting error

He suggested that interest rates and exchange rates might both be affected

by the same "news." Further, if both bonds and foreign exchange are traded

in efficient financial markets, the time lag between the arrival of the

news and its subsequent effect on prices will be similar in the two markets.

This begs the question as to the exact nature of the news. It also suggests

we should set up a simultaneous equation model where exchange rates and

interest rates are both endogenous variables. Frenkel uses instrumental

variables to cope with the simultaneity problem. I have ignored it. As

above I shall assume that c and v in (8) and (10) are uncorrelated.

On the other hand, I can test for rationality by testing the validity of

the cross equation restrictions on the 5 parameters in (9) and (10).

Note that the validity of this test does not depend on the validity of the

                                E   = 0
assumption that E(c,v)

        In the results reported in Table 5, I used the one—month EurocurrenCY

rates reported in the Harris Trust and Savings Bank Weekly Bulletin for

interest rates. Again I used the rate on the last Friday in each month.

  Date limitations prevented me estimating (9) and (10) over the full period

  2/72—4/79. I used maximum likelihood estimation as for the simple monetary

  model results reported in Table 2.

 In contrast to the tests based on the simple monetary model we find some

 weak evidence against rationality of expectations in Table 4. Also, it is

 rather interesting to note that although the German equation produced more

 robust results for the simple monetary model, the UK equation gives more

 significant beta coefficients when the simple interest rate model is est-

 imated.


 V. Conclusion

        We have uncovered very little evidence unfavorable to the hypothesis

 that expectations are formed rationally in the foreign exchange market.
                                                                     18.



However, proponents of a simple monetary model of exchange rate determination

can find little comfort in the results. There is some evidence that a single

simple model may not be satisfactory for explaining all currency movements.

This might be related to the different way monetary policy is conducted in

different countries. If the monetary authorities followed an interest rate

rule then unanticipated innovations in interest rates may provide more rele-

vant information than unanticipated movement in the money stock. The opposite

might be the case for a country which followed a money stock growth rate rule.

If the authorities did not follow any stable rule over the period examined,

then it would be very difficult to test any model of exchange rate determin-

ation. This is just another implication of the Lucas critique of econometric

policy evaluation (Lucas, 1977). Instability in policy over the estimation

period could have been a major factor leading to the very imprecise estimates

of the     parameters found in this paper.

 Equation      (1.16) corresponds to (5)' in the text. The simple monetary

 model can also be tested using the term structure of the forward rate.

 We could use expression (1.14) above but I decided to test an alternative

 expression which is also implied by the simple monetary model.

          First observe that

 So

Now use (1.12) together with the forecasting equations as in (3)' in the

 text

         t+1 =           3(L)M

                                 n

model can be tested. As above, estimates of the elasticity parameters in

the money demand functions will also be obtained and these can be compared

with estimates of these same parameters which have been obtained by other

methods.

                    The Likelihood          Function for the Model        (3),   (5)


        To simplify the exposition I will use the notation of equations (3)

and (5) in the text rather than the more explicit but more cumbersome

notation of (3)' and (5)'.

        We want the likelihood function for the simultaneous system


             X = Zy + V

                  = (X—Zy) +


        Let (Xi,.. .
                               ,Xkt,L) be   the lx(k+2) vector of observations on

the endogenous variables at time t and let (Z1,...                                 be the

lxP. vector of observations on the' exogenous variables at time t.

        Then the system can be written



        (X1,... XI(t,t)B + (Z1,.. .            ,Z)     F =
                                                             (v,E)

             B =       (

             r= (y y)
Since detB = 1         we can write the log likelihood function17

                                                       n             VI
     L* =    —(k+l)log2ir          —              —
                                                      4 E (vc)C'( )          where

     If       and       are diagonal the log likelihood can be maximized by

dividing each of the equations by the estimated variance of the residual

of that equation and then using non—linear least squares to obtain the para-

meter estimates y and .

     In   the more general case where E
                                        V
                                            and E
                                                    C
                                                        are unrestricted I used

an algorithm specified in a paper by Berndt, Hall, Hall and Hausman (1974).

     In both cases, I corrected the residuals for heteroskedasticity using

the time trend procedure outlined by Glesjer and discussed in Johnston (1963).

Initial parameter estImates were obtained and the absolute values of the

residuals were then regressed on a constant and a time trend to get two

                    and il for each equation i .         The data of equation I
parameters

were then corrected by dividing by the square root                +     •   time.

Parameter estimates using the corrected data were then obtained.        While

this procedure is satisfactory when E       and E       are diagonal, it would

have been preferable in the more general case to have included time trend

terms in        and E   .   However, this would have greatly increased the

number of parameters to be estimated. Results for both the unadjusted and

adjusted data are reported when IV      and I       are not constrained to be
                                                C

diagonal.

     1. I would particularly like to thank Frederick S. Mishkin for many

valuable discussions and suggestions. I would also like to thank Jacob A.

Frenkel and Robert J. 1-lodrick for their comments. Financial support from

the Lilly Endowment Fund, the University of Chicago, and Princeton Univer-

sity is gratefully acknowledged.

     2.   I shall use the term "exogenous" for these determining variables
for ease of exposition.     Some of them might in   fact be   simultaneously   deter-
mined with money supply and/or demand. This shall be discussed further

below.

     3.   This will be true, for example, if the evolution of these exogenous

variables can be explained by a stable low order autoregression and agents

are aware of this fact and form expectations rationally.

     4.   See Frenkel and   Razin   (1980).

     5. This was also done in Mussa (1978) and Bilson (1978).

     6.       =      —




     7. See Appendix 1.

     8. See Lucas (1977).

     9. Bank clearings and the wholesale price indices were obtained from

the International Financial Statistics. I used this variable to capture

the transactions demand for money.

    10. Note that the theory implies the error term in equation (8) will

be a moving average. This fact has been ignored in the estimation and will

lead to inefficient estimates of the parameters of the model.

    11. See Dornbusch (1976) for example.
                                                                          F—2.




     12. If, for example, partial adjustment parameters were appended to

the present model, a far wider range of estimated lagged effects would be

consistent with the model. However, I would consider that a weakness and

not a strength of the extended model. If one is to postulate a model with

lagged adjustments, it would be preferable to have a theory explaining the

source of the lags so that one could get restrictions on the adjustment

parameters more open to refutation.

     13. Frenkel (1978) discusses the use of the relevant price index to

use here. To the extent that purchasing power parity pertains to traded

goods only, (1.1) would also contain terms involving the relative price of

traded to non—traded goods.

     14. The functional forms proposed here for the money demand functions

are common in monetary economics and exchange rate literature.

     15. Equation (1.5) has been tested previously in quite a few studies

and appears to hold up reasonably well (see for example Frenkel and Levich,

1975, 1977 and Levich L978, 1979).

     16. Notethat if c is autocorrelated so Et+l = ct(L)C +                then

                                      =          —           =   and we will still
Ec÷i = c(L)c and E:+l — Ect+1             E:+l       c(L)c
get an uncorrelated error term in (1.12).

     17. See for example Schimidt (1976), p. 216.
