  Asset Substitutability and the Impact of Federal Deficits

                             ABSTRACT

      In   this paper, the role of asset substitutability in deter-

mining the impact of debt—financed federal deficits is examined. The

issues are first discussed in the context of a simple analytical model

in which financial assets are disaggregated into money, federal debt,

and corporate bonds. In this model, it is shown that depending on the

degree of substitutability among financial assets, a range of possible

outcomes associated with a change in the federal deficit is possible.

Next, the issue of asset substitutability is examined empirically in a

disaggregated structural model of the Treasury security, corporate

bond, and equity markets. Using this model, the implications of

larger debt—financed federal deficits are then examined in a series

of simulation experiments.

           The large federal deficits since 1975, and the prospect of

 their further rapid expansion through the mid—1980s, have caused

 greater attention to be focused on the economic consequences of

 federal deficits. Much of the discussion has centered on the issue

 of whether a rise in the deficit crowds out interest—sensitive

 private spending. This discussion is properly directed, as a vast

 majority of deficits since the late 1960s have been debt financed.

 In particular, while marketable Treasury securities net of Federal

 Reserve holdings actually declined during the 1964—69 period, private

 investors have purchased about 85 percent of the cumulative rise in

federal debt since 1969. Moreover, during 1980 and 1981, private

investors purchased over 90 percent of the rise in outstanding federal

debt .-'


      Any of several Conditions have been shown to imply situations

in which a debt—financed increase in the federal deficit due to a

rise in government expenditures crowds out an equal amount of private

expenditures, even in the short run.- One unambiguous case emerges

when all factors of production are
                                      already fully employed [e.g., M.
Friedman (1970)]. However, even in the presence of unemployed

resources, if households view the tax liability associated with an

increase in federal debt as being equal to the value of the debt, then

debt—financed increases in government spending would again crowd out

private spending [e.g., Bailey (1971), Barro (1974), and Kochin

(1974)]. That is, if the Ricardian equivalence theorem holds,
                             —2—


systematic fiscal policy cannot affect aggregate demand.-"

      In the absence of full employment and Ricardian equivalence,

Tobin (1961,1963) and subsequent writers have noted that the extent of

short—run crowding out depends on the substitutability among assets.

If federal debt and private capital are perfect substitutes, for

example, complete crowding out is again possible if the demand for

money depends on wealth [e.g., Silber (1970) and Meyer (1975)]. How-

ever, if money and federal debt are perfect substitutes, a debt—

financed increase in the deficit causes total spending to rise. Al-

lowing imperfect substitutability among money, federal debt, and

capital, the possible outcomes span these extremes and therefore

range from crowding out to crowding in [e.g., B. Friedman ([1978)].

Moreover, even if federal debt and capital are perfect substitutes,

Blinder and Solow (1973) have demonstrated that bond—financed deficits

may be more stimulative than those that are money—financed in the

long run.1

      The purpose of this paper is to examine empirically the role

asset substitutability plays in determining the impact of federal

deficits on interest rates and capital formation. In the first sec-

tion, the issues are examined in a simple analytical model including

three assets: money, federal debt, and corporate bonds. Following

B. Friedman (1978), the impact of federal deficits is shown to depend

primarily on the relative magnitudes of the interest—rate coefficients

in the aggregate demands for these three assets. The empirical model

used to evaluate asset substitutability is presented in the second

section. The model consists of estimated demands for corporate bonds,

equities, and four different maturity classes of Treasury securities
                               —3—



 by 11 disaggregated investor categories. In the third section, the

 short—run impact of deficits on interest rates is estimated using

 simulations in which the supply of each of the four maturity classes

 of Treasury securities is separately increased in each period. The

 dynamic effects of deficit shocks are then calculated in this partial

 equilibrium framework. The general equilibrium effects of deficits on

 both interest rates and capital formation are considered in the fourth

 section. These general equilibrium effects are obtained from the

 model developed by B. Friedman (1981,1982), which in turn is comprised

 of the disaggregated asset demands estimated by Roley (1980,1982) com-

 bined with the MIT—PENN—SSRC (MPS) model. The main conclusions of

 this paper are summarized in the final section.


               ISSUES IN A SILE ANALYTICAL MODEL

      In this section, a basic analytical model is presented to con-

sider the role of asset substitutability in
                                              determining the impact of

a change in the federal deficit on interest rates.- Two permutations

of this simple model are also considered.   First, the corporate

financing decision is endogenized to examine whether
                                                        substitutability
between financing alternatives moderates the impact of deficits on

interest rates. Second, similar effects are investigated in the con-

text of financial intermediation. Although the empirical results

reported in later sections are obtained from a disaggregated structural

model comprised of 51 behavioral equations, the empirical model in its

aggregated form is similar to the illustrative models analyzed here.

      In each of the models presented below, only the financial effects

of an increase in the federal deficit are considered.    Thus, income is
                                    —4—



exogenous and the financial effects examined are analogous to shifts

in the LM curve in traditional IS—LN analysis. Using B. Friedman's

(1978) terminology, such shifts in the LM curve determine the amount

of "portfolio crowding out," which is separate from the amount of

"transactions crowding out." This latter effect corresponds to the

movement along a given LM curve associated with shifts in the IS

curve. As long as the LM curve has a positive slope, some transactions

crowding out—and a subsequent rise in interest rates—will occur in

response to stimulative fiscal actions. However, if the LM curve is

not vertical, transactions crowding out cannot be of sufficient magni-

tude to inhibit altogether a rise in total spending. Thus, the ques-

tion of whether crowding out is complete depends also on the sign and

magnitude of the portfolio crowding out effect considered below. More-

over, depending on the substitutability among assets, some portion of

transactions crowding out could actually be offset resulting in an

unambiguous rise in total spending with perhaps only a trivial rise in

interest rates.

        To investigate these questions, the first model considered is

comprised of the aggregate demands for money (Nd), federal debt (Td),

and corporate bonds (Bd):

            Md= mtt
                 r + mbb
                      r                   m     m
               =         +

where

        r. rb =    yields    on Treasury securities and corporate bonds,

                   respectively

                 W =      financial       wealth

                 Y = income

         s..,    y.,     6.(i,j=m,b,t) =           coefficients.
 Throughout this section, it is assumed that own—yield and wealth

 elasticities of demand are nonnegative such that ..>O,

 (i=t,b), and that assets are not gross complements
                                                                   ij,
 (i,j=m,t,b)].1 The Brainard—Tobjn (1968) portfolio balance condi-

 tions place further restrictions on the coefficients, and they may be

 represented as

             mt + tt              + bt      = 0



             8mb +        tb +        bb = 0

                     +   ''t +        = 1

            tS       +        +       =   0.
                 m        t       b
 In   this model, the interest—bearing securities are assumed to have

variable coupons and fixed market values, and businesses are assumed

to finance all capital accumulation with bonds. It is also assumed

that the cumulative supply of bonds CBS) equals the value of the

capital stock, K. Thus, total wealth has the usual representation

            W=M+T+K.                                                 (2)

        Combining the aggregate demands (1) with fixed supplies of money

(N°) Treasury securities (T°), and capital (KO=BS), the model deter-

mines two endogenous yields, r and rb. Because of its presumed

effect on business investment decisions and hence total spending, the

impact of bond—financed deficits on the corporate bond rate is

examined here. That is, the corporate bond rate is taken as the rele-

vant rate for the IS curve.
                               —6—


      Following Christ (1968), Silber (1970), and Meyer (1975), any

increases in government expenditures (G) or decreases in taxes (R) are

related to increases in federal debt and outside money through the

government budget constraint

          dG—dR=dT+dM.                                         (3)

In the case of a bond—financed increase in the deficit, dM=0 and

dT=dW>0, the impact on the corporate bond rate may be expressed as


               -
                   tbt - btt
          3T
                   ttbb - tb8bt
where the denominator is positive if all assets are gross substitutes.

Thus, the presence of portfolio crowding out or crowding in depends on

the numerator. In turn, the sign and magnitude of the numerator

depends on the degree of asset substitutability and the effect of

wealth on the individual demands.

      With the above assumptions, it can be shown that if wealth does

not affect money demand (y=O), then a rise in the deficit unambig-

uously reduces the corporate bond rate and therefore leads to crowding

in. In this case, the wealth effects on the demands for interest—

bearing securities more than offset the impact of the rise in the

supply of Treasury securities. Alternatively, if the demands for

Treasury securities and corporate bonds are not functions of wealth

        abond—financed increase in the deficit unambiguously leads to

crowding out. Interest rates must rise in this case to offset the

increased demand for money due to the rise in wealth.

      The interest—rate coefficients in the demands—which relate

directly to asset substitutability—are equally important in deter-

mining the impact of larger deficits on the corporate bond rate. As
                                —7—


others have previously noted, if money and Treasury securities are

close substitutes, implying that bt is near zero, then bond—financed

increases in the deficit cause the corporate bond yield to fall.

Alternatively, if Treasury securities and corporate bonds are close

substitutes, leading to a value of bt near          crowding out is the
result.ZI For asset substitutability between these extremes, the out-

come could be either crowding out or crowding in.


Corporate Financing Decision

      In the model examined above, businesses are assumed to finance

capital accumulation solely by selling bonds. This assumption is now

relaxed in perhaps the simplest manner by allowing corporations to

either sell bonds or reduce their money holdings to finance investment

spending. As is shown below, the extent of crowding out or crowding

in is reduced if corporations view alternative funding sources as sub-

stitutes.

      In this extended model, corporations are assumed to demand money

and supply bonds according to

            Mc=b mbb
                  r +bK-1-b Y
                       xn        my
                                                                (5)
            BS =
                   bbbrb + bbK + bbY

where the coefficients b.., b,, b. (i,j=m,b) satisfy


            bbbO,              Obbybbml
as well as the portfolio—balance constraints

            bbb
              —bmb
                 =0, b —b =1, b —b =0.                          (6)
                      b m     by my
Implicit in equation (6) is the constraint KBS_Mc. The aggregate

demands for assets by households (1) are assumed to remain unchanged,
                             —8—


but equilibrium in the money market is now described by the market—

clearing identity

          Nd + Mc = N°.

      Combining equations (1) and (5), the impact of a bond—financed

increase in the deficit on the corporate bond rate may be determined

as before. In this case, it may be shown that the impact is

          rb   -
               —     tbt'bStt                                  (7)



Under the reasOnable assumption that the supply of bonds is negatively

related to the corporate bond rate (bbb<O), the impact on this rate

(7) is unambiguously less in absolute value than that in the previous

case (4). Not surprisingly, then, allowing some substitutability

among corporate financing decisions moderates the effect of increased

deficits on the corporate bond rate. The importance of substitut-

ability in the corporate—financing decision is empirically examined in

the third section.


Financial Intermediation

      If the portfolio behavior of financial intermediaries such as

banks, insurance companies, and pension funds is different from that

of households due to regulation or other institutional features, and

if households do not view intermediaries simply as mutual funds and

adjust their own portfolio behavior accordingly, then financial inter-

mediation may modify the impact of increased deficits on interest

rates. Indeed, Hansen (1973) and Meyer and Hart (1975) have examined

such effects in a model similar to that employed here, and found that

the addition of financial intermediaries alters the crowding—out
                                    —9—


 effect in a nontrivial way. Because financial intermediaries are

 explicitly represented in the empirical model discussed in subsequent

 sections, it may be useful to examine their impact in the context of

 the illustrative framework presented above.

       In the model, banks are taken as the representative interme-

 diaries and they are assumed to hold required reserves (Pit), excess

reserves (ER), and corporate bonds (Bb). The sum of their asset

holdings equals total money liabilities (M) and net worth (NW). The

behavior of these intermediaries is described by the following set of

equations

            H = PR + ER

         RR=ctM
                                                                (8)
         ERc       r

         Bb =           +
                cbbrb       cb(NW+M_RR)

where H represents outside money and the coefficients satisfy

         Ocl, Ocbbl,

as well as the portfolio adding—up restrictions

         ceb + cbb =    U c + cb = 1.                           (9)


Thus, for a given required reserve ratio (ci), banks determine their

allocation of assets between excess reserves and bonds. In addition,

the market—clearing condition for bonds now becomes

         Bd + Bb = BS

and household wealth may be expressed asp'

        W = H + T + K.

      Combining equation (8) with equations (1) and (5), the impact of

a bond—financed increase in the deficit on the corporate bond rate may
                             —lo-


be shown to equal

   3rb —                                                                .   (10)
   aT


The effects of financial intermediation may be illustrated by several

special cases. First, if the required reserve ratio equals one (cl),

then the impact of an increased deficit (10) is unambiguously smaller

in absolute value than before if banks exhibit some interest elasticity

in their allocation of net worth between excess reserves and bond

holdings. Second, this same result follows if banks' demand for bonds

has zero elasticity with respect to the value of total discretionary

asset holdings (cbO). Finally, in comparison to equation (7), changes

in the interest sensitivity in banks' portfolio allocation (cbb) have

ambiguous effects. As a whole, the presence of financial intermedia-

tion may accentuate or diminish any crowding—out or crowding—in

effect.

      To summarize, simple extensions to the illustrative model con-

sidered at the outset can significantly alter the portfolio crowding—

out effect. Before turning to the empirical investigation of the

crowding—out effect, the empirical analogue of the analytical model

discussed in this section is presented.


           SPECIFICATION AND ESTIMATION OF THE MODEL

      Various aspects of the empirical model used to estimate the

impact of bond—financed deficits on interest rates are discussed in

this section.-' The model consists of disaggregated demands for

Treasury securities, corporate bonds, and equities by 11 categories

of investors. The yields on these securities are determined from
                                    —11—


 market—clearing identities which equate aggregate demands with

 supplies for each type of security. As such, the reduced—form expres-

 sions for security yields implicit in the model are restricted by the

 underlying portfolio behavior of the different categories of inves—

 tors)1    Thus, as was the case in the illustrative model considered

 in the previous section, the substitutability among assets in the

 individual asset demands is a primary determinant of the impact of

bond—financed deficits on interest rates.

Specificat ion

      The approach used to specify the financial asset demands

attempts to capture the basic determinants of investors' short—run

portfolio allocation. One such determinant is surely the risk—return

trade—off associated with different attainable portfolios. This

trade—off may be modeled formally using the mean—variance portfolio

selection model, which serves to identify investors' desired port-

folios in terms of their risk aversion and the risk and return

characteristics of individual securities. Following Friedman and

Roley (l979b), the mean—variance model may be shown to be consistent

with the following linear homogenous demands:

           it
                 =   Ait/Wt   = a. + b. .r + c. a
                                 iO   ij       ik kt   ,   i=l,...,N   (11)

holdings in dollars, W(=EA) is total portfolio wealth, the               are

expected asset yields, and the ak are variances associated with these

yields. These latter terms are added to the asset demands obtained

from utility maximization to represent the possible nonstationarity of

yield variances—i.e., changes in the riskiness of different types of
                                     —12—

                                                and c. are fixed coefficients
                                                       ik

        Although,      investors desire to hold the portfolio shares des-

cribed in equation (11), actual short—run portfolios are often thought

to be different from those desired due to transactions costs. Because

of this important role of transactions costs, their effects should be

represented with some care. In this respect, the general portfolio

adjustment model used here distinguishes among the costs associated

with reallocating the securities currently held by the investor, the

smaller costs associated with purchasing securities from new investable

wealth flows, and the possible asymmetric costs in buying and selling

securities.-' Analytically, all of these features are represented in

the model

                   =
                       ikt(    twt_i,_1) +                  ' i=l,...,N    (12)


where        represents net purchases of asset i; the indices i and k

(i,k=l,. ..,N) are associated with endogenous assets;                describes the

marginal allocation of new investable wealth flows W; and the ikt

are flexible portfolio adjustment parameters.

        One way this model (12) differs from the standard stock adjust-

ment model is that it allows wealth flows to affect the reallocation of

assets already held in investors' portfolios. In particular, the

parameter describing the adjustment of last period's assets Aktl to

those desired               is not constant. Instead, this parameter is
                                           —13—


 defined as

      are   positive and negative wealth flows, respectively. For posi-

 tive wealth flows, for example,                   equals zero, and the larger the

magnitude of the flow, the less an investor will reallocate currently

held assets. In this case movement toward desired portfolio composi-

tion may be achieved with less cost by simply investing the wealth

flow according to desired portfolio composition.

      The final term in the model (12) reflects this less costly

investment strategy. This term describes the marginal allocation of

new investable wealth flows. For positive wealth flows, it is defined

to equal             investors' desired long—run portfolio composition. For

negative wealth flows, investors may not sell assets according to

desired portfolio composition for a variety of reasons—including

differential transactions costs and a possible aversion to realizing

capital losses—implying that a separate term may be needed to repre-

sent portfolio behavior in this case. Thus, the coefficient deter-

mining marginal purchases or sales is defined as


                     =
                it                                                          (14)


where y depends on the same factors as                    in equation (11), but it

is not constrained to imply identical responses by investors to posi-

tive and negative wealth flows.

     All of the terms that are additional to the standard stock

adjustment model are tested to judge their relevance. As might be

expected because of the diverse institutional and behavioral charac-

teristics of the categories of investors included in the structural

model, several sub—cases of the general portfolio adjustment model (12)

are actually applied. Statistical tests involving zero constraints on

the ik and      parameters and equality constraints on the co and

terms are used to determine which sub—model is appropriate for each

investor category.


Data and Estimation Techniques

      The investor categories included in the disaggregated structural

model are indicated in Table 1. As of yearend 1981, the investor

categories with endogenous demands held 96 percent of the total amount

of outstanding Treasury securities net of the Federal Reserve System

and foreign holdings, 98 percent of the total supply of corporate

bonds, and 96 percent of the total supply of equities. The primary

data source of the disaggregated structural model is the Federal

Reserve System's flow—of—funds accounts (1975), Quarterly observa-

tions are used, with the sample period beginning in l960:Ql and

ending in 1975:Q4.

      The data for Treasury securities consist of four weighted

maturity classes of federal debt that are consistent with the flow—of—

funds accounts. The data are defined in terms of four "definite"

areas and three "borderline" areas. The definite areas include the

following maturities:   (1) within 1 year (short—term), (2) 2 to 4

years (short—intermediate—term), (3) 6 to 8 years (long—intermediate—

term), and (4) over 12 years (long—term). Treasury securities with

maturities in the borderline areas are allocated to the definite

classifications according to a weighting scheme. The principal advan-

tage of this procedure is that it avoids the otherwise perverse

effects that occur when large debt issues cross fixed maturity

boundaries.

      Financial flow variables corresponding to the individual assets

of the 11 investor categories are defined in terms of seasonally

adjusted net changes during the quarter. The wealth flow variables

are generally defined as quarterly net acquisitions of financial

assets, seasonally adjusted. Financial stock variables, including

individual asset stocks and total portfolio wealth, are formed by

decrementing seasonally adjusted quarterly flows from the value of

yearend outstandings in l975:Q4. This procedure serves to guarantee

the mutual consistency of the asset stock and flow data throughout the

sample period. When asset stock data contain market valuation changes,

these components are included without seasonal adjustment. The

endogenous yields correspond to the published series for the 3—month

Treasury bill yield, the 3— to 5—year Treasury security yield, the

long—term (10—year and over) Treasury security yield, the yield on new

issues of corporate bonds (Aa utilities), Standard and Poor's dividend—

price ratio, and a weighted average of yields on Treasury securities

maturing in 6, 7, and 8 years for the long—intermediate—term yield.

When statistically significant, distributed lags on the percentage

change of the Standard and Poor's composite common stock price index
                                 —l 7—



 are also included to represent expected capital gains or losses on
          12/
 equities.—        .

                Variances of holding—period yields are represented by

 lagged four— or eight—quarter moving—average variances of the sum of

 the coupon return and the capital gain (or loss) on the respective

 securities.

       The estimated demand equations correspond to various sub—models

 embodied in equation (12). For the simplest case—involving the con-

                       = 0 and    =
 straints ik
                                      _expansion   of equation (12)

 implies that net purchases of a security depend on lagged stocks of

 assets, products of expected yields with wealth flows and stocks, and

 products of variances with wealth flows and stocks. The set of lagged

 asset stocks consists not only of the six securities modeled here, but

also such assets as commercial paper, state and local bonds, mortgages,

and components of the monetary aggregates. Similarly, yields and

variances of yields are included for all of these categories of assets.

      The structure of the supply—demand model necessitates the use of

a simultaneous equations estimation technique. This is the case

because yields on securities are jointly dependent variables along with

investors' demands. Thus, ordinary least squares estimation results in

inconsistent estimates. Because the direct application of 2SLS is not

possible due to the undersized sample problem—i.e., more predetermined

variables than sample observations—the application of an instrumental

variables technique described by Brundy and Jorgenson (1971) is used to

gain consistent estimates for the structural equations.

      The particular instrumental variables procedure used involves

replacing current values of dependent variables appearing in the right—

hand side of the structural equations with fitted values obtained from
                               —18—


a first—stage regression. The first—stage regression for an indi-

vidual structural equation has right—hand side variables consisting of

a subset of the principal components of the entire set of predeter-

mined variables in the system of equations, augmented by the set of

predetermined variables appearing in the structural equation. In

addition, since the dependent variables being instrumented appear as

products with either wealth flows or stocks, the proper procedure of

forming an instrument for the entire multiplicative term is followed

here.


Empirical Results

        In total, 51 behavioral equations representing the net purchases

of four maturity classes of Treasury securities, corporate bonds, and

equities are estimated over 64 quarterly observations beginning in

1960:Ql and ending in l975:Q4. Summary      statistics   for the estimated

equations are presented in Table 2. As indicated by the multiple



                       TABLE 2 about here




correlations (R2), these equations explain much of the variation of the

net purchases of the six types of securities. The multiple correla-

tions range from 0.53 to 0.91 for equities, 0.64 to 0.87 for corporate

bonds, and 0.35 to 0.93 for the much more volatile net purchases of

Treasury securities. Comparing the individual categories of investors

using this criterion, the short—run demands of life insurance com-

panies are explained the most successfully with multiple correlations

ranging from 0.83 to 0.96. Within individual investor categories, the

statistics reported in Table 2 also indicate that the net purchases of

each type of security are modeled with approximately equal success.

The standard errors of the estimated equations are additionally

reported to indicate the accuracy of the estimated equations in dollar

amounts.

      Individual parameter estimates also support the short—run port-

folio selection model. As reported by Roley (1980,1982), all coeffi-

cients on own—yields and own—asset stocks have the anticipated sign,

and virtually all are statistically significant. Moreover, in the set

of 51 estimated demands, there is evidence that at least some asset

substitutability exists as 45 statistically significant cross—yield

terms are included.

      By combining the 51 estimated equations with six market—clearing

identities that place aggregate demands equal to exogenous supplies

(net of exogenous demands) of the four maturity classes of Treasury

securities, corporate bonds, and equities, the yields on these six

types of securities along with the 51 endogenous security demands may

be simultaneously determined. The endogenous variables are determined

in this framework using both one—period and dynamic simulations

beginning in l960:Q1 and ending in 1975:Q4. The dynamic simulation

differs from the one—period (or static) simulation in that the former

uses simulated values for all lagged endogenous variables.

      The results from these simulations are summarized for the six

endogenous yields in the lower half of Table 2. In both simulations,

the root—mean—square errors (RNSE) inonotonically decrease for Treasury

security yields as the maturity becomes longer, reflecting the greater

volatility of shorter term yields. Moreover, for long—term yields, the
                              —21—


 root—mean—square errors range from only 19 basis points for the long—

 term Treasury yield in the one—period simulation to 37 basis points

 for the corporate bond and equity yields in the dynamic simulation.

 Thus, the disaggregated structural model explains yields remarkably

 well with only small biases evident in the reported results.


    FINAICIAL EFFECTS OF AN INCREASE IN THE FEDERAL DEFICIT

       In this section, the disaggregated structural model of the

Treasury security, corporate bond, and equity markets is used to

examine empirically the effect of an increase in the federal deficit on

interest rates. In particular, two sets of simulation experiments are

performed. First, the initial impacts of increases in each of the

four maturities of Treasury securities on the six endogenous yields are

considered. Second, the longer run effects of deficit shocks—

financed according to the historical maturity distribution of the out-

standing federal debt—are investigated. Since these experiments

involve only the financial sector, the results correspond to the port-

folio crowding—out effects reviwed in the first section.


Initial Effects of an Increase in the Deficit

      To examine the short—run impact of debt—financed increases in

the deficit on interest rates, simulations involving 1 percent

increases in the stocks of the four different maturity classes of

Treasury securities are performed, with all other predetermined vari-

ables taking historical values in each period. These experiments are

not only suggestive in indicating the initial financial effects of

increased debt—financed deficits, but they may also be used to examine

whether alternative financing schemes involving the four maturities of
                             —22--



Treasury securities have different consequences. Indeed, in a pre-

vious study [Roley (1982)], this model was shown to imply that debt—

management operations involving changes in the maturity composition of

the federal debt significantly affect corporate bond and equity yields.

In the expanded model employed in the next section, B. Friedman (1981)

found similar effects.

      As is discussed in more detail in the next subsection, the 1 per-

cent changes in the different maturity classes of Treasury securities

are quite small in comparison to the historical innovations in the

respective net supplies. Thus, in the context of actual deficit financ-

ing policy which occurred during the sample period, the changes in

asset stocks used in the simulation experiments may be thought of as

innovations in the time—series processes which generated these asset

stocks, and not as shifts in policy regimes which may render the model

inadequate [e.g., Mishkin (1979) and Sims (1982)]. In addition, in

all of the experiments performed in this section, the total financial

asset holdings of households are increased by the amount of the change

in the deficit. Thus, the experiments correspond to "bond rains" on

households. As a consequence, the possibility of additional effects

from shifts in relative total asset holdings of different categories

of investors is ignored at this stage. As shown by B. Friedman (1980),

such effects may significantly affect relative yields if different

investors have different "preferred habitats."

     One—period simulations utilizing the model exactly as outlined

in the previous section are reported on the top half of Table 3. For

short—term Treasury securities (US1), for example, the results indi-

cate that a 1 percent rise in the amount outstanding causes the bill

yield (rT) to rise 32 basis points above its value in the control

simulation in 1966:Ql, 19 basis points in l971:Ql, and an average of

32 basis points in one—period simulations over the entire sample

period. Similarly, 1 percent increases in outstanding short—term

Treasury securities results in an average rise in the corporate bond

rate of 4 basis points, and a decline in the equity yield of 3 basis

points.

      As a whole, the results from these simulations are somewhat

mixed. However, in comparing short— and long—term debt financing, the

model suggests that the former is less likely to result in crowding

out. In particular, under long—term debt financing, the average

impacts on the corporate bond and equity yields are 12 and 1 basis

points, respectively, or about 8 and 4 basis points higher than those

calculated under short—term debt financing. This difference occurs

despite the fact that the average increase in short—term Treasury

securities is over three times larger than the rise in long—term

Treasury securities.

      In the next set of simulations, the supply of corporate bonds is

made endogerious by adding B. Friedman's (1979) corporate bond supply
                     13/     .        .   .
equation to the model.— This specification is particularly well
suited for the experiments conducted here as it emphasizes the substi-

tutability between long— and short—term debt financing. In this

expanded model, the same simulations as before are performed, and the

impacts of increased Treasury security supplies on both yields and the

supply of corporate bonds are reported on the bottom half of Table 3.
                                      —25--



         In terms of the impacts on yields, the simulation results are

  virtually the same as those reported on the top half of the table. The

  average impact on the corporate bond yield is, however, reduced

 slightly in the experiments concerning increases in long—term Treasury

 securities. With respect to quantity effects, the substitution away

 from corporate bond financing is quite small in three of the four sets

 of experiments. The average reductions in net issues of corporate

 bonds are $17m, $lOm, $lm, and $53m for 1 percent increases in US1,

 US2, US3, and US4, respectively, where average increases in these four

 maturities of Treasury securities are $ll8m, $52m, $66m, and $31m.

 The results therefore indicate a high degree of substitutability

 between long—term federal debt and corporate bonds, as a $31 million

 average increase in long—term Treasury securities results in an

 average reduction of $53 million in corporate bonds.

Dynamic Effects of an Increase in the Deficit

        The longer run financial effects of an increase in the deficit

are considered in two sets of dynamic simulations. In these
                                                                        experi-

ments, the innovation technique suggested by Nishkin (1979) is

employed. This approach is implemented by first estimating an equa-

tion representing the time—series process of the cumulative debt—

financed deficit over the l960:Q1 to 1975:Q4 sample period.-11 Using

the Box—Jenkins (1970) identification procedures, the time—series

model ultimately obtained is----'

           Debt = .5734       tDebt        + .3850 Debt         +
                                       1                    2       t    (15)
                      (4.6)                   (2.6)
              = .90     SE      $3479m        Q(26) =   10.48
where
                                 —26—



          Debt = cumulative debt—financed federal deficit at time t
                =   serially   uncorrelated random error.

This estimated equation (15) is then shocked by $3.5 billion, or about

one standard error, and the dynamic cumulative changes in the federal

debt are computed. The increases in the cumulative deficit which

result are financed according to the historical proportions of the

amount outstanding in each of the maturity classes of Treasury securi-

ties to the total privately—held federal debt in each quarter. It may

be verified from (15) that the $3.5 billion shock cumulates to $26.1

billion after 12 quarters, and averages $15.3 billion over the same

period.

      As before, simulations are performed both with and without an

endogenously determined supply of corporate bonds. In the case of an

exogenously determined supply, dynamic simulations beginning in

l966:Ql and 1971:Q1 are reported on the top half of Table 4. In each



                       TABLE 4 about here




case, the dynamic simulations span 12 quarters. In comparison to the

results in Table 3, each of the simulations exhibit much larger

impacts in the initial quarter reflecting the significantly larger

magnitude of the federal debt shock. In the experiment initiated in

l966:Ql, the corporate bond yield rises throughout the 12 quarters,

while the equity yield reaches a peak and then declines to 21 basis

yields actually fall below their control si1Dulation values after 12

quarters.

      With an endogenously determined supply of corporate bonds, the

yields exhibit similar patterns, as is apparent on the bottom half of

Table 4. In this case, however, several of the initial impacts of the

deficit shocks are somewhat smaller. Moreover, after 12 quarters, the

corporate bond yield is significantly lower in comparison to the exog-

enous supply case. The declines in net issues of corporate bonds are

also fairly small relative to the increase in the cumulative deficit.

After 12 quarters, outstanding corporate bonds fall by about $7.7 and

$4.9 billion in the experiments initiated in l966:Ql and 1971:Ql,

respectively, while the cumulative change in federal debt equals $26.1

billion in each simulation. However, to the extent that the quantity

of as well as the yield on corporate bonds influences business invest-

ment decisions, these results could be consistent with some crowding

out of investment expenditures. These general equilibrium effects are

examined in the next section.


      DEFICITS, CAPITAL FORMATION, AND ECONOMIC ACTIVITY

      In this section, both the nonfinancial and financial effects of

an increase in the federal deficit are examined in a model developed

by B. Friedman (1981,1982). The model consists of B. Friedman's

(1977,1979) structural model of the corporate bond market, the struc-

tural model of the Treasury securities market discussed in preceding

sections, and the MPS model. The principal differences between this

model (hereafter MPS—CGB) and the NPS model are that yields are deter-

mined in an explicit supply—demand market—clearing framework, and that
                              —29—


 the government budget constraint is explicitly imposed.

       Deficits are increased in the simulation experiments by adding

 $10 billion to government expenditures in each quarter.-1' The money

stock is held at its control simulation path, thereby allowing vir-

tually all of the rise in the deficit to be reflected in net sales of

federal debt to the public. In implementing the simulation experiments,

the Treasury bill yield is determined in the money market as in the

unaltered ME'S model, and the quantity of Treasury bills (US1) is then

proximately determined in the short—term Treasury securities market.

The remainder of the deficit that must be financed is allocated to the

other three maturities of Treasury securities according to their

historical proportions to total privately—held federal debt.

      The results of two dynamic simulations are reported in Table 5.



                      TABLE 5 about here




As before, the simulations begin in l966:Ql and 197l:Q1. The experi-

ments consist of increasing real government expenditures by $10 billion

in each of four quarters. In terms of interest rates, the pattern is

similar to that found in the partial—equilibrium financial model,

although the long—intermediate—term yield appears to be somewhat un-

stable. Nevertheless, all yields initially rise above control simula-

tion levels in response to the increase in debt—financed government

expenditures, while the longer run effects on the long-term yields are

ambiguous.!71 The impact on the supply of outstanding corporate

bonds is on average smaller than before, reflecting a larger amount of

 total corporate external financing resulting from the cumulative rise

in investment spending.

      The effect of this debt—financed fiscal policy action on

economic activity is much smaller in the NPS—CGB model than would be

expected in the unaltered MPS model. In the MPS—CGB model, real GNP

rises by slightly more than the increase in government expenditures in

the initial quarter, but by the end of four quarters real spending

equals about one—third of the rise. Real business fixed investment

exhibits a small initial rise due to accelerator effects, but in the

1966:Q4 experiment, some real investment is crowded out after four

quarters. Moreover, the nominal federal deficit rises over the four

quarters, and since prices remain virtually unchanged from their con-

trol simulation levels, the rise mainly reflects gains in real

deficits.

      As a whole, the results suggest that while a debt—financed

increase in government spending provides stimulus over four quarters,

the multiplier is less than one after a year. Moreover, the results

suggest that capital formation could be adversely affected, although

it rises on average in the simulations. One source of these rather

pessimistic results is the deficit—financing scheme adopted in the

experiments. In particular, as a consequence of the bill yield being

determined in the money market, the supply of bills held by the public

actually falls by over $1 billion after four quarters in each of the

simulations)1 Thus, the rise in the deficit in addition to this $1

billion must be financed by issuing longer term debt instruments. In

particular, slightly less than one—half of the cumulative rise in the

deficit is financed with long—intermediate— and long—term Treasury
                             —32—


securities. On the basis of debt—managements experiments using this

model [B. Friedman (1981)], a greater emphasis on short—term debt

financing would lead to a more expansionary fiscal policy impact on

both total spending and capital formation.


                    SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS

      Asset substitutability played an explicit role in determining the

effects of federal deficits on interest rates and economic activity in

this paper. The role of asset substitutability was made explicit by

considering the impact of deficits in a disaggregated structural model

of the U.S. Treasury securities, corporate bond, and equity markets.

In this model, the relationships among yields depend on the substitut-

ability of assets in the portfolios of different categories of inves-

tors. As indicated in the simple illustrative model considered at the

outset of this paper, the presence of imperfect asset substitutability

implies that the possible impact of an increase in the federal deficit

may range from crowding out to crowding in.

      In simulations which examined both portfolio and total crowding

out, the results suggest that the manner in which the deficit is

financed affects interest rates. When the increased deficit is fi-

nanced with short—term Treasury securities, the partial equilibrium

experiments indicated that corporate bond and equity yields change

only slightly. In contrast, when long—term debt—financing is employed,

both yields rise, particularly the corporate bond yield. Simulations

in a general equilibrium setting tended to coincide with these results,

as an increase in government expenditures financed by new issues of

Treasury securities exclusive of Treasury bills was found to be offset
                             —33—


significantly, but not completely, by a reduction in private

expenditures.

     *1 am grateful to David Johnson and Rick Troll for research

assistance, to Benjamin Friedman for the use of his expanded MPS

model, and to Benjamin Friedman, Alan Hess, Karlyn Mitchell, Carl

Walsh, and Charles Webster for helpful comments. This paper was

prepared for the conference on "The Economic Consequences of

Government Deficits," cosponsored by the Center for the Study of

American Business and the Institute for Banking and Financial Markets,

Washington University. This paper is also a part of the Financial

Markets and Monetary Economics Program of the National Bureau of

Economic Research. The views expressed here are solely my own and do

not necessarily represent the views of the Federal Reserve Bank of

Kansas City or the Federal Reserve System.

     1. The source of these data are Board of Governors of the

Federal Reserve System (1975) and subsequent issues. For purposes of

this introductory section, total marketable U.S. Treasury securities

are disaggregated into Federal Reserve and non—Federal Reserve

holdings.

     2.     For a reduction in taxes, private spending remains at its

initial level implying an unchanged level of total spending in both of

the cases considered below.

     3. This theory also hinges on operative intergenerational trans-

fers in which the size of bequests varies with the presumed tax

liability of future generations. For evidence on the importance of

intergenerational transfers as a determinant of private saving, see

Kotlikoff and Summers (1981). For arguments and evidence against the

Ricardian equivalence view, see Feldstein (1982).
       4. For other dynamic long—run analyses of the two—asset model,

 see, for example, Burmeister and Phelps (1971), Infante and Stein

 (1976), Tobin and Buiter (1976), and Turnovsky (1978).

       5. In this model it is assumed that investors regard federal

debt as wealth, that resources are not fully employed, and that the

price level is constant.

       6. A system of asset demands similar to the set of equations (1)

may   be   derived from expected utility maximization. In the expected—

utility maximization models presented by Blanchard and Plantes (1977)

and Roley (1979), positive covariances between asset yields are a

necessary but not a sufficient condition for gross substitutability.

Moreover, Roley (1983) has shown that syietry in the yield—coefficient

matrix implies constant absolute risk aversion, and hence is not a

general property of asset demands. Symmetry is not, therefore,

imposed in the asset demands (1).

      7. For previous studies which examine the consequences of asset

substitutability in the three—asset model, see, for example, Tobin

(1961,1963), Brunner and Meltzer (1972), B. Friedman (1978), Cohen and

McMenamin (1978), and Walsh (1983). In contrast to the other studies

listed above and to the illustrative model discussed here, Cohen and

McMenamin (1978) consider the dynamic and long—run consequences of

asset substitutability in determining the effect of deficits. Also,

Walsh (1983) is unique in considering the impact of deficits in

models based on explicit utility maximizing behavior and rational

expectations.

      8. Households are also assumed to regard the net worth of banks

(NW) as exogenous and to allocate W—NW among money, federal debt, and
corporate bonds. Thus, W—NW replaces W in equation (1), where

W = Md + Td + Bd +    =   H+T   + K.

     9. For a more complete description of this model, see Roley

(1980).

    10. For a discussion of alternative models of interest—rate

determination, see Friedman and Roley (1980). For a comparison of a

version of this disaggregated structural model to the "efficient

markets" model as advanced, for example, by Pesando (1978) and

Mishkin (1978), see Roley (1981).

    11. The portfolio adjustment models specified by Brainard and

Tobin (1968), Modigliani (1972), Bosworth and Duesenberry (1973), and

B. Friedman (1977) exhibit some, but not all, of these properties.

    12. In a test of rational, unitary, and autoregressive models of

expectations in the context of a disaggregated structural model of the

corporate bond market, the autoregressive model used here to represent

expected capital gains on equities dominates the other expectations

models. See Friedman and Roley (l979a).

    13. This corporate bond supply equation was re—estimated through

l975:Q4. The estimated coefficients remained basically unchanged

from those reported by B. Friedman (1979).

    14. To conform with the simulation experiments in the next sec-

tion, the aggregated debt variable—as opposed to the stocks of the

individual maturity classes of Treasury securities—is used to

evaluate the impact of deficit shocks. These deficit data should

correspond to those used by Barro (1980). However, in calculating

deficit shocks, Barro does not use an ARIMA model.

    15. This model was estimated using Chase Econometrics' automated
Box—Jenkins program. The Q(26) statistic is distributed as X2(24),

and is not significantly different from zero at the 5 percent

significance level, indicating that the null hypothesis of white

noise residuals cannot be rejected.

    16. While this procedure departs from the innovation technique

implemented in the previous section, the numerical values are not

drastically different. In particular, an ARIMA model was estimated

for the five exogenous categories of government expenditures in the

MPS—CGB model, and the combined standard error was about $6 billion.

Over the next three quarters, a one standard error shock yielded

values of $7.5, $7.3, and $8.1 billion. In the current version of the

program used to simulate the MPS—CCB model, only constant changes in

government expenditures may be used.

    17. In a reduced—form model, Makin (1982) estimates the impact of

deficit shocks to be less than one—third of the magnitude reported

here for the Treasury bill yield. In representing deficit shocks,

Makin employs a demand shock involving exports instead of the govern-

ment expenditures variable used in Table 5.

    18. In the simulations, the increase in the demand for Treasury

bills resulting from the rise in the Treasury bill yield is more than

offset as a result of rises in other yields, particularly r2 and r3.
