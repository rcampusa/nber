We estimate the effect of temporary tax incentives on equipment investment using shifts in accelerated
depreciation. Analyzing data for over 120,000 firms, we present three findings. First, bonus depreciation
raised investment in eligible capital relative to ineligible capital by 10.4% between 2001 and 2004
and 16.9% between 2008 and 2010. Second, small firms respond 95% more than big firms. Third,
firms respond strongly when the policy generates immediate cash flows but not when cash flows only
come in the future. This heterogeneity materially affects aggregate estimates and supports models
in which financial frictions or fixed costs amplify investment responses.

       Economists have long asked how taxes affect investment (Hall and Jorgenson, 1967). The
answer is central to the design of countercyclical fiscal policy, since policymakers often use
tax-based investment incentives to spur growth in times of economic weakness. Improving
policy design requires knowing which firms are most responsive to taxes and why they respond.
However, because comprehensive micro data has been previously unavailable, past work has
not fully explored the role of heterogeneity in how tax policy affects investment or whether
such heterogeneity is macroeconomically relevant.1
       This paper uses two episodes of investment stimulus and a difference-in-differences method-
ology to study the effect of taxes on investment and how it varies across firms. The policy we
study, “bonus” depreciation, accelerates the schedule for when firms can deduct from taxable
income the cost of investment purchases. Bonus alters the timing of deductions but not their
amount, so the economic incentive created by bonus works because future deductions are
worth less than current deductions. That is, bonus works because of discounting: firms judge
the benefits of bonus by the present discounted value of deductions over time.2
       Our first empirical finding is that bonus depreciation has a substantial effect on investment.
We find that bonus depreciation raised eligible investment by 10.4 percent on average between
2001 and 2004 and 16.9 percent between 2008 and 2010. Our estimates are consistent with
the large aggregate response House and Shapiro (2008) document for the first episode of
bonus, but well above estimates from studies of other tax reforms.3
       The first part of the paper details this finding and a litany of robustness tests. The research
design compares firms at the same point in time whose benefits from bonus differ. Our strat-
egy exploits technological differences between firms in narrowly defined industries. Firms in
industries with most of their investment in short duration categories act as the “control group”
because bonus only modestly alters their depreciation schedule. This natural experiment sep-
arates the effect of bonus from other economic shocks happening at the same time. If the
parallel trends assumption holds—if investment growth for short and long duration industries

      Key theoretical studies include Hall and Jorgenson (1967), Tobin (1969), Hayashi (1982), Abel and Eberly
(1994), and Caballero and Engel (1999). Abel (1990) presents a unifying synthesis of the early theoretical
literature. Key empirical work includes Summers (1981), Auerbach and Hassett (1992), Cummins, Hassett and
Hubbard (1994), Goolsbee (1998), Chirinko, Fazzari and Meyer (1999), Desai and Goolsbee (2004), Cooper and
Haltiwanger (2006), House and Shapiro (2008), and Yagan (2015). Edgerton (2010) explores heterogeneity
within a sample of public companies but finds mixed results.
    2
      Summers (1987) states this most clearly: “It is only because of discounting that depreciation schedules affect
investment decisions. . . ”
    3
      Cummins, Hassett and Hubbard (1994) study many corporate tax reforms with public company data and con-
clude that tax policy has a strong effect on investment. Using similar data and a different empirical methodology,
Chirinko, Fazzari and Meyer (1999) argue that tax policy has a small effect on investment and that Cummins,
Hassett and Hubbard (1994) misinterpret their results. Hassett and Hubbard (2002) survey empirical work and
conclude that the range of estimates for the user cost elasticity has narrowed to between -0.5 and -1. Surveying
this and more recent work, Bond and Van Reenen (2007) decide “it is perhaps a little too early to agree with
Hassett and Hubbard (2002) that there is a new ‘consensus’ on the size and robustness of this effect.”



                                                         2
would have been similar absent the policy—then the experimental design is valid.
       The key threat to this design is that time-varying industry shocks may coincide with bonus.
This risk is limited for four reasons. First, graphical inspection of parallel trends indicates
smooth pretrends and a clear, steady break for short and long duration firms during both the
2001 to 2004 and 2008 to 2010 bonus periods. The effects are the same size in both periods,
though different industries suffered in each recession. Second, the estimates are stable across
many specifications and after including firm-level cash flow controls, industry Q, and flexible
industry trends. Controlling for industry-level co-movement with the macroeconomy increases
our estimates, and we confirm parallel trends in past recessions when policymakers did not
introduce investment stimulus. Third, the estimates pass a placebo test: the effect of bonus on
ineligible investment is indistinguishable from zero. Last, for firms making eligible investments,
bonus take-up rates (i.e., whether firms fill in the bonus box on the tax form) are indeed higher
in long duration industries. For these reasons, spurious factors are unlikely to explain the large
effect of bonus.
       In the second part of the paper, we present a set of heterogeneity tests designed to shed light
on the mechanisms underlying the large baseline response. Our second empirical finding is that
small firms are substantially more responsive to investment stimulus. We work with an analysis
sample of more than 120,000 public and private companies drawn from two million corporate
tax returns. Half the firms in our sample are smaller than the smallest firms in Compustat.4
The largest firms in our sample, those most like the public company samples from prior work,
yield estimates in line with past studies of other tax reforms. In contrast, small and medium-
sized firms show much stronger responses. Though aggregate investment is concentrated at
the top of the firm size distribution—the top five percent of firms in our sample account for
more than sixty percent of investment—accounting for the bottom ninety-five percent of firms
materially affects our aggregate estimate. The investment-weighted elasticity is 27% higher
than the elasticity for the largest firms.
       The asymmetry of the corporate tax code introduces another source of heterogeneity: firms
with tax losses must wait to realize the benefits of tax breaks. Because many firms in our sample
are in a tax loss position when a policy shock occurs, we can ask how much firms value future
tax benefits, namely, the larger deductions bonus depreciation provides them in later years.
Our third empirical finding is that firms only respond to investment incentives when the policy
immediately generates cash flows. This finding holds even though firms can carry forward
unused deductions to offset future taxes, and it cannot be explained by differences in growth
opportunities.
   4
    When aggregated, these small firms account for a large amount of economic activity. According to Census
tabulations in 2007 (http://www.census.gov/econ/susb/data/susb2007.html), firms with less than
$100 million in receipts (around the 80th percentile in our data) account for more than half of total employment
and one third of total receipts.


                                                       3
   To confirm the importance of immediacy, we study a second component of the depreciation
schedule. Firms making small investment outlays face a permanent kink in the tax schedule,
which creates a discontinuous change in marginal investment incentives. This sharp change in
incentives induces substantial investment bunching, with many firms electing amounts within
just a few hundred dollars of the kink. And when legislation raises the kink, the bunching
pattern follows. Immediacy proves crucial in this setting, as bunching strongly depends on a
firm’s current tax status: firms just in positive tax position are far more likely to bunch than
firms on the other side of the discontinuity. For a different group of firms and a different
depreciation policy, we again find that firms ignore future tax benefits.
   Our findings have implications for which models of corporate behavior are most likely to
fit the data. In the presence of financial frictions (Jensen and Meckling, 1976; Myers and Ma-
jluf, 1984; Stein, 2003), firms value future cash flows with high effective discount rates, which
amplify the perceived value of bonus incentives because the difference in today’s tax bene-
fits dwarfs the present value comparison that matters in frictionless models. Building on the
differential response by firm size, we perform a split sample analysis using alternative mark-
ers of ex ante financial constraints. In addition to small firms, non-dividend payers and firms
with low cash holdings are 1.5 to 2.6 times more responsive than their unconstrained counter-
parts. Moreover, we find that firms respond by borrowing and cutting dividends. That firms
only respond to immediate tax benefits also suggests models in which liquidity considerations
matter.
   Though these facts suggest a role for financial frictions, markers of financial constraints and
tax position may also measure the likelihood of adjustment in models with non-convex adjust-
ment costs (Caballero and Engel, 1999; Cooper and Haltiwanger, 2006). In these models,
when the policy induces a firm across its adjustment threshold, investment increases sharply
because the firm does not plan to adjust every year. Thus models in which fixed costs lead firms
to differ in their relative distance from an adjustment threshold may also explain the patterns
we observe. Consistent with this idea, firms very likely or very unlikely to invest in the absence
of the policy indeed exhibit lower elasticities. Taken together, the data point toward models in
which financial frictions, fixed costs, or a mix of these factors amplify investment responses.
   Our paper follows a long literature that exploits cross sectional variation to study the effect
of tax policy on investment (Cummins, Hassett and Hubbard, 1994; Goolsbee, 1998; House and
Shapiro, 2008). We depart by using a broader sample of firms than public company samples
and by using detailed micro data to present new heterogeneity analyses, which shed light on
the underlying mechanisms. Allowing for heterogeneous responses also proves necessary to
estimate an accurate aggregate elasticity. In addition, the results suggest that countercyclical
policy aimed at high elasticity subpopulations can produce larger effects, in a similar spirit to
studies documenting heterogeneous responses of consumption to policy changes (Shapiro and


                                                4
Slemrod, 1995; Johnson, Parker and Souleles, 2006; Aaronson, Agarwal and French, 2012).
Our findings also highlight the potential importance of distinguishing tax policies that target
investment directly and immediately—such as depreciation changes—from policies that more
broadly affect the cost of capital and pay off gradually over time—such as corporate or dividend
tax changes (Feldstein, 1982; Auerbach and Hassett, 1992; Yagan, 2015).
    Section 1 introduces the bonus depreciation policy and our conceptual approach. Sec-
tion 2 describes the corporate tax data, variable construction, and sample selection process.
Section 3 describes the main empirical strategy for studying bonus depreciation, the identifi-
cation assumptions, and presents results and robustness tests. Section 4 explores the role of
heterogeneity in driving our results and presents aggregate estimates that account for this het-
erogeneity. Section 5 connects our findings to past work and discusses alternative theoretical
interpretations. Section 6 concludes.


1     Bonus Depreciation

1.1    Conceptual Approach
Consider a firm buying $1 million worth of computers. The firm owes corporate taxes on
income net of business expenses. For expenses on nondurable items such as wages and adver-
tising, the firm can immediately deduct the full cost of these items on its tax return. Thus an
extra dollar of spending on wages reduces the firm’s taxable income by a dollar and reduces
the firm’s tax bill by the tax rate. But for investment expenses the rules differ.
    Usually, the firm follows the regular depreciation schedule in the top panel of Table 1. The
first year deduction is $200 thousand, which provides an after-tax benefit of $70 thousand.
Over the next five years, the firm deducts the remaining $800 thousand. The total undiscounted
deduction is the $1 million spent and the total undiscounted tax benefit is $350 thousand.
    The value of these deductions thus depends on the tax rate and how the schedule interacts
with the firm’s discount rate. We collapse the stream of future depreciation deductions owed
for investment:
                                               T
                                               X        1
                                    z = D0 +
                                     0
                                                               Dt ,                          (1)
                                               t=1
                                                     (1 + r) t

where Dt is the allowable deduction per dollar of investment in period t, T is the class life of
investment, and r is the risk-adjusted rate the firm uses to discount future flows. z 0 measures
the present discounted value of one dollar of investment deductions before tax. If the firm
can immediately deduct the full dollar, then z 0 equals one. Because of discounting, z 0 is lower
for longer-lived items (i.e., items with greater T ), which forms the core of our identification
strategy.

Notes: This table displays year-by-year deductions and tax benefits for a $1 million investment in computers, a five
year item, depreciable according to the Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS). The top schedule
applies during normal times. It reflects a half-year convention for the purchase year and a 200 percent declining
balance method (2X straight line until straight line is greater). The bottom schedule applies when 50 percent
bonus depreciation is available. See IRS publication 946 for the recovery periods and schedules applying to other
class lives.



       In general, the stream of future deductions depends on future discount rates and tax rates.
For discount rates, we apply a risk-adjusted rate of seven percent for r to compute z 0 in the
data, which enables comparison to past work. Our empirical analysis assumes the effective tax
rate does not change over time, except when the firm is nontaxable.5 When the next dollar of
investment does not affect this year’s tax bill, then the firm must carry forward the deductions
to future years.6
       Bonus depreciation allows the firm to deduct a per dollar bonus, θ , at the time of the
investment and then depreciate the remaining 1 − θ according to the normal schedule:

                                               z = θ + (1 − θ )z 0                                              (2)

Returning to the example in Table 1, assume 50 percent bonus. The firm can now deduct a
$500 thousand bonus before following the normal schedule for the remaining amount, so the
total first year deduction rises to $600 thousand. Each subsequent deduction falls by half.
       The total amount deducted over time does not change. However, the accelerated schedule
   5
     We use the top statutory tax rate in the set of specifications requiring a tax rate. This is an upper bound on
the more realistic effective marginal tax rate, which in turn depends on tax rate progressivity and the level of
other expenses relative to taxable income. See, e.g., Graham (1996, 2000) for a method tracing out the marginal
tax benefit curve. The policies we study will increase the use of investment as a tax shield regardless of where
the firm is on this marginal benefit curve. Except when current and all future taxes are zero, bonus increases the
marginal tax benefit of investment.
   6
     This assumes that “carrybacks”—in which firms apply unused deductions this year against past tax bills—have
been exhausted or ignored.



                                                          6
does raise the present value of these deductions. Applying a seven percent discount rate yields
$311 thousand for the present value of cash back in normal times. Bonus raises this present
value by $20 thousand, just two percent of the original purchase price. This small present
value payoff is why some authors conclude that bonus provides little stimulus for short-lived
items (Desai and Goolsbee, 2004).7
      The more delayed the normal depreciation schedule is, the more generous bonus will be.
Longer-lived items like telephone lines and heavy manufacturing equipment have a more de-
                                                                      0
layed baseline schedule than short-lived items like computers (i.e., zLong < zShort
                                                                              0
                                                                                    ). Thus indus-
tries that buy more long-lived equipment see a larger relative price cut when bonus happens.
At different points in time, Congress has set θ equal to 0, 0.3, 0.5 or 1. We use these policy
shocks to identify the effect of bonus depreciation on investment. Industries differ by aver-
age z 0 prior to bonus, providing the basis for a difference-in-differences setup with continuous
treatment.
      In a frictionless model, a firm will judge the benefits of bonus by comparing these present
value payoffs. Note however the large difference in the initial deduction, which translates into
$140 thousand of savings in the investment year. Such a difference will matter if firms must
borrow to meet current expenses and external finance is costly (Stein, 2003). Or it will matter
if managers place excess weight on taxes saved today, so that they will aggressively use bonus
to reduce taxes but only when the benefits are immediate. In short, when firms use higher
effective discount rates to evaluate bonus, they will respond more than the frictionless model
predicts.
      Even without financial frictions, bonus can induce a large investment response for the
longest-lived items through intertemporal substitution when firms expect the policy to be tem-
porary (House and Shapiro, 2008). Alternatively, if investment entails fixed costs, firms in-
duced by bonus across an adjustment threshold will show a large response even in the absence
of financial frictions (Winberry, 2015). Our empirical approach does not rely on a particular
mechanism driving the response, just that the incentives created by bonus operate through
discounting. We present a set of baseline estimates that can be interpreted without appealing
to a specific theory, and then follow with a series of heterogeneity analyses designed to shed
light on the underlying mechanisms.


1.2      Policy Background
House and Shapiro (2008) provide a detailed discussion of the baseline depreciation schedule
and legislative history of the first round of bonus depreciation.8 Kitchen and Knittel (2011)

provide a brief legislative history of the second round. Appendix A summarizes the relevant
legislation for our sample frame.
   In 2001, firms buying qualified investments were allowed to immediately write off 30 per-
cent of the cost of these investments. The bonus increased to 50 percent in 2003 and expired at
the end of 2004. In 2008, 50 percent bonus depreciation was reinstated. It was later extended
to 100 percent bonus for tax years ending between September 2010 and December 2011. The
policies applied to equipment and excluded most structures.
   The policies were intended as economic stimulus. In the words of Congress, “increasing
and extending the additional first-year depreciation will accelerate purchases of equipment,
promote capital investment, modernization, and growth, and will help to spur an economic
recovery” (Committee on Ways & Means, 2003, p. 23). That the policies were not imple-
mented at random, but rather coincided with times of economic weakness, is why we exploit
cross-sectional variation in policy exposure to separate the effects of bonus from other macroe-
conomic factors.
   To avoid encouraging firms to delay investment until the policy came online, legislators
announced that bonus would apply retroactively to include the time when the policy was under
debate. Although the first bonus legislation passed in early 2002, firms anticipating policy
passage would have begun responding in the fourth quarter of 2001. We therefore include
firm-years with the tax year ending within the legislated window in our treatment window.
   Whether firms perceived the policy as temporary or permanent is a subject of debate. The
initial bill branded the policy as temporary stimulus, slating it to expire at the end of 2004,
which it did. For this reason, House and Shapiro (2008) assume firms treat the policy as
temporary. In contrast, Desai and Goolsbee (2004) cite survey evidence indicating that many
firms expected the provisions to continue. Expecting the policy to be temporary is important
for House and Shapiro (2008), because their exercise relies upon how policies approximated as
instantaneous interact with the duration of investment goods approximated as infinitely lived.
In his comment on Desai and Goolsbee (2004), Hassett also argues that the temporary nature
of these policies increases the stimulus through intertemporal shifting.
   While an assumption about expectations may be important for interpreting the data, mea-
suring the baseline policy response does not require such an assumption. Nor is a particular
assumption necessary to justify a large policy response; as noted above, financial frictions and
non-convex adjustment costs can amplify the effects of both temporary and permanent poli-
cies. And because we allow firms in high exposure industries to respond with an arbitrary mix
of short- and long-lived purchases, our empirical design relies less than House and Shapiro’s
(2008) design on the response of the longest-lived investment goods.

2        Business Tax Data
The analysis in this paper uses the most complete dataset yet applied to study business invest-
ment incentives.9 The data include detailed information on equipment and structures invest-
ment, offering a finer breakdown than previously available for a broad class of industries. The
sample includes many small, private firms and all of the largest US firms, which enables a rich
heterogeneity analysis. Because the data come from corporate tax returns, we can precisely
separate firms based on whether the next dollar of investment affects this year’s taxes. We de-
scribe the source of these data, the analysis sample, and how we map tax items into empirical

Each year, the Statistics of Income (SOI) division of the IRS Research, Analysis, and Statistics
unit produces a stratified sample of approximately 100,000 unaudited corporate tax returns.
Stratification occurs by total assets, proceeds, and form type.10 SOI uses these samples to gen-
erate annual publications documenting income characteristics. The BEA uses them to finalize
national income statistics. In addition, the Treasury’s Office of Tax Analysis (OTA) uses the
sample to perform policy analysis and revenue estimation.
        In 2008, the sample represented about 1.8 percent of the total population of 6.4 million
C and S corporation returns. Any corporation selected into the sample in a given year will be
selected again the next year, providing it continues to fall in a stratum with the same or higher
sampling rate. Shrinking firms are resampled at a lower rate, which introduces sampling attri-
tion. We address this attrition in several ways, including a nonparametric reweighting proce-
dure for figures and through assessing the robustness of our results in a balanced panel. Each
sample year includes returns with accounting periods ending between July of that year and
the following June. When necessary, we recode the tax year to align with the implementation
of the policies studied in this paper.


2.2        Analysis Samples, Variable Definitions, and Summary Statistics
We create a panel by linking the cross sectional SOI study files using firm identifiers. The raw
dataset has 1.84 million firm-years covering the period from 1993 to 2010. There are 355
    9
     Yagan (2015) uses these data to study the 2003 dividend tax cut. Kitchen and Knittel (2011) use these data
to describe general patterns in bonus and Section 179 take-up.
  10
     For example, C corporations file form 1120 and S corporations file form 1120S. Other form types include
real estate investment trusts, regulated investment companies, foreign corporations, life insurance companies,
and property and casualty insurance companies. We focus on 1120 and 1120S, which cover the bulk of business
activity in industries making equipment investments. More detail on the sample is available at http://www.
irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/08cosec3ccr.pdf.

                                                      9
thousand distinct firms in this dataset, 19,711 firms with returns in each year of the sample,
and 62,478 firms with at least 10 years of returns. Beginning with the sample of firms with
valid data for each of the main data items analyzed, we keep firm-years satisfying the follow-
ing criteria: (a) having non-zero total deductions or non-zero total income and (b) having an
attached investment form.11 In addition, we exclude partial year returns, which occur when a
firm closes or changes its fiscal year. To analyze bonus depreciation, we exclude firms poten-
tially affected by Section 179, a small firm investment incentive which we analyze separately.
Our main bonus analysis sample consists of all firms with average eligible investment greater
than $100,000 during years of positive investment.12 This sample consists of 820,769 obser-
vations for 128,151 distinct firms.
       Our main variable of interest, eligible investment, includes expenditures for all equipment
investment put in place during the current year for which bonus and Section 179 incentives
apply.13 We conduct separate analyses for intensive and extensive margin responses. The in-
tensive margin variable is the logarithm of eligible investment. The extensive margin variable
is an indicator for positive eligible investment. We aggregate this indicator at the industry
                                                                              p
level and transform it into a log odds ratio (i.e., we use log( 1−p )) for our empirical analyses.
In some specifications, we use an alternative measure of investment, which is eligible invest-
ment divided by lagged capital stock. Capital stock is the reported book value of all tangible,
depreciable assets. Sales equals operating revenue and assets equals total book assets. Total
debt equals the sum of non-equity liabilities excluding trade credit. Liquid assets equals cash
and other liquid securities. Payroll equals non-officer wage compensation. Rents equals lease
and rental expenses. Interest equals interest payments.
       Our main policy variable of interest, zN,t , is the present discounted value of one dollar of
deductions for eligible investment, where N refers to a four-digit NAICS industry. In each
non-bonus year, we compute the share of eligible investment a firm reports in each category—
specifically, 3-, 5-, 7-, 10-, 15-, and 20-year Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System prop-
erty and listed property. We compute category z’s by applying a seven percent discount rate to
the category’s respective deduction schedule from IRS publication 946.14 For each firm-year,
  11
      Knittel et al. (2011) use a similar “de minimus” test based on income and deductions to select business entities
that engage in “substantial” business activity. Form 4562 is the tax form that corporations attach to their return
to claim depreciation deductions on new and past investments. An entity that claims no depreciation deductions
need not attach form 4562. It is likely that these firms do not engage in investment activity, and so their exclusion
should not affect the interpretation of results.
   12
      The relevant threshold for Section 179 was $25,000 until 2003, when it increased to $100,000. In 2008, it
increased to $250,000 and then to $500,000 in 2010. Using alternative thresholds in the range from $50,000 to
$500,000 does not alter the results.
   13
      Section 179 also applies to used equipment purchases, while bonus only applies to new equipment. The form
does not require firms to list used purchases separately.
   14
      We apply the six-month convention for the purchase year. We use a seven percent rate as a benchmark that is
likely larger than the rate firms should be using, which will tend to bias our results downward. Summers (1987)
argues that firms should apply a discount rate close to the risk-free rate for depreciation deductions.


                                                         10
we combine the firm-level shares in each category with the category z’s to construct a weighted
average, firm-level z. We compute zN at the four-digit NAICS industry level as the simple aver-
age of firm-level z’s across non-bonus years prior to 2001. In bonus years, we adjust zN by the
size of the bonus. If θ is the additional expense allowed per dollar of investment (e.g., θ = 0.3
for 2001), then zN ,t = θ t + (1 − θ t ) × zN . The interaction between the time-series variation in
θ and the cross-sectional variation in zN delivers the identifying variation we use to study the
effect of bonus.
    Table 2 collects summary statistics for the sample in our bonus depreciation analysis. The
average observation has $6.8 million in eligible investment, $180 million in sales, and $27
million in payroll. The size distribution of corporations is skewed, with median eligible invest-
ment of just $370 thousand and median sales of $26 million. The average net present value
of depreciation allowances, zN ,t , is 0.88 in non-bonus years, implying that eligible investment
deductions for a dollar of investment are worth eighty-eight cents to the average firm. zN ,t
increases to an average of 0.94 during bonus years. Cross sectional differences in zN ,t are sim-
ilar in magnitude to the change induced by bonus, with zN ,t varying from 0.87 at the tenth
percentile to 0.94 at the ninetieth. The first year deduction, θN ,t , increases from an average of
0.18 in non-bonus years to 0.58 in bonus years.
    It is helpful to give a sense of the groups being compared, because our identification will
be based on assuming that industry-by-year shocks are not confounding the trends between
industry groups. The five most common three-digit industries (NAICS code) in the bottom
three zN deciles are: motor vehicle and parts dealers (441), food manufacturing (311), real
estate (531), telecommunications (517), and fabricated metal product manufacturing (332).
In the top three deciles are: professional, scientific and technical services (541), specialty
trade contractors (238), computer and electronic product manufacturing (334), durable goods
wholesalers (423), and construction of buildings (236). Neither group of industries appears
to be skewed toward a spurious relative boom in the low z group. The telecommunications
industry suffered unusually during the early bonus period as did real estate in the later period.
Both industries are in the group for which we observe a larger investment response due to
bonus.


3     The Effect of Bonus Depreciation on Investment

3.1      Empirical Setup
Bonus depreciation provides a temporary reduction in the after-tax price and a temporary in-
crease in the first-year deduction for eligible investment goods. Eligible items are classified for
deduction profiles over time based on their useful life. Identification builds upon the idea that

Notes: This table presents summary statistics for analysis of bonus depreciation. To preserve taxpayer anonymity,
“percentiles” are presented as means of all observations in the (P − 1, P + 1)th percentiles. Investment is bonus
eligible equipment investment. zN ,t is the weighted present value for a dollar of eligible investment expense at
the four-digit NAICS level, with weights computed using shares of investment in each eligible category. Statistics
are presented at both the firm-by-year and industry-by-year level. zN is the weighted present value for a dollar of
eligible investment in non-bonus periods for the cross section of industries in the sample. The odds ratio is defined
at the four-digit NAICS level as the fraction of firms with positive investment divided by the fraction with zero
investment. Cash flow is net income before depreciation after taxes paid. Ratios are censored at the one percent
level. Appendix Table B.1 presents more detailed investment statistics, allowing comparison of our sample to past
work.




                                                        12
some industries benefited more from these cuts by virtue of having longer duration investment
patterns, that is, by having more investment in longer class life categories. This cross sectional
variation permits a within-year comparison of investment growth for firms in different indus-
tries.15 The policy variation is at the industry-by-year level, so the key identifying assumption
is that the policies are independent of other industry-by-year shocks. Several robustness tests
validate this assumption.
    The regression framework implements the difference-in-differences (DD) specification,

                             f (I i t , Ki,t−1 ) = αi + β g(zN ,t ) + γX i t + δ t + "i t ,                   (3)

where zN ,t is measured at the four-digit NAICS industry level and increases temporarily during
bonus years. The investment data summarized in Table 2 is highly skewed with a mean of
$6.8 million and a median of just $370 thousand. Thus a multiplicative unobserved effect
(that is, I i = Ai I ∗ (z)) is the most likely empirical model for investment levels. This delivers an
additive model in logarithms, which is the approach we pursue below. Because approximately
eight percent of our observations for eligible investment are equal to zero, we supplement the
intensive margin logs approach with a log odds model for the extensive margin. We measure
the log odds ratio as log(P[I > 0]/(1 − P[I > 0])) at the four-digit industry level.16
    Studies often use an alternative empirical specification for f (I, K), where investment is
scaled by lagged assets or lagged capital stock. We prefer log investment for four reasons.
First, small firms are not always required to disclose balance sheet information, so requiring
reported assets would reduce our sample frame. Second, and related to the first reason, requir-
ing two consecutive years of data for a firm-year reduces our sample by fifteen percent. Third,
there is some concern that balance sheet data on tax accounts are not reported correctly for
consolidated companies due to failure to net out subsidiary elements.17 Measurement error in
the scaling variable introduces non-additive measurement error into the dependent variable.
Last, with multiple types of capital, the scaling variable might not remove the unobserved firm
effect from the model. This is especially a concern because we cannot measure a firm’s stock
of eligible capital and because firms vary in the share of total investments made in eligible cat-
egories.18 While we prefer the log investment model, we also report results using investment
scaled by lagged capital stock, which allows comparison to past studies.
  15
     This methodological approach was first applied in Cummins, Hassett and Hubbard (1994). See also Cummins,
Hassett and Hubbard (1996), Desai and Goolsbee (2004), House and Shapiro (2008), and Edgerton (2010).
  16
     An alternative specification, with the odds ratio replaced by P[I > 0], works as well. However, the logs odds
ratio has better statistical properties (e.g., a more symmetric distribution).
  17
     Mills, Newberry and Trautman (2002) analyze balance sheet accounting in tax data and document difficulties
in reconciling these accounts with book accounts.
  18
     Abel (1990) notes that this issue and other violations of linear homogeneity can lead to spurious conclusions
(e.g., a reversed investment-Q relationship).

3.2       Graphical Evidence
Figure 1 presents a visual implementation of this research design. To allow a comparison that
matches a regression analysis with fixed effects and firm-level covariates, we construct residuals
from a two-step regression procedure. First, we nonparametrically reweight the group-by-year
distribution within ten size bins based on assets crossed with ten size bins based on sales.
This procedure addresses sampling frame changes over time, which cause instability in the
aggregate distribution.19 In the second step, we run cross sectional regressions each year of the
outcome variable on an indicator for treatment group—either long duration or short duration—
and a rich set of controls, including ten-piece splines in assets, sales, profit margin, and age.
We plot the residual group means from these regressions.
       We compare mean investment in calendar time for the top and bottom three industry-
level deciles of the investment duration distribution. Long duration industries show growth
well above that of short duration industries, with this difference only appearing in the bonus
years. The difference between the slopes of these two lines in any year gives the difference-in-
differences estimate between these groups in that year. The other years provide placebo tests
of the natural experiment and indicate no false positives.


3.3       Statistical Results and Economic Magnitudes
Table 3 presents regressions of the form in (3), where f (I i t , Ki,t−1 ) equals log(I i t ) in the in-
tensive margin model, log(PN [I i t > 0]/(1 − PN [I i t > 0])) in the extensive margin model, and
I i t /Ki,t−1 in the tax term model; and g(zN ,t ) equals zN ,t in the intensive and extensive margin
models and (1 − τzN ,t )/(1 − τ) in the tax term model. The baseline specification includes year
and firm fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered at the firm level in the intensive margin
and tax term models.20 Because log odds ratios are computed at the industry level, standard
errors in the extensive margin model are clustered at the industry level.
       The first column reports an intensive margin semi-elasticity of investment with respect to
z of 3.7, an extensive margin semi-elasticity of 3.8, and a tax term elasticity of −1.6. The
average change in zN ,t was 4.8 cents (or 0.048) during the early bonus period and 7.8 cents
  19
      During the period we study, the size of the sample frame changed twice due to budgetary constraints, which
causes the size distribution within our sample to shift. This reweighting procedure, first used by DiNardo, Fortin
and Lemieux (1996), allows comparisons of groups over time when group-level distributions of observable char-
acteristics are not stationary. We set the bins based on the size distribution of assets and sales in 2000 and compute
bin counts and total counts separately for treatment and control groups. In other years, we apply bin-level weights
equal to the base-year fraction of firms in a bin divided by the current-year fraction of firms in a bin.
   20
      This is consistent with recent work (e.g., Desai and Goolsbee (2004), Edgerton (2010), Yagan (2015)) and
enables us to compare our confidence bands to past estimates. The implicit assumption that errors within indus-
tries are independent is strong, for the same reason that Bertrand, Duflo and Mullainathan (2004) criticize papers
that cluster at the individual level when studying state policy changes. Our results in this section are robust to
industry clustering, as are the tax splits in the next section.

             Extensive Margin: Bonus I                               Extensive Margin: Bonus II




Notes: The top graphs plot the average logarithm of eligible investment over time for groups sorted according to
their industry-based treatment intensity. Treatment intensity depends on the average duration of investment, with
long duration industries (treatment groups) seeing a larger average price cut due to bonus than short duration
industries (control groups). The bottom graphs plot the industry-level log odds ratio for the probability of positive
eligible investment, thus offering a measure of the extensive margin response. The treatment years for Bonus I
are 2001 through 2004 and 2008 through 2010 for Bonus II. In these years, the difference between changes in the
red and the blue lines provides a difference-in-differences estimator for the effect of bonus in that year for those
groups. The earlier years provide placebo tests and a demonstration of parallel trends. The averages plotted here
result from a two-step regression procedure. First, we nonparametrically reweight the group-by-year distribution
(i.e., Dinardo, Fortin, and Lemieux (1996) reweight) within ten size bins based on assets crossed with ten size
bins based on sales to address sampling frame changes over time. Second, we run cross sectional regressions each
year of the outcome variable on an indicator for treatment group and a rich set of controls, including ten-piece
splines in assets, sales, profit margin and age. We plot the residual group means from these regressions. To align
the first year of each series and ease comparison of trends, we subtract from each dot the group mean in the first
year and add back the pooled mean from the first year. All means are count weighted.




                                                        15
(or 0.078) during the later period, implying average investment increases of 17.7 log points
(= 3.69 × 0.048 = .177) and 28.8 log points (= 3.69 × 0.078 = .288), respectively. In a simple
investment model, the elasticity of investment with respect to the net of tax rate, 1 − τz,
equals the price elasticity and interest rate elasticity. Our empirical model delivers a large
elasticity of 7.2. Thus by several accounts, bonus depreciation has a substantial effect on
investment. However, these predictions should not be confused with the aggregate effect of
the policy, because they are based on equal-weighted regressions which include many small
firms. They only provide an informative aggregate prediction under the strong assumption
that the semi-elasticity is independent of firm size. We relax this assumption to produce an
aggregate estimate in Section 4.3.
       In the second column, including a control for contemporaneous cash flow scaled by lagged
capital does not alter the estimates. Columns three and four show a similar semi-elasticity for
both the early and late episodes. Column five controls for fourth order polynomials in each
of assets, sales, profit margin, and firm age, as well as industry average Q measured from
Compustat at the four-digit level. Column six adds quadratic time trends interacted with two-
digit NAICS industry dummies, which causes the estimated semi-elasticity to increase.21 These
alternative control sets do not challenge our main finding: the investment response to bonus
depreciation is robust across many specifications.


3.4       Robustness
The calendar time plot in Figure 1 provides several visual placebo tests through inspection of
the parallel trends assumption in non-bonus years. Because bonus depreciation excludes very
long lived items (i.e., structures), we can use ineligible investment as an alternative intratem-
poral placebo test. The first two columns of Table 4 present two specifications of the intensive
margin model, which replace eligible investment with structures investment. The first specifi-
cation is the baseline model, and the second includes two-digit industry dummies interacted
with quadratic time trends. We cannot distinguish the structures investment response from
zero. Thus the results pass this placebo test.22
       Another concern with our results is that they may merely reflect a reporting response, with
less real investment taking place. The third and fourth columns of Table 4 provide a reality
  21
     We can replace the quadratic time trends with increasingly nonlinear trends or two digit industry-by-time fixed
effects. We can also replace the time trends with two-digit industry interacted with log GDP or GDP growth. In
each case, the estimates increase. This suggests that omitted industry-level factors bias our estimates downward.
Consistent with this story, Dew-Becker (2012) shows that long duration investment falls more during recessions
than short duration investment.

     This placebo test is valid if structures are neither complements nor substitutes for equipment. Without this
assumption, the structures test remains useful because observing a structures response equal in magnitude or
larger than the equipment response would indicate that time-varying industry shocks drive our results.

check. We replace our measure of investment derived from form 4562 with net investment,
which is the difference in logarithms of the capital stock between year t and year t − 1. Both
the baseline and industry trend regressions confirm our gross investment results with net in-
vestment responding strongly as well.
    Columns five and six of Table 4 offer a sanity check of our findings. Here, the dependent
variable is an indicator for whether the firm reports depreciation expense in the specific form
item applicable to bonus. Effectively, this is a test for bonus depreciation take-up. The table
indicates that the probability of taking up bonus is strongly increasing in the strength of the
incentive.

                                             Yi t = αi + βzN ,t + δ t + "i t

where Yi t is either the logarithm of structures investment (columns (1) and (2)), log growth in capital stock
(columns (3) and (4)), or an indicator for take-up of bonus depreciation ((5) and (6)). zN ,t is the present value
of a dollar of eligible investment computed at the four-digit NAICS industry level, taking into account periods of
bonus depreciation. Columns (1), (3), and (5) implement the baseline specification in table 3. Columns (2), (4)
and (6) include quadratic time trends interacted with two-digit NAICS industry dummies. All regressions include
firm and year fixed effects. Standard errors clustered at the firm level are in parentheses.



    Appendix Tables B.2, B.3, and B.4 provide additional evidence suggesting omitted industry
shocks are unimportant. In Appendix Table B.2, we merge average industry zN ,t computed in
our data to a Compustat sample and estimate our baseline model using capital expenditures
reported in firm financial statements. Appendix Table B.2 confirms similar estimates to our
baseline analysis and for each round of bonus. The point estimate is somewhat larger, but not
statistically distinguishable from the estimate from our main sample.
    In Appendix Table B.3, we rerun the main specification within a Compustat sample using the
five recessions prior to 2001 as placebo tests of parallel trends. For each recession we assume
bonus depreciation was introduced in the first year of the recession and applied, as in the first
round of bonus, to the subsequent three years. In contrast to our estimates from the policy

                                                          18
period, four out of the five placebo recessions show zero or negative effects. The recession
beginning in 1973—which coincided with a reinstatement of the investment tax credit and a
shortening of depreciation allowances—shows a positive effect, lending further out-of-sample
support to the importance of investment tax incentives.
   Appendix Table B.4 takes a different approach and estimates our baseline model using zi,t
measured at the firm level to determine policy exposure. We prefer the industry-level measure
for our main analysis because measurement error in policy exposure correlated with firm-level
characteristics would confound our heterogeneity tests. At the same time, the firm-level mea-
sure allows us to control for industry-level shocks by including industry-by-time fixed effects.
Relative to the baseline firm-level estimate, including two-digit industry-by-year or four-digit
industry-by-year fixed effects lowers point estimates somewhat. But the effects remain strong
and are statistically indistinguishable from the baseline estimates.
   Bonus depreciation coincided at different points in time with other business tax policy
changes that may have affected investment as well. The most important of these are the 2003
dividend tax cut, the temporary extensions of the net operating loss carryback window from
2 to 5 years in both 2001 and in 2008, and the temporary repatriation holiday of 2004. For
any of these changes to confound our estimates, they must disproportionately affect long du-
ration industries relative to short duration industries, and these effects must be concentrated
within eligible categories of investment. These other policy changes either affect the relative
price of all corporate activity (the dividend tax cut) or provide unrestricted liquidity to the firm
(the carryback extensions and the repatriation holiday), and so do not make strong predictions
about the relative response of eligible and ineligible investment, nor do they obviously benefit
long duration industries more generously.
   Furthermore, research that has explored these other policies finds limited investment re-
sponses or that the affected groups represent a small fraction of the population we study. In
the case of the dividend tax cut, Yagan (2015) finds a precisely estimated zero effect of the
tax on investment, using a similar sample drawn from corporate tax returns. In the case of the
repatriation holiday, Dharmapala, Foley and Forbes (2011) find that very few firms benefited
from the holiday and these firms primarily responded by returning funds to shareholders. In
the case of carryback extensions, Mahon and Zwick (2015) show that just ten percent of C-
corporations are eligible for net operating loss carrybacks. Our response is concentrated among
firms currently in taxable position who are not eligible for carrybacks.


3.5    Investment Responses to Depreciation Kinks
We now present direct evidence that firms take the tax code into account when making invest-
ment decisions. With respect to equipment investment, they pay special attention to the depre-
ciation schedule and the nonlinear incentives it creates. These nonlinear budget sets should

                                                19
induce bunching of firms at rate kinks. Consistent with this logic, we find sharp bunching at
depreciation kink points. This evidence supports our claim that temporary bonus depreciation
incentives were also salient.
   We study a component of the depreciation schedule, Section 179, which applies mainly to
smaller firms. Under Section 179, taxpayers may elect to expense qualifying investment up to
a specified limit. With the exception of used equipment, all investment eligible for Section 179
expensing is eligible for bonus depreciation. Focusing on Section 179 thus serves as an out of
sample test of policy salience that remains closely linked to the bonus incentives at the core of
the paper.
   Each tax year, there is a maximum deduction and a threshold over which Section 179 ex-
pensing is phased out dollar for dollar. The kink and phase-out regions have increased incre-
mentally since 1993. When the tax schedule contains kinks and the underlying distribution of
types is relatively smooth, the empirical distribution should display excess mass at these kinks
(Hausman, 1981; Saez, 2010). Figure 2 shows how dramatic the bunching behavior of eligible
investment is in our setting. These figures plot frequencies of observations in our dataset for
eligible investment grouped in $250 bins. Each plot represents a year or group of years with
the same maximum deduction, demarcated by a vertical line. The bunching within $250 of the
kink tracks the policy shifts in the schedule exactly and reflects a density five to fifteen times
larger than the counterfactual distribution nearby.
   In general, evidence of bunching at kink points reflects a mix of reporting and real responses
(Saez, 2010). The bunching evidence is informative in either case because these are both
behavioral responses, which show whether firms understand and respond to the schedule. In
the next section, we study the importance of immediacy by comparing bunching activity across
different groups of firms, who benefit from bunching at different points in time. This test does
not depend on whether the response is real or reported.
   The bonus depreciation design is less vulnerable to misreporting. In that design, we can
confirm the response by looking at other outcomes. In addition, the difference-in-differences
estimator is much less sensitive to misreporting by a small fraction of total investment. More-
over, the sample contains many firms who use external auditors, for whom misreporting invest-
ment entails substantial risk and little benefit. Last, our conversations with tax preparers and
corporate tax officers suggest that misreporting investment is an inferior way to avoid taxes.
This is because investment purchases are typically easily verifiable, require receipts when au-
dited, and usually reduce current taxable income by just a fraction of each dollar claimed as
spent. In the case of investment expenses depreciated over multiple years, the audit risk of
misreporting is also extended over the entire depreciation schedule.

     Notes: These figures illustrate the salience of nonlinearities in the depreciation schedule. They show sharp bunching of Section 179 eligible investment
     around the depreciation schedule kink from 1993 through 2009. Each plot is a histogram of eligible investment in our sample in the region of the maximum
     deduction for a year or group of years. Each dot represents the number of firms in a $250 bin. The vertical lines correspond to the kink point for that year
     or group of years.
3.6       Substitution Margins and External Finance
We ask whether increased investment involves substitution away from payroll or equipment
rentals, how firms finance their additional investment, and whether the increased investment
reflects intertemporal substitution or new investment. Understanding substitution margins is
critical for assessing the macroeconomic impact of these policies and provides further indica-
tion of whether the observed response is real. Studying external finance responses helps us
understand how firms paid for new investments.
       Table 5 presents estimates of the intratemporal and intertemporal substitution margins,
following the baseline specification in equation 3 with a different left hand side variable. Ap-
pendix Table B.5 presents robustness checks using the additional specifications from Table 3.
For rents, payroll, and debt, we focus on flows (namely, differences in logs) as outcomes that
match investment most closely.23 For payouts, we study an indicator for whether dividends are
non-zero.

where Yi t equals the difference in the logarithm of the dependent variable in columns (1) through (3). In column
(4), the dependent variable is an indicator for positive dividend payments. zN ,t is the present value of a dollar
of eligible investment computed at the four-digit NAICS industry level, taking into account periods of bonus
depreciation. Column (5) includes contemporaneous and twice lagged zN ,t . All regressions include firm and year
fixed effects. Standard errors clustered at the firm level are in parentheses.



       The first column of Table 5 shows that growth in rental payments did not slow due to
bonus, but rather increased somewhat. Thus we do not find evidence of substitution away
from equipment leasing. The second column of Table 5 reports the effect of bonus on growth
  23
    In their tax returns, firms separately report rental payments for computing net income. Unfortunately, this
item does not permit decomposition into equipment and structures leasing.

in non-officer payrolls. Again, we find no evidence of substitution, but rather coincident growth
of payroll. Finding limited substitution in both leasing and employment makes it more likely
that bonus incentives caused more output.
       While increased depreciation deductions do allow firms to reduce their tax bills and keep
more cash inside the firm, they must still raise adequate financing to make the purchases in
the first place. This point is especially critical if firms thought to be in tight financial positions
respond more. Here, we test whether bonus incentives affect net issuance of debt and payout
policy. Columns (3) and (4) of Table 5 provide some insight. Increased equipment investment
appears to coincide with significantly expanded borrowing and reduced payouts.
       We assess the extent of intertemporal substitution using a model that includes both contem-
poraneous z and lagged z. Our data often do not include the fiscal year month, so it is possible
that we are marking some years as t when they should be t − 1 or t + 1. For most of our tests,
this issue introduces an attenuation but no systematic bias. However, when testing for in-
tertemporal substitution, we want to be sure that lagged z measures past policy changes. Thus
column (5) of Table 5 includes regressions with twice-lagged z added to the baseline bonus
model. The coefficient on lagged z is negative but not distinguishable from zero and including
lagged z does not alter the coefficient on contemporaneous z. This implies limited intertempo-
ral shifting of investment, consistent with the aggregate findings in House and Shapiro (2008)
and in contrast to Mian and Sufi’s (2012) finding that auto purchases stimulated by the CARS
program quickly reversed.


4        Heterogeneous Responses to Tax Incentives

4.1       Heterogeneous Responses by Size and Liquidity
We begin our exploration of heterogeneous effects by dividing the sample along several markers
of ex ante financial constraints used elsewhere in the literature. Even for private unlisted firms,
we can still measure size, payout frequency, and a proxy for balance sheet strength. Table 6
presents a statistical test of the difference in elasticities across these three characteristics. For
the sales regressions, we split the sample into deciles based on average sales and compare
the bottom three to the top three deciles. The average semi-elasticity for small firms is twice
that for large firms and statistically significantly different with a p-value of 0.03.24 When we
measure size with total assets or payroll, the results are unchanged.
       The second two columns of Table 6 present separate estimates for firms who paid a dividend
in any of the three years prior to the first round of bonus depreciation.25 The non-paying firms
  24
       Cross-equation tests are based on seemingly unrelated regressions with firm-level clustering.
  25
       We only use the first round of bonus for the dividend split. The dividend tax cut of 2003, which had a strong



                                                         23
are significantly more responsive. Our third sample split is based on whether firms enter the
bonus period with relatively low levels of liquid assets. We run a regression of liquid assets on
a ten-piece linear spline in total assets plus fixed effects for four-digit industry, time, and cor-
porate form. We sort firm-year observations based on the residuals from this regression lagged
by one year. Note that this sort is approximately uncorrelated with firm size by construction.
The last two columns of Table 6 report separate estimates for the top and bottom three deciles
of residual liquidity. The results using this marker of liquidity parallel those in the size and
dividend tests, with the low liquidity firms yielding an estimate of 7.2 as compared to 2.8 for
the high liquidity firms.
    Appendix Table B.6 presents means of various firm-level characteristics for each size decile.
The relationship between firm size and dividend activity is non-monotonic, with both small
and large firms exhibiting higher payout rates than firms in the middle of the distribution.
Liquidity levels are somewhat lower for the smallest firms but are constant across the rest of
the firm size distribution. Thus firm size is not a sufficient proxy for the other characteristics
in accounting for the heterogeneity results.

Notes: This table estimates regressions from the baseline intensive margin specification presented in Table 3. We
split the sample based on pre-policy markers of financial constraints. For the size splits, we divide the sample into
deciles based on the mean value of sales, with the mean taken over years 1998 through 2000. Small firms fall
into the bottom three deciles and big firms fall into the top three deciles. For the dividend payer split, we divide
the sample based on whether the firm paid a dividend in any of the three years from 1998 through 2000. The
dividend split only includes C corporations. The lagged cash split is based on lagged residuals from a regression
of liquid assets on a ten piece spline in total assets and fixed effects for four-digit industry, year and corporate
form. The comparison is between the top three and bottom three deciles of these lagged residuals. All regressions
include firm and year fixed effects. Standard errors clustered at the firm level are in parentheses.

4.2       Heterogeneous Responses by Tax Position
For firms with positive taxable income before depreciation, expanding investment reduces this
year’s tax bill and returns extra cash to the firm today. Firms without this immediate incentive
can still carry forward the deductions incurred but must wait to receive the tax benefits.26 We
present evidence that, for both Section 179 and bonus depreciation, this latter incentive is
weak, and differences in growth opportunities cannot explain this fact.
       The Section 179 bunching environment offers an ideal setting for documenting the im-
mediacy of investment responses to depreciation incentives. The simple idea is to separate
firms based on whether their investment decisions will offset current year taxable income, or
whether deductions will have to be carried forward to future years. We choose net income
before depreciation expense as our sorting variable. Firms for which this variable is positive
have an immediate incentive to invest and reduce their current tax bill. If firms for which this
variable is negative show an attenuated investment response and these groups are sufficiently
similar, we can infer that the immediate benefit accounts for this difference.
       The panels of Figure 3 starkly confirm this intuition. In Panel (a), we pool all years in the
sample, recenter eligible investment around the year’s respective kink, and split the sample
according to a firm’s taxable status. Firms in the left graph have positive net income before
depreciation and firms in the right graph have negative net income before depreciation. For
firms below the kink on the left, a dollar of Section 179 spending reduces taxable income by
a dollar in the current year. Retiming investment from the beginning of next fiscal year to the
end of the current fiscal year can have a large and immediate effect on the firm’s tax liability.
For firms below the kink on the right, the incentive is weaker because the deduction only adds
to current year losses, deferring recognition of this deduction until future profitable years. As
the figure demonstrates, firms with the immediate incentive to bunch do so dramatically, while
firms with the weaker, forward-looking incentive do not bunch at all.
       One objection to the taxable versus nontaxable split is that nontaxable firms have poor
growth opportunities and so are not comparable to taxable firms. We address this objection
in two ways. First, we restrict the sample to firms very near the zero net income before de-
preciation threshold to see whether the difference persists when we exclude firms with large
losses. Panel (a) of Appendix Figure B.1 plots bunch ratios for taxable and nontaxable firms,
estimated within a narrow bandwidth of the tax status threshold. The difference in bunching
appears almost immediately away from zero, with the confidence bands separating after we
include firms within $50 thousand dollars of the threshold. For loss firms, the observed pattern
  26
    In the code, current loss firms have the option to “carry back” losses against past taxable income. The IRS
then credits the firm with a tax refund. Our logic assumes that firms have limited loss carryback opportunities
because, in the data, we find low take-up rates of carrybacks. Furthermore, carrybacks create a bias against our
finding a difference between taxable and nontaxable firms, because carrybacks create immediate incentives for
the nontaxable group.

Notes: These figures illustrate how bunching behavior responds to tax incentives. Firms bunch less when eligible
investment provides less cash back now. Panel (a) splits the sample based on whether firm net income before
depreciation is greater than or less than zero. Firms with net income before depreciation less than zero can carry
back or forward deductions from eligible investment but have no more current taxable income to shield. Panel (b)
groups firms with current year taxable income based on the size of their prior loss carryforward stocks. The x-axis
measures increasing loss carryforward stocks relative to current year income. The y-axis measures the excess
mass at the kink point for that group. Firms with more alternative tax shields find investment a less useful tax
shield and therefore bunch less. Excess mass ratios are computed using the algorithm and code in Chetty et al.
(2011).



cannot be distinguished from a smooth distribution, even for firms very close to positive tax
position. The bunching difference for nontaxable firms is not driven by firms making very large
losses.
        Table 7 replicates the tax status split idea in the context of bonus depreciation. We modify
the intensive margin model from Table 3 by interacting all variables with a taxable indicator
based on whether net income before depreciation is positive or negative. According to these
regressions and consistent with the bunching results, the positive effect of bonus depreciation
on investment is concentrated exclusively among taxable firms. The semi-elasticity is statisti-
cally indistinguishable from zero for nontaxable firms, while it is 3.8 for taxable firms. In Panel
(b) of Appendix Figure B.1, we repeat the narrow bandwidth test for bonus depreciation. The
figure plots the coefficients on the interaction of taxable and nontaxable status with the policy
variable. The difference in coefficients in Table 7 emerges within $50 thousand of the tax sta-
tus threshold, and these coefficients are statistically distinguishable within $100 thousand of
the threshold. Here as well, the results are not driven by differences for firms far from positive
tax positions.
        To further address the concern about nontaxable firms, Panel (b) of Figure 3 uses differences
within the group of taxable firms. This plot shows again that bunching is due to tax planning

Notes: This table estimates regressions from each intensive margin in columns (1) through (6) specification
presented in Table 3. For each firm year, we generate an indicator based on whether a firm is in taxable position
prior to depreciation expense. We fully interact this indicator with all controls and the time effects. Column
(7) splits taxable firms into three groups based on the size of their lagged loss carryforward stocks relative to
net income before depreciation. We interact these group indicators with zN ,t and the time effects. Only firms
with nonzero stocks of lagged loss carryforwards are included. All regressions include firm and year fixed effects.
Standard errors clustered at the firm level are in parentheses.



with regard to the immediate potential benefit. We divide profitable firms by their stock of
loss carryforwards in the previous year. Each dot in this plot represents a bunching histogram
where the y-axis measures the degree of bunching using the excess mass estimator in Chetty
et al. (2011). The groups are sorted according to the ratio of lagged loss carryforward stock to
current year net income before depreciation, which proxies for the availability of alternative
tax shields. The scatter clearly indicates a negative relationship between the presence of this
alternative tax shield and the extent of eligible investment manipulation.
    We confirm this pattern in the bonus setting. Column (7) of Table 7 focuses on the group
of taxable firms with non-zero stocks of lagged loss carryforwards. We split this group into
three subgroups based on the size of their carryforward stock. Firms with large stocks of loss
carryforwards display a semi-elasticity with respect to z of 2 compared to a semi-elasticity of
5.7 for firms with low loss carryforward stocks.

4.3    Aggregate Elasticity Accounting for Heterogeneous Responses
Investment is concentrated among the largest firms in the firm size distribution, which exhibit
lower elasticities than the average firm in our sample. Thus to produce an aggregate elasticity,
we must account for heterogeneous responses by firm size and extrapolate our estimates to the
population of firms beyond the scope of our sample. Appendix C.1 describes this calculation
in further detail.
   We reestimate the baseline model separately for each of twenty size groups and compute
the weighted average of the elasticities, where a group’s respective investment share is taken
to be its weight. In our sample, the average share of aggregate eligible investment for the top
5 percent of firms is 62%, accounting for sampling weights. The weighted average elasticity is
2.89 or 22% lower than the equal-weighted elasticity of 3.69. The elasticity for the top group
is 2.27. Thus accounting for the bottom 95 percent of firms materially affects our aggregate
estimate, which is 27% higher than the elasticity for the top group. Using the weighted average
elasticity, the implied effect of the first round of bonus is 13.8% and of the second round is
22.7%.
   Our aggregate eligible investment amounts do not reflect all eligible investment in the
economy. We use data from Kitchen and Knittel (2011) on aggregate investment by corpo-
rate form to extrapolate our estimates to investment done outside our sample. First, we focus
on a subsample of all corporations—namely C and S corporations large enough to clear the
size threshold based on average eligible investment. Second, a significant amount of eligible
investment is undertaken outside the corporate sector, either in partnerships or in sole propri-
etorships operated by individuals.
   On average, our sample represents 44% of all eligible investment during the policy window.
Of the remainder, 22% takes place in corporations outside our sample, 20% takes place in
partnerships, and 13% takes place within the sole proprietorship sector. We divide investment
within these other sectors based on whether that investment is likely subject to bonus or instead
would qualify for Section 179 expensing in most years. We also incorporate relative differences
in take-up of the provision across sectors, which may reflect differences in tax loss position or
policy awareness. In cases where our sample gives limited guidance on what elasticity to use,
we apply a conservative estimate, which tends to lower the aggregate estimate. Taking these
considerations into account, we arrive at an estimated total effect of 10.4% for the first round of
bonus and of 16.9% for the second round. These correspond to average annual dollar amounts
of $73.6B and $135B per year in the first and second rounds, respectively.
   We also consider an alternative approach to estimate an aggregate response, which provides
a lower bound response by exploiting only the cross-sectional variation induced by the policy.
Appendix C.2 describes this calculation in further detail. The idea is to use the group that
receives the smallest shock due to bonus as a counterfactual, and then compute the policy

                                                28
effect for other groups relative to this one. By construction any time series effect of the policy
shown by the bottom group is set to zero and removed from the effect computed for other
groups. This provides a lower bound because the bottom group also benefits from the policy
and thus would exhibit a positive response (as long as general equilibrium price effects are not
too strong to undo the subsidy).
    We divide industries into twenty equal-sized bins based on the pre-policy weighted present
value of depreciation deductions, zN , for that industry. We use the investment weighted-
average elasticity of 2.89 to translate the changes in z to changes in investment for each group.
We aggregate these changes in investment and compute the average change for each policy pe-
riod. The results imply an average annual response for the full population of firms relative to
the lowest exposure group of $30.4B and $55.9B in the first and second bonus rounds, respec-
tively. As a percent of aggregate investment, the respective lower bounds for each period are
3.9% and 6.0%.


5     Discussion of Results

5.1    Relation to Past Work
Appendix Table B.8 collects from other studies estimates that we can compare to our tax term
model. Like our study, each one uses tax reforms crossed with industry characteristics to es-
timate the effect of taxes on investment. Panel (a) of Figure 4 plots the estimates from these
studies with confidence bands, highlights the consensus range, and compares them to our es-
timate. The average tax term elasticity across these studies is -0.69, which falls within Hassett
and Hubbard (2002)’s consensus range of -0.5 to -1, but is less than half our estimate of -1.60.
    There are three reasons why our estimates likely differ from these previous studies. First,
our sample includes more small and medium-sized firms than have been previously available.
Panel (b) of Figure 4 plots elasticities and confidence bands from regressions run for each of
ten deciles based on average sales. These estimates help us reconcile our findings with past
studies. The largest firms show tax term elasticities in line with the findings surveyed in Hassett
and Hubbard (2002), while smaller firms, for whom data were previously unavailable, yield
estimates outside the consensus range.
    Appendix Table B.2 confirms this heterogeneity by firm size within the Compustat sample.
The average Compustat firm falls within the tenth decile of our sample in terms of size, but
there are many small Compustat firms who also show large responses to bonus depreciation. An
investment-weighted tax term elasticity within our sample falls within the confidence intervals
of Desai and Goolsbee (2004) and Edgerton (2010), but remains on the high end of estimates.
    A second reason why our estimates may differ is attenuation bias due to measurement error,

which has often plagued studies of taxes and investment (see, e.g., Goolsbee (2000)) and is
a key concern motivating Cummins, Hassett and Hubbard’s (1994) focus on tax reforms. Like
past studies, we proxy for the firm-level benefit of bonus depreciation with an industry measure
of policy benefits. Unlike these studies, our measure derives directly from tax data, reducing
measurement error.
   Measurement error is a particular concern in studying the role of tax status. Cummins,
Hassett and Hubbard (1995) and Edgerton (2010) note that tax losses will reduce the incentive
of firms to respond to tax changes. The former study uses a sample of sixty loss firms to
conclude that losses reduce the effect of tax breaks on investment. The latter maps financial
accounting data to a tax account and finds mixed evidence that losses matter. Recent work
documents large differences between “book” and tax accounts, which introduces the risk of
measurement error into such a mapping (Mills, Newberry and Trautman, 2002). With our
data, we can precisely measure whether a firm’s current tax position means that the next dollar
of investment affects this year’s tax bill. Our sample of loss firms includes almost two hundred
thousand loss year observations.
   Finally, a third difference between our study and most past work is our focus on depreciation
incentives. Earlier studies pool the effects of different tax reforms, which include depreciation
changes, tax rate changes, and rule changes regarding corporate form. If some of these policies
have weaker effects on investment behavior, perhaps because they do not target investment
directly or immediately, then past estimates will be attenuated.
   In focusing only on this policy, the study most closely related to ours is House and Shapiro
(2008), who study the first episode of bonus depreciation using aggregate investment data at a
quarterly frequency. Their design compares residuals from a prediction model for investment in
short duration and long duration categories, thus relying on a similar source of cross-sectional
variation to identify the effect of the policy.
   Appendix Table B.9 reproduces their estimate and presents parallel estimates applying their
specification and sample time frame to the main bonus analysis sample. We first replicate
their main result and then reestimate their model using annualized data. Our baseline, equal-
weighted estimates are approximately twice the size of theirs. When we restrict attention to
the largest decile of firms based on average sales, who account for nearly 70% of aggregate
investment within our sample, the estimates are in line with House and Shapiro (2008). Thus
the estimated effect of bonus for our sample is largely consistent with their findings.
   House and Shapiro (2008) also show that for the first round of bonus and in contrast to
the earlier episodes of the investment tax credit, equipment prices did not increase. They
conclude that the small price effects imply an important role for internal adjustment costs in
limiting investment demand; our heterogeneity results lend further support to this conclusion,
in which either financial frictions or internal fixed costs fill this role. Such frictions may also


                                                  31
help explain why the second round of bonus influenced investment despite historically low
nominal interest rates.
       With respect to other policy reforms in the US, Goolsbee (1998) shows that changes in the
investment tax credit, which were more permanent and often did not occur during recessions,
coincide with price increases that mute quantity responses, especially in less competitive in-
dustries. Yagan (2015) shows that investment did not respond to the dividend tax cut in 2003,
in a research design that carefully compares C-corporations to S-corporations that were un-
affected by the dividend tax. In the case of depreciation incentives, both House and Shapiro
(2008) and our estimates provide strong evidence of an investment response.27 Confirming
and reconciling the difference in power between various tax instruments is an important goal
for future research.


5.2       Implications for Alternative Theories of Investment
The population of firms exhibits considerable heterogeneity in response to bonus depreciation.
The split sample analyses provide additional empirical moments that point toward a set of
models most likely to fit the data. These models depart from a simple investment model by
incorporating financial frictions or non-convex adjustment costs.
       Costly external finance raises the total discount rate firms apply to evaluate projects. Be-
cause bonus depreciation is more valuable when firms use higher discount rates, financial
frictions can amplify the effect of the policy on investment. Consistent with this story, firms
more likely to depend on costly external finance—small firms, non-dividend payers, and firms
with low levels of cash—respond more strongly to bonus. However, the constraint markers
used to divide firms are imperfect: they do not directly measure the costs of external finance
and may instead reflect other factors that can amplify the response for certain firms.28
       For example, idiosyncratic failure risk might generate higher discount rates for small firms
even in the absence of costly finance. Appendix Table B.6 shows that failure rates are indeed
higher for the smallest decile of firms, though the failure rate-size slope is flat for the remaining
ninety percent of firms. Furthermore, split sample tests based on ex post failure or a predictive
model of failure reveal similar or lower elasticities for firms with higher expected failure risk.
While we cannot measure failure expectations directly, these facts suggest high discount rates
driven by fear of failure do not explain our results.
  27
     In Cummins, Hassett and Hubbard’s (1996) study of tax reforms in twelve other countries, the three reforms
with the largest estimates all featured changes in depreciation rules or investment incentives. These countries
were Spain, Norway, and Belgium. Standard errors for these reforms are too large to draw a definitive conclusion
about the relative importance of investment incentives.
  28
     See Fazzari, Hubbard and Petersen (1988) for an early application of this methodology and Almeida, Campello
and Weisbach (2004), and Chaney, Sraer and Thesmar (2012) for recent examples. Criticism of split sample
markers dates back to Poterba’s comments in Fazzari, Hubbard and Petersen (1988).



                                                      32
   An alternative model is managerial myopia or short termism, which raises effective discount
rates by sharply discounting the future relative to the present. Consistent with this story, firms
only respond to investment incentives when the policy immediately generates after-tax cash
flows. The finding for nontaxable firms contradicts a simple model of costly external finance,
because firms neglect how the policy affects borrowing in the future. At the same time, firms
cannot be too myopic because the investment decision itself only pays off in the future. Thus for
myopia to be the explanation, managers must use different accounts to think about investment
decisions and the tax implications, or they must balance short-termist concerns about cash
flows with long-termist concerns about having sufficient capital in the future.
   It is possible that managers view investment as a tax shield whose value falls discontinu-
ously when the firm is no longer in taxable position, and that they perceive the slight increase in
future per-period taxes as second order. This view is consistent with how the policies are often
marketed by equipment producers. For example, http://www.section179.org provides
information on equipment depreciation policies and a calculator that firms can use to estimate
their tax savings when making eligible purchases. As of the time of this writing, these sav-
ings were calculated relative to a zero deduction benchmark, instead of the MACRS schedule,
which is the appropriate counterfactual. The web site is operated by an equipment financing
company.
   As an alternative to financial and managerial frictions, Winberry (2015) presents a model
of fixed costs that can generate large average responses of investment to bonus depreciation.
In that model, when the policy induces a firm across its adjustment threshold, investment in-
creases sharply because the firm does not plan to adjust every year. The observed change in
investment for adjusting firms is thus larger than in a model with convex adjustment costs.
Winberry (2015) focuses primarily on the average response rather than drivers of heteroge-
neous effects, but we can ask whether firms likely to be induced across an adjustment threshold
exhibit stronger effects.
   Appendix Table B.7 presents a series of split sample tests designed to explore this idea. We
cannot observe a firm’s investment plans and adjustment threshold, so develop a set of proxies
motivated by Winberry’s (2015) model, acknowledging that these markers are imperfect. Be-
cause they are more likely to adjust in the absence of the policy, firms with high levels of sales
growth, young firms, and firms with a high expected probability of an investment spike or a
low expected probability of inaction should be less responsive to bonus.
   The results indeed offer some support for the fixed cost interpretation. High sales growth
and high spike firms do exhibit lower sensitivities, and firms with a high likelihood of inaction
appear more responsive than firms with a low likelihood of inaction. However, young firms
do not appear less responsive than older firms. Appendix Table B.6 presents means of these
adjustment markers for each size decile. Growth rates are non-monotonic in firm size, with


                                                33
the largest and smallest firms growing faster than firms in the middle. The smallest firms do
not exhibit higher spike rates but are considerably more likely to be inactive. The average age
for firms in the bottom decile is 19.5. While these firms are younger than their larger coun-
terparts, they are not especially young. In summary, there does not appear to be a single firm
characteristic—whether based on markers of financial frictions or predictors of adjustment—
that can account for the full set of results.


6    Conclusion
This paper combines methods from public and applied economics with new comprehensive
micro data to address a first order macroeconomic question: what is the effect of taxes on
investment and how does it differ across firms?
    We find that firms respond strongly to depreciation incentives. Ignoring small firms leads to
aggregate estimates considerably below estimates that properly account for the heterogeneity
in the population of firms. Because small firms are thought to face larger financial frictions,
our heterogeneity results—that the investment response is larger for small, cash-poor firms, but
only when the benefit is immediate—suggest financial frictions may be a natural explanation
for the observed facts. However, since fixed costs to capital stock adjustment may also vary
across firms—and firms more likely to be induced across an adjustment threshold also exhibit
larger elasticities—more work is needed to differentiate the key mechanisms.
    Another question for future research concerns the nature of tax planning. How do tax
preparers and equipment sellers affect the decision to take up these policies? More generally,
do firms focus on minimizing current taxes at the possible expense of future payoffs? The
answer to these questions might shed light on how agency problems interact with public policy
and on how firms learn optimal management practices.
    The results imply that stimulus policies which target investment directly and yield imme-
diate payoffs are most likely to influence investment activity. Policies that target financial
constraints might have a similar effect if conditional on the investment decision. In an approx-
imate sense, bonus depreciation operates like a loan from the government, with a spread equal
to the difference between the firm’s discount rate and the federal rate.
    While we show a strong immediate investment response, the net effect of this stimulus on
the capital stock is less certain. If all of the response comes in the form of substitution from
the near future, then the value of the policy in supporting productivity or long-term capital
investment will be limited. In comparison to studies of consumer durable goods, we find less
evidence of intertemporal shifting, but more work on this question is needed. Data from the
period following the recent stimulus, once available, will be very useful.

A    Legislative Background
This appendix describes legislation affecting the bonus and Section 179 depreciation provisions
studied in this paper.


Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981
The act set the Section 179 allowance at $5,000 and established a timetable for gradually
increasing the allowance to $10,000 by 1986. A business taxpayer could claim the investment
tax credit only for the portion of an eligible asset’s cost that was not expensed.

Depreciation Policies Affected – Section 179

Date Signed – August 13, 1981

Bill Number – H.R. 4242


Deficit Reduction Act of 1984
The act postponed from 1986 to 1990 the scheduled increase in the Section 179 allowance to
$10,000. Use of the allowance rose markedly following the repeal of the investment tax credit
by the Tax Reform Act of 1986.

Depreciation Policies Affected – Section 179

Date Signed – July 18, 1984

Bill Number – H.R. 4170


Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993
The act increased the Section 179 allowance from $10,000 to $17,500, as of January 1, 1993.

Depreciation Policies Affected – Section 179

Date Introduced – May 25, 1993

Date of First Passage Vote – May 27, 1993

Date Signed – August 10, 1993

Bill Number – H.R. 2264




                                              38
Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996
The act increased the Section 179 allowance and established scheduled annual (with one
exception) increases over six years. Specifically, the act raised the maximum allowance to
$18,000 in 1997, $18,500 in 1998, $19,000 in 1999, $20,000 in 2000, $24,000 in 2001 and
2002, and $25,000 in 2003 and thereafter.

Depreciation Policies Affected – Section 179

Date Introduced – May 14, 1996

Date of First Passage Vote – May 22, 1996

Date Signed – August 20, 1996

Bill Number – H.R. 3448


Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002
The act created the first bonus depreciation allowance, equal to 30 percent of the adjusted basis
of new qualified property acquired after September 11, 2001, and placed in service no later
than December 31, 2004. A one-year extension of the placed-in-service deadline was available
for certain property with a MACRS recovery period of 10 or more years and for transportation
equipment.

Depreciation Policies Affected – Bonus Depreciation

Date Introduced – October 11, 2001

Date of First Passage Vote – October 24, 2001

Date Signed – March 9, 2002

Bill Number – H.R. 3090


Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003
The act (JGTRRA) raised the bonus allowance to 50 percent for qualified property acquired
after May 5, 2003, and placed in service before January 1, 2005. The act raised the Section
179 allowance to $100,000 (as of May 6, 2003), set it to stay at that amount in 2004 and 2005,
and then reset in 2006 and beyond at its level before JGTRRA ($25,000). JGTRRA also raised
the phase out threshold to $400,000 from May 2003 to the end of 2005, indexed the regular
allowance and the threshold for inflation in 2004 and 2005, and added off-the-shelf software
for business use to the list of depreciable assets eligible for expensing in the same period.
    The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 extended the Section 179 changes made by JGTRRA
through the end of 2007. The Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005 extended
the changes in the allowance under JGTRRA through 2009.

Notes: These figures replicate the taxable position splits in the bunch and bonus settings, while restricting the
sample to within a narrow bandwidth of the tax status threshold. Panel (a) replicates the analysis in panel (a) of
Figure 3, which compares bunching behavior for taxable and nontaxable firms. Panel (b) replicates the regression
in column (1) of Table 7, which estimates separate coefficients with respect to bonus incentives for taxable and
nontaxable firms.

Notes to Table B.1: This exhibit provides detailed investment statistics to enable comparison to past work. The
investment rate is bonus eligible investment divided by lagged depreciable assets. All statistics are weighted by
sampling weights from SOI. The unbalanced sample includes all firms used in the bonus analysis. The balanced
sample includes only those firms in the sample for the entire sample frame. Figure (a) plots investment rate
densities with intervals labeled by right end points. Table (b) follows Table 1 of Cooper and Haltiwanger (2006).
Inaction is defined by investment below 1%. Spikes are defined by investment above 20%. Aggregate investment
is total eligible investment divided by total lagged capital. The spike share of aggregate investment is total eligible
investment due to spikes divided by total eligible investment. Table (c) presents these statistics over time for the
unbalanced panel. σ is the standard deviation of a statistic over time. βAgg is the correlation of a statistic with
the aggregate investment rate. Table (d) presents investment rate statistics for the unbalanced panel with firms
sorted by firm characteristics. Standard deviations, skewness, and kurtosis are in parentheses for investment
rates. Standard deviations are in parentheses for all other statistics.

Notes: This table estimates regressions for firms in Compustat from the baseline intensive margin specification
presented in Table 3, where I i t is now capital expenditures and zN ,t remains the present value of a dollar of eligible
investment computed at the four-digit NAICS industry level, taking into account periods of bonus depreciation.
Column (1) presents the baseline specification for the time period considered in our main analysis. Column (2)
restricts the sample to firms with less than $164M in average sales, defined using mean sales taken over the years
1998 through 2000 and 2005 through 2007. This corresponds to the firms in the 1st through 9th deciles of the
bonus analysis sample. Column (3) restricts to firms with average sales above $164M, corresponding to the tenth
decile in the bonus analysis sample. Column (4) focuses on the later bonus period and column (5) focuses on the
earlier period, using a ten-year window that allows us to compare estimates to placebos from past recessions. All
regressions include firm and year fixed effects. Standard errors clustered at the firm level are in parentheses.

Notes: This table estimates regressions from the Compustat sample using the specification presented in Table B.2.
Each column corresponds to a placebo test where we have centered the window around the start of a previous
recession and applied the bonus schedule from the first round of bonus to the placebo time period. Column (1)
covers the recession beginning in 1990, column (2) the “double-dip” recession beginning in 1980, column (3)
the recession in 1973, column (4) the recession in 1969, and column (5) the recession in 1960. The recession
in 1973 coincided with a reinstatement of the investment tax credit and a shortening of depreciation allowances.
All regressions include firm and year fixed effects. Standard errors clustered at the firm level are in parentheses.

Notes: This table estimates regressions from the intensive margin specification presented in Table 3. Instead of
measuring policy exposure through industry level zN ,t , we measure zi,t at the firm level using all observations
for each firm to measure the share of investment in each class life. Column (7) adds two-digit NAICS-by-year
fixed effects to the intensive margin specification and column (8) adds four-digit NAICS-by-year fixed effects.
All regressions include firm and year fixed effects. Standard errors clustered at the firm level are in parentheses
(industry level for the extensive margin models).

Notes: This table estimates regressions of the form in Table 5 using the additional specifications from Table 3.
Column (1) reproduces the results from the text using the baseline specification. Column (2) augments the
baseline specification with current period cash flow scaled by lagged capital. Column (3) focuses on the early
bonus period and column (4) focuses on the later period. Column (5) controls for four-digit industry average Q
for public companies and quartics in assets, sales, profit margin, and firm age. Column (6) includes quadratic
time trends interacted with two-digit NAICS industry dummies. For the regressions using lagged zN ,t−2 , we do
not have data from the policy’s post period for the later round of bonus, so we exclude this specification. All
regressions include firm and year fixed effects. Standard errors clustered at the firm level are in parentheses.

     Notes: This table presents means of firm characteristics with firms grouped and ordered by sales bin. Ever Pay is an indicator for whether the firm paid a
     dividend in any of the three years prior to the first round of bonus depreciation. Lagged Cash is the decile for the residuals from regression of liquid assets
     on firm characteristics, as described in the text; lower deciles have less liquidity. Ever Fail is an indicator for whether the firm fails at some point during the
     sample period; failure is defined as disappearance of a corporate EIN from the population of tax filings, which accounts for switches in corporate form, or
     the filing of an inactive return. Taxable is an indicator for whether a firm is in taxable position prior to depreciation expense. Sales Growth is the average
     log difference in sales over as many of the previous three years as are available. Age is the number of years since the firm’s date of incorporation. Spike is
     an indicator defined by an investment rate above 20%. Inactive is an indicator defined by an investment rate below 1%.

Notes: This table estimates regressions from the baseline intensive margin specification presented in Table 3.
We split the sample based on predictors of adjustment. For the sales growth split, we divide the sample into
deciles based on the average log difference in sales over years 1998 through 2000 and 2005 through 2007. Low
growth firms fall into the bottom three deciles and high growth firms fall into the top three deciles. For the age
split, we divide firms into the top and bottom three deciles based on age over the years 1998 through 2000 and
2005 through 2007, where age is the number of years since the firm’s date of incorporation. The P(Spike) and
P(Inactive) splits are based on predictive models for adjustment, either a spike defined as an investment rate
above 20%, or inaction defined as an investment rate below 1%. The predictions are predicted values based on
regressions of an indicator of adjustment on indicators for size group decile, lagged sales growth, lagged dividend
payer, indicators for lagged cash decile, and four-digit industry fixed effects. Lagged cash decile is the residual
measure of liquidity used in Table 6, which is based on lagged residuals from a regression of liquid assets on a ten
piece spline in total assets and fixed effects for four-digit industry, year, and corporate form. The comparison is
between the top three and bottom three deciles of these adjustment predictors. All regressions include firm and
year fixed effects. Standard errors clustered at the firm level are in parentheses.

Notes: This table estimates regressions using the bonus analysis sample and the specification from House and
Shapiro (2008, hereafter HS) and compares these to the estimates from HS’s sample. Column (1) presents the
original OLS estimate from Table 4, Panel A, Row 1 in HS. Column (2) presents an estimate from an annualized
panel derived from HS’s original data. Column (3) presents an estimate using the bonus analysis sample and
the original difference-in-differences design, where we have applied equation (21) in HS to transform zN ,t to
estimate ξ (see HS p. 751). Column (4) repeats this exercise with asset class z T s taken from HS. Column (5)
repeats the specification in column (3) after restricting the sample to the largest decile of firms based on sales.
These regressions focus on the 1993-2006 period studied in HS. Regressions (3) through (5) include firm and
year fixed effects. Standard errors for regressions (3) through (5) clustered at the firm level are in parentheses.

C     Aggregate Effects of Bonus Depreciation
C.1     Accounting for Heterogeneity in Size and Corporate Form
In this section, we describe our approach for producing an aggregate estimate of the effect of
bonus depreciation on investment, which accounts for heterogeneous responses by firm size
and extrapolates our estimates to the population of firms beyond the scope of our sample. We
develop separate estimates for the first and second rounds of bonus (BI and BII, respectively),
which differed in average generosity. We proceed in three steps.
    1. Compute an investment-weighted elasticity within our sample.
       Average firm-level zN ,t prior to 2001 is 0.881. The average from 2001 through 2004 is
       0.929. The average between 2005 and 2007 is 0.882 and the average from 2008 through
       2010 is 0.960. Thus the ∆z is 0.048 on average for BI and 0.078 on average for BII.
       The coefficient on zN ,t in Table 3 is 3.69. The equal-weighted average effect is thus
       3.69 × ∆z = .177, or 17.7%, in BI and 28.8% in BII.
       Investment is concentrated among the largest firms in the firm size distribution, which
       exhibit lower elasticities than the average firm in our sample. Thus an aggregate effect
       must appropriately account for this heterogeneity. Our approach is to divide the sample
       into twenty bins based on pre-policy average sales and compute the share of aggregate
       investment within the sample accounted for by each bin. We reestimate the baseline
       model separately for each of twenty size groups and compute the weighted average of
       the elasticities, where a group’s respective investment share is taken to be its weight.
       In our sample, the average share of aggregate eligible investment for the top 5 percent
       of firms is 62%, accounting for SOI sampling weights. The weighted average elasticity is
       2.89 or 22% lower than the equal-weighted elasticity. The implied effect of BI is 13.8%
       and of BII is 22.7%.
       The elasticity for the top group is 2.27. Thus accounting for the bottom 95 percent of
       firms materially affects our aggregate estimate, which is 27% higher than the elasticity
       for the top group.

    2. Use the weighted elasticity to generate an aggregate prediction within our sample.
       In terms of aggregate dollars, the average aggregate eligible investment amounts were
       $338B in BI and $384B in BII. We can compute the aggregate increase from the baseline
       model using the average amounts here and the formula IActual = ICounterfactual × eβ∆z , which
       we can rearrange as ∆I = IActual × (1 − e−β∆z ).
       Using the weighted average elasticity of 2.89 yields an aggregate prediction of $43.8B
       on average per year in BI and $77.5B per year in BII.

    3. Use Kitchen and Knittel (2011) data on aggregate investment by corporate form to extrap-
       olate our estimates to investment done outside our sample.
       Our aggregate eligible investment amounts do not reflect all eligible investment in the
       economy. First, we focus on a subsample of all corporations—namely C and S corpo-
       rations large enough to clear the size threshold based on average eligible investment.

                                                 55
Second, a significant amount of eligible investment is undertaken outside the corporate
sector, either in partnerships or in sole proprietorships operated by individuals.
We can extrapolate our estimate to these other corporations and corporate forms to pro-
duce an aggregate estimate across all corporate forms. Since our elasticity is estimated
for a different group, this exercise should be interpreted with caution.
Table C.1 presents aggregate investment statistics for bonus analysis sample and for the
complete sample in our data. We present these data alongside aggregate investment
statistics from Kitchen and Knittel (2011), who combine the corporate sample which is
the source of our data with data for partnerships and sole proprietorships. Their ag-
gregates closely match the NIPA aggregates for equipment and software investment. We
present aggregates for the years of bonus during which our series and their series overlap.
On average, our sample represents 44% of all eligible investment during these years.
Thus we need estimates for the effect of bonus for the remaining 56%. Of this remainder,
22% takes place in corporations outside our sample, 20% takes place in partnerships, and
13% takes place within the sole proprietorship sector.
We divide investment within these other sectors based on whether that investment is
likely subject to bonus or instead would qualify for Section 179 expensing in most years.
Within the population of corporations outside our sample, 69% is in very large regu-
lated investment and insurance companies or real estate investment trusts and 31% is in
small firms mostly covered by Section 179. For partnerships, the statistics from Kitchen
and Knittel (2011) reveal that 89% of investment is bonus eligible. For individuals, this
number is 41%.
To assign elasticities to these other groups, we must make additional assumptions about
their average duration of investment, their taxable positions, and the take-up rate for
bonus.
For other non-bonus sample corporations, we assume the 69% in large companies re-
sponds with the same elasticity as the top 5 percent in our sample (2.27) and the 31%
displays a response of zero. This yields an increase of $12.2B per year in BI and $21.2B
per year in BII.
Partnerships include many finance and professional service firms whose activity is rel-
atively short duration, but they also include many real estate partnerships, which buy
relatively more long duration equipment. Using the Kitchen and Knittel (2011) data, the
composition of eligible and Section 179 investment suggests they are comparable in size
to the C and S corporations in our sample. Thus we assume their elasticity equals the
2.89 sample weighted average.
However, Kitchen and Knittel (2011) document considerably lower take-up rates among
this sector. This may be for reasons associated with losses or because many partnership
owners are tax exempt or foreigners and are therefore less tax-motivated. We use the
relative take-up rate for the partnership sector—equal to 73% of the corporate sector’s
average take-up rate of 56%—from Kitchen and Knittel (2011) to rescale our estimate.
Then for the bonus eligible amount in the partnership sector, we have an increase of
$13.5B in BI and $30.2B in BII, after taking into account the differences in the take-up.

                                         56
      Last for the individuals, we perform a similar exercise for the amount subject to bonus
      and adjust by the relative take-up rate for individuals—equal to 63% of the corporate
      sector’s average take-up rate. This yields an estimate of $4.1B in BI and $6.1B in BII.
      Taking the sum over each component yields a total aggregate response per year of $73.6B
      in BI and $135B in BII. The aggregate average investment amount per year was $781B
      across all sectors in BI and $936B in BII. Thus relative to the counterfactual, the implied
      response is 10.4% in BI and 16.9% in BII.

Notes: This table presents aggregate investment amounts for the bonus analysis sample and for other corporate
forms from Kitchen and Knittel (2011). The Kitchen and Knittel (2011) sample includes imputations for software
purchases, which are necessary to match NIPA aggregates for equipment and software investment. Our investment
measure does not include these imputations.

C.2    Lower Bound on Aggregate Effects
The estimates produced in the previous section map the cross-sectional elasticity into a time
series aggregate effect under the assumption that the mapping is valid. An alternative, which
provides a lower bound response, follows from Mian and Sufi (2012) and exploits only the
cross-sectional variation induced by the policy to estimate an aggregate response.
    The idea is to use the group that receives the smallest shock due to bonus as a counter-
factual. We then compute the effect of the policy for other groups relative to this one. By
construction any time series effect of the policy shown by the bottom group is set to zero and
removed from the effect computed for other groups.
    We operationalize this idea by dividing industries into twenty equal-sized bins based on the
pre-policy weighted present value of depreciation deductions, zN , for that industry. During BI,
the bottom 5 percent sees a 3.1 cent increase in z while the top group sees a 7.2 cent increase.
We subtract the 3.1 cent increase from all other groups and accumulate the investment response
for each group. We repeat this exercise for BII, in which the bottom group sees a 6.5 cent
increase while the top group sees a 12.4 cent increase.
    We use the investment weighted-average elasticity from the previous section (2.89) to trans-
late the changes in z to changes in investment for each group. We aggregate these changes in
investment and compute the average change for BI and BII.
    The results imply an average annual response of $18.1B in BI and $32.1B in BII. Note that
if the bottom group also responded to bonus, these estimates would provide a lower bound.
Performing a similar exercise as before to extrapolate this bound to the full population of firms
yields a response of $30.4B in BI and $55.9B in BII. As a percent of aggregate investment, the
BI lower bound is 3.9% and the BII lower bound is 6.0%.
