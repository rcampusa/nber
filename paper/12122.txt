Why China is Likely to Achieve its Growth Objectives

                                           ABSTRACT

In 2002, the Chinese Communist Party announced a goal of quadrupling per capita income by the
year 2020. Starting at income levels of the year 2000, this would require a growth rate of 7.2 percent
per annum in per capita income or close to 8.0 percent in GDP. Such unresolved and emerging
problems as growing income disparities, increasing pollution, pressures on infrastructure, the
inefficiency of state owned enterprises, and political instability are often cited as reasons to doubt
the attainability of the CCP’s goal. However, China’s progress in addressing fundamental constraints
that might limit rapid economic growth augurs well for the success of its economic goals. Although
there are disagreements about economic policy among top leaders, the continued transformation into
a market economy and the promotion of increasing local autonomy in economic matters are not in
doubt. In education, China has substantially increased the percentage of its workforce receiving a
college education, and continuing growth in this investment in human capital could account for a
large portion of the desired growth rate. In addition, the value of improvements in the quality of
economic output unmeasured by GDP, such as advances in the quality of health care and education,
could raise reported growth rates by as much as 60 percent. Finally, the government’s increasing
sensitivity to public opinion and issues of inequality and corruption, combined with improving living
conditions, have resulted in a level of popular confidence in the government that makes political
instability unlikely.

                   Why China Is Likely to Achieve Its Growth Objectives


       In 2002, the Chinese Communist Party announced a goal of quadrupling per capita

income by the year 2020. Starting at income levels of the year 2000, this would require a growth

rate of 7.2 percent per annum in per capita income or close to 8.0 percent in GDP (M. Wang

2005). Is China likely to meet that objective? That question has been a subject of debate in Asia,

Europe, and America, with an array of both pessimistic and optimistic views.

       In this paper I present some reasons for joining the optimists. Indeed, I will argue that

China’s GDP is likely to grow at rates of 8 percent per annum or more for a least a generation—

that is, to 2030—and perhaps beyond that date. Before getting into substantive issues about the

economic, structural, and political problems that will have to be overcome if the growth

objectives are to be met, it is useful to look at some numbers in order to set the context for

analysis.

       Exceptionally rapid rates of growth have been achieved by several poor Asian countries

for relatively long stretches of time since World War II. During the twenty years from 1950 to

1970, Japan grew at an average annual rate of 8.4 percent in per capita income, increasing its per

capita income more than sixfold, an achievement that is 50 percent higher than the goal set by

the Chinese leadership. Over the twenty years between 1960 and 1980, Singapore’s growth in

per capita income averaged 7.3 percent. The corresponding figure for South Korea between 1965

and 1985 was 7.6 percent, and Taiwan-China averaged 7.2 percent over the same period. Even

China exceeded its new growth target over the 22-year period from 1980 to 2002, when the

achieved growth rate averaged 8.2 percent per annum (Fogel 2004b). So the target set by the

leadership is well within the experience of the rapidly growing economies of Southeast Asia.




                                                                                                3
       However, those who question whether the new goal is achievable do so not because they

are unaware of the past experience of nations within the region, but because they doubt that

China will be able to replicate the experience of past leaders between now and 2020. The doubts

arise from beliefs that unresolved or emerging economic, political, and international problems

are likely to reduce the recent growth rate substantially. One of the economic issues is the shaky

state of the banking system, which is saddled with a high proportion of nonperforming loans.

The inefficiency and unprofitability of many state-owned enterprises (SOEs) is also seen as a

threat to future growth. Another problem is the growth in income disparities between the rapidly

growing coastal provinces and the more slowly growing interior provinces, between urban and

rural labor, and between highly skilled and manual labor (cf. Heckman 2005). There are also

bottlenecks in infrastructure, including pressure on fuel supplies and electrical power, and the

growth of environmental pollution. Although concern over the capacity of China to feed itself

has diminished, concern over the adequacy of water supplies has risen. This is not an exhaustive

list of the potential economic impediments to a continued high rate of economic growth, but it

captures some of the main concerns.1

       Although I recognize the importance of these issues, I shall not dwell on them at this

point. I view them as issues that need to be addressed during the course of economic growth and,

for reasons that I discuss in the second half of the paper, I believe that they will be addressed.

They are certainly on the “to do” lists of China’s political leaders and their economic advisors,

who stress the need for reducing social and economic imbalances. My initial focus is on more

fundamental constraints to sustaining rapid economic growth for another generation, constraints

that might undermine long-term growth prospects even if all the right things are done to resolve

the current litany of problems.




                                                                                                4
       To get at these potentially more binding constraints it is useful to disaggregate the

sources of growth in per capita income between 1978 and 2002. The process is facilitated by

equations (1) and (2) in Figure 1. Equation (1) is merely an identity which states that the level of

per capita income is equal to output per worker multiplied by the labor force participation rate. In

equation (1) the output of the economy is divided into three sectors: agriculture, industry, and

services. Labor productivity in each sector is weighted by that sector’s share of the labor force.

Equation (2) is the rate of growth transformation of equation (1). It says that the rate of growth in

per capita income is a weighted average of the sum of the rate of change in the labor share and of

labor productivity of each sector plus the rate of change in the labor force participation rate. The

sectoral weights are the mid-period shares of income originating in each sector.

       Table 1 shows that 69 percent of the growth in per capita income between 1978 and 2002

was due to increases in labor productivity within each of the three main sectors of the economy.2

The rise in labor productivity was most rapid in industry (6.2 percent per annum) despite the

inefficient state-owned enterprises and the inefficiencies in the allocation of capital. As Lin and

Tsai (2004, 355-356) have pointed out, the policy of gradually shifting from central control

appears to have been more effective than the “big bang” approach. By sequencing reforms that

successively enlarged the scope of the market sector, even the SOEs shifted most of their

purchases and sales to market prices rather than plan prices.

       Table 1 also shows that while changes in labor productivity were highest in the industrial

sector, they were nearly as high in agriculture (5.7 percent in agriculture as compared to 6.2

percent in industry). Moreover, this high rate of growth in agricultural productivity has been

sustained for more than two decades. Table 2 shows that although China’s rate of growth in

agricultural labor productivity over a two-decade period is not unprecedented, it is at the high




                                                                                                   5
end of experience in both Asia and Europe. Only Korea exceeded the Chinese growth in

agricultural labor productivity between 1980 and 1997, but in contrast to China, most of the

Korean agricultural labor force had already shifted into industry and services. In the Chinese

case, half of the labor force is still in agriculture, so the interindustry effect might yet prove to be

substantial. Indeed, it is likely to be somewhat larger in the next two decades than it was between

1980 and 2000.

       Since about 30 percent of China’s growth rate is likely to continue to come from inter-

industry shifts and modest increases in the labor force participation rate (cf. Johnson 2000),

growth rates of labor productivity within sectors need only average about 5 percent per year.

Several factors suggest that such growth rates are likely. Despite the remarkable advances of

recent decades, the average technology is still well below best prevailing practice in each of the

three sectors. Hence, growth in each sector will be stimulated by the diffusion of the best

prevailing practice. Moreover, the frontier of technology is moving out rapidly, especially in the

industrial and service sectors, but also in agriculture. Third, the investment in capital, especially

human capital, is capable of rapid improvement in the next several decades. Finally, despite the

preoccupation with possible overstatement of the Chinese growth rate due to inflated estimates

of growth sent from localities, on balance it is likely that the true Chinese growth rate is

understated, especially in the service sector, due to the failure adequately to account for

improvements in the quality of output and the underreporting of small firms. I now want to

elaborate briefly on these last two factors and assess their likely impact on growth rates over the

next two or three decades.




                                                                                                      6
                               The Role of Factor Enhancement

       Table 3 presents enrollment ratios in primary, secondary, and tertiary schools for 1980,

1990, 1997, and 2000. China is compared with seven Asian nations, four Western European

nations, and the United States. At the primary level, China’s ratios exceed those of all the other

nations. At the secondary level China compares favorably with the other newly industrializing

countries (NICs), but it is behind South Korea, Japan, Western Europe, and the United States.

However, the gap diminished rapidly between 1990 and 1997. In this brief span the enrollment

ratio at the secondary level increased by over 40 percent. China lags furthest behind the rich

nations at the tertiary level. There its enrollment level is between 15 and 27 percent of

enrollment levels in Korea, Japan, Western Europe, and the United States. However, once again

it is rapidly closing the gap. Between 1990 and 2004 the Chinese tertiary enrollment ratio

sextupled (China Statistical Yearbook 2005).

       It is possible to quantify the impact of enhancing the quality of labor through education

on the growth rate of per capita income by making use of the equations shown in Figure 2.

Equation (3) is a factor-augmenting production function in which γ L and γ K are indexes of labor

and capital augmentation (in this discussion I will focus only on labor augmentation). Equation

(4) merely rearranges equation (3) to put it in a more convenient form. The dependent variable is

now labor productivity and the term in square brackets brings the augmentation indexes together

with the index of total factor productivity. Equation (5) is the rate of growth transformation of

equation (4). It indicates that when all other variables are held constant, labor productivity will

grow at the rate of growth of labor augmentation multiplied by labor’s share in income.




                                                                                                 7
       Table 4 presents the information needed to implement equation (5). The top part presents

an index of the relative productivity of labor with primary, high school, and college degrees. The

index is based on the income of U.S. males by education level. It indicates that a college-

educated worker is 3.1 times as productive, and a high school graduate is 1.8 times as productive,

as a worker with less than a ninth-grade education.3 The bottom half of the table indicates the

contribution of various scenarios of increases in enrollment ratios. Labor enhancement would

grow at the rate of 1.8 percent per annum if the secondary ratio reached one hundred in 20 years.

Multiplying this figure by the labor share indicates that such an achievement would add about

1.1 percent to the growth rate of labor productivity.

       Labor enhancement would grow at 7.4 percent per annum if the tertiary ratio rose from 6

to 25 in the next twenty years, which would put the tertiary level of education in China at about

where the Western European nations were in 1980. That level of labor augmentation would add

4.4 percent to the growth rate of labor productivity, and by itself would account for over 60

percent of the target set in 2002. With a more ambitious expansion of higher education, reaching

enrollment ratios of 50 in 20 years, labor augmentation would grow at 11.2 percent. The rate of

investment in human capital would by itself add 6.7 percent to the overall growth rate.

       These targets for higher education are not out of reach. It should be remembered that as

recently as 1980, the Western European nations had ratios of about 25. Only the United States

was above 50. The movement to enrollment ratios of 50 in Western Europe was a product of the

last two decades of the twentieth century. In the case of the U.K., two-thirds of the increase from

19 to 52 percent took place between 1990 and 1997.

       The significance of investment in human capital as an engine of economic growth has not

eluded the State Council. In 1998 Jiang Zemin called for a massive increase in enrollments in




                                                                                                 8
higher education. The response was swift: over the next four years enrollment in higher

education increased by 165 percent (from 3.4 million to 9.0 million) and the number of students

studying abroad also rose by 152 percent (China Statistical Yearbook 2003). It is currently

estimated that by 2010 at least 20 percent of high school graduates will be enrolled in institutions

of higher education and the long run target is 50 percent by 2050. The tertiary enrollment ratio

increased by about 50 percent between 2000 and 2004 (from 12.5 to 19.0 percent), so the

calculations shown in Table 4 may well be too conservative (China Statistical Yearbook 2005).

China currently has about 20 million students enrolled in higher education, which exceeds

current U.S. enrollments by about 60 percent. (Newcomb 2005; U.S. Statistical Abstract 2005).

It is estimated that in 2005-6 China will produce 3.3 million college graduates, India 3.1 million,

and the United States 1.3 million (Colvin 2005). However, in advancing the frontier of scientific

training, the United States still has a considerable lead.

                              Errors in the Measurement of Output

       So far I have focused mainly on factor enhancement to support my contention that China

is likely to achieve its growth targets. I want to turn now to the problems of measurement on the

output side of equation (5). Errors in the measurement of national income from the output side

have become increasingly severe. It is now clear that official estimates of GDP for the United

States badly underestimate U.S. economic growth because they do not take into account

improvements in the quality of output, especially in such services as education and health care.

Children in secondary schools are taught more about science and technology today than post-

graduate college students used to be taught a generation ago, let alone two generations ago.

       Even more dramatic are the improvements in health care. A century and a half ago,

people in their late thirties and early forties were more afflicted by chronic disabilities than




                                                                                                  9
people in their late sixties and early seventies are today. Not only has the average age at onset of

disabilities been delayed by a decade or so, but once disabilities appear, there are now numerous

effective interventions. Hernias, which used to be permanent and exceedingly painful conditions

afflicting one out of every four males, can now be repaired by a surgical procedure that in the

United States requires hospitalization for only 23 hours. Other areas where medical interventions

have been highly effective include treatment of genito-urinary conditions, control of

hypertension and reduction in the incidence of stroke, replacement of knee and hip joints, curing

of cataracts, and chemotherapies that reduce the incidence of osteoporosis and heart disease

(Fogel 2004a).

       Yet most of these great advances in health care and education are overlooked in the GDP

accounts, because the values of these sectors are measured by inputs instead of by output. An

hour of a doctor's time is considered no more effective today than an hour of a doctor's time was

half a century ago, before the age of antibiotics and modern surgery. It has recently been

estimated that the value of improvements in health care, if properly measured, are at least twice

the cost of health care, but such calculations have not yet made their way into the GDP accounts

(Cutler and McClellan 2001; Murphy and Topel 2003; Nordhaus 2003). In the case of the United

States, my own rough estimates indicate that allowing for such factors as the increase in leisure

time, the improvement in the quality of health care, and the improvements in the quality of

education would come close to doubling the U.S. annual growth rate of per capita income over

the past century (from 2.0 to 3.6 percent per annum).

       What is the implication of these statistics for understanding the change in standards of

living for the typical American? If we use the conventional measure of growth, the real income

of the typical American in 2000 was 7 times greater than it was in 1900. However, if an adjusted




                                                                                                 10
measure is used, Americans in 2000 had real incomes that were 34 times greater than in 1900. In

other words, 80 percent of the goods and services that Americans enjoy today are outside of the

measured economy (Fogel 2000 and 2004a).

       What is the implication of the failure to take account of improvements in the quality of

output for the measurement of Chinese economic growth? In China the main increases in life

expectancy took place before the onset of the period of reform. Between 1950 and 1980, life

expectancy at birth increased from 40.8 to 67.8 years. By 2000 life expectancy stood at about

71.4, an increase of about 0.18 years of life expectancy per calendar year during the period of

accelerated economic reform (Keyfitz and Flieger 1990; China Statistical Yearbook 2003).

Studies of the value of a statistical life year in rich and poor nations suggest that the value of an

additional year of life in China is about 3.5 times per capita income (see, e.g., Murphy and Topel

2002; Viscusi and Aldy 2003). Hence, the value of the unmeasured improvements in life

expectancy may have been high enough to raise the rate of economic growth between 1980 and

2000 by about 60 percent. If the true growth of GDP between 2000 and 2040 is 13 percent

instead of 8 percent, then the true size of the Chinese economy in 2040 will be about 6 times the

size of the measured economy. Of course, if both the United States and China similarly neglect

changes of quality in their measurements, the relative ranking of the two economies may not be

changed significantly.

                   Will Political Instability Undermine Economic Growth?

       So far I have focused purely on economic issues. Some analysts argue that political

instability is a serious impediment to China’s ability to maintain high rates of economic growth.

Several scenarios have been outlined in which political factors could thwart economic goals.

Some of these scenarios begin with an economic breakdown brought on by a sharp cyclical




                                                                                                  11
downturn that would raise unemployment and undermine a precarious social stability. Others

warn that a growing social unrest has been brought on by the financial problems and

inefficiencies of the state-owned enterprises. These problems have not only led to rising urban

unemployment but have also resulted in the failure to pay promised wages, pensions, health-care

allowances, and housing allowances (Bremmer 2005; Chaohua 2005). Still others warn of an

impending breakdown in the banking system, which is beset by a huge burden of nonperforming

loans, a breakdown that could undermine the microeconomic stability of the economy (Garnaut

and Song 2004).

       Other threats to stability that have been observed include: widespread corruption; internal

power struggles; bubbles in real estate, international trade, and steel (among other products);

inequality between the urban and rural areas, between the coastal and interior provinces, between

the highly educated elites and poorly educated masses, and between the Han majority and the

ethnic minorities. One unique warning singles out the sharp rise in the sex ratio concentrated at

ages 15–34, which, it is argued, will translate into high rates of crime and violence and may

promote concubinage. Some single out international tensions, particularly over Taiwan, which

divert the attention of the leadership from their growth objectives (Pei 2005; Bradsher 2004;

Dunphy 2004, Hu 2000; Lim 2004; Business Asia 2002; McGregor 2004; Wilson 2004; EIU

ViewsWire 2004).

       When speculating about the future, the range of possible scenarios is virtually unlimited.

The point at issue is not what might occur, but what is likely to occur. Moreover, many of the

problems singled out are of long standing, such as the inefficiency of many state-owned

enterprises. While these SOEs may be a drag on the economy, China has nevertheless been able

to grow at over 8 percent per capita for a quarter of a century. The idea that these inefficient




                                                                                               12
firms will suddenly go bankrupt is far-fetched. The policy of the State Council has been to

gradually phase them out or to reorganize them on a profitable basis so as not to sharply increase

unemployment. Not only does the government have the finances needed to continue subsidizing

inefficient firms if it chooses to do so for economic or political reasons, but the burden of these

subsidies will also gradually diminish, because the share of the industrial output supplied by

these underperforming SOEs will gradually decline and the burden of a given level of subsidies

will rapidly diminish with the economy growing so rapidly.

       These points also apply to the problem of the state banks. Although the proportion of

nonperforming loans may be about 35 percent, China is not in immediate danger of a collapse of

its banking system. It is within the power of the government to remove this burden. The banks

originally became saddled with the bad paper because the government obliged the banks to

finance unprofitable SOEs. The inefficiencies and distortions in the economy produced by

banking policies have been relieved by the large injection of foreign direct investment,

encouraged by government policy, which has also facilitated the transfer of advanced

technologies to China. With direct investment going largely into large-scale industry, the banks

have been able to supply part of the capital needed by small-scale enterprises (Lin, Cai, and Li

2003; Fan 2005). Movements in the direction of more effectively using the monetary system to

manage business cycles, and contemplated reforms in capital markets, should also alleviate

economic distortions. For example, the government recently restructured two of the four largest

state-owned banks to bring their capital position up to international standards. Most important,

perhaps, is the very low level of government indebtedness (less than a fifth of GDP), which gives

the State Council leeway to pursue needed stabilization policies, including a rapid restructuring




                                                                                                13
of the banking system, instead of the gradual policy of reform it is currently pursuing (Lin, Cai,

and Li 2003; Fan 2005).

       Although there are disagreements about economic policy among the top leaders, the

proposition that China should continue to transform itself into a market economy is not at issue.

Nor is there disagreement over the policy of promoting increasing autonomy in economic

decisions as a lever of rapid economic growth. As many analysts have pointed out, the

government is unified around a policy that has been called “market preserving federalism.” This

Chinese form of federalism limits the central government’s control over economic decision

making, promotes creative competition among local governments, constrains rent seeking, and

provides an array of incentives to induce creative local enterprises. This type of federalism is

also apparent in the design of the tax system, which has been called “fiscal federalism,” and

which is aimed at preventing taxation from stifling economic growth. In the tax reform of 1994,

the central government limited its primary administration to VAT and taxes on centrally owned

enterprises. It also set up local tax bureaus under the direction of local governments to supervise

income taxes. While much remains to be done in the design of the fiscal system, especially with

respect to narrowing regional inequalities, these issues are on the leadership’s agenda of needed

reforms. The central leadership is also aware of the danger that local autonomy may move in

counterproductive ways that promote rent seeking, moral hazard, and other forms of corruption,

and that it must monitor performance and penalize corruption where possible. The successful

unfolding of autonomy requires a center strong enough to integrate national and local goals, to

discipline local authorities whose corrupt practices threaten the progress of reform, and to

Hendrischke 2003).

       Some analysts argue that unless China permits competing political parties, powerful

pressures will build up between the provinces and the center that will undermine political

stability and thwart continued high rates of economic growth. Others argue that the unsolved

inequalities have also built up pressures at the grass roots that threaten to become unmanageable

(Goldstone 1995; Ohman 1995; Esarey 2002). Other issues stressed by analysts include

mounting environmental hazards, lagging development of public health programs, and endemic

corruption (Shambaugh 2000; Chapman 2002).

       The difficulty with these arguments is that they assume that the leaders of the CCP and

the State Council are unaware of these problems. The leaders are quite well aware that the

successes of their growth policies have weakened the central government’s control over daily life

and access to information. Indeed, one purpose of the reforms was to promote creativity at the

local level by promoting local initiative and by encouraging the entry of global firms into the

Chinese market in order to facilitate new ideas and technologies. Moreover, critiques of current

policies that hamper economic growth are encouraged, although competitive political parties are

prohibited. Debates over governmental policies at all levels are as vigorous and wide-ranging at

the meetings of the Chinese Economists Society as they are at the American Economic

Association.

       The leaders of the CCP have responded to the changing economic and social conditions

by changing the central goal of the CCP and by co-opting the elites who are at the forefront of

China’s economic and social transformation. This process of adaptation is reflected in the new

slogan of the CCP, “Three Represents,” introduced by Jiang Zemin in the spring of 2000 to




                                                                                              15
replace the previous slogan of “Three Revolutionary Classes” (peasants, workers, and soldiers).

The new slogan portrays the CCP as: (1) the embodiment of society’s most advanced productive

forces; (2) the promoter of an advanced culture; and (3) representing the needs and interests of

the great majority of the Chinese population. To extend its connections with the elites who are

bringing about the transformation of China, the CCP encouraged the formation of a wide array of

new business and professional societies with strong ties to the state. It also transformed the

membership of the CCP, bringing into its fold the technocratic leaders of business, social, and

intellectual life. During the two decades following 1982, the proportion of the Central

Committee members holding college degrees increased from a little over half to nearly 99

percent (Dickson 2003a and b).

       The 16th Congress of the CCP, which met in November 2002, made provincial leaders the

most prominent group in the Politburo, representing 42 percent of its membership. By contrast,

the military represented only 8 percent of the Politburo, and central party institutions accounted

for 25 percent. The balance of the Politburo membership came from Shanghai political circles or

from institutions other than provincial leaderships or central government institutions. Given the

dominant role of provincial leaders in the shaping of national policy, it makes little sense to

dwell on the possibility of a conflict between the national and provincial leaders, especially when

many of the central leaders came from provincial posts (Bo 2004).

       Some analysts argue that leaders of the CCP and the State Council are out of touch with

public opinion. However, the weight of evidence contradicts that view. Local and provincial

governments have been using polling techniques to determine public opinion on an array of

economic and social issues since the late 1980s. Academic critics of government policies abound

and interactions between these critics and top government leaders are numerous. The range of




                                                                                                16
problems raised by respondents to surveys mirrors the complaints of academic critics and foreign

analysts, including widespread corruption, increasing inequality, persistent unemployment,

burdensome taxes, and unpaid pensions. Nevertheless, the polls also reveal majority support for

the central government and overwhelming belief that the courts, the press, and government

institutions will be responsive to their grievances (Pei 2001; Lin et al. 2002; China Newsweek

2005).4

          Popular confidence in the government reflects the widespread belief among the Chinese

that their living conditions have improved (67 percent better, 12 percent worse, 20 percent no

change). The level of confidence about whether living conditions will continue to improve is

similar. According to another poll, optimism about the future is slightly higher in rural areas (75

percent) than in the cities (68 percent). Hence, it is not surprising that political reform is quite

limited, although there is an expectation that the government will gradually improve legal and

governmental institutions. This generally favorable view of government not only reflects the

pragmatic responses of leaders at all levels of government to grievances, but also the frequent

intervention of the central government with local officials when they are too slow to respond to

complaints. It also reflects the rapid increases in income experienced by the great majority of

households for more than a quarter of a century (Fewsmith 2003).5

          This combination of widely shared economic advances and governmental attention to

public opinion, especially with respect to grievances, is a formula for continued political

stability. One indication of the stability of the regime and the self-confidence of its leaders is its

successful bid for the 2008 Olympic Games. Another is its encouragement of Chinese students to

enroll in American and European universities. The gradual loosening of constraints on

expression in China is likely to continue over the next several decades. Whether or not these




                                                                                                   17
developments lead to a multiparty system of the American type remains to be seen. However,

the government’s responsiveness to popular concerns indicates that political stability is likely to

remain at the level required for continued long-term economic growth.




                                                                                                18
                                                 Notes


1. Discussions of economic impediments that may foil the growth targets of China are
   summarized in Shane 2005; Zakaria 2005; Morrison 2005; R. Wang 2005; Economist
   2004a, 2004b, 2005a; Prasad 2004.

2. The disaggregation shown in Table 1 is based on data from the China Statistical
   Yearbook 2003, pp. 26, 27, 313. In the absence of a GDP deflator, the retail fixed-base
   price index was used to obtain real GDP. Because the differential approximation shown
                                             *
   in equation (1) does not quite add up to Y , the sum of the terms on the right-hand side of
   the equation was used as the denominator when computing the contribution of changes in
   the LFPR, in inter-industry shifts in the labor force, and in within-sector productivity to
   the overall change in per capita income.

3. The relative index for other G-8 countries reporting data were somewhat different from
   those shown for the United States in Table 2, but not materially so. Their use would not
   materially change the analysis. I prefer the U.S. figures as reported in Table 2 because it
   is likely that even they underestimate the impact of labor-augmentation on Chinese
   economic growth. The data reported by OECD for 6 of the G-8 countries for 1997, 1998,
   or 1999 are as follows:

                         Canada France Germany Italy                     UK       U.S.
  Less than 12th grade      100      100        100       100            100      100
  High-school graduate      120      119        128       172            154      149
  B.A. or higher degree     183      201        201       —              263      269
 Source: Sherman, Honegger, and McGivern 2003, Table A31.

   The values of the U.S. index in this table differ from those in Table 2 for several reasons.
   The values here are based on average income over both sexes rather than the median
   income for men only. The age range here excludes persons aged 65 and over. The years
   used here are 1997, 1998, or 1999 rather than 2000. But the most important factor is that
   the base here is less than twelfth grade rather than less than ninth grade. It should be
   noted that in Table 2, the ratio of the income of persons with college degrees to those
   with high school degrees is 173. In this note it is 181.

4. Other interesting discussions of political stresses and responses include Huang 1995;
   Chapman 2002; Gong 2005; D. Wang 2005; and Bremmer 2005.

5. It is also worth noting the distinction made by Fareed Zakaria between liberal
   democracies, illiberal democracies, and liberalizing autocracies. Liberal democracies are
   not only marked by contested elections, but also by governments that seek to protect the
   autonomy and dignity of individuals against coercion, create checks on the power of
   various branches of government, and establish equality under law. Illiberal democracies
   have contested elections but the elected governments use their power to repress speech
   and assembly and to restrict economic and social behavior. Liberalizing autocracies have


                                                                                            19
one-party systems but have permitted individuals limited political rights and have
improved the spheres of economic, social, and civil rights. He argues that most East
Asian governments today “are a mix of democracy, liberalism, capitalism, oligarchy, and
corruption—much like Western governments circa 1900” (Zakaria 1997, 28; cf. Zakaria
2003. See also Economist 2005b).
