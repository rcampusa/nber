The Flow Approach to Labor Markets: New Data Sources and Micro-Macro Links

                                            ABSTRACT

New data sources and products developed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Bureau of the
Census highlight the fluid character of U.S. labor markets. Private-sector job creation and destruction
rates average nearly 8% of employment per quarter. Worker flows in the form of hires and
separations are more than twice as large. The data also underscore the lumpy nature of micro-level
employment adjustments. More than two-thirds of job destruction occurs at establishments that
shrink by more than 10% within the quarter, and more than one-fifth occurs at those that shut down.
Our study also uncovers highly nonlinear relationships of worker flows to employment growth and
job flows at the micro level. These micro relations interact with movements over time in the cross-
sectional density of establishment growth rates to produce recurring cyclical patterns in aggregate
labor market flows. Cyclical movements in the layoffs-separation ratio, for example, and the
propensity of separated workers to become unemployed reflect distinct micro relations for quits and
layoffs. A dominant role for the job-finding rate in accounting for unemployment movements in mild
downturns and a bigger role for the job-loss rate in severe downturns reflect distinct micro relations
for hires and layoffs.

       More than ten percent of U.S. workers separate from their employers each

quarter. Some move directly to a new job with a different employer, some become

unemployed, and some exit the labor force. The flow of new hires is similarly large, and

somewhat larger whenever aggregate employment expands. The magnitude of hires and

separations underscores the fluid character of U.S. labor markets and draws attention to

questions of search and matching, recruiting, applicant screening, and employee

retention. It also provides powerful motivation for theories of frictional unemployment.

       The economic forces behind worker flows can be grouped into broad categories.

On the “demand side,” employers create new jobs and destroy old ones in large numbers

every quarter. These newly created and destroyed jobs can be measured directly, and they

account for much of the job mobility and many of the jobless spells experienced by

workers. Workers also switch jobs and change employment status because of “supply-

side” events such as labor force entry, family relocation and retirement. In addition,

workers switch jobs for reasons of career development, better pay and preferable working

conditions. Roughly speaking, the creation of new jobs and the destruction of old ones

reflect demand-side developments in the labor market, while worker flow measures also

capture supply-side events and job switching.

       U.S. statistical agencies have recently developed some remarkable new datasets

that yield a richer, fuller picture of labor market flows. We use these new sources and

several older sources to develop evidence about the magnitude and distribution of labor

market flows in the cross section and over time. We also characterize the relationship of

hires, separations, quits and layoffs to the creation and destruction of jobs by individual

employers. Our evidence reveals that the micro relations between worker flows and job

flows, while complex and nonlinear, are fairly stable over the business cycle. That is,

business cycle swings mainly involve shifts in the distribution of employer growth rates

rather than big shifts in hires, separations and layoffs conditional on employer growth.

         In line with this finding, we show that much of the time variation in hires,

separations, layoffs, and unemployment flows reflect the interaction between shifts over

time in the distribution of employer growth rates and relatively stable, but highly

nonlinear micro relations. We also show that some unusual aspects of the labor market

downturn during and after the 2001 recession are explained by the micro relations

between worker flows and employment growth. Our attention to the aggregate

implications of micro heterogeneity and nonlinearities follows work by Bertola and

Caballero (1990), Dunne, Roberts, and Samuelson (1989), Davis and Haltiwanger (1990,

1992), Caballero and Engel (1991), Caballero (1992), Foote (1998) and others.



Labor Market Flows: Concepts, Measures and Magnitudes

Basics

         For any given business and at any level of aggregation, the net change in

employment between two points in time satisfies a fundamental accounting identity:

         Net Employment Change ≡ Hires - Separations ≡ Creation - Destruction
                                   Worker Flows              Job Flows

Job creation is positive for an expanding or new business, and job destruction is positive

for a shrinking or exiting business. Aggregating across employers within a region or

industry typically yields large positive values for both job creation and job destruction.

While a single employer can either create or destroy jobs during a period, it can

simultaneously have positive hires and separations. Hence, the flow of hires exceeds job


                                              2
creation, and the flow of separations exceeds job destruction. As an example, consider a

business with two quits during the period and one replacement hire. The worker flows at

this business consist of two separations and one hire, and there is a net change of one

destroyed job. These concepts of worker flows and job flows are easily aggregated by

cumulating over business establishments or firms.

         To express the flows from t – 1 to t as rates, we divide by the simple average of

employment in t – 1 and t. This calculation yields growth rates in the interval from -200

to 200 percent with endpoints corresponding to births and deaths. This growth rate

measure has become standard in work on labor market flows, because it offers important

advantages relative to log changes and growth rates calculated on initial employment. In

particular, it yields measures that are symmetric about zero and bounded, affording an

integrated treatment of births, deaths and continuing employers. It also lends itself to

consistent aggregation, and it is identical to log changes up to a second-order Taylor

Series expansion. See Tornqvist, Vartia and Vartia (1985) and the appendix to Davis,

Haltiwanger and Schuh (1996) for additional discussion.

         Table 1 reports average job and worker flow rates for the U.S. economy at

monthly, quarterly, and annual sampling frequencies based on establishment-level data

from several sources. The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) is designed

to produce worker flow estimates, but manipulation of the JOLTS micro data yields

estimates of job flows as well.1 According to JOLTS data, workers newly hired within the

month account for more than 3 percent of employment, and the number of newly


1
  For more on the JOLTS data, see Clark and Hyson (2001) and Faberman (2005). The publicly available
JOLTS statistics for worker flows are based on a monthly sample of approximately 16,000 establishments
that commences in December 2000. Our estimates are based on a research sample of JOLTS data described
in Davis, Faberman, and Haltiwanger (2006).


                                                  3
separated workers is slightly smaller. Job creation and destruction rates in the JOLTS

data are 1.5 percent per month, almost half as large as hires and separations.

        Several sources are available for quarterly figures on worker flows and job flows.

A quarterly JOLTS sample shows worker flow rates that exceed 9 percent of

employment, and job flow rates that exceed 3 percent of employment. The JOLTS

sample, however, does not capture establishment entry and exit. In contrast, the Business

Employment Dynamics (BED) data are based on a virtual census of establishments, and

they provide more representative estimates for quarterly job flows.2 The BED data yield

much larger job flows, with average job creation and destruction near 8 percent of

employment per quarter. That is, for every dozen or so filled jobs at a point in time, on

average one job disappears in the following three months. In a growing economy, a

somewhat larger number of new jobs are created at new and expanding establishments.

        The Longitudinal Employer Household Dynamics (LEHD) data contain matched

employer-employee records that allow the calculation of job and worker flows.3 The

matching process is complex and lends itself to multiple estimation approaches. Here, we

present one set of estimates that capture all worker flows, regardless of how long a job-

worker match endures, and another set for the subset of “full-quarter” transitions. Full-

quarter transitions refer to separations in the current quarter of employees who worked at

the establishment during the full previous quarter, and to hires in the current quarter who

continue to work at the establishment in the full following quarter. The more inclusive

concept (all transitions) yields quarterly rates for hires and separations of about 25

  Published job flow statistics derived from the BED commence in 1992 and are updated quarterly. We rely
on a research version of the BED created by Faberman (2006) that yields job flow statistics back to 1990.
See Pivetz et al. (2001), Spletzer et al. (2004), and Clayton and Spletzer (2005) for more on the BED data.

  See Abowd, Haltiwanger and Lane (2004) for a detailed discussion of the LEHD program. See Burgess
et al. (2000) for a discussion of the relationship between worker flows and job flows in this type of data.


                                                     4
percent of employment. Many of the transitions captured by these remarkably large

worker flows reflect very short employment spells. Indeed, restricting attention to full-

quarter cases yields quarterly rates of 13 percent for hires and 11 percent for separations.

Quarterly job flow rates in the LEHD are half as large. Finally, Pinkston and Spletzer

(2004) use the BED to produce annual job flows, which do not count establishment-level

employment changes that are reversed within the year. Annual job creation and

destruction are about 14 percent of employment.4

        Clearly, the U.S. economy exhibits high average rates of job flows and worker

flows. As we show below, this characterization holds in booms and slumps alike. Several

points should be kept in mind when interpreting these flows, especially when comparing

measures derived from different data sources or procedures. First, hires and separations

can be measured as cumulative flows during the sampling interval or by comparing the

membership of the workforce at the beginning and end of the sampling interval. Both

methods respect the fundamental accounting identity, but the method of point-in-time

comparisons misses employment relationships that begin and end within the sampling

interval. Also, under point-in-time comparisons, shorter sampling intervals capture a

larger fraction of transitory employment changes. Second, for the purposes of measuring

labor market flows, “employers” can be defined at the level of establishments, firms or

tax-paying entities that serve as the unit of observation. We focus on establishment-based

measures of labor market flows. Third, high-quality longitudinal links are essential for

accurate labor market flows. Broken links create spurious entry and exit, overstating job

flows, and spurious job-to-job transitions, overstating worker flows. We focus on data

 Davis, Haltiwanger, and Schuh (1996) and Davis and Haltiwanger (1999a) present additional job flow
measures and discuss the relationship between job flows at different sampling frequencies.

sources with high-quality longitudinal links that are the product of many person-decades

of measurement work by the statistical agencies and outside researchers.

Differences by Industry

       Job flow and worker flow magnitudes vary greatly among industries. Table 2

illustrates this point by reporting BED-based quarterly job flows and JOLTS-based

monthly worker flows for selected industry groups. Even for broadly defined industry

groups, average job and worker flow rates vary widely. For example, job flow rates are

three times larger in Construction than in Manufacturing, and worker flow rates are three

times larger in Leisure & Hospitality than in Manufacturing.

       Table 2 also reports large industry differences in quit rates and layoff rates and in

the quit-layoff mix of separations. Goods-producing industries, such as Construction and

Manufacturing, stand out for a high ratio of layoffs to quits. At the other extreme, the

layoff-quit ratio is relatively low in Retail Trade and Leisure & Hospitality, implying that

most of the separations in these industries take the form of quits. The relationship

between worker flows and job flows varies across industries as well. Some industries

have a nearly one-to-one relation between the number of layoffs and the number of

destroyed jobs, while other industries tend to destroy more jobs than they lay off workers.

       These industry differences in the magnitude and character of labor market flows

have interesting implications for workforce management, the incidence of

unemployment, and the response of unemployment to industry-level shocks. When

normal rates of worker attrition are high, as in Leisure & Hospitality, employers can more

readily respond to negative demand shocks without resorting to layoffs. When attrition

rates are low, as in Manufacturing, negative demand shocks lead to bigger layoffs. Not




                                             6
surprisingly, the incidence and duration of unemployment are much higher for layoffs

than for quits.5 Thus, we hypothesize that a uniform contraction in employer growth

rates results in greater unemployment among workers who separate from employers with

low attrition rates. Testing this hypothesis in full is beyond the scope of this paper, but we

show below that the layoff-separation ratio exhibits a strong negative relationship to

employer growth rates in the cross section and over time.

        The evidence in Table 2 also raises a number of deeper questions. For example,

why do layoffs account for a bigger fraction of separations in goods-producing

industries? Do industry differences in the prominence of layoffs reflect differences in the

flexibility of wages? If so, why do differences in wage flexibility arise and persist? How

effectively can employers influence recruiting and retention by altering pay levels and

compensation design? Answering these questions is beyond the scope of this paper, but it

is worth remarking that the LEHD is well suited to an investigation of these issues,

because it contains individual earnings records and has a longitudinal matched employer-

employee design.

Heterogeneity and the Micro Distribution of Labor Market Flows

        Tables 1 and 2 suggest that an employer can bring about a sizable workforce

reduction over a period of several months by curtailing new hires and relying on attrition.

Conversely, an employer can expand over time by devoting more resources to retention

while hiring at a steady pace. In fact, because most establishments undergo small

percentage employment changes most of the time, many desired adjustments in

workforce size can be achieved by modest changes in recruiting and retention rates. It is


5

Figure 6.8) and Bleakley et al. (1999, Figure 4).


                                                  7
important to recognize this point in thinking about the nature of micro-level employment

adjustments and the problem of managing workforce size for a typical employer.

         For the analysis of labor market flows and their consequences, however, it is

equally important to recognize that most job flows involve establishments undergoing

rapid expansions or contractions. As an example, take the estimates from BED data for

all nonfarm private-sector establishments in the third quarter of 2001. 31 percent of BED

establishments contracted during the quarter and so contributed to job destruction.

Another 26 percent expanded and so contributed to job creation. Most job destruction, 68

percent, occurred at establishments that contracted by 10 percent or more during the

quarter. Perhaps more surprising, 63 percent of job creation occurred at establishments

that expanded by 10 percent or more. In fact, the prevalence of such large employment

changes is the norm in both booms and busts. Hence, most job destruction cannot be

interpreted as the product of modest contractions achieved by normal rates of worker

attrition. Neither can most job creation be seen as the outcome of modest establishment-

level growth rates. That is, although most establishments experience little or no

employment change within a quarter, job flows mainly reflect lumpy employment

changes at the establishment level.6

         Worker flows are less concentrated at establishments with big percentage

employment changes. 53 percent of hires and 52 percent of separations take place at

establishments that change employment by 5 percent or less in a given month, including

11 percent at establishments with no employment change. Another 43 percent of hires

occur at establishments that expand by at least 5 percent in the month, and 42 percent of

6
  See section 3.4 in Davis and Haltiwanger (1999a) for additional evidence on this point. A large literature
has arisen on the factors, such as nonconvex adjustment costs, leading to lumpy employment changes. See,
e.g., Caballero, Engel and Haltiwanger (1997) and Cooper, Haltiwanger and Willis (2004).


                                                     8
separations occur at establishments that contract by at least 5 percent. Layoffs are more

concentrated at shrinking employers – 58 percent take place at establishments that

contract by 5 percent or more during the month. Many hires (16 percent of the total)

occur at contracting establishments, and many separations (22 percent) occur at

expanding establishments.

Labor Market Flows from the Worker Perspective

       Thus far, our discussion has centered on job and worker flows measured from the

employer perspective. One can also measure worker flows from the perspective of

individuals as in Blanchard and Diamond (1990), Fallick and Fleischman (2004) and

Shimer (2005). These studies use longitudinal data on the employment status of

individuals and cross-sectional data on the duration of ongoing employment and

unemployment spells to estimate the flow of persons between jobs and the flows into and

out of employment, unemployment and the labor force. Figure 1 draws on tabulations

from the Current Population Survey (CPS) by Fallick and Fleischman (2004) to report

average monthly flows between unemployment, employment and out of the labor force.

The figure also reports the average monthly flow of job switchers, i.e., direct employer-

to-employer flows. For each flow, Figure 1 reports the raw number of movers (in

millions), the number of movers as a percent of the population aged 16-64, and the

hazard rate for movements from one labor market state or job to another.

       According to Figure 1, 11.9 million persons changed labor market status from one

month to the next during the 1996 to 2003 period. Another 2.8 million persons switched

employers in the average month. That is, nearly 15 million workers – more than 8 percent

of the working-age population – switched jobs or employment status in the average




                                             9
month. Restricting attention to employed persons: 2.6 percent switch employers from one

month to the next, another 1.3 percent enter unemployment, and 2.7 percent exit the labor

force. That is, 6.6 percent of employed persons switched jobs or left employment in the

average month. These numbers confirm the fluid character of U.S. labor markets.



Labor Market Flows: Time-Series Evidence

Job Flows

       How do labor market flows move over time? Figure 2 displays quarterly job flow

rates for the private sector from 1990 to 2005, and Figure 3 shows longer series for the

manufacturing sector. Figure 3 is constructed by splicing BED data for the manufacturing

sector to job flows calculated by Davis and Haltiwanger (1999b) from the Longitudinal

Research Database (LRD) and the older BLS Labor Turnover Survey (LTS). See

Faberman (2006) for details regarding the splicing method.

       The two figures confirm that job creation and destruction rates are remarkably

high at all times. The manufacturing data in Figure 3 also show pronounced spikes in job

destruction rates during employment downturns, as stressed by Davis and Haltiwanger

(1990, 1992). The shorter BED-based series for the private sector also exhibits job

destruction spikes in the 1990-91 and 2001 recessions, but they are much milder than the

ones in the manufacturing sector. This pattern is consistent with Foote’s (1998) evidence

of manufacturing/non-manufacturing differences in the cyclical dynamics of creation and

destruction.

       Figures 2 and 3 also show a long downward slide in job creation rates before,

during, and well after the 2001 recession. There is no such downward slide in job

creation rates during or after the 1990-91 recession. Moreover, the 58-year time series


                                            10
for manufacturing shows no comparable episode with a sustained downward drift in gross

job creation rates coupled with declining employment. Judging by the available evidence,

such a long slide in job creation rates is not a feature of any other recession in the postwar

era. However, the two figures suggest that the recent slide in job creation rates is part of

a longer term fall in the overall magnitude of job flows. Davis et al. (2006) provide

additional evidence for this view. They document large trend declines since the mid

1970s in the cross-sectional dispersion of employment growth rates and in the volatility

of business growth rates.7

Worker Flows from the Employer Perspective

        Figure 4 shows seasonally adjusted rates of hires and separations from the

published Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) data. The available time

series covers fewer than six years but includes the 2001 recession and aftermath. The

hires rate declines from 3.8 percent of employment in December 2000 to 3.0 percent in

April 2003, mirroring the downward drift in job creation observed in Figure 2. Thus, the

BED and the JOLTS tell similar stories of weakness in job creation and new hires during

the 2001 recession, and for more than a year thereafter. The separations rate declines

modestly after the 2001 recession and then reverses course. Breaking separations into its

component parts, however, shows a mild increase in layoffs during the recession and a

stronger decline in quits that continues until mid 2003. A longer BLS time series on

Mass Layoff Initial Claims (not reported here) more clearly shows a jump in layoff rates

during the 2001 recession.


7
 Recent studies by Comin and Philippon (2005) and others find a trend increase in volatility among
publicly traded firms. Davis et al. (2006) show that rising volatility among publicly traded firms is
overwhelmed by declining volatility among privately held firms, which account for about 70 percent of
private business employment.


                                                   11
       As students of the business cycle have long observed, falling (or low) quit rates

and rising layoff rates are symptomatic of weak labor markets; early studies reaching this

conclusion include Schlicter (1921) and Woytinsky (1942). Put differently, the mix of

separations shifts from quits to layoffs during cyclical downturns. Figure 4, however,

shows very mild movements in the layoff rate around the 2001 recession and modest

changes in the quit-layoff mix of separations. One view holds that these patterns reflect a

sharp departure from previous postwar recessions. Another view holds that the behavior

of layoffs and quits around the 2001 recession simply reflects the mild character of the

downturn and the delayed onset of employment growth after the recession. We provide

some evidence on this issue below.

       Groshen and Potter (2003) and Aaronson, Rissman and Sullivan (2004) show that

layoff behavior during the 2001 recession is unusual in least one important respect. Prior

to the 1990-91 recession, recessions were typically accompanied by a large surge in

temporary layoffs that accounted for much of the increase in total layoffs and much of the

cyclical increase in unemployment. This pattern is much weaker in the 1990-91

recession and almost completely absent in the 2001 recession. Instead, almost all of the

layoffs during the 2001 recession reflect permanent separations. This feature of the 2001

recession is a significant departure from the behavior of the labor market in earlier

recessions, especially those before 1990.

Unemployment Inflows and Outflows

       Unemployment is one of the oldest and most studied topics in labor economics, so

no discussion of labor market flows would be complete without considering

unemployment inflows and outflows. Figure 5 reports monthly time series from 1976 to




                                             12
2004 for unemployment flows, as percentages of the labor force, based on estimates from

the Current Population Survey (CPS). The figure shows that worker flows through the

unemployment pool rise during recessions, a phenomenon that characterizes earlier

postwar recessions as well (Davis, 1987). Unemployment outflows directly to

employment also rise in recessions, as documented by Blanchard and Diamond (1990)

and Bleakley, Ferris, and Fuhrer (1999), and they remain high during the subsequent

recoveries. Figure 5 also shows that unemployment flows decline by more than a third

from the early 1980s to the mid 1990s. The aging of the labor force is likely a major

factor in this decline, because younger workers engage in much more job shopping (Hall,

1982 and Topel and Ward, 1992). Another factor is the previously discussed trend

declines in the magnitude of job flows and the volatility of business growth rates.

       Unemployment inflows can be broken into four component parts: job leavers

(quits), temporary layoffs, permanent layoffs, and entrants to the labor market. Spikes in

temporary and permanent layoffs are prominent features of recessions in the 1970s and

1980s, but as discussed above, temporary layoffs are much less prominent in the last two

recessions. Unemployment outflows include individuals who find jobs as well as those

who leave the labor force. In both booms and busts, the escape rate from unemployment

to employment (often termed the “job-finding rate”) is high, with at least 20 percent of

the unemployed finding work each month (Bleakley, Ferris, and Fuhrer, 1999; Shimer,

2005). Because unemployment escape rates are high, spikes in job destruction and layoffs

lead to short-lived rises in the unemployment rate unless the spike itself is long lived.

The unemployment escape rate is also highly procyclical, and movements in the




                                             13
unemployment escape rate account for most of the time variation in the unemployment

rate, as recently stressed by Hall (2005) and Shimer (2005).

       CPS data also show that unemployment escape rates are considerably smaller for

workers on permanent layoff than for job leavers and labor force entrants. Recalling our

earlier discussion, workers who are laid off are more likely to enter unemployment and,

conditional on entering unemployment, they have longer unemployment spells. This

effect is amplified during recessions when unemployment escape rates are generally

lower. Accounting for the cyclical behavior of unemployment inflows and outflows

requires a major role for movements in the job separation rate or the propensity of

separated workers to become unemployed (Davis, 2005).



Micro Relations and Aggregate Outcomes

Hires, Separations, and Employment Growth at the Establishment Level

       We turn now to the micro relations between worker flows and establishment

growth and show that they provide considerable insight into the behavior of aggregate

worker flows. Figure 6 displays the cross-sectional relationships of the hires rate and the

separations rate to the establishment growth rate in the JOLTS micro data. The hires and

separation rates are measured on the vertical axis as a percent of employment. The

establishment growth rate is measured along the horizontal axis (also as a percent of

employment). Given that most monthly employment changes are small, we focus the

figure on changes between −30 and 30 percent of employment. The dotted lines

emanating from the origin show the minimum number of hires (for expansions) and

separations (for contractions) required to accommodate the establishment-level




                                             14
employment change. To construct Figure 6, we use pooled monthly data from December

2000 to January 2005 to estimate the mean hires rate and the mean separations rate for

narrow intervals of the establishment growth rate distribution.8 The reader should

interpret the curves as depicting how establishment-level hires and separations vary with

the establishment growth rate. Given that job creation involves establishments with

positive growth and job destruction involves establishments with negative growth, Figure

6 also shows the cross-sectional micro relations between worker flows and job flows.

         Figure 6 yields several noteworthy results. First, hires and separations are highly

nonlinear functions of the establishment growth rate, with sharp kinks and sign changes

at zero. It will be important for the analysis below that this kink occurs in the thick part of

the establishment growth rate distribution. Second, hires increase roughly one-for-one

with job growth at expanding establishments, and separations increase roughly one-for-

one with job loss at contracting establishments. Third, separations rise more sharply to

the right of zero than hires rise to the left of zero. This asymmetry reflects a greater

separation propensity for new hires coupled with a greater need for new hires at

expanding establishments. Finally, hires and separations rates are lowest for zero-growth

establishments, implying that these establishments are stable with respect to both job

growth and worker turnover.

         One can decompose the separations rate in the JOLTS data into quits and layoffs.

Figure 7 displays the relationships of the quit and layoff rates to the establishment growth



8
  Interval widths range from 0.1 percent to 5 percent, with narrower intervals closer to zero. This curve-
fitting method is equivalent to a least squares regression of the hires (separations) rate on a large number of
dummy variables for growth rate intervals that partition the -200 to 200 percent range. In the regression
approach, it is easy to include establishment fixed effects that isolate variation over time within
establishments. In unreported results, we find that the patterns displayed in Figure 6 survive the inclusion
of establishment fixed effects. We have also verified that the same patterns hold in data from the LEHD.


                                                      15
rate in a similar fashion to Figure 6. Since quits and layoffs are components of total

separations, their rates can lie well below the dotted lines emanating from the origin. As

seen in Figure 7, quits account for a bigger portion of separations than layoffs for

expanding establishments, and for establishments that contract by less than 12 percent in

the month. For establishments that contract by more than 15 percent in the month, layoffs

account for most of the separations. Rapidly contracting establishments show a close

relationship of layoffs to job destruction.

       In Davis, Faberman and Haltiwanger (2005), we explore these worker flow

relations in more detail. A key finding is that the patterns depicted in Figures 6 and 7 for

hires, separations and layoffs are quite similar in months with high aggregate growth and

months with negative or low aggregate growth. Put differently, these functions are

reasonably stable in the face of seasonal and cyclical swings in the aggregate growth rate

of employment. In the next two subsections, we develop some implications for aggregate

worker flows of stable nonlinear relationships of hires, separations and layoffs to

establishment-level growth rates.

Accounting for Movements in Aggregate Worker Flows

       Insofar as the worker flow relations in Figures 6 and 7 are stable over time,

movements in aggregate hires, separations, quits and layoffs can be accounted for by

movements in the cross-sectional distribution of establishment growth rates. According

to this view, fluctuations in aggregate worker flows mainly reflect movements in the

cross-sectional density of establishment growth rates, rather than shifts in the worker

flow relations at the micro level. Furthermore, because the micro relations are highly




                                              16
nonlinear, aggregate worker flows are sensitive to the exact location and shape of the

establishment growth rate distribution.

        To be more precise, express the aggregate separations rate at time t as the integral

                                      St = st (n) f t (n)dn

where n indexes the establishment growth rate, f t (n) is the employment-weighted cross-

sectional density of establishment growth rates at t, and st (n) is the time-t micro

separations relation. The integral says that the aggregate separations rate can be

calculated by computing the separations relation at each n, weighting by the value of the

density function at that point, and then integrating over all n. As the integral shows,

movements in aggregate separations arise from shifts in the micro relation st (n) and in

the cross-sectional growth rate density f t (n) .

        If the micro separations relation is stable, however, then the aggregate separations

rate St will closely track

                                          s (n) f t (n)dn,

where s (n) is the time-averaged separations relation displayed in Figure 6. This case is

illustrated in Figure 8, which shows a hypothetical shift in the density function f t (n)

across a stable micro separations relation. The leftward shift in the density function leads

to an increase in the aggregate separations rate in this illustration, because more of the

mass is placed at establishments with high separation rates. Alternatively, if movements

in the aggregate separations rate arise mainly from shifts in st (n) over time, then the

aggregate separations rate will closely track




                                               17
                                                 st (n) f (n)dn,

where f (n) is the time-averaged density function. If neither of these integral

expressions closely tracks St , then the interaction between contemporaneous shifts in

st (n) and f t (n) is essential in accounting for movements in aggregate separations.

Analogous expressions and arguments hold for hires, quits and layoffs.

           How well can movements in f t (n) and the time-averaged micro relations depicted

in Figures 6 and 7 account for movements in aggregate worker flows? Using monthly

JOLTS data, we find that this type of exercise accounts for 38 percent of the movements

in aggregate hires, 42 percent for separations, 11 percent for quits, and 80 percent for

layoffs (Davis, Faberman and Haltiwanger, 2005). The percentage is so low for the

aggregate quit rate, because the micro quits relation varies significantly over time. In

particular, conditional on the establishment growth rate, quit rates tend to rise and fall

with the aggregate growth rate. The story for layoffs is quite different: the micro layoff

relation is highly stable within the JOLTS sample period, so that movements in f t (n)

alone account for the lion’s share of movements in aggregate layoffs.9

Explaining the Cyclical Behavior of Separations, Layoffs and Unemployment Flows

           Figures 6 and 7 also suggest testable hypotheses about the cyclical behavior of

aggregate hires, quits and layoffs and about how they relate to unemployment flows and

the duration of unemployment spells. To see the basic idea, consider again a leftward

shift in the cross-sectional density f t (n) of the sort that occurs when the economy swings


9
    We also find that movements in the   f t (n) account for much of the seasonal and cyclical variation in
aggregate hires and separations in quarterly LEHD data from 1993 to 2003. Analysis of the LEHD data
also indicates that shifts over time in the micro relations are important in accounting for trend movements
in aggregate hires and separations.


                                                       18
from boom to bust. If the micro relations in Figure 7 are reasonably stable, then the

leftward shift in f t (n) causes a rise in the ratio of layoffs to separations. (Stability of the

micro relations is sufficient but not necessary.) Now recall that laid-off workers are

much more likely to enter unemployment than job leavers and, conditional on becoming

unemployed, they have longer spells. So, as the layoff-separations ratio rises, so too does

the propensity of separated workers to become unemployed. In other words, the leftward

shift in f t (n) that accompanies a recession brings more unemployment inflows per

separated worker. In addition, the larger share of layoffs among the persons flowing into

the unemployment pool is a force for lowering the escape rate out of unemployment and

thus increasing the average duration of unemployment spells.

         Figure 9 provides direct evidence on cyclical movements in the ratio of layoffs to

separations. The figure plots the layoff-separation ratio against the employment growth

rate in seasonally adjusted monthly data from two data sources: the Manufacturing Labor

Turnover Survey (LTS) from 1947 to 1981, and JOLTS data for the manufacturing sector

from December 2000 to January 2005. Also shown are fitted relationships from

regressions of the layoff-separation ratio on a quadratic function in the growth rate of

manufacturing employment. The figure shows a strong negative relationship between

employment growth and the percentage of separations that take the form of layoffs. The

fitted curves in Figure 9 also indicate that the layoff-separation ratio is more sensitive to

employment growth at the margin when the percentage employment decline is larger.10




10
  The linear and quadratic terms are individually statistically significant in the LTS data and, when we pool
over industries, in the JOLTS data. When we restrict the JOLTS sample to data on the manufacturing
industry only (as in Figure 9), the linear and quadratic terms are jointly statistically significant, but we
cannot reject the individual null hypothesis that the coefficient on the quadratic term is zero.


                                                    19
This convex shape for the fitted curves is consistent with the micro relations in Figure 7,

which show a greater layoff-quit ratio the more rapidly an establishment contracts.

       What does all this mean for unemployment? Three hypotheses follow directly.

First, unemployment inflows rise in a recession. The rise in unemployment inflows

occurs because the leftward shift in the establishment growth rate distribution brings a

greater number of separations. Second, unemployment inflows rise more than one-for-

one with the recessionary rise in separations. This hypothesis follows because a

recession involves a change in the mix of separations. In particular, Figure 7 tells us that

the ratio of layoffs to quits rises when the establishment growth rate distribution shifts to

the left. The evidence in Figure 9 confirms a major element of this hypothesis. Third, the

escape rate out of unemployment declines during downturns because job losers make up

a larger percentage of unemployment inflows. This compositional change in the pool of

unemployed persons leads to lower unemployment escape rates, and it reinforces the

effects of the general tendency for job-finding rates to decline in recessions.

       Other hypotheses pertain to the distinct responses of aggregate worker flows to

mild and sharp downturns in aggregate employment. A mild (as in shallow) downturn

slides much of the mass in the cross-sectional density along the steep portion of the micro

hires relation, so that aggregate hires respond strongly. The same density shift slides

along the flat portions of the micro layoffs relation, so that layoffs respond weakly. In

contrast, a sharp downturn slides more of the mass along the flatter portion of the hires

relation to the left of zero and the steeper portion of the layoffs relation. Hence, a sharp,

severe downturn involves bigger movements in layoffs relative to hires.




                                              20
        To translate these observations into a characterization of unemployment

fluctuations, use the identity that links the change in the number of unemployed persons

to the job-loss and job-finding rates for workers. In the simple case with a constant labor

force, the discrete-time version of this identity is

                                    ∆U t = lt −1 Et −1 − f t −1U t −1

where l is the job-loss rate for employed persons E , f is the job-finding rate for

unemployed persons U , and t indexes the time period. Because the hires rate drives the

job-finding rate, and the layoff rate drives the job-loss rate, the micro relations for hires

and layoffs in Figures 6 and 7 yield the following two-part hypothesis. First, changes

over time in the job-finding rate dominate unemployment rate movements, more so in

connection with mild contractions in aggregate employment. Second, changes over time

in the job-loss rate account for a bigger fraction of unemployment rate movements in

connection with sharp contractions in aggregate employment. This hypothesis appears to

fit the evidence on postwar U.S. unemployment fluctuations in Shimer (2005).



The 2001 Recession and Subsequent Downturn

        The 2001 recession was relatively mild and brief, officially starting in March and

ending in November according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. At no time

did aggregate employment fall abruptly the way it had in several other postwar

recessions. Yet while the initial shock to the labor market was small from a historical

perspective, its effects lasted well past the end of the recession, with employment losses

continuing until mid-2003. Nonfarm employment did not return to its pre-recession peak

until early 2005.



                                                  21
       We have already discussed many of the labor market characteristics related to this

downturn. Let us now take stock of the downturn and summarize some of its key aspects

from a labor flows perspective. First, as with other recessions, the job destruction rate

jumped in 2001, but the surge was modest, especially compared to the historical pattern

in manufacturing (Figures 2 and 3). Second, a persistent downward drift in the job

creation rate began in late 1999, well before the recession'
                                                           s onset in March 2001, and

continued for 7 quarters after the recession’s end (Figure 2). Hires also drifted downward

during and well after the recession (Figures 4). Third, the layoff rate rose modestly during

the 2001 recession, while the quit rate drifted downward during and after the recession

(Figure 4). Fourth, the flow of workers through the unemployment pool during the 2001

recession rose modestly compared to previous recessions (as illustrated in Figure 5).

Fifth, there was no upsurge in temporary layoff unemployment, a sharp departure from

previous recessions. And finally, research by Faberman (2006) suggests that the latest

downturn is unique in its persistently low rates of job creation, and that these low rates

are part of a longer term decline in the magnitude of job flows.

   Our analysis indicates that some of these features reflect two factors: the mild

character of the recent downturn, and the secular decline in the employment share of

cyclically sensitive goods-producing industries. Mild employment contractions give rise

to little or no increase in the aggregate separation rate, because the cross-sectional

distribution of establishment growth rates remains centered near zero, which is the trough

in the micro separations relation (Figure 6). For a similar reason, the layoff rate and

layoff share of separations also rise modestly in a mild contraction, as implied by Figure




                                             22
7 and confirmed in Figure 9. In turn, a modest rise in layoffs produces a modest rise in

unemployment inflows and outflows.

   Historically, goods-producing industries, especially construction and durable-goods

manufacturing, are more cyclically sensitive than service-producing industries. In

particular, service-producing industries are less prone to the violent contractions that give

rise to spikes in job destruction, layoffs and unemployment inflows. Thus, one

explanation for the mild character of the 2001 and 1990-91 recessions rests on the

shrinking share of employment in cyclically sensitive industries. Because this trend is

likely to continue, we anticipate that future recessions will also tend to have a relatively

mild character and to involve modest surges in job destruction, layoffs and

unemployment inflows. Nonetheless, if one or more large negative shocks causes

aggregate employment to contract sharply, our analysis implies that layoffs and

unemployment inflows will spike sharply, as they did in the deep recessions of the 1970s

and 1980s. In this regard, we emphasize that the nonlinear worker flow relations in

Figures 6 and 7 imply that layoffs and unemployment inflows are more sensitive to

aggregate employment contractions on the margin when the contraction is deeper and

more abrupt.

   The virtual absence of a surge in temporary layoff unemployment in the 2001

recession is a striking departure from past recessions. The 1990-91 recession also

involves a relatively small surge of temporarily laid off workers into the unemployment

pool. In part, these developments reflect the declining share of employment in

construction and manufacturing, two industry groups that have traditionally relied most

heavily on temporary layoffs during downturns, but there is clearly more to the story. It is




                                             23
unclear to us why temporary layoffs were so unresponsive in the 2001 recession. Lacking

a fuller explanation for their behavior in the most recent recession, it is difficult to assess

whether temporary layoffs will figure prominently in future recessions.

        The long downward slide in the job creation rate is another striking feature of the

recent downturn. As we remarked, this slide began more than a year before the 2001

recession and continued for more than a year afterwards. This fact suggests the

downward slide in job creation is part of a longer term development in the U.S. economy,

an inference reinforced by Figures 2 and 3. The factors behind this secular decline in the

magnitude of job flows probably contributed, albeit modestly, to the nearly four-year

slide in private sector job creation rates that commenced in late 1999.

        Aggregate employment did not resume a pattern of sustained growth until the

latter part of 2003. A full explanation for this sluggish employment performance in the

aftermath of the 2001 recession is beyond the scope of our analysis, but a likely

contributing factor is the strength and duration of the expansion in the 1990s. The ratio of

employed persons to the working-age population rose from 61.2 percent at the end of

1991 to 64.7 percent in mid-2000 and then fell back to 62.1 percent in late 2003. The

employment-population ratio in 2000 is an historical peak that reflects a rise of about 9

percentage points since the early 1960s. The large secular increases in the employment-

population ratio and the labor force participation rate may have fully played out by the

late 1990s.




                                              24
Concluding Remarks

       New data sources like the Business Employment Dynamics (BED), the Job

Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) and the Longitudinal Employer-

Household Dynamics (LEHD) program provide a strong empirical foundation for the

flow approach to labor market analysis. These data sources confirm the remarkable

magnitude of labor market flows. Quarterly job creation and destruction rates average

nearly 8 percent of employment in the U.S. private sector. Among workers with job

tenure of at least three months, nearly 11 percent separate from their employers in an

average quarter. And more than 8 percent of the working-age population changes

employer or labor market status from one month to the next. The data also confirm the

lumpy nature of micro-level employment adjustments. Nearly two-thirds of all job

creation and destruction occurs at establishments that shrink or grow by more than 10

percent within the quarter.

       Another key theme to emerge from our study is the link between micro-level

behavior and aggregate outcomes. Our study uncovers highly nonlinear relationships

between worker flows and job flows at the micro level. We show how these micro

relations interact with shifts over time in the cross-sectional distribution of establishment

growth rates to produce recurring cyclical patterns in aggregate labor market flows.

Cyclical movements in layoffs’ share of separations, for example, as well as the

propensity of separated workers to become unemployed reflect distinct micro relations

for quits and layoffs. The distinct micro relations for hires and layoffs imply that the

relative contribution of job-loss and job-finding rates to unemployment movements

depends on whether an employment downturn is shallow or deep.




                                             25
       Other evidence documented in our study also merits attention. First, the

magnitude of job flows has trended downward in recent decades. This trend dates back to

the 1960s in the manufacturing sector, and it appears to hold for the private sector as a

whole in the period since 1990 covered by the BED. On a related note, the private-sector

(gross) job creation rate began declining well before the 2001 recession and continued to

slide until the middle of 2003. Based on the available evidence, the recent downturn

stands out for an unusually long, steady slide in the job creation rate. Second, industries

differ greatly in worker turnover rates and in employer reliance on layoffs as a tool for

adjusting employment levels. These industry differences raise interesting questions about

the role of pay levels, wage flexibility and compensation design in the magnitude and

character of worker flows. New data sources on labor market flows developed by the

Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Bureau of the Census make it possible to explore these

and many other issues.
