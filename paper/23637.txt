Multi Product Firms, Import Competition, and the Evolution of Firm-product Technical Efficiencies

JEL No. D24,F14

                                          ABSTRACT

We study how increased import competition affects the evolution of firm-product technical
efficiencies in the small open economy of Belgium. We observe quarterly firm-product data at the
8-digit level on quantities sold and firm-level labor, capital, and intermediate inputs from 1997 to
2007, a period marked by stark declines in tariffs applied to Chinese goods. Using Diewert (1973)
and Lau (1976) we show how to estimate firm-product quarterly technical efficiencies using a
multi-product production (MPP) function that avoids using single-product (SP) production func-
tion approximations to it. We find that a 0.01 increase in the import share leads to a 1.05% gain in
technical efficiency. This elasticity translates into gains from com- petition over the sample
period exceeding 1.2 billion euros, which is over 2.5% of the average annual value of
manufacturing output in Belgium. Firms appear to be less technically efficient at producing goods
the further they get from their ”core” good and firms respond to competition by focusing more on
their core products. Instrumenting import share - while not important for the signs of the
coefficients - is very important for the magnitudes as the effect of competition increases tenfold
when one moves from OLS to IV. We close by testing the SP approximation to MPP and reject in
eight of twelve industries.

1       Introduction
Economists have shown in a variety of theoretical settings that product-market competi-
tion can provide firms with strong incentives to adopt cost-lowering production processes
in order to remain profitable (see e.g. Holmes and Schmitz, 2010 for a recent review).1
Several important contributions in the empirical productivity literature have established
a strong positive relationship between firm-level total factor productivity growth and in-
creased competition, where the former is given by total firm-level deflated revenue less its
predicted value given input use (see e.g. Olley and Pakes, 1996; Pavcnik, 2002; Bloom,
Draca and Van Reenen, 2016).
    A well-known feature of micro-level production data is that most firms produce mul-
tiple products, which suggests the possibility that within-a-firm different products may
be produced with different levels of technical efficiency.2 We show existence of the multi-
product production function using the seminal contributions of Diewert (1973) and Lau
(1974). The standard single product production function gives the maximal output for
any tuple of inputs (e.g. labor, capital, and intermediate inputs). A multi-product pro-
duction function extends the single product setting by giving the maximal amount of
output achievable of one of the goods the firm produces holding inputs and the levels of
other goods produced constant.
    We observe Belgian manufacturing data that records at the quarterly level firm-
product quantities and production inputs. This existence result is critical for motivating
our firm-product regression of output of one product on total input levels and the output
quantities of all other products produced by the firm. We address the simultaneity of
inputs and outputs with multiple unobserved technical efficiencies per firm by extending
suggestions from Petropoulos (2001) and Ackerberg, Benkard, Berry, and Pakes (2007).
We repeat these regressions with each firm-product treated separately as a dependent
variable to get technical efficiency estimates for every product. A major strength of our
theory is that it neither requires us to assume that multi-product production is a col-
lection of single-product production functions nor does it require us allocate aggregate
firm-level input measures across them.
    Firm-product technical efficiencies allow for more direct identification of the impact
of competition as changes in firm-product technical efficiencies can be directly related
to changes in competitive conditions for that particular 8-digit product category. They
also allow us explore implications of the recent theoretical models of Eckel and Neary
    1

(2010), Bernard, Redding and Schott (2010, 2011), and Mayer, Melitz and Ottaviano
(2014). All of these models have - in equilibrium - higher revenue ”core” products being
produced more efficiently within multi-product firms. Recent extensions of these models
by Dhingra (2013) and Eckel et al. (2015) show how firms respond to trade liberalization
by undertaking R&D activities that lead to greater increases in technical efficiencies or
improved quality depending on the nature orf the good or the initlial level of firm efficiency.
    We explore all of these margins using the Census of Belgian manufacturing data from
1997 to 2007, a period of increased competition with China’s 2001 entry into the World
Trade Organization (WTO). We estimate multi-product production function for 12 in-
dustries separately. Consistent with our production theory the estimated coefficient on
the other-goods-produced quantity index is the correct sign - negative - and significant for
all 12 industries, implying that holding all input levels constant an increase in the firm’s
output index of other-goods-produced leads to a fall in the output of the good under
consideration.
    We calculate the implied estimates of quarterly firm-product technical efficiency and
regress them on last period’s import share while controlling for last period’s technical
efficiency, the product’s ”rank” in terms of revenue generated at the firm, interactions
between the lagged import shares and product rankings, and 8-digit product- and quarter-
specific fixed effects, We instrument for the share using European tariffs on Chinese
imports and an estimate of world export supply (excluding Belgium), as suggested by
Hummels et al. (2014). Consistent with the theory models we find that product rankings
on average lines up one-to-one with the level of technical efficiency with which a good is
produced, with the highest revenue good being produced most efficiently. We find that
a 1% increase in the lagged import share is associated with a 1.05% percent increase in
technical efficiency in the current period for the first and second ranked products, and a
0.65% increase in technical efficiency of all other products produced by the firm. Across
10 robustness checks our estimate of 1.05% ranges between 0.84% up to 1.17%. Without
instruments we find only one-tenth the effect, which is consistent with lagged import pene-
tration being higher in product markets where domestic innovations in technical efficiency
are lower (and vice versa).
    We calculate the long-run changes in the value of produced output due to a change
in the previous period’s input share by multiplying the log change in technical efficiency
by the product’s current revenue, and then scaling it up to account for future output
gains arising due to the high persistence of the technical efficiency process as the AR(1)
coefficient is estimated to be 0.9 across almost all specifications instrumented or not. Of
the 65,242 positive and negative changes the average change is a little over 22 thousand


                                              3
euros, and while most changes are positive almost 35% of the realized changes are negative
because import shares decrease in many cases. There is a tremendous amount of variation
across industries in these changes with some of the biggest negative changes ranging from
-1.8 to -2.5 million euros and the some of the biggest positive changes ranges between 2.2
and 2.5 million euros. Aggregating over the entire sample period the overall gain in the
value of output due to increased import competition is on the order of 1.4 billion euros,
almost 2.5% of average annual value of manufacturing output in Belgium over this period.
    We investigate whether our findings change if we use the single-product (SP) produc-
tion approximation with an input allocation rule based on the good’s revenue share. We
develop a test for whether we can reject the SP production approximation based on our
production function theory and in eight of twelve cases we reject the SP approximation
at the 1% level of significance. When we estimate the impact of competition on technical
efficiency using the SP technical efficiency residuals we find with no other controls the
coefficient is 0.71, not far off from our preferred estimate of 1.05. However, once the inter-
action terms are added between the import share and the product ranking, the coefficient
on the import share drops to 0.45 and is no longer significant, and all of the interaction
terms in this specification are close to zero and insignificant.
    The closest empirical findings to ours are from De Loecker, Goldberg, Khandelwal,
and Pavcnik (2016), who use manufacturing data on multi-product production from In-
dia to estimate the effect of trade liberalization on firm-product marginal costs. They
assume multi-product production is a collection of single-product production functions
and allocate inputs based on input optimization theory. Their setup has one firm techni-
cal efficiency firm common across all products but their model implies separate marginal
costs for each firm-product. Similar to our findings they find that marginal costs are on
average declining as the within-firm product revenue share increases and that increases
in trade liberalization are associated with reductions in product-specific marginal costs.
    The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the detailed quar-
terly firm-product dataset that we build. In Section 3, we explain the methodology that
we use to estimate the multi-product production functions. Section 4 formalizes and pa-
rameterizes the system of simultaneous production equations that comes out of the theory
of Section 3. Section 5 addresses simultaneity, Section 6 presents our results, and Section
7 concludes.


2     Product Quantities, Prices, and Import Shares
We construct quarterly 8-digit firm-product observations on quantities sold, unit prices,
and import shares from 1997–2007 using the Belgian PRODCOM survey and the Belgian

                                              4
data on international trade transactions. We construct quarterly measures of inputs used
in production using the Value Added Tax (VAT) declarations, the National Social Security
database, and data from the Belgian Central Balance Sheet Office.

2.1     The Belgian PRODCOM survey
The first data set is firm-product level production data (PRODCOM) collected by Statis-
tics Belgium.3 The survey is designed to cover at least 90% of production value in each
NACE 4-digit industry by including all Belgium firms with a minimum of 10 employees or
total revenue above 2.5 million Euros.4 The sampled firms are required to disclose monthly
product-specific revenues and quantities sold of all products at the PRODCOM 8 digit
level (e.g. 15.96.10.00 for ”Beer made from malt”, 26.51.11.00 for ”Cement clinker”). We
keep only firms that are classified by NACE as have their principal business activities in
manufacturing. We aggregate revenues and quantities to the quarterly level and calculate
the associated quarterly unit price. We restrict our analysis to the period from 1995-2007
because it is the main period of trade liberalization and because in 2008 PRODCOM
both significantly reduced its sample size and changed its classification system. For each
firm within each 4-digit industry we compute the median ratios of total revenue over em-
ployment, capital over employment, total revenue over materials and wage bill over labor
(average wage), and we exclude those observations more than five times the interquartile
range below or above the median. Finally, we keep only firm-product observations where
the share of the product’s revenue in the firm’s total revenue is at least 5%.
    The Value Added Tax revenue data provides us with a separate check against the
revenue numbers firms report to PRODCOM. Comparing the tax administrative data
revenue numbers with the revenue numbers reported in the PRODCOM data, we find
that between 85% and 90% of firms report similar values for both. We exclude firms if
they do not report a total value of production to PRODCOM that is at least 90% of the
revenue they report to the tax authorities.
    Table 1 shows the average revenue share of products in firms’ portfolios when they
are producing a different number of products at two levels of aggregation (8-digit and
2-digit PRODCOM). We observe 137,453 firm-product observations between 1997-2007.
As has been noted in other product-level data sets the majority of firms produce multiple
products. 5 At the 8-digit level of disaggregation multi-product firms are responsible for

73% of total value of manufacturing output. Most firms produce between one and five
products and these firms account for 75% of the value of manufacturing output. For firms
producing two goods the core good accounts for 77.5% of revenue. Similarly for firms
producing three goods 69.5% of revenue comes from the core product. Even for firms
producing six or more goods the core good is responsible for 49.4% of revenue. At the 2-
digit level of aggregation the fraction of manufacturing revenue coming from single product
firms jumps to 78% and the fraction of manufacturing revenue from firms producing three
or more goods falls to 3%, suggesting firms specialize by typically producing goods within
the same 2-digit category.

2.2     Firm Input Measurements
Quarterly measurements of firms inputs from 1997 to 2007 are obtained from the VAT
fiscal declarations of firm revenue, the National Social Security database, and the Central
Balance Sheet Office database. For tax liability purposes Belgian firms have to report in
their VAT fiscal declarations both their sales revenues and their input purchases. Using
this information we construct quarterly measures for intermediate input use and invest-
ment in capital (purchases of durable goods). For measures of firm employment we use
data from the National Social Security declarations where firms report on a quarterly ba-
sis their level of employment and their total wage bill. To construct a quarterly measure
of capital we start with data from the Central Balance Sheet Office, which records annual
measures of firm assets for all Belgian firms. For the first year a firm is in our data, we
take the total fixed assets as reported in the annual account as their starting capital stock.
We then use standard perpetual inventory methods to build out a capital stock for each
firm-quarter.6
   6
     In order to build the capital stock, we assume a constant depreciation rate of 8% per year for all
firms. Real capital stock is computed using the quarterly deflator of fixed capital gross accumulation. The
initial capital stock in t = t0 , where period t0 represents the 4th quarter of the first year of observation
of the firm, is given by
                                      T otal f ixed assetsf irst year of observation
                              Kt0 =
                                                         PK;t0
The capital stock in the subsequent periods is given by
                                                                  It
                                      Kt = (1 − 0.0194) Kt−1 +
                                                                 PK;t

We assume that the new investment is not readily available for production and that it takes one year
from the time of investment for a new unit of capital to be fully operational.

2.3      The Increase in Import Shares: 1997-2007
The competitive environment in Europe changed significantly over the 1997-2007 period
with the implementation of the Single Market Plan within the European Union in 1993
and with the entry in 2001 of China into the World Trade Organization. We construct
two separate measures of import shares by combining information from the PRODCOM
database with the Belgian international trade data, which contains the quarterly values
and quantities of all imports and exports by Belgium firms at the 8-digit level.7
   Let Mijt denote the quantity of imports of firm i of good j at time t and let Mjt =
   P
          Mijt be the total quantity of imports of product j at the 8-digit level. Let
i ∈ Importers
Qjt denote the total domestic quantity sold of product j. Our first measure of import
penetration is given as:
                                             Mjt
                                 IS1jt =            .
                                          Qjt + Mjt
    Belgium is a small open economy on the North Sea in Central Europe and a signif-
icant fraction of the products entering Belgium are subsequently re-exported to other
countries.8 To account for re-exporting we develop a second measure based on net im-
ports. Continuing to work in quantity units we define net imports at the firm level as
M ax {Mijt − Eijt , 0} where Eijt is the physical quantity of exports of good j from firm i
at time t. Our second import share measure is then given as
                                       P
                                                M ax {Mijt − Eijt , 0}
                                  i ∈ Importers
                       IS2jt =            P                              .
                               Qjt +              M ax {Mijt − Eijt , 0}
                                        i ∈ Importers


    Table 2 shows the changes in import shares at the 8-digit product level between 1997
and 2007 using IS2jt , the ”export-corrected” measure of imports,, which is our preferred
measure. The table shows the percentiles for all 8 digit-products pooled together and by
2-digit industries. The mean change across all products is an increase of 0.043. This mean
hides the tremendous heterogeneity in the underlying changes with most changes positive
but many changes negative. The 10th percentile change is -0.21 and the 90th percentile
is 0.368. The 25th percentile is -0.04 and the 75th percentiles is 0.136. This pattern is
reasonably robust across all of the 2-digit industries and across our two measures of import
competition and it suggests that there is a role for increases and decreases in competition
to both increase and decrease technical efficiencies.

     International trade data are recorded at the CN8 level while PRODCOM is recorded at the PROD-
COM level. We use the concordance tables by Eurostat between nomenclatures and over time.
   8
     For example, Duprez (2014) shows that 30% of Belgian exports in 2010 are re-exports of imported
goods not processed in Belgium.

3      Multi-Product Production
Using Diewert (1973) and Lau (1976) we review the theoretical conditions under which
single- and multi-product production functions exist and their testable implications. We
then explore conditions under which multi-product production can be characterized by a
collection of single product production functions, one for each good produced by the firm.
Readers not interested in the details can jump directly to estimation in section 4.

3.1      Single Product Firms
The primitive of production analysis is the firm’s production possibilities set T. In the
single-product setting T lives in the non-negative orthant of R1+N and contains all values
of the single output q that can be produced by using N inputs x = (x1 , x2 , . . . , xN ), so if
(q˜1 , x̃) ∈ T, then q˜1 is producible given x̃, The single-product production function F (x) -
the production frontier - is defined as:

                                     q ∗ = F (x) ≡ max{q | (q, x) ∈ T }.

    F (x) admits some well-known testable properties. If inputs are freely disposable then
an output level achieved with the vector of inputs x0 can always be achieved with a vector
of inputs x00 where x00 ≥ x0 . This implies the production function is weakly increasing
in inputs (Diewert (1973)). The production function F (x) should also be concave in the
freely variable inputs holding fixed inputs constant and it should be quasi-concave in the
fixed inputs holding the freely variable inputs constant (Lau (1976)).

3.2      Multi-Product Firms
With M outputs and N inputs the firm’s production possibilities set T lives on the
non-negative orthant of RM +N . It contains all of the combinations of M non-negative
outputs q = (q1 , q2 , . . . , qM ) that can be produced by using N non-negative inputs x =
(x1 , x2 , . . . , xN ) so if (q̃, x̃) ∈ T then q̃ = (q˜1 , . . . , q˜J ) is achievable using x̃ = (x˜1 , . . . , x˜N ).
For good j produced by the firm let the output production of other goods be denoted by
q−j . For any (q−j , x), if max{qj | (qj , q−j , x) ∈ T is finite, then Diewert (1973) defines the
multi-product production function as

                              qj∗ = Fj (q−j , x) ≡ max{qj | (qj , q−j , x) ∈ T }.

If no positive output of qj is possible given (q−j , x) then he assigns

                                                Fj (q−j , x) = −∞.

                                                           8
We develop the properties of Fj (q−j , x) under a mix of assumptions from Diewert (1973)
and Lau (1976).
    We follow Lau (1976) and divide outputs and inputs (q−j , x) into those that are variable
v in the short-run and those that are not, denoted by K. We sometimes abuse notation
by expressing (q−j , x) as (v, K) and by writing Fj (v, K).
    We assume the production possibilities set T satisfies the following five Conditions P :

  (i) P.1 T is a non-empty subset of the non-negative orthant of RM +N

 (ii) P.2 T is closed and bounded,

(iii) P.3 If (q, xk , x−k ) ∈ T then (q, x0k , x−k ) ∈ T ∀x0k ≥ xk .

 (iv) P.4 If (qj , q−j , x) ∈ T then (qj0 , q−j , x) ∈ T ∀qj0 such that 0 ≤ qj0 ≤ qj .

 (v) P.5 The sets T K = {v | (v, K) ∈ T } are convex for every K; the sets T v =
     {K | (v, K) ∈ T } are convex in K for every v.

    Conditions (i) and (ii) are weak regularity conditions on T that are not testable.
Condition (iii) is the free disposal condition again but now on inputs conditional on
outputs; it says if you can produce qj given (q−j , x) then you can produce qj with any
  0
x ≥ x. Condition (iv) is a similar free disposal condition on outputs that says if you can
                                                                        0
produce qj given (q−j , x) then you can produce any level of output qj of good j such that
      0
0 ≤ qj ≤ qj given (q−j , x). Diewert (1973) uses these free disposal conditions to prove that
output is weakly increasing in any input holding all other inputs and outputs constant,
and that output of good j is weakly decreasing in any other one output holding all other
outputs and inputs constant.
    Diewert (1973) shows if the production possibilities set T is convex the production
function is concave in the inputs and the negative of outputs, ruling out the possibility
of increasing returns to scale. Condition (v) (Lau (1976)) weakens full convexity on T to
disjoint biconvexity, where convexity holds but only on two subsets of goods, the freely
variable inputs v holding fixed inputs K constant, and the subset of fixed variables K
holding freely variable inputs v constant. This setup allows for the possibility of overall
increasing returns to scale - non-convexities in T - while allowing for decreasing marginal
rates of substitution between inputs/outputs in v or inputs/outputs in K. Convexity in
the flexible inputs/outputs v (conditional on any K) results in a production function that
is concave in v holding K constant. For the fixed inputs/outputs K convexity in K given
v results in the production function being quasi-concave in K given v.
    The following theorem formalizes the above claims.

                                                  9
Theorem 3.1 (The Transformation Function ) Under P.1-P.5 the function Fj (q−j , x)
is an extended real-valued function defined for each (q−j , x) ≥ (0M −1 , 0N ) and is non-
negative on the set where it is finite. Fj (q−j , x) is non-decreasing in x holding q−j con-
stant and non-increasing in q−j holding x constant. Fj (v, K) is concave in v for all K
and quasi-concave in K for all v.


See the Appendix. The existence result of the multi-product production function moti-
vates its estimation, where one quantity is posited as a function of each of the total input
levels used at the firm for all production and each of the other quantities of output pro-
duced by the firm. It also motivates several possible tests of the specification, including
testing to see that inputs enter positively and outputs enter negatively in the production
function.

3.3     Testing Single-product Production Approximations
We propose a test for whether multi-product production can be represented as a collection
of single-product production functions. Total firm inputs used for all goods produced by
any multi-product firm - what is reported in data - must be allocated across the single
product production functions prior to estimation. Foster, Haltiwanger, and Syverson
(2008) use product-output revenue shares to do so and De Loecker, Goldberg, Khandelwal,
Pacvnik (2016) use input optimization. Definition 3.2 states the conditions under which
SPPA holds in the settings of Foster et. al. (2008), De Loecker et. al. (2016), and any
other setting where the input allocation rule adds up to the total input usage reported by
the multi-product firm.

Definition 3.2 (Single-Product Production Approximation (SPPA)) Multi-product
production of M goods can be written as a series of M single-product production functions

                                   fj : R N → R 1          j = 1, . . . , M

if
                                  ∀ (q1 , . . . , qM , x1 , . . . , xN ) ∈ T
there exists input tuples (xj1 , . . . , xjN )M
                                              j=1 satisfying

                                  M
                                  X                          M
                                                             X
                                        xj1 = x1 , . . . ,         xjN = xN
                                  j=1                        j=1

and
                              qj = fj (xj1 , . . . , xjN )     j = 1, . . . , M.

                                                      10
In contrast to the multi-product production function a necessary condition for Definition
3.2 to be satisfied is - conditional on the allocated inputs - (any function of) other own-
firm instrumented outputs should not enter significantly in the single-product production
function. We test the SPPA in our setting by including instrumented outputs in our
single-product production specifications.


4     Functional Forms for Production
We describe simple Cobb-Douglas approximations first for the two-product case and then
for the general multi-product case. Diewert (1973) argues for a trans-log specification
and we add quadratic terns in our robustness section. We also revisit input and output
indices.

4.1    2-Product Case
Dhyne, Petrin and Warzynski (2014) look at the bread and cakes industry in Belgium,
where most firms that produce one also produce the other. With all variables in logs let
qBt and qCt denote the output quantities of bread and cakes respectively, and let lt , kt ,
and mt denote the three inputs labor, capital and materials. Tthe production function
for bread is given as a function of inputs and cake production:

                      qBt = β0 + βlb lt + βkb kt + βm
                                                    b
                                                      mt + γC qCt + εBt                (1)

with the production parameters β b = (βlb , βkb , βm
                                                   b
                                                     ) denoting the percentage change in
bread output due to a one percent change in any one input holding other inputs and cake
output constant. γC is the percent change in bread output that results from increasing
the output of cake by one percent holding overall input use constant. Similarly, the
production function for cakes is given as

                      qCt = β0 + βlc lt + βkc kt + βm
                                                    c
                                                      mt + γB qBt + εCt                (2)

with the production parameters β c = (βlc , βkc , βm
                                                   c
                                                     ), and γB . Inputs and outputs are en-
dogenous in this two equation system. Theorem 3.1 says that all six input coefficients
should be positive and the two output coefficients should be negative.

4.2    M-Product Case
With all variables in logs the general M product system of production equations is given
as:
              qjt = β0j + βlj lt + βkj kt + βm
                                             j       j
                                               mt + γ−j 0q−jt + εjt j = 1 · · · M    (3)

                                             11
                                                                                         j
where q−jt denotes the M − 1 column vector of all other outputs excluding qj and γ−j
denotes the M − 1 row vector of output elasticities for all other products excluding j.
The vector of input production parameters is given by β j = (βlj , βkj , βmj
                                                                             ). Theorem 3.1
                                                                         j           j
says the multi-product production function is only well-defined when β > 0 and γ−j     < 0.
Again all inputs and outputs are simultaneously determined and will therefore need to be
instrumented.

4.3     Input and Output Indices
Most firms produce output using only some of all available inputs recorded in disag-
gregated firm-level input data. An implication of Theorem 3.1 is different input tuples
represent different production functions, but estimating separate production function pa-
rameters for each input tuple places prohibitively high demands on the data. In our data
the same issue arises with multiple outputs as firms in our 2-digit industries produce only
a small number of all possible goods in that 2-digit category.
    In order to circumvent this ”zeros” issue researchers have aggregated across inputs
within firms to create a smaller number of non-zero input aggregates, like capital, inter-
mediate inputs, or labor.9 Suppose there are G goods over which to aggregate denoted
(m1 , . . . , mG ) and let Qmg denote quantity used (or produced) of good mg (we suppress
the time index). The input index q ∗ that is almost universally used weights the quantity
of the input by the input’s price Pmg :
                                                  G
                                                  X
                                        ∗
                                       q = log(         Pmg Qmg ).
                                                  g=1


In place of estimating the G unrestricted coefficients βg g = 1, . . . , G on log(Qmg ) g =
1, . . . , G , only one coefficient β G associated with the quantity index q ∗ is estimated.
                    P Q
Letting sl = PG mPg mQl       the index achieves this parsimony by restricting the elasticity
                  g=1   mg   mg

of output with respect to input l (βl ) to be proportional to β G :

                                     βl = sl ∗ β G , l = 1, . . . G.

so an input with twice the expenditure share of another input in the input category will
have twice the output elasticity. We use this index for all of our inputs.
   9
    Capital is an aggregate mix of the value of different kinds of machines, buildings, and/or vehicles
used by the firm. The intermediate input aggregate sums across all kinds of different materials weighting
by their price. Labor is also sometimes aggregated by weighting the different labor types with their wage
to get the labor aggregate.




                                                   12
   We construct two output aggregators for the production function for qj . One is the
analog to the input aggregator and is given by
                                                    X
                                        ∗
                                       q−j = log(          Pmg Qmg ).
                                                    g6=j


with the only difference being that it excludes good j. The second index sums all units
of the goods and then takes logs:

                                                     XG
                                          ∗
                                         q−j   = log(   Qmg ),
                                                      g6=j

                                Qm
where sl is given as sl =     PG l       , The estimating equations become
                               g=1 Qmg



                  qjt = β0j + βlj lt + βkj kt + βm
                                                 j       j
                                                   mt + γ−j  ∗
                                                            q−jt + εjt   j = 1···M                (4)
                                            j
where now there is only one coefficient γ−j    to estimate for each good j.
    The output-side aggregation restriction is analogous to the input-side restriction. Con-
sider a firm that produces good k and k 0 in addition to producing good j. If we use the
first index then if good k generates twice as much of the firm’s revenue as good k 0 then the
(negative) elasticity of output of good j with respect to good k will be twice as large in
absolute value as good k 0 .10 If we use the index based only on quantities then to produce
an extra unit of good k holding all other inputs and outputs constant the firm would have
to give up twice as much unit-output of good j as it would if it had to produce another
unit of k 0 .


5       Estimation
To address the issue of simultaneity (Marschak and Andrews (1944)) we extend the
Wooldridge (2009) formulation of Olley and Pakes (1995) (OP) and Levinsohn and Petrin
(2003) to the multi-product production setting by allowing for one technical efficiency
shock for each product made by the firm.

5.1       Single-product production setting
In the single product case we have for qt :

                                 qt = βl lt + βk kt + βm mt + ωt + t                             (5)
 10
      Roberts and Supina (2000) use a similar quantity index when they estimate cost functions.



                                                    13
where we have replaced the shock with its two components, i.e. εt = ωt + ηt . t is
assumed to be i.i.d. error upon which the firm does not act (like measurement error or
specification error). ωt is the technical efficiency shock, a state variable observed by the
firm but unobserved to the econometrician. ωt is assumed to be first-order Markov and is
the source of the simultaneity problem as firm observe their shock before choosing their
freely variable inputs lt and mt . kt also responds to ωt but with a lag as investments
made in period t − 1 come online in period t. This assumption allows kt to be correlated
with expected value of ωt given ωt−1 . as ωt−1 - denoted E[ωt |ωt−1 ] - but maintains that
the innovation in the productivity shock ξt = ωt − E[ωt |ωt−1 ] is unknown at the time the
investment decision was made in t − 1 and is therefore uncorrelated with current kt .
    The control function approaches of OP and LP both provide weak conditions under
which there exists a proxy variable ht (kt , ωt ) that is a function of both state variables and
that is monotonic in ωt given kt . The variables may include either investment (OP) or
materials, fuels, electricity, or services (LP) (e.g.). Given the monotonocity there exists
some function g(·),
                                         ωt = g(kt , ht )
allowing ωt to be written as a function of kt and ht . Wooldridge (2009) uses a single index
restriction to approximate unobserved productivity, writing

                                   ωt = g(kt , ht ) = c(kt , ht )0 βω

where c(kt , ht ) is a known vector function of (kt , ht ) chosen by researchers with parameter
vector βω to be estimated. The conditional expectation E[ωt |ωt−1 ] can then be written as

                                E[ωt |ωt−1 ] = f (c(kt−1 , ht−1 )0 βω )

for some unknown function f (·), which Wooldridge (2009) approximates using a polyno-
mial.
    Replacing ωt with its expectation and innovation, the estimating equation becomes

                        qt = βl lt + βk kt + βm mt + E[ωt |ω,t−1 ] + ξt + t                      (6)

For expositional transparency we use only the first-order approximation term for f (·),
which yields our error term

                   [ξt + t ](θ) = qt − βl lt − βk kt − βm mt − c(ht−1 , kt−1 )0 βω               (7)

with the parameters to β = (βl , βk , βm , βω ).11
  11
    The first-order approximation would add another parameter in front of c(ht−1 , kt−1 )0 βω but this
parameter is already subsumed in βω and is therefore not separately identified.

                                                  14
    We formulate the moment condition using materials mt as the proxy but any other
available proxy cited above could also be used here. The only change would be the set
of conditioning variables. For the special case when mt is the proxy a sufficient set of
conditioning variables given as (e.g.) xt = (kt , kt−1 , mt−1 , mt−2 , lt−1 ). Let θ0 denote the
true parameter value. Wooldridge shows that the conditional moment restriction

                           s(xt ; θ) ≡ E[[ξt + t ](θ)|xt ] and s(xt ; θ0 ) = 0

is sufficient for identification of β in the single product case (up to a rank condition on the
instruments).12 In equation (10) a function of mt−1 and kt−1 conditions out E[ωt |ωt−1 ].
ξt is not correlated with kt , so kt can serve as an instrument for itself. Lagged labor lt−1
and twice lagged materials mt−2 serve as instruments for lt and mt .

5.2        Multi-product production setting
In the multi-product case we have a system of Mt output equations:

                   qjt = β0j + βlj lt + βkj kt + βm
                                                  j       j
                                                    mt + γ−j 0q−jt + εjt    j = 1···M                 (8)

We denote the vector of technical efficiency shocks as ωt = (ω1t , ω2t , . . . , ωMt ). Choices of
inputs will now generally be based not only on ωjt but also on all of the other technical
efficiency shocks ω−jt . This frustrates the ”inverting out” of ωt that allows one to express
ωt as a function of kt and a single proxy ht as is done in the single product case.
    We adopt suggestions from Petropoulos (2001) and Ackerberg, Benkard, Berry, and
Pakes (2007) to allow for multiple unobserved technical efficiency shocks. Suppose we
observe (at least) one proxy variable for every technical efficiency shock. Let ht =
(h1t , . . . , hLt ) denote the 1XL vector of available proxies. Each of these variables will
generally be a function of kt and (ω1t , ω2t , . . . , ωMt ) and we write ht (kt , ωt ). If the mul-
tivariate function ht (kt , ωt ) is a bijection in ωt conditional on kt - one-to-one and onto -
then we can invert the proxy variables to get the 1XL vector of functions ωt = g(kt , ht ).
Included in this vector of functions is

                                    ωjt = gj (kt , ht ),   j = 1···M

which then motivates including a function of (kt , ht ) in the estimation to control for ωjt .
   The rest of the estimation proceeds in a manner similar to the single-product case.
We use the same single index restriction to approximate unobserved productivity, so we
have
                            ωjt = gj (kt , ht ) = cj (kt , ht )0 βωj
  12
       The Wooldridge formulation is robust to the Ackerberg, Caves, and Frazer (2015) criticism of OP/LP.

                                                      15
where cj (kt , ht ) is a known vector function of (kt , ht ) chosen by researchers. E[ωjt |ωt−1 ]
is now given as
                              E[ωjt |ωt−1 ] = fj (cj (kt−1 , ht−1 )0 βωj )

for some unknown function fj (·). Again we use only the first-order approximation term
for fj (·) to keep exposition to a minimum.
    Re-expressing in terms of firm’s expectations we have

                    qjt = βlj lt + βkj kt + βm
                                             j       j
                                               mt + γ−j 0q−jt + E[ωjt |ωt−1 ] + ξjt + jt               (9)

with ξjt = ωjt − E[ωjt |ωt−1 ]. The error is

                [ξjt + jt ](θ) = qjt − βlj lt − βkj kt − βm
                                                           j       j
                                                             mt − γ−j 0q−jt − cj (kt−1 , ht−1 )0 βωj

with the new parameters γ−j     added to β j = (βlj , βkj , βm

    An additional key difference from the single product case is the need for instruments
for q−jt , which might either be lagged values of q−jt or inputs lagged even further back. Let
the set of conditioning variables be given as (e.g.) xjt = (q−j,t−1 , kt , kt−1 , ht−1 , mt−1 , lt−1 ).13
Let θ0 denote the true parameter value. The conditional moment restriction

                          s(xjt ; θ) ≡ E[[ξjt + jt ](θ)|xjt ] and s(xjt ; θ0 ) = 0

continues to be sufficient for identification of β as long as a rank condition holds.

5.3        Example: Two product case
In the case of two-product production we have an equation for good 1

                              q1t = βl1 lt + βk1 kt + βm
                                                       1
                                                         mt + γ 1 q2t + ω1t + 1t                      (10)

and an equation for good 2

                             q2t = βl2 lt + βk2 kt + βm
                                                      2
                                                        mt + γ 2 q1t + ω2t + 2t .                     (11)

We use as our two proxies investment and materials, and we write these input demands as
it (kt , ω1t , ω2t ) and mt = m(kt , ω1t , ω2t ). If the bivariate function (it , mt ) is one-to-one and
onto with (ω1t , ω2t ) then this bivariate bijection can be inverted and there exist functions
g1 (·) and g2 (·) such that ω1t = g1 (kt , it , mt ) and ω2t = g2 (kt , it , mt ). For either j we
approximate
                               ωj = gj (kt , it , mt ) = cj (kt , it , mt )0 βωj
  13
       If ht contains mt (lt ) then one would add mt−2 (lt−2 ) to the conditioning set.


                                                      16
where cj (kt , it , mt ) is a known vector function of (kt , it , mt ) chosen by researchers. The
nonparametric conditional mean function for either j is given as

                       E[ωjt |ωt−1 ] = fj (cj (kt−1 , it−1 , mt−1 )0 βωj ) j = 1, 2

for some unknown functions f1 (·) and f2 (·). The error now becomes

    [ξjt + jt ](θ) = qjt − βlj lt − βkj kt − βm
                                               j       j
                                                 mt − γ−j q−jt − fj (cj (kt−1 , it−1 , mt−1 )0 βω ) j = 1, 2.

Let the set of conditioning variables be given as (e.g.) xjt = (q−j,t−1 , kt , kt−1 , it−1 , mt−1 , mt−2 ).
Let θ0 denote the true parameter value. The conditional moment restrictions for each
equation are given as

                 s(xjt ; θ) ≡ E[[ξjt + jt ](θ)|xjt ] and s(xjt ; θ0 ) = 0 j = 1, 2.


6     The link between technical efficiency improvements,
      import competition, and changes in gross output
We estimate three different specifications to investigate the relationship between technical
efficiency andmport shares.. We use the import share net of re-exporting for our preferred
results and show robustness of our results to our second import share index. We also dis-
cuss the mapping of changes import shares into the implied immediate long-term changes
in the value of output due to these changes in competition.
    In our first specification, we regress current firm-product technical efficiency on last
quarter’s technical efficiency and last quarter’s import share, including 8-digit product
indicator variables (νj ), and year-quarter indicator variables (δt ),

                           ωijt = ρ ωij(t−1) + α1 ISj(t−1) + νj + δt + ηijt                          (12)

where ηijt denotes the innovation in the firm-product technical efficiency conditional on
last period’s technical efficiency, import share, and the time and product fixed effects.
    We map changes in import shares into changes in output as follows. Letting ∆ denote
the one period change operator. The units of the technical efficiency term are in the units
of output, so the immediate short term impact on the growth rate of output induced by
∆ISj(t−1) = ISj(t−1) − ISj(t−2) is given by ∆ωijt = α1 ∆ISj(t−1) . An approximation to the
short-term value of this change is then given by

                                          P Qijt ∗ α1 ∆ωijt ,

where P Qijt denotes our approximation to the average revenue from period t − 1 to t
generated by the particular product. Alternative approximations might use last periods

                                                   17
revenue or the simple average of this period’s revenue and last period’s revenue. Finally, if
the AR(1) term ρ is greater than zero but less than one then this suggests approximating
the long-term change in the value of output - denoted ∆V alueijt - as
                                                 P Qijt ∗ α1 ∆ISj(t−1)
                             ∆V alueijt =                              .                         (13)
                                                        (1 − ρ)
Once we have estimates of α1 and ρ we can compute this quantity for every firm-product
in every time period.
    In our second specification we include indicator variables that denote the revenue rank
of the product in the firm’s portfolio to investigate whether within-a-firm product rank
and technical efficiency are correlated. The omitted variable is the core (highest revenue)
                2                                                 3
product, Rankijt   is an indicator for the second product, Rankijt   is an indicator for the
                           4
third product, and Rankijt is an indicator that is equal to one for any product ranked
lower than third. The estimation equation is
                                                      4
                                                      X
                                                                   k
               ωijt = ρ ωij(t−1) + α1 ISj(t−1) +            αk Rankijt + νj + δt + ηijt          (14)
                                                      k=2

Note that ∆V alueijt in this setup is exactly the same as in the first setting above.
    In our third specification we interact these rank indicators with the lagged product-
level import shares in order to investigate whether the competitive effects vary by product
rank. This will also allow for the ∆V alueijt to vary by product rank holding the change
in import share constant. The estimation equation is given as
                                        4
                                        X
                                                                        k
    ωijt = ρ ωij(t−1) + α1 ISj(t−1) +         (αk + α3+k ISj(t−1) ) Rankijt + νj + δt + ηijt .   (15)
                                        k=2

For a product that ranks first the formulation for ∆V alueijt remains as above but for a
product that ranked (e.g.) second in revenues in a firm’s portfolio the new expression for
∆V alueijt is given as
                                          P Qijt ∗ (α1 + α5 ) ∆ISj(t−1)
                         ∆V alueijt =                                   ,                        (16)
                                                     (1 − ρ)
and similarly for other lower ranking products.
    We estimate these equations using ordinary least squares and using instrumental vari-
ables for the import share for a total of six primary specifications. As noted in De Loecker
(2013), we could have estimated all of these parameters in one step along with the produc-
tion function parameters to achieve possible efficiency gains. We did not do so because the
one-step approach does not make apparent the quality of the instruments for the import
share and we want the first stage F-statistic test for weak instruments to be very trans-
parent. Also, in our results most of our production function estimates and our estimates
from the equations above are fairly precise.

                                                    18
6.1      Instruments for Import Share
The import shares that enter into equations 7-9 are functions of the quantities of imports
at the 8-digit level. If these quantities are correlated with the innovations in the firm-
product technical efficiencies after controlling for last period’s technical efficiency shock
and time and 8-digit product-level fixed effects then we need instruments that are cor-
related with the shares but uncorrelated with the innovations. For example, if imports
shares are increasing in 8-digit product categories in which domestic producers are be-
coming less technically efficient then import shares will be negatively correlated with the
technical efficiency shocks, biasing the effect of import competition on technical efficiency
down.
    We use two different instruments. Our first instrument for the import share makes use
of tariffs obtained from the World Bank WITS website.14 Over our sample time period
the ”effectively applied tariffs” on Chinese goods applied by the European Union are
significantly reduced for many goods as a result of China’s entry into the World Trade
Organization.15 The World Bank aggregates tariffs to the HS6 level and we use this same
HS6-level tariff for all 8-digit level goods in that category.16 In the spirit of Hummels et.
al. (2014) we focus more on HS6-level product categories where China has a significant
pre-sample presence by weighting the HS6-level tariffs by the import share of China at
the HS6 level in 1995.
    Our second instrument is also based on Hummels et. al (2014). For each good j at
time t we calculate the total world exports net of those coming from Belgium using the
BACI database from CEPII.17 This variable includes world-wide shocks to export supply
for good j that vary over time and products. Positive shocks to world export supply
for good j - like decreases in transportation costs for the good - should be positively
correlated with the total import share of good j in Belgium. World export supply net
of Belgium exports is a valid instrument for the import share if the world-wide supply
shocks are uncorrelated with the innovations in firm-product technical efficiencies. This
condition is a slightly weaker condition than required by Hummels et al (2014) where
the levels of productivity must be uncorrelated with the world-wide shock holding other

  15
      From the WITS website ”WITS uses the concept of effectively applied tariff which is defined as
the lowest available tariff. If a preferential tariff exists, it will be used as the effectively applied tariff.
Otherwise, the MFN applied tariff will be used.”
   16
      We use conversion tables from Eurostat to identify the HS6-level product category to which each of
our 8-digit level PRODCOM goods’ belongs.

      BACI is the World trade database developed by the Centre d’Etudes Prospectives et d’Informations
Internationales (CEPII). The original data is provided by the United Nations Statistical Division (COM-
TRADE database). BACI is constructed using a harmonization procedure that enables researchers to
link import shares directly to HS 6-digit product disaggregation level.

7      Results
We report multi-product production function estimates and then relate the implied firm-
product technical efficiencies to changes in import penetration. We then map realized
changes in import shares to changes in aggregate manufacturing output. We compare
our findings with what we would find if instead we used the single product production
approximation to multi-output production.

7.1     Estimation at the firm-product level
Our baseline production functions specifications are Cobb-Douglas with parameters as-
sumed constant at the 2-digit industry level. All of our estimates include both 8-digit
product indicator variables and year-quarter indicator variables for all XX quarters from
2000 to 2007.18 We allow for the possibility of two unobserved technical efficiency terms
by using both investment and materials as proxies, and we refer to this estimator as the
Wooldridge-OPLP estimator. The quantity aggregate used in our main specifications is
the log of the (real) total revenues of all the other goods but we also experiment with the
log of total quantities of all other goods.
    Table 3 reports the results of our production function estimates for the 12 largest
2-digit product groups, which represents 1,655 different 8-digit products or 70% of all
products made in Belgium. Our largest product group is food and beverages with 52,573
firm-product-quarter observations while our smallest product group is electrical machinery
with 4,437 firm-product-quarter observations.19 The quantity aggregate coefficient is the
correct sign (negative) and significant for all 12 industries and ranges between -0.082
for paper and -0.145 for apparel. The interpretation for apparel is that - holding all
input levels constant at their current levels - an increase in the firm’s apparel output
index of one percent comes at the expense on average of 0.14 percent of the good under
consideration. On the input side 29 out of 36 coefficients are statistically significant, 35 of
the 36 coefficients have the correct (non-negative) sign, and in the one case where capital
is negative it is not significant.
    In the multi-product setting returns to scale can be defined in a variety of ways de-
pending upon what feature of production is of interest. If we hold the other outputs
constant and increase all inputs by one percent we get a range for most industries of an
  18
    We include the own-product price control suggested in De Loecker et al (2016). Later we show our
main findings are robust to not including price.
 19
    The 2-digit PRODCOM product categories are the same as the European industry codes (NACE).


                                                20
increase in output of the good under consideration between 0.8 and 1, which is the sum of
the coefficients on all three inputs. Above we report that ”returns” to output of a good If
we hold inputs constant and increase the other-output index by one percent ranges from
-0.08 to -0.14. If we increase all inputs and the output index by one percent - the sum of
all coefficients - then we get a range of increases that principally lie between 0.7 and 0.9.
In the single-product case researchers frequently report returns to scale close to one but
comparisons to the multi-product case are frustrated by the fact that they are different
function, the latter of which holds other outputs constant and the former of which does
not.

7.2     The link between technical efficiency and import competi-
        tion
Table 4 presents results from the OLS and IV regressions of technical efficiency on import
shares. All specifications include 8-digit product indicators and quarterly-time indica-
tor variables. Our ten alternative estimates for α1 range from 0.84 to 1.17 and are all
statistically significant.

7.2.1   Non-instrumented Results

In column 1 we regress firm-product technical efficiency (in logs) on lagged firm-product
technical efficiency (in logs) and lagged product import share. Changes in import share are
positively correlated with technical efficiency but the magnitude is small; the estimated
value of α1 from equation (12) is estimated to be 0.10, implying an increase of 10% in the
import share with a 1.0% increase in firm-product technical efficiency. Since the average
change in shares is 4.7%, this OLS estimate suggests import competition has played a
relatively minor role in promoting economic growth.
    We find a high persistence in firm-product technical efficiency over time with a coeffi-
cient of 0.91 for lagged productivity that is statistically significant at 1%. This estimated
value for ρ is approximately the same for all of the OLS and IV specifications we have
estimated and it suggests changes in technical efficiency are long-lived.
    In column 2, we investigate whether the technical efficiency associated with a product
is related to the share of revenue that the product generates for the firm by including
share-rank indicators. The left out good is the firm’s ”core” product, that is, the product
that generates the most revenue for the firm. Products that generate less revenue are not
produced in as technically efficient a manner, with the second ranking product’s technical
efficiency 9.3% less than the core product, the third ranking product 20.9% less, and the
fourth and above ranked products 32.3% less. All rank indicator variables are statistically

                                             21
significant at 1%. While the exact magnitudes of these differences do vary across our OLS
and IV specifications the finding of this ordering of technical efficiencies by share-rank is
very robust.
    Column 3 adds interactions between import share and the rank of the product to test
whether the magnitude of the change in technical efficiency due to a change in import
shares varies by share-rank. The lead coefficient α1 is still small at 0.12 and significant
at 1% and slightly higher than in the previous specifications, where it represented the
average effect across all products. The interactions between import share and product
rank are all negative, with -0.01 for the second product (but not statistically significant),
-0.03 for the third product (significant at 1%) and -0.12 for products ranked more than
3 (significant at 1%). Thus the OLS results suggest changes in import shares impact the
first, second, and third products similarly but do not affect products ranked higher than
three.

7.2.2   Instrumented Results

Columns 4, 5, and 6 are the IV analogs to columns 1-3. They use the same price-
weighted quantity index in the W-OPLP production function estimation. Our first-stage
F-statistics from the regressions of import shares on our two instruments reject the hy-
pothesis of weak instruments at the 1% level in all three IV regressions.
    Column 4 shows estimates from the regression of technical efficiency on last period’s
technical efficiency and the lagged instrumented import share. Relative to column 1 the
estimate of α1 increases almost ninefold from 0.10 to 0.87 and is significant at the 10%
level. When we add the share-rank indicators in column 5 the estimate of α1 goes up
to 0.99 and is significant at the 5% level. When we add the interactions of the share-
rank indicators with the instrumented lagged import share in column 6 the estimate of
α1 climbs to 1.05 and remains significant at 5%. The increase from 0.12 to 1.05 when
we move from OLS to IV is consistent with lagged import penetration being higher in
product markets where domestic innovations in technical efficiency are lower (and vice
versa).
    In column 6 the coefficients on the share-rank indicators decrease only a bit relative
to OLS. However the coefficients on the interactions tell a different story from OLS as all
products - regardless of the product revenue ranking - have technical efficiency increasing
in response to increases in import competition. A 1% increase in the lagged import share
is associated with a 1% percent increase in technical efficiency in the current period of
both the first and second ranked products and a 0.65% increase in technical efficiency of
all other products produced by the firm. All three coefficients are statistically significant


                                             22
at 1%. Recall that this impact is only the short-term effect because the estimated AR(1)
coefficient is 0.89 and strongly significant.
    Column 7 presents the first of ten robustness checks. We estimate the production
function parameters with the W-OPLP estimator but using the unweighted quantity
index instead of the price-weighted quantity index. The estimated coefficient on α1 drops
slightly to 1.01 and remains significant at the 5% level. The remaining point estimates
are very similar to those from column 6. Table 5 and table A1 contain the other nine
robustness checks. The estimates for α1 range from 0.84 to 1.17 and seven of the nine
are significant at the 5% level (the other two are significant at the 10% level). For the
most part the other coefficients are very similar across these specifications. Readers not
interested in these details can skip directly to Section 7.3.
    For comparison Column 1 of table 5 reprints the results from our preferred specification
(column 6 of table 4). All nine specifications use the price-weighted quantity index, and
except for columns 2 and 3, all of these specifications estimate the production function
parameters with the W-OPLP estimator. In column 2 we estimate the production function
but address simultaneity using just materials as the proxy (the Wooldridge-LP estimator).
We find an estimate of α1 of 1.06. In column 3 we ignore simultaneity and use OLS to
estimate the production function parameters. We find the estimated coefficient is 0.84,
the lowest of all of our alternative estimates. Column 4 uses our alternative measure of the
import share that does not adjust for re-export. For this specification we estimate a value
of α1 of 0.93. Column 5 does not include the product’s output price in the estimation
of the production functions and we find an estimate of 0.89 for α1 . Column 6 allows
the price-weighted quantity index and its squared value to enter the production function
during estimation, as argued by Diewert (1973), and the coefficient increases to 1.17, the
largest estimate of α1 across all eleven specifications.
    We currently pool single and multi-product firms. Column 1 of table A1 reports results
for only multi-product firms and Column 2 uses both single- and multi-product firms -
the full sample - but includes an indicator variable for multi-product firms in the import
share regression. The respective α1 ’s are 1.08 and 1.11 and both are significant at the 5%
level.
    Firms that are active in international markets may respond differently to increases in
import competition relative to those that only sell in the domestic market. Column 3 of
table A1 includes two indicator variables, one for whether the firm producing the product
imports and one for whether they export. The estimate of α1 is 1.02 and significant at
the 5% level. Column 4 of table A1 includes two indicator variables, one for whether the
firm imports goods in the same 8-digit category as the good it is producing and one for


                                            23
whether it exports that particular good. Both variables are lagged by one quarter. The
estimate is 1.01 and again significant.20

7.3     Changes in the Value of Output due to Changes in Import
        Competition
Equation 16 shows how we translate changes in import shares into changes in the value
of manufacturing output for any product j. The expected percentage change in technical
efficiency in the current period due to a change in the lagged import share is given by
multiplying our preferred estimate of α1 of 1.05 by the change in the lagged import share
for that 8-digit product category. We multiply this expected change in technical efficiency
in the current period by the current revenue of the product to estimate the total expected
change in product revenue this period. The AR(1) coefficient of 0.89 implies these changes
are highly persistent and we account for future gains in technical efficiency by scaling up
                                                  1
this estimated change in current revenue by 1−0.89    . By design the total lifetime change
in revenues will be positive in years when the lagged import share increases and negative
when the import share decreases.21
    Table 6 reports the entire distribution of 65,242 changes in the long-run value of
produced output due to changes in the previous period’s input share from 1997-2007.
There is a tremendous amount of dispersion in the changes in the value of output due to
changes in import shares. Almost 35% of the realized changes are negative because import
shares decrease in many cases (see Table 2). On average changes in prior year’s input share
leads to an increase in the long-run value of output of over 22 thousand euros. Across
industries the largest average change is 96 thousand euros in Electrical Machinery followed
by Apparel (75 thousand) and Basic Metals (71 thousand). The median changes in import
shares are close to zero and this leads to the median changes in the value of output to
be close to zero across all 11 2-digit industries. Both the positive and negative changes
can be very large for products with the biggest revenues, as in industries like Machinery
and Equipment, Basic Metals, and Electrical Machinery. Across these industries the 10th
percentile of the distribution in these industries ranges between -1.8 to -2.5 million euros
and the 90th percentile changes ranges between 2.2 and 2.5 million euros.
    In table 7 we aggregate the positive and negative changes separately across industries
in each year from 1997 to 2007. On average the value of increased output due to increases
  20
     We also find two additional side results in line with previous papers in the literature. Firms that
import appear to be slightly more efficient at making their goods (column 3), and exported goods appear
to be produced slightly more efficiently as well (column 4).
  21
     We did not have enough variation to allow for precise estimation of different coefficients on increases
and decreases in import shares but we could not reject that they were significantly different from one
another.

                                                    24
in import shares ranges from 1.1 to 1.4 billion euros in any given year and the decreases
range from -1.1 to -1.4 billion euros. These numbers are not small relative to the overall
average annual total value of real output in Belgian manufacturing of 55 billion euros.
The net changes in every year are positive except for 1997 and most years range from
between 100 and 300 million euros. Aggregating over the entire sample period the overall
gain in the value of output due to increased import competition is on the order of 1.4
billion euros, almost 2.5% of average annual output.

7.4    Single-product production approximation to multi-product
       production
We investigate whether our findings change if we use the single-product (SP) production
approximation. We allocate inputs to the SP production functions in proportion to the
good’s revenue share. We estimate the SP production functions with results reported in
table A3. We then calculate the implied technical efficiencies and rerun our main import
share regressions from table 4 and report these results in table 8.
    If we think of the multi-product setting as generalizing the SP approximation, the SP
approach will add measurement error to the estimates of technical efficiency. Our results
are largely consistent with this hypothesis as many specifications have coefficients that
appear to be attenuated towards zero relative to our preferred specifications in table 4.
The coefficients on the lagged import share in the OLS specifications are about half of their
magnitude at 0.05 and 0.06 down from 0.10 but continue to be statistically significant..
Almost all of higher-order product terms are close to zero and are not significant in any
of the OLS specifications.
    Columns four through six instrument the import share. In column four with no other
controls and also in column five with only the product-rank indicator variables the co-
efficient is 0.71 and significant at the 10% level. So despite possible measurement-error
attenuation in these two specifications the SP approach accounts for almost 70% of the
changes we find with our preferred specification (that coefficient is 1.05). However, once
the interaction terms are added between the import share and the product ranking, the
coefficient on the import share drops to 0.45 and is no longer significant. All of the
interaction terms in this specification are close to zero and insignificant.
    We close by testing whether we can reject the SP production approximation using the
test suggested in Section 3.3. We add the quantity index to the SP specification from table
A3 to test for significance and report results in table A2. We find the point estimates across
all twelve industries for labor, materials, and capital are virtually unchanged from table
A3. However, in eight of twelve cases the instrumented quantity index enters significantly


                                             25
at the 1% level, rejecting the single product approximation.


8    Conclusion
We develop a new approach to estimate firm-product technical efficiencies for multi-
product firms using detailed quarterly data on inputs and on the physical quantities
of goods produced by firms. We use our estimates of 8-digit firm-product technical effi-
ciencies to study the link between productivity and import competition. Our results show
a strong positive relationship between firm-product technical efficiency and import com-
petition, pointing towards the disciplinary effect of competition on efficiency. Over the
sample period we find an aggregate effect on Belgian manufacturing of over $1.2 billion.
Consistent with several theory models we find that firms are most technically efficient at
the goods that generate them the most revenue. We also find that while all products’
technical efficiencies benefit from increased competition, the ”core” products experience
the biggest increases in response to increased competition.
    While our main finding is that increased import competition leads to higher productiv-
ity, we do not identify the exact channel through which firms generate these productivity
gains. Therefore, our results as such provide indirect evidence in favor of recent exten-
sions of multi product firms models that suggest that firms adapt their innovation strategy
when facing trade liberalization (see e.g. Dhingra, 2013; Eckel et al., 2015). We leave this
line of investigation for future research.

(1976).
Proof of Theorem 3.1
Under P.1-P.5 Fj (q−j, x) is
(1a) non-decreasing in x
Let (q−g , x) ≥ (0M −1 , 0N ) and suppose qg∗ = F (q−g , x) is finite. Then (qg∗ , q−g , x0 ) ∈
T ∀x0 ≥ x by free disposal. But F (q−g , x0 ) ≥ qq∗ = F (q−g , x).
and
(1b) non-increasing in q−g
Let (q−g , x) ≥ (0M −1 , 0N ) and suppose qg∗ = F (q−g , x) is finite. Then (qg∗ , q−g , x) ∈ T. Then
        0             0                                             0                         0
(qg∗ , q−g , x) ∈ T ∀q−g ≤ q−g by free disposal. Then qg∗ ≤ F (q−g , x) ≡ max(qg | (qg , q−g , x) ∈
T. #



Under P.1-P.5 Fj (v, , x) is

(2a) concave in v ∀ K
Suppose qj∗ = F (vj , K) j = 1, 2. Then (qj∗ , vj , K) ∈ T j = 1, 2.
By convexity (λ q1∗ + (1 − λ)q2∗ , λ v1 + (1 − λ)v2 , K) ∈ T 0 < λ < 1.



                      T hen q ∗ = F (λ v1 + (1 − λ)v2 , K)
                                 = max(q | (q, λ v1 + (1 − λ)v2 , K) ∈ T )
                                 ≥ λ q1∗ + (1 − λ)q2∗
                                 = λ F (v1 , K) + (1 − λ)F (v2 , K)




(2b) quasi-concave in K ∀ v
Suppose qj∗ ≡ F (v, Kj ) f or j = 1, 2. Then (qj∗ , v, Kj ) ∈ T f or j = 1, 2. Let q̃ =
min(q1∗ , q2∗ ). Then (q̃, v, Kj ) ∈ T f or j = 1, 2. Then convexity of T in K ∀v implies
(q̃, v, λK1 + (1 − λ)K2 ) ∈ T f or0 < λ < 1 With Kλ ≡ λK1 + (1 − λ)K2 we have

                        qλ = F (v, Kλ ) ≥ q̃ = min(F (v, K1 ) , F (v, K2 ).

     Note: This table reports results for the estimates in column 6 of table 4 using four alternative methods of estimating the production
     function estimates and the implied technical efficiency residuals. As before all production function specifications include quarter-year
     and product dummies and a constant term (not reported). Column (1) uses the same specification as column 6 in table 4. Column
     (2) uses the TFP measure from the Wooldridge-Levinsohn&Petrin estimator with price control. Column (3) uses ordinary least squares
     estimates of TFP. The next four columns use the Wooldridge OPLP estimator used in table 4. Column (4) uses an import share measure
     in quantity and that does not control for reexport. Column (5) uses the TFP estimates from the Wooldridge-OPLP estimator that does
     not include the product’s output price as an control. Column (6) includes a quadratic term for the revenues of the other goods produced
     by the firm when estimating the production function parameters. Robust standard errors are in parentheses. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, *

     Note: The table uses the estimates in column 6 in table 4 along with the realized changes in import shares to calculate the estimated
     change in output value. The change in output value is calculated by first multiplying the change in firm-product technical efficiency by
     the coefficient on import share to get the change in the growth rate in output due to the change in the import share. In order to account
                                                                                                                                1
     for the time series persistence in technical efficiency implied by the AR(1) term we scale additional value in output by 1−ρ̂ , where ρ̂ is
     the estimated value of the AR(1) coefficient from column 6 of table 4.

     Note: Column (1) considers only multi-product firms. Column (2) considers all firms but adds an indicator variable for multi-product
     firms when estimating the production function parameters. Column (3) includes two indicator variables, one for whether the firm is an
     importer, the other for whether the firm is an exporter. In column (4), the import and export indicators are on if the firm is exporting
     or importing that specific product. All specifications include quarter-year and product dummies and a constant term (not reported).
     Robust standard errors are in parentheses. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.
