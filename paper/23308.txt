Do Payroll Tax Breaks Stimulate Formality? Evidence from Colombia’s Reform
Adriana Kugler, Maurice Kugler, and Luis Omar Herrera Prada
NBER Working Paper No. 23308

                                          ABSTRACT

Alternative work arrangements have grown rapidly around the world. In Latin America, these
alternative work arrangements have long been part of the labor market and have continued to
grow. The informal sector grew rapidly in Latin America over the past few decades comprising
up to half of the working population in many countries. Some attribute the growth in alternative
work arrangements and informality to regulations and taxes, while others argue that it is precisely
the lack of enforcement of regulations that allows unprotected employment arrangements to
flourish. We examine whether reducing taxes associated with employment stimulates formal
sector employment. We exploit the fact that the Tax Reform introduced in Colombia in 2012
affected only certain types of workers and not others. In particular, workers earning less than 10
minimum wages (MW) and self-employed workers with more than 2 employees experienced a
reduction of payroll taxes of 13.5% between 2013 and 2014. We use the Colombian Household
Surveys, Social Security records and the Monthly Manufacturing Sample to conduct difference-
in-difference analyses of the reform. We find evidence of increased formal employment for the
affected groups after the reform using all three datasets. We find that the probability of formal
employment and the likelihood of transitioning into registered employment increased for the
affected groups after the reform. We also find that the level and share of permanent employment
relative to temp employment grew after the reform for those earnings less than 10 MW. The
results are greatest for those in smaller firms and those earnings close to the MW.

1.     Introduction

       Latin America and other developing regions depend on payroll taxes to finance pensions,

disability and maternity benefits, and worker’s compensation that compensates those with

workplace injuries. In the case of Colombia, payroll taxes are also used to finance the National

Vocational Training Service (Servicio Nacional de Aprendizaje, SENA, in Spanish) and the

Colombian Institute for Family Welfare (Instituto Colombiano de Bienestar Familiar, ICBF, in

Spanish). Until very recently, mandatory contributions in Colombia were close to the European

median, where the payroll tax rate was about 40 percent (Gill et al., 2005). However, payroll

contributions are much higher compared to countries with relatively less regulated labor markets,

such as the United Kingdom and the United States, where contributions have fluctuated between

15 and 20 percent of total compensation (OECD, 2015).

       In Latin America and continental Europe, high payroll taxes increase the labor costs that

companies have to pay, thus discouraging companies from hiring workers. Nonetheless, from a

theoretical perspective, the impact of payroll taxes on the labor market is ambiguous. On one

hand, when workers value the benefits paid for with payroll taxes as much as the amount they

contribute, increases in payroll taxes are fully passed through from companies to employees in

the form of lower salaries, with a neutral effect on unemployment. Consequently, in this case,

companies do not experience increases in their overall labor costs. On the other hand, if wages

are not fully flexible or if payroll taxes fund services that do not directly benefit all employees

(such as SENA or ICBF), then wages would not absorb the total payroll taxes as lower wages

and there would be an increase in labor costs and a reduction in employment.

       Empirical studies from various countries show mixed evidence regarding the impact of

payroll taxes on employment and wages. For instance, Gruber and Krueger (1991) and Gruber

                                                2
(1994) find neutral effects on employment in the United States (i.e., full pass-through of taxes

onto wages). Gordon (1972) also finds full pass-through taxes onto wages and no impact on

employment in the United States. Nevertheless, Vroman (1974) and Harmermesh (1979) find

that there is partial pass-through with non-neutral effects on wages and employment. Kaestner

(1996) finds that there is no pass-through from payroll taxes onto wages for young workers in the

United States.

       In most Latin American countries, minimum wages are relatively high and constitute a

binding restriction on formal sector employment (see, for example, Maloney et al., 2004). As a

result, in this context, it is not feasible to pass-through higher payroll taxes to employees as

lower wages, so it is more likely that increases in payroll taxes reduce formal employment.

Gruber (1997) finds that a reduction in payroll taxes is completely passed-through to employees

in the form of higher wages, without an impact on employment, in Chile. By contrast, Kugler

and Kugler (2009) find that a 10 percent increase in payroll taxes reduces manufacturing

employment by five percent among the least skilled workers. In this context, the increase in

payroll taxes was not transferred to employees through lower wages. This finding is consistent

with evidence provided by Maloney et al. (2004) that the minimum wage was binding in

Colombia at the time.

       In the current study, we explore the effects of the recent drop in the payroll tax rate

associated with the Tax Reform, Law 1607, implemented at the end of 2012. The goal of this

reform was to increase employment and, in particular, formal employment. As a result, in this

study we focus on evaluating the impact of the reform on formal employment. Although the

effects of changes in payroll taxes have already been studied in the Colombian context, it is

important to study the effects of this particular reform for two reasons. First, the effects of

                                               3
changes in payroll taxes are likely to be asymmetric depending on whether there is a hike or a

decline. Due to a binding minimum wage, it is more feasible for a reduction in payroll taxes to be

passed-through to employees as higher wages than for an increase in payroll taxes to be passed-

through to employees as lower wages. On the other hand, changes in the tax rate would have

larger effects on employment if the levied taxes were used to finance services that do not directly

benefit contributors and that, as a result, cannot be passed-through to workers’ wages.

       In Colombia, the link between benefits and contributions was relatively weak before the

introduction of Law 1607. This made workers less willing to accept the lower wages offered by

employers in response to increases non-wage labor costs. As Kugler and Kugler (2009) show this

implies that there is less formal employment and, consequently, it becomes harder to find a

formal sector job. Kugler and Kugler (2009) provide evidence that reductions in payroll taxes –

often proposed to stimulate demand for low-wage labor – are an effective measure to reduce

unemployment and informality among young and low-skilled workers, especially if the tax cuts

are focused on indirect benefits (like SENA and ICBF).

       The analysis in this paper examines the effects of Law 1607, which reduced payroll taxes

for those with less than 10 minimum wages and for self-employed who hired two employees or

more. These two groups that qualify for payroll tax reductions under the reform. The analysis

exploits the fact that specific groups of employers and employees were affected by the reform to

estimate the impact of the reduction in the payroll tax using a quasi-experimental evaluation

design. The analysis consists of comparisons of the following two pairs of groups: (i) workers

with fewer and more than 10 minimum wages, before and after the reform; and (ii) self-

employed workers with two or more employees, and others who either are not self-employed or

who are self-employed but hire fewer than two employees, before and after the reform.

                                                4
       Our analysis uses three different data sets to examine the effects of the reform. In

particular, we analyzed data from: the Household Surveys collected by the Colombian National

Department of Statistics (Gran Encuesta Integrada de Hogares or GEIH, in Spanish),

administrative data from the Social Security System (Planilla Integrada de Liquidación de

Aportes or PILA, in Spanish), and survey data from the Monthly Manufacturing Sample (MMS).

The data from the Household Surveys and from the Social Security records enable us to examine

individual-level data to analyze effects on levels and transitions to the formal sector. The data

from the MMS allow us to examine the effects of the reform on permanent employment at the

establishment-level.

       The results from the three data sets consistently show positive effects of the reform on

formal employment. The results from the Household Surveys show an increase of 8.5 percentage

points or a 15 percent increase in the probability of having a signed contract, and an increase of

12.4 percentage points or a 32% increase in the probability of contributing to the pension and/or

health schemes for those with less than 10 minimum wages after the reform. The effects are

bigger among smaller companies. Likewise, the results using Social Security records show an

increase of 3.5 percentage points or 15.2 percent in the probability of going from informality or

unemployment to formality for those paid under 10 minimum wages after the reform.

       The results also show small positive effects for self-employed workers with more than

three employees using both the Household Survey and Social Security data. The probability of

employment and of transitioning to a job with health benefits and/or pensions increases by one

and sixteen percentage points after the reform for self-employed workers with more than three

employees.




                                                5
       The results using the Manufacturing Sample also show that the reform increased

permanent employment in the manufacturing sector. The evidence shows that manufacturing

establishments that pay less than 10 minimum wages on average increase their number of

permanent employees by 46 workers. They also show that the percentage of permanent workers

employed by those establishments increased by 10 percent following the reform. In general, the

reform is associated with an increase in formal employment for individuals and for companies

with less than 10 minimum wages after the reform. The effects are robust to different

specifications and are greater among smaller companies.

2.     Changes in the Structure of Payroll Taxes

       About four years ago, Colombia introduced important legislative changes to reduce

payroll taxes. The most important reform in changing payroll taxes since the reforms of the

1990s was the introduction of Law 1607. This reform reduced payroll taxes for workers with low

wages, who a priori should had experienced greater distortions and had fewer formal job

opportunities due to the higher labor costs before the reform.

       A couple of years before, in 2010, the First Employment Law reduced payroll taxes for

employers hiring young workers and others entering the labor force. As a result, in this analysis

we try to distinguish the First Employment Law effects from those of the more expansive

reforms introduced by Law 1607.

2.1.   Law 1607 of 2013

       The tax reform introduced with Law 1607 included exemptions to employer payroll taxes

used to finance training programs, family and childcare programs, and compulsory health

benefits. While the law was approved in 2012, starting on May 1st, 2013, exemptions were first


                                                 6
applied to the contributions going to training programs (SENA, 2%) and family and childcare

programs (ICBF, 3%), for a total exemption of 5% in payroll taxes. Importantly, neither training

nor family and childcare programs are typically used and benefit all of those who contribute

payroll taxes to these programs, so the link between the benefit and the contributions made to

these programs is weak.

       Beginning on January 1st, 2014, the exemptions were also applied to employer

contributions to the Contributory Health Scheme (of 8.5%), first introduced in 1993 by article

204 of Law 100. In our analysis, we evaluate the differential impact on formal employment for

workers exempted and not exempted from taxes by the new law starting in 2013.

       According to Law 1607, issued by decree 862 in April 26, 2013, the exemption on

payroll taxes applies to two groups of individuals. First, it applies to all legal, contributing for-

profit entities paying taxes and that have in their payroll workers who individually accrue fewer

than ten (10) monthly, legal, minimum wages. Second, it applied to all self-employed individuals

who employ two or more workers. The law also indicates those individuals who do no benefit

from the exemptions. These include legal entities that do not pay income taxes, such as unions,

community action boards, horizontal joint ownership boards, and, in general, those listed in

articles 22, 23, 23-1, and 23-2 of the National Tax Code. It also includes legal, non-profit

entities, such as cooperatives, employee funds, associations, corporations, and foundations. In

addition, it includes Free Tax Zones established by December 31st, 2012 or with pending

applications at that time as well as users of previous Free Tax Zones that have qualified or could

qualify in the future to these zones and that are subject to the special income tax rate of 15%

established by the first subsection of article 240-1 of the National Tax Code. Finally, it includes




                                                 7
all employees who earn more than 10 minimum wages and self-employed individuals who

employ fewer than two employees.

       At the same time, the Colombian government introduced its Plan to Increase Productivity

and Employment or PIPE program (Plan de Impulso a la Productividad y el Empleo in Spanish),

which intended to replace the revenues lost from the exemptions for SENA, ICBF and public

health insurance through other sources of funding. To off-set the revenue losses from the

exemptions, the tax reform included an equity income tax or CREE (Impuesto sobre la Renta

para la Equidad in Spanish). The CREE rate was 9% starting in 2013. In 2015, the CREE

increased by an additional 5%, which has continued to increase by 1% every year until 2018.

This percentage is distributed as follows: 1.4 percentage points go to SENA, 2.2 percentage

points go to ICBF, and 4.4 percentage points go to the social security health scheme. The

additional 1.2 percentage point charged during the first three years was devoted to financing

public institutions of higher education (40%), the subsidized health scheme (30%), and social

investments in the agricultural sector (30%). Importantly, the equity income tax is levied on

profits and, thus, tends to affect the most profitable firms, which are also the largest firms.

       In conclusion, beneficiaries of the payroll tax exemptions instituted by Law 1607 from

2012 are CREE contributors who hire workers with less than 10 minimum wages and self-

employed individuals who hire two or more workers. The reduction of the employer payroll tax

rates for SENA and ICBF by 5% and of health contributions by 8.5% introduced by the reform

intends to not only reduce informal employment, but also to generate new formal jobs. The

reason why employment creation in the formal sector would be incentivized is that payroll taxes

which are associated with formal employment would fall. Even though the equity income tax




                                                  8
was introduced, this tax is on profits and not associated with employment thus de-linking the

new taxes from employment.

2.2.   Law 1429 from 2010

       Before the implementation of the Tax Reform, the First Employment Law was introduced

in 2010. This reform also reduced the labor costs generated by payroll taxes to certain types of

recently hired workers.

       The First Employment Law allows companies to deduct from their income tax

contributions the payroll tax payments destined to finance services not directly benefiting all

their employees, including tax contributions to finance SENA, ICBF, as well as contributions to

the Solidarity Guarantee Fund or FOSYGA (Fondo de Solidaridad y Garantias in Spanish),

which subsidizes health services for the poorest, and the contributions to the Minimum Pension

Guarantee Fund or SGP (Sistema General de Pensiones in Spanish) which subsidizes pensions

for the poorest. These deductions applied to companies that hired: workers younger than 28 years

of age; female heads of households; individuals who have been displaced or are in the process of

reintegration; individuals who are disabled; women older than 40 years of age, and workers

earning less than 1.5 minimum wages. Although this law also covers pensions, the First

Employment Law is more limited in the number of individuals it covers relative to the payroll

tax reform. This is because it is only valid for new hires covering young workers, women over

40, and those who earn less than 1.5 times the minimum wage, as opposed to the 10 minimum

wage threshold in the tax reform.

       In addition, the benefits only apply to new workers. The law defines new workers as

those who appear for the first time in the administrative social security records, or those who


                                               9
were previously in the system as self-employed workers. This prevents companies from trying to

claim exemptions for workers who are laid-off and rehired or new hires who are simply

replacing previously hired workers.

       To benefit from the exemptions of Law 1429, employers must also fulfill the following

requirements established by the law. Companies have to be formally registered and have to hire

the type of workers described by the law. Also, they have to increase their payrolls and not

replace old personnel. That is, the number of employees must increase relative to the number of

employees that were contributing in the previous year, and the total value of payroll must

increase by the month of December of the previous year in which the discounts are applied.

       In the empirical analysis presented in this paper, we will focus on the impacts of the Tax

Reform (Law 1607) by exploiting the fact that the reform covered certain groups but not others.

Moreover, we will attempt to disentangle the effects of the tax reform from those of the First

Employment Law (Law 1429) since the latter preceded the tax reform and some of the coverage

of the latter may have overlapped somewhat with Law 1607.

3.     Data

3.1.   Household Surveys

       Colombia collects cross-sectional data on labor force participation, earnings, and quality

of life indicators of households since the 1960s. However, since the start of this data collection

process and up to 2006, data were only available for 13 cities and their metropolitan areas.

Starting in 2006, the entire survey covers 24 cities and their metropolitan areas. In addition, the

modules on labor markets and household earnings also cover rural sectors.




                                                10
       The purpose of this data collection effort is to provide information about the size and

structure of the labor force (employed, unemployed, and inactive) as well as of socio-

demographic characteristics of the population. Consequently, the Household Surveys allow to

classify the population according to the concepts detailed by the International Conference of

Labor Statisticians (CIET, in Spanish); to calculate the main labor market indicators

(participation rate, occupation rate, unemployment rate, etc.); to measure general population

characteristics (characteristics of dwellings, access to public services); to obtain socio-

demographic information from the population (sex, schooling levels, civil status, etc.), and to

measure employment characteristics, among others.

       The existing database is the result of a probabilistic sampling of several stages, stratified

by unequal conglomerates, and weighed for the 24 capital cities and their metropolitan areas. The

universe is the entire civilian, non-institutionalized population residing in Colombia. The

sampling unit is a segment of 10 contiguous households. The sample size is 20,669 households.

The sampling error is no greater than 5% and possesses national coverage, including

differentiation by zone, department, and large regions. Data were collected weekly for big cities

and monthly for capital cities.

       In order to construct the treatment group that was exempt because they earned less than

10 times the minimum wage, we calculated a variable called Times Minimum Wage (MW) as

the ratio of nominal yearly earnings to the yearly minimum wage (515,000 Colombian pesos for

2010; 535,600 Colombian pesos for 2011; 566,700 Colombian pesos for 2012; and 589,500

Colombian pesos for 2013). We, then, used this variable to construct a dummy for 10 times the

MW. We also constructed variables for: self-employment; employers; contract type for wage-

earners. We also construct firm size variables that identify if firms are less than 3 employees;

                                                11
between 4 and 10; between 10 and 50, and more than 50 employees. This allows us to construct

an indicator for the second treatment group by interacting the self-employment dummy with the

less than 3 employee dummy. We also created an indicator for 2013 to capture the effects of the

reform by interacting the post-reform period with the indicators of whether workers earned less

than 10 times the MW and whether they were self-employed and hired at least two employees.

       For the dependent variables, we constructed several measures of formality. In particular,

we constructed five different measures of formality: an indicator that takes the value of 1 if the

employee has a written contract and zero otherwise; an indicator that takes the value of 1 if the

employer or employee contributed to social security and zero otherwise; an indicators that take

the value of 1 if the employer or employee contributed either to the health system, pensions, and

workers’ compensation and zero otherwise.

       Among the control variables, we include data on socio-economic factors about

individuals, such as age, age squared, marital status, whether the person is literate (i.e., can read

and write), years of schooling, department dummies, and year dummies among others.

       Finally, to corroborate the robustness of the results, we create additional variables to

generate placebos by replacing some criteria, and controls for the First Employment Law. In

particular, we generated a variable for fewer than 20 MW, as well as variables for individuals

younger than 29 years of age, women older than 40 years, and for individuals with salaries below

1.5 MW in order to control for the First Employment Law.

       Table 1 shows different measures of formality for the years from 2010 to 2013. The table

shows that formality has increased over time, regardless of the measure used. For example, the

proportion of people who contribute to health or pension schemes or both increased by 30% in


                                                 12
 2010 to 33% in 2013. Similarly, the proportion of people contributing to workers compensation

 increased from 28% in 2010 to 31% in 2013. The proportion of individuals with a written

 contract from 29% in 2010, to 31% in 2013. Table 1 also shows that the coverage of the reform

 was broad, since 99.5% of workers in 2012 (the year that the reform was approved) earned less

 than 10 MW. Also, 22% of individuals were self-employed workers and 6% were self-employed

 with more than 2 employees in 2012. Finally, over half of the individuals in the sample, 59%, are

 men; about 55%, are married or have lived with their partner for more than two years; 56%, have

 a high school degree while a minority of them has no high school or university degree in 2013.

3.2.    Social Security Administrative Records

        The social security records come from the PILA, which is the data that integrates all the

 payroll contributions made by workers. These records contain contributors’ reported information

 for each of the funds in which they are required to contribute. It is the responsibility of the

 contributor to provide information in order for the contributions to be paid by the Social Security

 System.

        The PILA database analyzed in this study has around 1.25 billion registries that reflect

 the tracking of 16.8 million individuals over 7 years (from 2008 through 2014). The data has no

 defined periodicity, since they are based on the contribution reports to the health and pension

 systems made by individuals at any point in time during the period from 2008-14. This means

 that a person may register more than one monthly payment to the same fund and that the number

 of days quoted in a month can be greater than the duration of the month.

        For this analysis, we consolidated all the payment reports and quoted days for each fund

 in each month. The total monthly income was converted to constant December 2014 prices using


                                                 13
the monthly inflation rate for each department. This was then used to estimate the number of

times a person earns the minimum wage. In addition, the database contains reports from the

contributing company and reports related to employees. Using this code, we added individuals

who reported monthly for one company and used this to infer the firm size. The database has no

information regarding date of birth or age for individuals before 2014, so we did not consider

these characteristics. The control variables were constructed for each month, year, type of

industry, and department.

           We consider workers who have a payment report as being in the formal labor market at

that moment in time. Thus, we estimate transitions from non-employment to formal or registered

employment as those in which an individual was not in the system the previous month and then

appears as contributing into the system the next month. The results of contributions to the health

and pension funds are very similar, but there is a possibility of registering payments to the health

scheme without actually working. For this reason, we rely only on registries into the pension

funds to identify transitions into formal employment.3

           The analysis includes an unbalanced panel by individual year-month. Consequently,

some of the controls and added periods do not contain any information. These are considered as

additional categories in the fixed effects.

           Table 2 shows the descriptive statistics for the PILA database for the entire sample and

by company size. The proportion of employees transitioning from outside the labor force,

unemployment, or informality towards formality or the fraction of individuals who enter into

registered employment is, on average, about 23% per month. The average size of registered
3
    Estimations were made using 25% of the sample due to the volume of information.

employment is concentrated in the capital (Bogota with 5.25%) and the two departments where

the next largest cities of the country are located are located (Antioquia with 5.1% and Valle with

3. 4%).

3.3.      The Monthly Manufacturing Sample (MMS)

          The MMS includes data on employment, wages, production, and characteristics of

establishments in the manufacturing sector, i.e., those with Industry Code CIIU Rev. 3.4

          The data of the MMS are used to detect changes that could occur in the manufacturing

sector in the short-term, including changes in employment, wages, hours worked, production,

and sales of Colombian manufacturing establishments. At the same time, the sample allows to

determine the performance of the sector in different industrial activities; to determine the size

and evolution of different sectors; to create competiveness indices; to analyze the impact of the

economic dynamics on the productive sector; and to construct an index to temporarily estimate

GDP.

          Each establishment’s information is given to DANE (the National Administrative

Statistics Department) by the accountant, manager, owner, or the person in charge of accounting

matters in the establishment. The MMS uses as sampling, observation, and analysis unit the

industrial establishment and it is part of the Annual Manufacturing Sample with a 5% error rate

4
  This dataset dates back to May 1962, when the country started compiling industrial sampling data in order to build
employment and wage indicators. In parallel, the country also collected data on industrial production, an effort that
was stopped in 1970 when the data collection process was unified under a single system, using code ISIC Rev. 1.
This design was in use until 1980. Nevertheless, the first change in the data collection process took place in 1978
when the design of the sample was modified in order to comply with code ISIC Rev. 2. This design was maintained
until 1990. At the same time, during the most recent years of the 1980s, a new adjustment to the design was
introduced and was maintained until the end of the millennium. Towards the end of the 1990s and beginning of the
21st century, changes in representativeness and the need to adopt a third revision of the ISIC motivated the adoption
of the current design.

                                                         15
at the national level. It includes stratified probabilistic sampling (although random for each

stratum), and stratification is done by production, personnel, and type of industry. The

compilation of the information is performed within the first 20 days of each month.

       These data are subject to confidentiality restrictions and statistical reserve. Although we

had access to the data through DANE’s computers, it is not possible to get access to these data

outside of the country. For this reason, the descriptive information we obtained from the database

is limited. One of the reasons for such confidentiality is that for a given region, a company that

meets certain characteristics (for instance, size, production, and type of industry) may be the only

company that does so and, as a result, confidentiality would be lost. Confidentiality is one of the

main agreements with the companies providing information.

       In this study, we use the MMS to examine the impacts of the reform on employment and

hours worked of different types of workers in the manufacturing sector. The data to which we

had access has about 120,770 entries (about 16,400 annual entries). The database we used had

information on the establishment characteristics previously mentioned as well as monthly

temporary jobs from January 2007 through April 2014. Even though there is an identifying

number that may seem unique, it is not possible to do a panel-like tracking because oftentimes

the response of each unit is voluntary and it is sometimes forcefully imputed because of

probabilistic matters.

       We constructed several variables with the MMS for analysis. Unlike the Household

Surveys and the Social Security data, the MMS does not have individual level wages. We can,

however, estimate the ratio of the average wage in the establishment to the MW of 515,000 in

2010 Colombian pesos. Then, we estimate a dummy variable for establishments whose average

wages are less than 10 times the MW to identify establishments in which employees are most

                                                16
likely affected by the payroll tax reform. Our outcomes are the total number of the total number

of production and non-production permanent employees and the proportion of permanent

production and non-production workers out of the total number of employees (both permanent

and temporary). The idea is that permanent employment should increase both in levels and as a

proportion of total employment, since payroll taxes are required for permanent workers but

sometimes exempt temporary workers. We also examine the impact of the reform on the number

of hours worked by permanent employees. Since the fixed cost of hiring a permanent worker

goes down, employers should now prefer hiring more permanent workers and reducing their

hours worked. We also construct a placebo of fewer than 20 MW, to check that our results are

driven by the reform and not by some other factor that affects firms paying lower wages.

       Table 3 shows descriptive statistics for the data from the MMS. The average number of

permanent non-production and production employees in the sample are 52.2 and 99.5 employees,

respectively. The average number of yearly regular and extraordinary hours worked for

permanent production and non-production employees are 19,587 and 1,725, respectively.

       Figure 1 shows the distribution of establishments by department. The vast majority of

manufacturing establishments are in Bogota, Antioquia, and el Valle; the rest of the

establishments are distributed throughout the country. Bogota has 32.9% of the establishments

and 7.3% are located in Cundinamarca (a department next to Bogota); 21.4% are in Antioquia;

12.8% are in el Valle; 6.3% are in the Atlantic (in the Caribbean coast) and 3.4% are in

Santander. The rest are distributed throughout the country with no more than 2.5% of the

establishments located in any one of the other departments.

4.      Empirical Evidence

        We explore empirically whether the reduction and restructuring of payroll taxes

generated incentives to create formal jobs. We also evaluate if the reform increases employment

at the extensive margin (number of employees) and reduces employment at the intensive margin

(number of hours) using data at the individual-, household- and establishment-level.

4.1.    Results from the Household Surveys

        We estimated the following model to calculate the probability of having a formal job

using data from the Household Surveys:


                 P(Fit) = bXit + ls + fr + τt + δ0Less 10 MWit + δ1Postt × Less 10 MWit
                          + δ2Postt × Self-Employed_More 3 Employeesit+ uit
        Where P(Fit) is the probability of having a formal employment and where formal

employment is equal to one if the individual has a formal job defined as: (a) having a written

contract, (b) the individual or employer pays for health benefits, (c) the individual or employer

contributes to a pension fund, (d) the individual or employer contributes to a health and/or

pension scheme, and (e) the individual or employer pays for workers’ compensation. Less 10

MWit is a dummy variable that equals one if the person receives fewer than 10 minimum wages.

Self-Employed More 3 Employeesit is an indicator that equals one if the employee is self-

employed and hires three or more workers.5 Postt is an indicator for whether the person is

observed after 2013. Thus, the coefficients on the interaction terms, δ1 and δ2, capture the effects

of the reform on formal employment. Xit is a vector of controls that includes characteristics such

as age, marital status, gender, schooling level, firm size, and an indicator for whether the


5
 Note that the data does not allow distinguishing 2 or more employees, so we construct a variable for three or more
employees.

                                                        18
employee is self-employed or not as well as interactions between this last indicator with firm

size. The sectorial, geographic, and temporal effects are captured by ls, fr and τt, respectively.

We cluster standard errors by department.

       Table 4 reports coefficients δ1 and δ2 , which capture the effects of the individuals with

fewer than 10 minimum wages and on self-employed with more than 2 employees. The results

show that the reform generated an increase in the probability of having formal employment.

Specifically, the probability of having a written contract after the reform is 8.5 percentage points

greater for employees with wages less than 10 MW. The probability of contributing to health

benefits is 13.4 percentage points higher. The probability of contributing to a pension scheme

increased by 11.1 percentage points and the probability of contributing to a health and/or pension

system increases by 12.4 percentage points for workers with fewer than ten MW after the reform.

Finally, the probability of contributing to workers’ compensation increases by 17.1 percentage

points. These coefficients are robust and are significant even with clustered standard errors. To

understand the magnitude of these effects, we estimated the elasticity of employment with

respect to non-wage labor costs. The effects translate into elasticities of 3 and 4.2 for the effects

regarding written contracts and jobs that contribute to social security. These effects are in line

with the biggest effects reported by Hamermesh (1996) and similar to those observed in

countries like Germany, where labor costs are similar to those of Colombia and where wages are

downwardly rigid.

       Table 4 also reports coeffficients of the post-reform indicator interacted with the indicator

for self-employed workers with 3 or more employees. The results show that the probability to

pay for health benefits or to contribute to a health or pension fund increases by one percentage

point among self-employed workers with more than two employees after the reform. This effect

                                                 19
translates into an elasticity of employment of 0.3, which is much lower than the elasticity we

calculated for workers with less than 10 minimum wages, but it is within the average range of

elasticities found by Hamermesh (1996).

       When the effects are estimated separately for men and women, it is clear that while the

effects for those with less than 10 minimum wages are observed for both men and women, the

effects for the self-employed with more than 3 employees is only observed for men. Panel B of

Table 4 shows the effects for women and Panel C for men. The results for those earnings less

than 10 MW are greater for women and they are observed across all measures of formality. For

example, the probability of having a written contract increases to 9.3 percentage points while the

probability of contributing to either health or pension benefits increases to 15 percentage points

for women earning more than 10 MW after the reform. The results in Panel C shows equivalent

effects on these measures of formality of 7.8 and 8.2 percentage points for men. However, the

effects on the probability of contributing to a pension plan or workers’ compensation are not

significant for men. By contrast, there is no effect on self-employed women, but the effect of the

reform increases the probability of contributing to the health insurance system for self-employed

men with more than 2 employees.

       Table 5 shows the results of the effects of the Tax Reform by firm size. The results show

that Law 1607 had greater effects on formal employment among those working in the smallest

firms. Panel A report estimates for the full sample; Panel B report estimates for those in firms

with fewer than 10 employees; Panel C report results for firms between 11 and 50 employees,

and Panel D report results for those in firms with more than 50 employees. The effects for those

working in firms with fewer than 10 employees are larger than those for the entire sample. The

probability of having a formal job under any of our definitions of formality increases by about

                                               20
six percentage points for self-employed workers with more than 3 employees and by about 230

percentage points for those with less than 10 minimum wages. The effects for workers with less

than 10 minimum wages and who work in firms with 10 to 50 employees are significant and

bigger than those in the entire sample, but smaller than those found for small firms with fewer

than 10 employees. Formality among men and women earning less than 10 minimum wages in

medium-sized firms increased between 22 to 30 percentage points, but there is no effect among

self-employed workers in medium-sized firms. By contrast, formality among workers earning

less than 10 minimum wages in firms with more than 50 employees increased between 2.5 to 5

percentage points after the reform, which are smaller effects than those found in the full sample.

This reveals an obvious pattern. The effects are bigger among those in smaller firms. This makes

sense given that bigger firms were more likely to have to pay the CREE and smaller firms are

more likely to have qualified for exemptions for employees closer to the MW and for self-

employed hiring others.

       To guarantee that these results capture the effects of the reform and not some other

factors affecting lower-earning workers after the reform, we performed regressions with

placebos. In our placebo, we changed the threshold of ten MW (as specified by Law 1607) to 20

MW in order to calculate the dummy variable for employee wages. In these regressions, we

excluded all workers with fewer than 10 MW. Table 6 shows these results with clustered

standard errors. We found that there was no effect on formality for people with fewer than 20

MW. As can be observed on Table 6, in many cases the coefficients become negative and they

were always insignificant.

       Finally, Table 7 shows similar effects to those presented in Tables 4 and 5, but

controlling for effect on groups affected by the First Employment law. In particular, we included

                                               21
indicators for individuals younger than 29 years of age, women older than 40, and individuals

earning less than 1.5 MW and we interacted them with a post-2011 indicator, since the First

Employment Law was enacted in December 2010. These results show that the effects of the

interaction between the reform and employees with less than 10 MW is still positive and

significant and that the effect is even greater when controlling for the First Employment Law. In

this case, the probability of having a formal employment increases by about 22 to 25 percentage

points. The effects for people younger than 29 years and for those who earn less than 1.5 MW

after 2011 are either statistically or economically insignificant. On the other hand, the effects for

self-employed workers with more than two employees after the tax reform and among women

older than 40 after the First Employment law are now negative and significant.

       In conclusion, people earning less than 10 minimum wages benefited the most from the

reform in terms of having a higher likelihood of holding a formal sector job and the effects are

greater for women and for workers in small firms.

4.2.   Results from Social Security Records

       We estimated the following model to calculate the impact of the reform on transitions

from unemployment, inactivity, and informal employment into registered employment:


            P(Fit) = bXit + ls + fr + τt + µm + δ0Less 10 MWit + δ1Postt × Less 10 MWit
                       + δ2Postt × Self-employed More 3 Employeesit + uit


P(Fit) is the probability of transitioning from non-employment or informal employment into the

formal sector. Less 10 MWit and Self-employed More 3 Employees are indicators for groups

exempted from the payroll tax, that is, those with less than 10 minimum wages and self-

employed workers with two or more employees. Postt is an indicator for whether the company is

                                                 22
observed after 2013. Xit includes economic activity and size of the firm. The PILA database does

not contain data on age, education, or any other individual characteristic. The geographic and

sectorial effects are captured by ls and fr respectively and the year and month effects are

captured by τt and µm. All of the regressions estimate clustered standard errors at the individual

level.

         Table 8 shows the effects on transitions into registered jobs for the full sample and by

firm size. Columns (1) and (2) show the coefficients for the interaction terms in regressions using

the full sample. Columns (3) and (4) show the estimates for firms with fewer than 3 employees,

Columns (5) and (6) show the estimates for firms between 3-10 employees; Columns (7) and (8)

show the estimates for firms between 10-50 employees and Columns (9) and (10) show the

estimates for firms with more than 50 employees. The overall results in Column (1) show an

increase in the probability of transitioning into formal sector employment of 3.5 percentage

points among employees with less than 10 minimum wages and of 16.3 percentage points among

self-employed workers employing more than 2 employees. The specification in Column (2)

allows for differential effects for those earnings less than 2 MW, those earnings between 2 and 5

MW and those earning between 5 and 10 MW. As expected, these results show that the impact is

greatest on those earning close to the MW and smaller for those with higher wages. The

probability of transitioning into formal employment increases by 5.1 percentage points for those

earning less than 2 MW, by 2 percentage points for those earning between 2-5 MW and by 1

percentage point for those earning between 5-10 MW. Since it is more difficult to pass on higher

payroll taxes onto workers when workers face a binding minimum wage, it is likely that a

reduction in payroll taxes also has the greatest impact in terms of formal employment for this

group of workers.


                                                23
       Columns (2)-(10) of Table 8 show the effects on entry into registered jobs for firms of

different sizes. Columns (2) and (4) show that the likelihood of transitioning into registered

employment increases by 39.4 and 29.7 percentage for those in firms with fewer than 4

employees and in firms with 4 to 10 employees who earn less than 10 MW after the reform.

Also, Columns (3) and (5) show that the effects are bigger for those earning less than 2 MW,

somewhat smaller for those earning between 2-5 MW and even smaller, though still positive and

significant, for those earning between 5 and 10 MW. The effects are negative for those in larger

firms. Likewise, the likelihood of transitioning into registered employment increases by 11.7, 6

and 7.5 percentage points for self-employed workers with 4 to 10 employees, with 10-50

employees and with more than 50 employees.

4.3.   Results from the Manufacturing Survey

       We estimated the following model to calculate the impact of the reform on the level and

composition of employment using the monthly manufacturing sample:


        Ejst = αKjst + ls ++ fr + Ψt + δ0Less 10 MWjst-1 + δ1Postt × Less 10 MWjst-1 + vjst


       Ejst is employment in establishment j for permanent production and non-production

employees, as well as the percentage of permanent production and non-production employees.

Less 10 MWjst-1 is a dummy variable that equals one if the establishment pays on average wages

that are less than ten minimum wages before the reform. Postt is an indicator for whether

employment at the company occurs after May 2013. The geographic, sectorial, and temporal

effects are captured by ls, fr, and Ψt. Kjst represents installed capital. All of the standard errors

are clustered by department.




                                                 24
       The coefficients of interest are those for the interaction between the variable for less than

10 minimum wages and the variable for after 2013 for the different types of workers. Panel A in

Table 9 shows the results for the entire sample, while Panels B, C, D, and E in the same table

show the results for establishments with less than 4, 4-10 employees, 10-50 employees, and more

than 50 employees, respectively. Columns (1) and (2) in Table 9 report the impacts on the

number and percent of permanent non-production employees, Columns (3) and (4) reports

impacts on the number and percent of permanent production workers. For establishments that

pay on average less than 10 minimum wages, we observed an increase in the number of

permanent workers and employees after 2013. In particular, Columns (1) and (3) in Panel A

show that there is an increase of 46.1 permanent non-production employees and of 254

permanent non-production employees in establishments that pay less than 10 minimum wages

after the reform. This by itself suggests increased job creation in the manufacturing sector. In

addition, Columns (2) and (4) of Panel A show an increase of 10% in the share of permanent

non-production employees, though no effect on the share of permanent production employees.

       Columns (5) and (6) in Table 9 also show the effects on regular and extraordinary hours

for all permanent workers. The results in Column (5) show substitution in working hours for

permanent employees. There is a reduction of 279 regular hours or a reduction of 1.5% in regular

hours for this group of workers, though no effect for extraordinary hours.

       Panels B-E in Table 9 show effects by establishment size. The results show that even

though the effects regarding additional permanent workers are naturally smaller in smaller

establishments, the effects are clearly larger for smaller companies when looking at the shares of

permanent workers. Panels B and C in Table 9 show that the percentage of permanent non-

production employees increases by 85.8 and 55.5 percent, respectively, in establishments with

                                                25
fewer than 4 employees and in companies with 4 to 10 employees and that pay less than 10

minimum wages on average. Likewise, for small companies that pay less than 10 minimum

wages on average, there is an increase in the percentage of permanent production workers. Also,

there is a reduction in the regular and extraordinary working hours of permanent employees in

establishments with less than 4 employees and a reduction in regular hours in establishments

with 4-10 employees. By contrast, Panels D and E Table 9 show that while there is a positive

effect on the number of permanent non-production and production employees, there are no

effects on the shares of permanent non-production and production employees or on regular and

extraordinary permanent hours among bigger establishments with 10 to 50 employees and with

50 or more employees. Thus, consistent with the data using the Household Surveys and the

Social Security records, we find bigger effects on smaller employers. This is likely because the

smaller employers are more likely to face higher labor costs due to the inability to pass these

costs to their employees. Also, the equity income tax introduced by the Tax Reform likely had a

higher incidence on larger employers.

       As with the Household Surveys, we carried out regressions with a placebo group using

the MMS data. Table 10 shows the results of this placebo using as a threshold 20 minimum

wages on average at the establishment-level. The results show no significant effects in the

regressions that use 20 MW as a threshold.

5.     Conclusions

       The results of estimations using data from Household Surveys, the Social Security

records, and the Monthly Manufacturing Sample are consistent with an increase in the creation

of formal employment in response to the Tax Reform that eliminated payroll contributions for

training, family services and health benefits.

                                                 26
       In the case of regressions using data from the Household Surveys and the Social Security

records, there is strong evidence indicating a greater propensity towards formality among the two

groups who experienced payroll tax reductions due to the reform, i.e., those with less than 10

MW and self-employed with more than 2 employees.

       The analysis with the data from the Household Surveys and the data from the Social

Security records show similar effects on formal employment with contributions to pension funds.

The Household Surveys show an impact of 11.1 percentage points on the likelihood of being

employed jobs with contributions to pension funds for those with less than 10 minimum wages.

The Social Security data shows an increase of 3.5 in the likelihood of transitioning to

employment registered in a pension fund. The results from the two databases also show effects of

one percentage point on formal employment among self-employed workers with more than two

employees. The Household Surveys also show an increase of 1 percentage point in the likelihood

of being employed in a job with contributions to both health and pension plans for self-employed

workers with more than 2 employees. Likewise, the Social Security data shows an increase of

16.3 in the likelihood of transitioning into a job registered with pension contributions.

       Moreover, the results using the Household Surveys and Social Security records show that

small firms are the ones most likely to respond to the reform by creating formal jobs. Moreover,

the results using the Social Security records are also stronger for those who earn lower salaries

closer to the minimum wage. We also included placebo regressions to verify that the results were

not driven by the reform and not by other factors. We do a placebos including interactions with

less than 20 MW instead of 10 MW and the results show no effects. The fact that the placebo

group was not affected, and that the groups most likely to be affected are indeed the ones for

which we find greater effects, confirms that the results are likely driven by the reform.

                                                 27
       The Manufacturing Sample results confirm these results and show an increase in

permanent employment. These results show an increase in the number and proportion of

permanent production and non-production employees after the reform among establishments that

pay less than 10 minimum wages on average. The Tax Reform also caused a substitution in the

regular hours worked by permanent workers, as would be expected since the costs of hiring

permanent workers decreased. As with the individual-level results, establishment-level results

show that the Tax Reform had greater impact among companies with fewer than 10 employees.

       These effects are larger in comparison to the reform from the mid-nineties in Colombia.

Kugler and Kugler (2009) find a much smaller effect − a 10% percent increase in payroll taxes

reduced employment by about 5%. The results from the MMS, which are closest to those used by

Kugler and Kugler (2009), show that a decrease of 13.5% in payroll taxes introduced by the

reform increased the share of permanent non-production workers by 46%.

       At the same time, the effects are substantial compared to other reforms carried out in

Colombia affecting both the supply and demand of labor. On the demand side, the exemptions

introduced by the First Employment Law for new hires from specific groups do not appear to be

as effective as the exemptions introduced by the Tax Reform. On the supply side, the program

Youth in Action (or Jóvenes en Acción in Spanish), which provided vocational training and

internships to young individuals, increased formal employment among men and women by 6 and

7 percentage points, respectively. In this case, the cost per employee was $770 dollars. In

comparison, the tax reform probably generated fewer costs, since the funds lost due to the tax

exemptions were recovered through the equity income tax. On the other hand, Kugler et al.

(2015) find that the effects of the Youth in Action program were permanent. It is too early to




                                             28
know if the effects of the Tax Reform are long-term, but it is possible that entering the formal

sector can generate hysteresis and increase the probability of remaining in the formal sector.

Note: The table reports coeficients and clustered standard errors by department (in parenthesis) of linear probability models of different measures of formality on the
interaction terms of the post-reform dummy with indicators of whether the worker earns less than 10 MW or the workers is self-employed and hires more than 2
employees. The formality measures include: a Written Contract dummy; an indicator of whether the employer or employee pay Health and Pension Contributions; an
indicator of whether the employee is covered by Workers' Compensation. To estimate the share of workers paid less than 10 MW, wages (deflated to their real value at
2013 prices) were divided by the Colombian Minimun Wage of 589,500 pesos in 2013 pesos. All regressions control for age, age squared, years of education, education
squared, a male dummy, dummies for marital status, the number of MW the indiviudal earns, the worker's type, firm size, the interaction between firm size and worker
type and fixed effects for industry and year. *** p<0.01, p<0.05, *p<0.1.
