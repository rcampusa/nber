                 This   working paper is a draft of a chapter in a larger

    manuscript   which   is concerned with the time   series   variations in

    fertility in the United States since 1920. This        chapter   asks how

    economic models of fertility aid our understanding of our demographic

    history. Thus little attention is given here to the suitability of

    economic models for the explanation of cross—sectional fertility

    differentials.

                 I would like to thank Paul David for his valuable comments

    on an earlier draft of this chapter.

                  The economic theory of fertility, in its current state,

        is a product of two broad strands of influence. One such strand can

        be found in the works of Becker,1 Mincer2 and Willis.3 The other

        strand winds its way through the works of Eastr1in.4 The Becker— and

        Easterlin—type approaches are fundamentally quite distinct, not in the

        least part because of the differences in what the authors try to

        accomplish. The main thrust of Becker's work (and that of his followers)

        is to show how economic models may be used to aid our understanding of

        fertility variations and differentials. The spirit of the Becker—type

        analysis, is the spirit of the economic theorist who is demonstrating

        the strength and breadth of the analytical framework by showing how it

        may be used to analyze a complex and unresolved problem. Easterlin came

        to the study of fertility with a quite different background, that of an

        economic historian. The problem for Easterlin was to understand fertility

        variations within a historical context. Thus, for Easterlin, the main

        problem was to provide a framework in which to comprehend the available

        information on the variations in fertility over time. The spirit of the

        Easterlin—type analysis is the spirit of the economic historian who finds

        himself compelled to modify economic models and concepts for the purpose
    •




        of understanding some observed behavior. Of course, there is much in

        common between these two approaches.

             One problem which is shared by both approaches to the

economics of fertility is how to account for the inverse relationships

between fertility and income which are so frequently observed.5 If

the relationships were always negative there would be some temptation

to label children as "inferior goods", but in reality the relationships

vary in sign.6 Furthermore, treating children as If they were inferior

goods does not explain observed behavior, but rather just gives it a name

after the fact. So economists have shied away from assuming that children

could be viewed as inferior goods and have regarded the negative associations

between income, and fertility as something which must be explained in other

terms. Thus all the models of fertility discussed below have some mech-

anism which can transform a nominally positive association between income

and fertility into a negative one.


The Economic Theory of Fertility Before Becker: Leibenstein

             Becker is usually considered the father of the contemporary

economic theory of fertility although his work was not the first to

analyze the demand for children within the framework economic theory.

His work was predated at least by the contributions of Leibenstein7 and

Okun.8 What differentiated Becker's work from that of Leibenstein's

and Okun's was Becker's use of the well known demand theory approach

to the problem of fertility without the introduction of ad hoc or unfamiliar

notions into the structure of model in order to explain the possibility

of a negative relationship between icnome and fertility.

             The essence of Leibenstein's contribution is presented in the      S
following   quotation.
                                    —3—

                  Our central notion is that people behave in the same
               way as they would if they applied rough calculations to the
               problem of determining the number of births they desire.
               And such calculations would depend on balancing the satis-
               factions or utilities to be derived from an additional birth
               as against the "cost," both monetary and psychological,
               of having an additional child. We distinguish among three
               types of utility to be derived from an additional birth
               and two types of cost. The types of utility are: (1) the
               utility to be derived from the child as a 'consumption
               good,' namely, as a source of personal pleasure to the parents;
               (2) the utility to be derived from the child as a productive
               agent, that is, at  some point the child may be expected to
               enter the labor force and contribute to family income; and
               (3) the utility derived from the prospective child as a
               potential source of security, either in old age or otherwise.
                  The costs of having an additional child can be divided
               into direct and indirect costs. By direct costs we refer
               to the conventional current expenses of maintaining the
               child, such as feeding and clothing him at conventional
               standards until the point is reached when the child is self—
               supporting. By indirect costs we refer to the opportunities
               foregone due to the existence of an additional child. These
               are represented by such lost opportunities as the inability
               of mothers to work if they must tend to children, lost
               earnings during the gestation period, or the lessened mobility
               of parents with large family responsibilities.9

               Many of the ideas subsequently developed in the economic theory

    of fertility can be found in Leibenstein's work. Indeed, those para-

    graphs suggest at least one line of approach which has not yet been

    explored. Leibenstein's main interest in fertility in his 1957 volume,

    was why fertility declined as per capita income rose. He summarized

    his argument on this score in the following figure.

              In the Leibenstein model fertility fell as per capita income

rose for two main reasons. First, as per capita income increases there

are associated changes in the structure of economic activities which

tend to reduce the value of children to their parents. Leibenstein

suggests that the main causes of this decline are the decreasing utility

of children of a given order in providing old—age security for their

parents and the decreasing potential of children contributing to family

income through work activities. On the other side of the coin, Leibenstein

views the costs of children of a given order as increasing as per capita

income increases because tithe style in which a child is maintained

depends on the position and income of the parents." Leibenstein also

thought that the indirect costs of children of a given order would rise

because he considered "opportunities for (parents) engaging in productive

or in various time—consuming activities as likely to grow as income

increases .

              Leibenstein's   analysis is focused on explaining variations

in fertility over time. It suggests that students of fertility pay

attention to two broad sets of forces in determining fertility movements.

The first is the set of structural transformations which accompany the

rIse in per capita income and which (according to Leibenstein) decrease

the value of children to their parents. The second is a set of forces

which increases the cost of children as income increases. Thus, the

Leibenstein model differs from a simple model of constrained optimiza-

tion in that par capita income affects fertility through a variety of

mechanisms in addition to its effect on the budget constraint. Leibenstein

solved the problem of explaining the negative secular relationship

between income and fertility by positing that the utility function
                                    —6—
                                                                                •)
shifts   with changes in per capita income and that the price of children

varies with family income. In the Leibenstein model secular increases

in income are associated with changes in tastes and changes in the

relative price of children which dominate the pro—natal effect of income

increases and cause the observed negative relationship. I think it

is fair to say that the Leibenstein model represented, in somewhat

more   formal terms, the main lines explanation of the secular decline
in   fertility which were widely accepted at the time    of his writing.

An Explanation of FluctuationS in American Fertility: The Work of Easterlin

             Like Leibenstein's ideas, the main focus of Easterlin's

work has been on fertility variations over time. Easterlin has made

a number of contributions to the economic analysis of fertility12,

but in this chapter we shall     be eclectic and   treat only those which

are    directly relevant   to the present discussion. Whereas Leibenstein

considered the problem of fertility variations in the context of

developing countries, the works of Easterlin, which will be discussed

here, deal with fertility fluctuations over time in the United States.

In 1961, Easterlin proposed an explanation     for   the American baby boom13

which suggested that the baby boom was a manifestation of the same sort

of forces which, in an earlier era, had produced long swings in migration.

In 1966, Easterlin suggested an integrated explanation of both the baby

boom and the following fertility decline.14

              In the earlier article, Easterlin focused on the time profile

of white fertility which he disaggregated into the time paths of the

fertility of foreign—born whites, rural native whites, and urban native
                                          —7—

    white.     He found through this process, that most of the temporal decline
)
    in fertility in white fertility in the United States was due to the

    declining fertility of foreign—born whites, the declining fertility of

    rural native whites, and the rural—urban shift. The fertility of urban

    native whites decreased only slightly from 1885—89 to 1925—29. After

    1925—29, however, urban white fertility shows a marked alteration from

    its relative constancy of the previous 40 years. The great depression

    caused a substantial decrease in fertility and the postwar period,

    through to the middle '50s, saw an unprecendented fertility increase.

                     Easterlin suggests a separate explanation for the fertility

    patterns of each of the three groups. For our present purposes it is

    sufficient to examine his explanation of the course of urban native

    fertility. In order to explain these fertility changes Easterlin concentrates

    on the fertility of young people. Easterlin's explanation of changes

    in the fertility of urban native whites hinges on the interaction of two

    factors: changes in the aggregate unemployment rate and         changes   in the

    rate    of growth of the total white male population 20—29. Both increases
    in the aggregate unemployment rate and the rate of growth of the total
    white   male population are thought to be negatively associated with

    fertility changes. The changes in these two       factors   taken together

    broadly reflect changes in the economic well—being      of young people, if
    we    abstract   from the secular upward trend in income. This explanation

    of    fertility changes is supported by evidence shown in Figure    2.    There
    is can be seen that changes in the unemployment rate and changes in
    the   rate of growth of the total white male population were inversely

    associated before the Great Depression. This inverse relationship

    is caused by a negative association between the unemployment rate in the

    United States and international migration to the United States.15

    According to Easterlin, the rapid response of migration to changes in

    labor market conditions which prevented pronounced cyclical movements

    in the economic well—being of young adults was the reason for the relative

    constancy of urban native white fertility before the Depression of the

    1930's. After the statutory restriction of international migration in

    the early 1920's the stage was set for the native white population to bear

    the full brunt of economic fluctuations. In

    particular, the baby boom period of the 'fifties was a period of relatively

    low unemployment rates and a relatively low growth rate of the white

    male population 20—29 because of the low fertility in the 1930's. The

    combination of these two circumstances was unusual and Easterlin suggested

    that it was this fortuitous combination which caused the baby boom.

                  In his later article on the baby boom, Easterlin added another

    element to his explanation of fertility changes. Easterlin argued that

    it was incorrect to create economic models of fertility based on the

    assumption that tastes remained fixed. He argued that young adults

    become acquainted with a certain level of consumption when they are

    teenagers in their parents' households and that this level of consumption

    affects their tastes and  aspirations. When the young adults become
    married,    so the argument goes, the tastes and aspirations formed in their
    adolescence remain   with   them. If   t1ir   income is such that their aspi-
    rations    are satisfied they will have higher fertility than if they are

    struggling to attain their desired level of consumption)6        Thus,   Easterlin

 suggests not only that we study changed in the economic position of

 young people in order to understand changes in fertility, but that we

 also study changes in their economic position relative to that of their

 parents.

            Easter].in presented a table to support the intergenerational

relative income hypothesis, which showed the relationship between

median family incomes of families whose heads were 14—24 in a given

year with those of families whose heads were 35—44 five years earlier.

Th table contained data for the years 1953—1962. Table 1 shows similar

data for the years 1953—1972 and these data together with the
                                                                age specific

fertility rates of married women 15—19 and 20—24 lagged one year are

plotted in Figure 3A.

            The peak of the income ratio is in 1956 and the ratio declines

rapidly to a local trough in 1963. The two years of marked increase

which follow 1963 give way to a continued decline through 1972. Thus,

at first glance, the income ratio series does not seem to do well in

explaining the fertility of young women. While both the lagged age—

specific marital fertility rates and the income ratios have local peaks

in 1956, the income ratio declines through 1963, while the lagged age—

specific martial fertility rate for women 15—19 is higher in 1960 than

in 1957 and the rate for women 20—24 is higher in 1959 than in 1957. After

1963, the three series hardly seem related at all. In Figure 3—B, the

intergenerational relative income ratio and the marriage rate for un-

married women 15—44 are plotted. It can be seen from that figure that

the marriage rate and the income ratio are quite closely related. Indeed,      .
I   apparently   they are more closely related than the income ratio and

    age—specific fertility rates. However, the relationship between the

    income ratio and the marriage rate is not so close as to obviate the

    need for further discussion. This is not the place for a complete

    test of the intergenerational relative income hypothesis. Here we

    simply want to suggest the possibility that, to the extent that inter-

    generational relative Income Is an important determinant of fertility,

    its impact is chiefly through its influence on marriage rates and only

    secondarily through it influence on the completed fertility of married

    women.

                 It would be quite naive to believe that all fertility

    variations could be understood with reference to a single income ratio

I   and this Is not what Easterlin intended. For one thing, contraceptive

    technology was changing rapidly in the '60's and this could possibly

    account for some of the deviations between the income ratio series

    and the lagged age—specific marital fertility series in the middle of

    the decade. A balanced view of the matter would suggest that the inter-

    generational relative income effect may be quite important in under-

    standing fertility changes, but that a definitive test of that hypo-

    thesis has not yet been made.

              Easterlin,   like Leibenstein, views tastes as changing in an

antinatal direction as income increases. At first glance, this might

seem to be a noneconomic explanation of fertility variation.
                                                                     However,

the Easterlin—Fuchs intergenerational relative income hypothesis puts

economIcs   back into the picture by claiming that economics can     aid in
the   understanding   of intergeperationa]. taste differences.


Becker's Economic Theory of Fertility: Leibenstein Formalized?

             In 1960, Becker formally applied demand theory to task of

understanding fertility.17 The model suggested by Becker dealt with a

single consumer and    may be written as follows:

             Model I: The Becker Model

                  Maximize    U = f(n,    e, s)

                  subject to I = nep        + ps

where f is autitity function, n is the number           of children, e is the
average   real expenditure per child,18    p      is a price index for the child

expenditure bundle, s is an index of the quantity of everything else

consumed by the houshold,      p5 is a   price index for s ,   and   I   is

money   income. Thus, In    the Becker model the utility function is defined

over the number of children, the average real expenditures per child, and

the quantity of everything else. The distinction between             and e
is
                                   — 12 —




     very Important for Becker's argument. He notes that it is quite

plausible that increases in income are associated with increases in the
                                                                                     .
average real expenditures per child, but that this does not by itself

indicate that the cost of children rises with Income. Becker wrote:

                    A change in the cost of children Is a change in the cost
               of children of given quality, perhaps due to a change in the
               price of food or education. . . One would not say that the price
               of cars has risen over time merely because more people now buy
               Cadillacs and other expensive cars. A change in price has to
               be estimated from indexes of the price of a given quality.
               Secular changes in real income and other variables have
               induced a secular increase in expenditures on children, often
               interpreted as a rise in the cost of children. The cost of
               children may well have risen . . . but the increase in expendi-
               ture on children is no evidence of such rise since the quality
               of children has risen. Today children are better fed, housed,
               and clothed, and in increasing numbers are sent to nursery schools,
               camps, high schools, and colleges. For the same reason, the
               price of children to rich parents is the same as that to poor
               parents even though rich parents spend more on children. The
               rich simply choose higher quality children as well as higher
               qualities of other goods.

               Armed with the distinction between cost and expenditure, Becker

attacked Lelbenstein and others for assuming that the cost of children

necessarily rose with income. He argued that it was preferable to make

an   analogy between children and       consumer durables. In the case of

consumer   durables, people can   not   only choose the quantity of these
items   they   wish to purchase, but also, to some extent, the amount   of

money they wish to spend on each unit. Becker        claimed that in the world of

consumer   durables quality and   quantity   income elasticities tend to be
positive   with the former exceeding the latter and, arguing by analogy, he

claimed that this would also be true for the demand for children, were

there   no contraceptive costs.

                  Becker's   distinction between expenditure and   cost was quite
    persuasive and for 13 years after Becker's initital article on fertility

    most economists working in the field were convinced that "the price of

    children to rich parents is the same as that to poor parents even though

    rich parents spend more on children.                                            20
                                                  However, in 1973, Becker and Lewis

    discovered that this statement waä an obiter dictum and not a true impli-

    cation of the Becker modal. Indeed, income changes generally produced

    endogeneous relative price changes in that model whose effects had not

    been previously analyzed. In analyzing these induced relative price changes

    Becker and Lewis found that Becker had been wrong in his earlier article.

    They wrote:

                    This price effect, however, does offer a correction to
               the argument advanced by Becker (1960), and followed by many
               others, that the price of children is the same for the rich as
               for the poor (aside from the cost—of—time argument), even
               though the rich choose more expensive children. The relevant
               price of children with respect to their number is higher for
               the. rich precisely because they choose more expensive children.
               Similarly, the relevant price of cars, houses, or other goods
               is higher r the rich because they choose more expensive
               varieties.

               In some regrds the Becker—Lewis article in 1973 brings us

    full circle to Leibenstein's 1957 arguments, albeit with a considerable

    increase in the level of analytic sophistication. Nonetheless, the

    initial Becker article still has some appeal and it is difficult to

    accept the proposition that the prices of goods are higher for the wealthy

    than for the poor just because the wealthy purchase higher quality goods.

    Are the price of automobiles, houses, children and other goods really

    higher for the rich thai for the poor? In order to discuss this question

    let us consider two alternative models.

            The main difference between the Becker Model and Model           II
is   that in the second model the real expenditure of each child

is treated as a separate argument in the utility function. In Beker's

model these arguments are aggregated together into the number of children,

and the average real expenditure per child. Thus,

parents are assumed to be indifferent between the sItuation in which they

have two children with a real expenditure of $10,000 on the first and $2

on the second and the situation in which the parents have two children with

a real expenditure of $5,001 on each of them. No such assumption is made

in Model II. Neither of these models has any implications for the number

of children or real expenditures on them as it is written. In order to
                                                 — 15



 derive some implications it is               customary to assume that all the arguments

 in the utility functions are normal goods.23 With these additional

 assumptions in mind let us consider the Becker model first.

                It can be seen immediately that the Becker model is not the

 standard model of demand theory. There are several very importmnt

 differences. First of all, the arguments of a utility function are

 generally quantities of goods and services. In the Becker model, n

 and s meet this criteria, but e does not because it represents an

 average of quantities, the average being taken over another argument in

 the utility function.            This     specification leads to the other important

departure from the standard model; the budget constraint is not linear

in the arguments of the utility function. The consequences of these

differences can be seen most clearly when the first—order conditions for

a utility maximum are written down. They are


               (1)          f          f     f
                             n         a      s

where k - for              k =    n,   e, and s .       The shadow price of n in this
formulation is pe and the shadow price of e is pn . Not only do
the   shadow prices of n and e change with income, the shadow prices
are functions     of the arguments of the utility function.

              Now int sense is it true that children are more expensive

to rich people than to poor people in the context of the Becker model?

To answer this question, let us suppose that, subject to the budget constraint


              (2) i(l) =               + ps

utility is maximized at the point (n (1) ,e (1),s(1) )                             .     At   this point
                                                                    (1)       = p eW and the shadow

price of e be defined as fleW =                                      Using these shadow prices,
                                                      PcW      .



the budget constraint may be rewritten as follows:


               (3)             =   (l)(l) +           11e0 + ps(

where R' =                + PeWnW .              As in the standard analysis, holding

the shadow prices constant, equation 3 is linear in the arguments of the

utility function. Now let income increase from I (1)                                     to I (2) .   In
this case there will exist an R2) >                    K''1)    such that at the point

(n(2),e(2),s(2)) utility is maximized subject to the two constraints


               (4) R2 (l)(2)                 +   ir      e(2) +


      and      (5)   I (2) =         (2')e (2) + ps(2)

               Since there are two constraints24 passing through point

(n(2),e(2),s(2)) there are two sets of shadow prices. The shadow prices
                                                                    (1)                (1)
for n, e, and s                along equation 4 are                       '
                                                                               11e
                                                                                              and

respectively. The shadow prices for n, e, and                                  s       along equation 5 are
  (2pe       ),

                               (=pn (2) ),   and      p8 respectively. Before we compare

shadow price ratios along the constraints, it is important to note that

Becker and Lewis believe that the pure income elasticity of demand for e

is greater than the pure income elasticity of demand for n. If this is

the case, e (2)      >   e (1)       Now how do the relative shadow prices of n
              n(2)

and   e     compare along the two constraints?

                                                 <(2)

Therefore, the shadow price of n relative to the shadow price of e
                   (2) (2)          (2)
at point (n             ,e     ,s          )   along   equation 5 is greater than the shadow

price of n relative to the shadow price of e at point (n (1) ,e (1) ,s (1) )

along equation 2. It is in this sense that Becker and Lewis mean that
children are more expensive to rich people than to poor people. However,

continuing the line of argument, there is another sense in which children

are more expensive for the rich than for the poor. The shadow prices of

both n and e relative to the price of a are                                       higher at point
      (2)
(11         ,e (2) ,s (2) ) along equation 5 than at (n(1),e(1) ,s (1) )                  along
equation 2 even if the true income                         elasticity   of demand   for n is
                                                                                     25
greater        than the true income elasticity of demand for e
                  The complications caused by the induced relative price effects
in    the Becker model contrast markedly with the simplicity of the analysis

of Model II, the model in which each child is treated separately.

Model II is formally identical to the standard model of demand theory and

therefore the first—order conditions for a maximum are:

and where n is the number of children in the family. In Model II

shadow prices are fixed parameters independent of income. Therefore, the

shadow prices are the same to rich and poor alike. There is no sense

in which the price of children or automobiles or houses, for that matter,

varies with income in this model.

                       Thus, it is the standard demand model which yields the assertion

that prices are invariant to income, whereas the original Becker model

itself leads to the Leibensteinian position taken on this question in the

Becker—Lewis 1973 article. Clearly, whether or not the price of children

varies with income depends upon the model chosen to represent the

decision—making process. The same is certainly true for houses, automobiles,

and other goods.

                       Now that there are two models proposed to explicate the same

phenomena, the question naturally arises: which model is preferable?

                       For those who would resolve this question by an empirical test

of the implications of the models, the absence of any testable implications

from the Becker model poses something of a problem. The Becker model

can accomodate virtually any fertility—income pattern, but it predicts

no particular association. Becker and Lewis have shown that even though

n     and e            are       assumed to be normal goods,   their observed elasticities

with respect to income may be negative. This can be seen in                      Figure 4,
where we have assumed that utility is initially maximized at the point

In   that figure the constraint K1K1 and the indifference curve U1U1

are both drawn holding the quantity of s consumed at s .                    Similarly
the constraint K2K2 and the indifference curve U2U2 are both drawn

holding the quantity of s consumed at s (3)

               Figure 4 illustrates the case where fertility decreases with

income even though n is a normal good in the utility function. The

initial point which maximizes utility is at a2 ,                the     point where

the budget constraint K1K1 and the indifference curve U11J1 are

tangent. With the increase in income the constraint may shift upward to

K2K2 which is tangent to U21J2 at point b2 .             Clearly   the increase in

income in that representation causes fertility to decline. Nonetheless,

n    is   not an inferior good. In order to show this, consider the straight

line      a1a2a3 which is tangent to both U1U1 and K1K1 at a2
Shifting this line upward without changing its slope until it becomes
tangent to U2U2 we obtain the line a4a5a6 . The point of tangency
between the line a4a5a6 and the indifference curve is a5 . However,
a5 is above and     to   the right of a2 indicating that holding relative
prices     constant an increase   in   income would be associated with both an

increase     in n and e .      Essentially,    the same argtunent can   be made
starting at any    point   on either indifference curve. For example, let us
consider     the straight line b1b2b3 which is tangent to TJ2U2 and K2K2

at point b2 .      A parallel downward shift in that line such that the

resulting line is tangent to U1U1 ,         yields   the line b4b5b6 .     Clearly,
b2 is above and to the right of b5 again indicating that both n

and e are normal goods.

                 In   addition to having no implications for the relationship

    between income and      fertility,   the Becker model also has no implications

    for the effects of market price changes on fertility. Changing p9

    has a pure cross—substitution effect26 on n of unknown sign which is now

    compounded   by an income effect     of unknown sign.     Decreasing p i
    equivalent to     increasing income and increasing PS        but since both of

    the latter two changes result in ambiguous changes In n , even decreasing

        has no clear effect on fertility in the Becker model.27 Therefore,

    since the Becker model has no implications for fertility it cannot

    easily be falsified by observed data. Rather than providing implications

    concerning fertility the Becker model provides a framework for the

    analysis of fertility into which practically all observed data can fit.

                 There is one particularly interesting subtelty of the Becker

    (1960) model that, as Becker and Lewis (1973) have shown, deserves

    attention. In the context of the Becker mod.i,

    the ordering of the observed income elasticities of demand for n and

    e may be the reverse of the ordering of the true income elasticities

    of demand for n and e              Thus, we might observe that the income

    elasticity of demand for e is greater than the income elasticity

    of demand for n ,       but   nonetheless it may be the case that the true

    income elasticity of demand for it         exceeds the true income elasticity

    of demand for a .        One matter which is   clearly implied by   the Becker

    model   is that in dealing with      that model we must   be cautious about
    assuming   that   the   signs or the ordering of true Income elasticities is

    identical to the signs or the ordering of observed income elasticities.

               As a framework for the analysis, the Becker model tells its
                                                                                            .
user that he cannot        learn much   about fertility from     simply   studying income

and   market   prices. In order to understand even the direction in which

fertility responds to an economic change, the Becker model requires

quite a bit of information about the individuaTh tastes. Thus, the

framework of analysis suggested by Becker and Lewis is one in which

the differences in the structures of individuals' taste patterns are

crucial to an understanding of fertility differentials.

            In contrast to the Becker model, in Model II Lhere are implications

for fertility of changes ir economic variables. The implications are


               1. increasing (decreasing) income never causes fertility

                  to fall (rise) and may cause it to rise (fall).

               2. decreasing (increasing) p never causes fertility to

                  fall (rise) and may cause it to rise (fall).

               3. decreasing (increasing)           p5 may cause fertility
                  either to rise or fall.


The first implication may be easily demonstrated. Let us suppose at some

initial income level IWutility is maximized with 3 children. In

other words, e (1)     ,   e (1)    and e (1)                .         (1) .
                                                    are positive and e4,..         (1)
                   1         2
are   zero. As   income increases more      money is spent on each of        the

three   children so that at least three children must be desired             after the

income   increase. However,        the family may choose to have even more

children after the income increase.             This possibility is shown in Figure 5.

In Figure 5, at income level aa , the family chooses not to have any
                                                                                                 .
children, i.e., e1=O . However, increasing income to bb induces the
family to have their first child and e1 becomes positive.
              A similar diagram can be used to illustrate                  the   second impli-
cation. When p          decreases fertility cannot fall because more is spent

on    each. existing child, but fertility may rise. This is shown in Fig. 6
again for the case where the family initially has no children. Given
the constraint aa ,          e1
                                   is zero. When        the constraint shifts to ba ,

because of the decrease in               ,   the    family is induced to have their

first child and e1 becomes positive. A decrease in p5 is equivalent

to an increase in income and an increase                in p c   .   The   increase in
income taken by itself could have a positive effect on fertility and                             )




the increase in PC           taken by itself could have a negative ffect

on fertility and it is impossible to determine a priori which of the

two effects would dominate. Therefore, the effect of a change in p5

on    fertility   is indeterininant.

             Backer and Lewis proved, in the context of the Becker model,

that although n ,        e   ,    and   s are assumed      to    be normal goods,      fl.




or    e may decrease as income increases. In Model II, which

treats   each child separately, when the arguments of the utility function
are   all normal goods, n can never decrease as income increases. Perhaps

this   added ambiguity in the Becker model concerning the effect of observed

income changes on fertility is a point in its favor because observed

fertility variations have indeed been both positively and negatively

associated with income. But some caution is suggested here. Any associ-

ations may be rationalized within a framework which does not restrict the

direction or magnitude of association. This is one reason economists have

chosen to assume children are not an inferior good and have reasoned,

therefore, that children ought to be treated in our models as if they were

consumer durables. If the Becker model of quantity—quality interaction

is appropriate for both children and consumer durables, then why do we

often observe negative income elasticities of ttdemandt for children,

whereas in the case of consumer durables positive observed income elas-

ticities are almost invariably observed. Within the context of the model

the answer could only be that tastes for children are really different

from tastes for durables. While this answer is better than no answer,

there will be those who would argue that the same answer could have

obtained without a model of quanity—quality interaction.

            Before completing the. comparison of the Becker model with the

standard demand theory model of fertility, there are a few minor points

to be mentioned. In the Becker model, given fixed money income and fixed

prices, PC and p      ,   the values of n , e   ,   and s which maximize

the utiliity function need not be unique. This is shown in Figure 7.

In that figure it is assumed that utility is mazimized when the quantity

   of    s is consumed and that assumption underlies the drawing of

both the constraint ab and     the   indifference curve           UU .    Clearly   a

multiplicity of solutions are possible in this case and, as it                is    drawn,

utility    is maximized at points A, ,      A2   ,   and   A3 .    Thus   far we have
ignored this problem and we shall assume it away in the remainder of
the    chapter.

              another minor point is that in the Becker model             there is a
quality   dimension in only one of the two goods, children. Adding a

quality dimension to the other good complicates the model considerably and

weakens whatever hope. there was     of   ever putting the Becker model to

an empirical test.28 Another aspect of the Becker model is that, although

both    n and e are asstmied to be normal goods,           even their product,
                                           27 —



I   total real expenditures on children (cne)         , need   not be normal with
    respect to observed income changes. It is possible, in the Becker model,
    for total real expenditures on children to decrease with an increase
    in income29 while in Model II total real expenditures on children must
    increase when income increases.
                 In   the end, the a priori choice between the Becker model and

    the alternative model boils down to the question of how relevant one

    believes the form of quality—quantity interaction (specified in the

    Becker model) to be in the case of fertility decisions. Model II,

    where relative prices do not change with income, is certainly easier to

    analyze and manipulate, but it treats each child as a separate entity

    just like each item in the household's consumption basket. Model II,

    which is, in fact, the standard demand theory model, thus fails to

    reflect certain sociological or psychological constraints upon the

    freedom of a family to select a "consumption mix."

                 Ironically in capturing the influence of such constraints upon fert-

    ility decisions, the Becker model comes closer
                                                       to recognizing the range of con-
    siderations which underlay Leibenstein's
                                                  treatment of fertility. One source of
    quantity—quality interaction, for example, may lie in parents' desire

    to make the same real expenditures on each child. In today's environ-

    ment in   the United States of small families in which the children are
    relatively   closely spaced, it seems plausible to believe that real

    expenditures per child do not differ much across children in the

    same family. This would perhaps justify treating the average real

    expenditure per child as a separate argument of the utility function ——
                                  28-

it would be an index of the family's (uniform) child—rearing style.


          Taking a more historical view, however, there seems to be reasons to
doubt that expenditures per child were equalized across children in

the family. Inheritance practices, of course, varied across time and

space, but it was not unusual for a farm to be divided unequally between

a farmer's heirs.3° In the United States earlier in this century it

was not uncommon for some children of the family to be sent to work

so that other children (brothers, usually) could be sent to school.3'

Therefore, it is not clear that observed regularities in behavior at

one time are most usefully treated as sociological or psychological

constraints operating on utility functions for all times. If there

is a modern social convention which influences parents to spend equally

on each child, it certainly owes much to the small size of the modern

family. To accept the convention as operating at all times can add

an element to circularity to any explanation of the decline in fertility

over time. An appropriate historical model should be able to account

for diversity in expenditures per child and the possible convergence

of these expenditures over time. In this regard, Model II, being more

general, must be judged to be preferable to the Becker model as a frame-

work for analysis.



The Household_Viewed as a Production Structure: The Willis Model of
  Fertility Decisions


          The analysis of household fertility decisions recently advanced
         32
by Willis   represents the combination and development of two   lines   of
                                              — 29 —



    approach, both suggested by Becker. The result            is   the most sophisticated

    and powerful model of fertility choice generally known to economists.

    Willis combined the Becker model of fertility discussed abgve with the

    concepts of household production and time allocation pioneered by Muth33

    and Becker.34 The two      threads,   however, can exist separately or in

    combination with other strands of thought. Becker and Lewis35 have

    shown that it is possible to analyze quantity—quality interactions in

    the Becker model without considering the structure of household pro-

    duction and below it will be shown that the structure of household

    production may   be   usefully placed in a model without the specific form
                                                                                36
    of quantity—quality interaction envisioned in the Becker model.

               The structure of the Willis model is as follows:


                            Model III: The Willis Model

     (9)         Maximize        U =    f(n,e,s)               utility function

           Assumptions:     (i) G( )    and H( ) are homogeneous of degree one.
                           (ii) H( )    is more intensive in the wife's time than         G( )•37

where    f( ) is a utility function; G( ) is a household production

whose output is childservices, c ; tc and X         are the quantities

of the wife's time and market goods respectively used in the production

of childservices; e is the average quantity of childservices per

child;38 T is the total amount of time the wife has available during

the period in question39 and t, is the amount      of   time she spends   in
the   labor market; V is total family money income during the period

in question excluding the wife's earnings in the labor market; w' is

the wife's wage rate if she participates in the labor market4° and
                                                                          p,

           A few words of comment are necessary here. Clearly, the Willis

model is not a complete model of fertility in the sense that there are

many plausible additions wich might still be introduced, even though as

it stands it constitutes a significant elaboration of the original Becker

model. For the purpose of creating models which have analytic implica-

dons, it is certainly important to abstract from all but the most impor-

tant aspects of the problem, but this does not mean that the specification

of the model is beyond question. Rather than probing the model for those

assumptions which are crucial and for those which are not, let us proceed

to a brief discussion of the model's properties.        After the model has

been put through its paces we shall return to the question of whether
                                            — 31 —


p
    it would have performed any differently had its assumptions been
    altered.

               At first glance the only portion of the Willis model which

    resembles the Becker model is the utility function. However, their

    similarities run   considerably   deeper. Since C and H are homogeneous

    of degree one, the derived demand functions for their inputs may be

    written as follows:41


    (15)                       t =
                                      g(w,p)s
    (16)                       x5 =   g(w,p)s
    (17)                       tc =   ht(w.p)c
    (18)                       x =    h(w,p)c
    where among other restrictions on                   they are all homogeneous

    of degree zero.42 If the wife is in the labor force we know that:

    (19)                       t
                                £
                                    =T—tC —tS #0
    and substituting this value of t into the budget constraint yields

    (20)                V + w'T =   w't C     xc + w'tS + p xs
                                            + p x            x

    If the wife is not in the labor market multiplying equation (13) by

    her "shadow wage rate", w*, and adding the resulting equation to equa-

    tion (14) yields

    (21)                V + w*T =   w*t c + p x + w*tS + p x
                                             xc           xs
    Equation (20) is the constraint binding the household If the wife is in

    the labor force and equatIon (21) is the constraint if she is not.

                                           -32-


Substituting equations (15) — (18) first into equation (20) and then into

equation (21) we obtain


(22)      V + w'T =
                         s(w'g(w' ,p   )+pg(w',p )) + c(w'h(w',p)+ph(w',P))

and


                         s(w*g(w*,p )+pg(w*,p )) + c(w*h(w*,p)+ph(w*,p))
(23)      V + w*T =


          If we write


(24)      I=V+wT
(25)      p5 =   wg.(wP) + Pg(waP)
(26)      Pc =   wh(w,p    )   +ph(v,p)
then we obtain


(27)      I =
                ps   +

and making use of equation (12)


(28)      I ps + pane

which is identical in form to the budget constraint in the Becker model.43

Thus both the Willis model and the Becker model may be written


(29)      Maximize              U =    f(n,e,s)
(30)      subject to            I =            +   pcne

However, in the Becker model p5        ,   p       and I are exogenous, whereas in
                                               44
the Willis model they are endogenous.

              There is somewhat less than meets the eye in this simi-

    larity between the Becker and Willis models because the budget constraint

    in the Willis model is really a combination of one constraint which is

    binding when the wife is in the labor market and one which is binding

    when she is not.45 This situation is shown In Figure 8.

    The curve c'as' Is the production possibilities frontier associated with

    equations Q.O. (1l. Q.3 and (14). The nonlinear portion c' a shows the

    situation In which the wife is not working in the labor market and the

    linear portion as' shows the situation in which she is working in the

    labor market. The cause of this rather unusual production possibilities

    curve may be stated simply. When the wife participates in the labor mar-

    ket her wage rate is fixed (by assumption) at w' regardless of how many

    hours she works and therefore p5 and c remain fixed. Moving upwards

    and to the left along the production possibilities frontier from s'a

    causes the wife's hours of work to decline steadily46 until at point a

    the wife stops working in the labor market. Continuing along the curve

from a to c', the wife's shadow wage rate rises because of the

assumption that c production is more time intensive than s production.47

The increase in the wife's shadow wage causes the price of c to rise

relative to the price of s and this is reflected in the curvature of

the constraint between a and c'.

          The Willis model has four exogenous variables, V, w, T, and

   •   Unfortunately, without further assumptions the model has no

implication for the direction of the change in fertility for any given

change in one of the exogenous variables. Changes in V, w, T, and p,

produce income effects and alter      and p5 .   Once the income and

relative price effects are identified, the analysis of the model is

identical to that of the Becker model. However, the Becker model as we

have seen has no implications for fertility. In the Willis model a

change in a single exogenous variable often produces both income and

relative price effects and, in this case, the amalgam of changes, each

of which may be positively or negatively related to fertility, stifl

produces a fertility response whose direction is indeterminant. None-

theless, the framework of the model is quite useful and Willis has been

able to extrac1 from it quite a plausible explanation of observed

cross—sectional fertility differentials. This explanation will be

discussed in connection with Model IV below.48


A Standard Demand Theory Version of the Willis Model


           The ambiguity with regard to implications for fertility in

the Willis Model has two roots: the specification of the utility
                                      — 35    —




function   and the specification of the production structure. It is

helpful in understanding the Willis model to separate the influences

of these two segments of the structure and to consider a modified

model with the production structure of the Willis model and the utility

formulation of Model II above. This model may be written

                                                                                 50
                         (iii) s and C1 through          c   are tormal goods;


where c is the output of childservices from the i—th child, t

is the   wife's time   spent on the i—th child, and x1 is the quantity

of goods spent on the i—th child. Otherwise, all the variables are

defined as above for the Willis model. As in the Willis model, it is

assumed    that C and II are     homogeneous of degree one and that the
                                       — 36   —




production    of childservices is more intensive in the wife's time       than
is    the production of s .     However, Model IV makes   the   additional, assump-

tion that the production functions for childservices are independent of

parity. This is an assumption whose merits can scarcely go unquestioned.5'

Nonetheless, as a simplification which aids us in understanding the

Willis model it is quite useful.

            Model IV combines the endogeneous relative prices of the

Willis model with the utility function of Model II. Once the income and

relative    price effects due to some change in the exogenous variables

are determined, the analysis of Model IV becomes identical to the

analysis of Model II. In Model IV, the constraint facing the house-

hold may be written



                       Pccl + pc2 + ... +
(38)        V + wT =                          PcCm +

            where       =
(39)
                            wh(w,p) + ph(w,p)
(40)        and p = wg(w,p) + pg(w,p)

This constraint differs from that in Model II only in that the income

concept is full income rather than money income and in that prices are

endogenous.    The distinction between whether the wife is in or out of
the    labor force remains important in Model IV. Let     us    make the following

definition:


(4l)                   cc +c
                          1
                             +...
                             2
                                  +cm
or, in words, c is equal to total childservices. Now the constraint

faced by the household may be simply written52

I   (42)                    V + wT =     +   pe

    The constraint is identical to the constraint in the Willis model and

    has nonlinear and linear segments as shown in Figure 8.

                 Because of the differences in the utility functions between

    Model III and Model IV the latter has some implications for fertility. A

    discussion of the implications of Model IV follows. If the wife is

    in the labor force both before and after an increase in husband's

    income, V, then this increase must cause fertility to increase or

    remain constant, but it can never cause it to decline.          An analogous

    statement is also true for an increase in T

                 If the wife is in the labor force both before and after an
    Increase in either V or T , full income increases and relative
    prices remain fixed.53 This        is identical to the situation in Model II

    where income increased and it was shown below that in that situation

    fertility could not decrease and possibly could increase.54 If the

    wife is Out of the labor force both before and after an increase in

    V ,    then the sign   of the change in   fertility is indeterminant. Why

    are    the implications for fertility of an increase in     V different
    for   women In and out of the labor market? They differ because if the
    wife Is in the labor force an increase in V is essentially identical
    to an increase in I in Model II. However, if the wife is not in the
    labor   force and increase in V has both an income and a relative price

    effect. This is due to a result known         as Rybczynski's   Theorem.55 For

    our present purposes Rybczynski's Theorem states that if G( )           and
                                     -38-


H( )   are both homogeneous of degree one, if H( )             is   more time        inten-
sive than G( ) ,       if the wife is not in the labor market and if

            i) increasing V , the relative price ratio,                  ,    will   equal

                                        and        <         This       may   be    seen

graphically in Figures 9 and 10.56 In Figure 9 the relative price

ratio, ps/p      is identical at points a and b . However, if the
                   ,



family initially consumed at point a it could not consume at point b

after the increase in V without violating the assumption that c was

a normal good. All points on the constraint which do not violate this
normality   assumption must be above and tothe left of point b and
have a   relative price ratio greater than he relative price ratios at
points a and b .'       Therefore,     if   c is   a normal good its relative
price must increase as V    increases.      Thus, increasing V                has   an income
effect which cet. p.    wouldcause fertility to increase and a relative
price effect which cet. 2!.• would cause fertility to decline and the
combination   of these two effects has an indeterminant sign.

            In the case of increasing T ,     both     the income and the relative

price effects work in the same direction, toward increasing fertility.

In Figure 10, which shows the effect of increasing T ,                  the   relative
              p
price ratios     are identical at points a and b .                      If   the family

                                      could not consume at point b after
    the increase in T without violating the assumption that s was a
    normal good. Therefore, all points consistent with the assumption that
    a    is a normal good must lie below and to the right of point b along

    the constraint. At aU such points, however, the relative price ratio

    the relative price effect reinforce each other in this instance and
    therefore fertility cannot fall.

                If the wife is out of the labor force before and after an in-

    crease in the market wage rate w' ,     her    fertility is unaffected by

    that change. If the wife is in the labor market both before             and after
    an   increase in the market wage rate, the effect of this change upon

    fertility is indeterminant. The increase in the wife's market wage

    has an income effect which cet. . would (by assumption) cause

    fertility to increase. flowever, the increase in w'        ,   causes    c to
    rise relative to p5t,59 and other things being equal, this, in turn,

    would cause a decline in fertility and the resultant of these two

    forces acting in opposite directions is of indeterminant sign.

               From considerations similar to these Willis derives an empiri-

    cally testable "mixture model" of fertility which he uses to explain

    nonlinearjties in observed cross—sectional fertility patterns.60 The

    fundamental assertions of the "mixture model" are, cet.

               i) the effect on fertility of increasing the husband's income

    is greater (i.e. more positive or less negative) when the wife's wage

    rate is higher than when it Is lower;

          ii)   the effect on fertility of increasing the wife's wage

 rate is greater (i.e. more positive or less negative) when the husband's

 income is lower than when it is higher.


 The assertions which comprise the "mixture model" are not implications

of either Model III or Model IV, but rather are plausible interpre-

tations of these models. Statement 1) is derived from the following

argument. Holding everything else constant increasing wives' wage rates

tends to increase wives' labor force participation rates.61 The effect

of an increase in the husband's income has a positive effect on fer-

tility if the wife is in the labor force and an ambiguous effect if

she is not. It is plausible, although not certain, that the effect

of an increase is V on fertility is smaller if the wife is not in

the labor force than if she is. Indeed, it is quite plausible that the

effect of increasing V Is to increase the fertility when the wife

is in the labor force and to decrease it when she Is not. If It is

true that the effect on fertility of increasing V is greater when the

wife is in the labor market then when she is not, then the impact of

an increase in V is greater the greater the wive's labor force par—

ticipation rate.

          Statement ii) is derived from the following argument. Holding

everything else constant, increasing husband's incomes causes wives'

labor force participation rate to decrease.62 Increasing the wives'

wage rates only affects the fertility of women in the labor market.

If increasing wives' wage rates causes fertility to decline then as

wives' labor force participation rates decrease, due to increases in V ,

I   it is likely the negative effect of increasing w would diminish. In
    the extreme case where wives' labor force participation rates were zero

    there would be no negative effect at all. Nonlinearities in fertility

    differentials of the sort described in statements i) and ii) have been
                                               63
    found in a wide array of fertility data.

              The implications sketched above would be essentially identi-

    cal to the considerations in the Willis model for determining fertility

    if c entered the utility function as a normal good and fertility was

    assumed to vary directly with c .   However,    c does not enter the

    utility function at all; in its place are the separate arguments n

    and e .   The added difficulty involved in such an approach, discussed

    above in terms of the Becker model, turns all the sign implications of

    the Model IV into ambiguous results and complicates the ambiguity of

    those situations irr which the sign implications for fertility are already

    unclear. Thus entertaining the Becker form of the utility function as

    opposed to a utility structure which treats each child as a separate

    entity has a substantial cost within the context of the Willis model.

    One would exepct' economists to accept it only if there was some sub—

    stantial benefit from doing so. To date, the existence of such bene-

    fits remains to be established.

              There are clearly a number of facets of the Willis model which

    can be elaborated and extended. However, sociologists frequently argue

    that there is one particular portion of the model which is not in need

    of elaboration or extension, but rather a candidate for removal: the

    utility function. The core of this objection may be separated into two
                                  — 43 —




parts.   The first half of the objection is that   fertility   control is

not perfect and parents often complete their childbearing years with

a number of children different from their preferred number.64 The

second half of the objection is that people        not choose their pre-

ferred number of children in a manner which seems rational or cons is—

tent from the point of view of an economic decision—making model.65

Acceptance of the latter conetntion, it should be noted, would under-

Cut Leibenstein's approach no less than Becker's ——    the   presence of

some significant degree of implicit sociology in both formulations

notwithstanding.

           The first objection can be eliminated within the framework

of models of utility—maximizing behavior by assuming that families

choose a contraceptive strategy rather than directly choosing a number

of children.66 The normative model then involves maximization of the

family's exepcted utility over possible contraceptive strategies. This

formulation may satisfy the first objection, but it certainly would not

satisfy the second. In orderto satisfy the second objection altogether

another framework for analysis is needed.



Modelling Fertility Behavior Without the Utility Maximization Hypothesis

           There is another framework in which models of household pro-

duction may fruitfully be viewed and which satisfies the second objec-

tion. That framework includes a statistical representation of the

behavior of a group of households. I have shown elsewhere67 that       it
                                    —44—



is possible to develop a demand theoretic structure for group behavior

which did not presume that individual consuming units maximized a

utility function or acted according to a consistent set of preferences.

In order to accomplish this, assumptions about distributions of purchases

and how they change when economic conditions change were substituted

for assumptions about individuals' maximizing behavior.

          Let us now consider another model of fertility which makes

use of the household production framework; this time a statistical

model of aggregate fertility behavior which does not assume anything

about the utility functions of individual families. First however,

some introductory comments are needed.

          Standard demand theory envisions a single household making

choices subject to a constraint. These models, then, have two main

parts, the constraint and the representation of the individual's pre-

ferences. All the four models of fertility which have been discussed

above are of this nature. The statistical model of fertility behavior

which shall be considered below envisions a large number of households,

all of whom are subject to the same constraint.   Using Model IV as an

example, in Figure 1]. the standard demand analysis Is concerned with

how much c and s a single household will choose to consume':when it

is subject to the constraint   a1a2a3 .    If the household chooses a
point on the arc a1a2 the wife will not participate in the labor market.

If the household chooses a point on the line segment a2a3 ,   then   the

wife will participate in the labor market. In contrast, the statistical

model of fertility behavior considers a large number of households
                                     —45—



distributed along the constraint. In general, there will be some house-

holds in which the wife participates in the labor market and some in

which she does not. Each household, though, consumes a particular

combination of s and c .       Let us suppose that there are m house-
holds whose consumption bundles are located at various points along the

constraint. The quantities of s and c consumed may be ordered from

the largest to the smallea so that

                       > 5 > ... —m

           and

                       >c >...>c
                              —m
We denote the ordered set of the s by {s} and the ordered set of the

c1 by {c} and call them the distribution of s and the distribution of

c respectively.

          The distributions of s and c may be represented graphically

by their distribution (or cumulative density) functions. Figure 11 shows

a constraint and its associated distribution of c •68      In Figure 11,

d1 is the proportion of families, subject to the constraint a1a2a3

which are childless. Generally, for any given quantity of childservices

consumed, say c2, the distribution function tells what percentage of

the families subject to the constraint consume a quantity of childservices

less than or equal to c2 .     Thus in Figure 1]- f percent of the house-

holds in question consume a quantity to c less than or equal to
                                                                     c2
Since all women for whom c <
                               c2 are in the labor force, f is also
the wives' labor force participation rate. In Figure 11, a graph of

the distribution of s was not included, but it is logically no less

important than the distribution of c ;             it   can be derived from the con-

straint and the distribution of c in this two—dimensional case.

           The major difference between the standard demand theory model

and the new demand theory model being considered here is that the standard

demand theory model consists of a constraint and a representation of the

tastes of a single household, while the new demand theory model consists

of a constraint and representations of purchase distributions of a large

group of households. Standard demand theory does not get very far on

constraints and utility functions alone and it has become standard prac-

tice to assume that the arguments of the utility function are normal

goods. Similarly the new demand theory does not get very far until an

analogous normality assumption is made. Before such an assumption can

be made, however, we must make the following definition.



Definition of an increase in the opportunity to consume a household
commodity:

           Let us consider a n—dimensional production possibilities curve,

given the prices and income in situation i(i1 or 2)69 which we write


                   =   L1 (Z                                    (i)
                                                                        ..    (i)
              jk           1k'    2k'          '
                                                    j—l,k   '
                                                                Zj+lk        Zflk

where Z is the maximum amount of household commodity j which can

be produced by household k given the resources in situation I and

given that it also produces the quantities of the other household commodi-

ties specified as arguments in the L1 function. If (Z                               ...,

    (Zj_i,k) (Z.k) ...         Z)       is infeasible70 then Z is zero. If the

    production possibilities curves in situations 1 and 2 differ such that

    over all points (Z                ...                     ...,
                                                                     Z)   which are

    feasible either in situation 1 or in situation 2

    and

                ii) there exists       some point (Z            ..., z9                  ..., Z)
    such that         >
                                    (z < z)
    then we say that the opportunity to consume household commodity j is

    greater   (smaller) in situation 2 than in situation 1




    Normality   Assumption: If       the opportunity to consume      Z is greater
    (smaller)   in situation    2    than in situation    1   then

                      z> Z (Z< Z)                         for        k = 1,   ...,   m




                In essence, the normality assumption asks our forebearance
    in the assertion that whenever the         constraint shifts upward and to the

    right, the distribution functions of the quantities purchased of each

    good also shift to the right.

            Now we may state a household production model of fertility

behavior which does not assume that each family maximizes a utility

function.


            Model V: A Model of Fertility Without Utility Maximization


(43)                       s =
                                 G(t5,x5)
                           c =
(44)                             H(tc,xc,n)

(46)                                    xc 5
                           V + wt = p (x + x )

            Assumptions:     (i) C and H are homothetic production functions,

                            (ii) H is more intensive in the wives' time than C

                           (iii) there are m households consuming at various

                                    points along the households' production

                                    possibilities frontier,

                            (iv) s and c are normal goods in the sense of

                                    normality given above,

                             (v) wives' time and numbers of children are

                                    complementary in the production of childservices.


             Model V differs from the original Willis model in a number of

ways. The most obvious difference is that there is no utility function

in Model V. It has been replaced by the assumption that there are m

households consuming at various points on their production possibilities

frontier. Another difference is that in the Willis model G( )            and   H( )

were assumed to be homogeneous of degree one while in Model V G( )             and      S
                                               —50—


I
     H(   )    are just assumed to be homothetic production functions, a consider-

     able generalization of the initial Willis specification.              The childser—

    vices production function here differs from that in the original Willis

    model in that here the childservjceg production function includes the

    number of children, whereas in the Willis model the quantity of child—

    services         did not   depend on the number of children. Indeed, in     all four
    previous models, it was assumed that holding the number of children
    constant it was always possible to increase childservices by any
    tnulitple        so long as time and goods inputs into children were increased
    by    that multiple. In these models it is never envisioned that spending
    ever more time and          goods on a fixed number   of   children could ever lead
    to    diminishing returns. In the specification used in Model V, if G(;)
    and       H( )    were   homoegeneous of degree one, a doubling,    for example,

    of c could be obtained by doubling the time and goods spent on children
    and the number of children; doubling the time and goods spent on child-
    ren without increasing the number would not double childservices, but
    rather increase it by a smaller multiple.
                     Putting the number of children into the childservices produc-
    tion      function is not without some difficulty, however. If          n is   to be
    treated     as an input, it must have a price either in terms of wives'

    time, market        goods   or both. The question then becomes, "how much does

    a live birth cost in terms of market goods and the wife's time?" In

    Model V, n appears in neither the wives' time constraint nor the

    budget constraint. In other words, it is assumed that the time and money



I
                                      —51—



costs of producing a live birth are zero. In reality of course, this is

not the case, but I have excluded them from this particular model for

ease' of exposition. Further, I do not believe their inclusion would

aid in the explanation of either time series trends or cross—sectional

differentials in fertility. This is not a crucial simplification,

however; the reader may easily produce the modifications needed to

treat both a time and a money cost of producing a live birth. Since,

in this model live births are costless, the production function H

must be one such that the marginal product of children can become zero
                                           72
when n is within a plausible range.

          The derived demand functions drawn from equations (43) and

(44) may be written


(47)                      = g1(w,p,)      (s)


(48)                  x5 =  g(w,p) 4 (s)
                      t   =
(49)                        h(w,p) 'P (c)
(50)                  x   = h(w,p) 'P (c)

(51)                  n =              'P (c)
                            hn(WPx)

where, among other restrictions,                and h    are homogeneous

of degree zero and where 4(s) and 'P(c) are strictly increasing
                                73
functions of their arguments.

          The time and budget consgraints, equations (45) and (46) may

be combined into a single equation as was done in equation (27) above.

Thus we obtain:


 (52)   V +wT = c(s) (wg(w,p) + pg(w,p)) + 'P(c)(wh(w,p)          + PxhxPx
                                                 —52—



 and

 where p      and           are defined as in equations (25) and (26) above.

 Clearly, if this constraint is interpreted as relating s) and ''(c)

 rather than s and c              ,   it   is identical to the constraint relating         s

 and    c   in the case of linear homogeneous production functions. Equa-

 tion (53), which is graphically represented in Figure 8, has                 a   linear

segment for the situation in which women are in the labor force and

a nonlinear segment covering the situation in which women are not in

the labor force.

     with   the distribution function e1e2e3 .          Rybczynski's            Theorem74 tells

     us that the point b2 must always be above and to the left of
                                                                                           a2
     Since by the Normality Assumption, the distribution function
                                                                                         e1e2e3

    wives' labor force participation rate after the increase in V ,                           2(2)
    in Figure 12, must be below           ,    the-wives'       labor force participation

    rate before the increase in v .            In   the case of m discrete house-

    holds it is only possible to show that the labor force participation rate

    of wives' cannot Increase when V increases.76

                Let us suppose, then, that              women are in the labor mar-

    ket before the increase in V and that q(2)                  women are in the labor

    market after the increase in V                          (2)           (1)
                                      .       Clearly   q         <   q         .    Let us
    write

    (56)
                        q(2)              h(w',p) 4(c2))

    where w' is the market wage rate.

               The terms 1) and 2) are the                  average fertility analogs
    of the Willis model concepts of the fertility of a woman who was in the

    labor force both before and after an increase In V .                    In      this case,

    however, it is not necessary to assume that we have observed the same

    women both before and after an Increase in V            .     Even if the same women

    are observed the q(2) women considered in                                         need not be

the same as those considered in computing 2)                 .                It   is important to

note that although 2) is the average fertility of women in the labor

force after an increase V ,              t41 is not the average fertility of
women in the labor force before the increase. Rather nj1 is the

average fertility of the              q(2) women in the labor market with the

lowest values of c or what amounts to the same thing in this model,

the highest numbers of hours worked in the labor force.78

            Now it is easy to prove that                 >                .        The proof pro-

ceeds as follows
                                                  m
                —(1)

                                              _
(57)                                                                  )

                                 q

and


                -(2)
                          h(w',p)
(58)                                                     (c2)) .
                                q              >m(2)+1
                                              jm-q
Therefore   to complete the proof It is only necessary to show that



(59)                          (c2))       >
                   (2)
                         +1

However, statement (59) follows directly from
            (i) 'Y( )     is   a strictly increasing function of c
and                                                                                                  79

                              c.(1)    j=l,... ,m (because of the Normality Assumptiton ).


Thus, we have demonstrated that the average fertility of comparable groups
of women in the labor market increases as husbands' income increases.

This result is clearly similar to the result in Model IV, for increasing

V while the wife remains in the labor market.

    labor force both before and after an increase in V ,                   the   resulting

    direction of the fertility change could not be predicted. A similar

    statement concerning average fertility can be made for Model V. Let

               be the number of women not participating in the larbor market at

    the lower level of V and let r2 be the number not participating

    at the higher level of V .              Clearly, r2 >       rW    .    Now let

                                    (1)
                  —(2) =
    (60)
                           r1      jl h(w2,p) (c2))

                  —(1) —     1            h (w     ,p ) IV(c.
                       —
                                   L       n j       x          )

                           r (1)   j=l

    The average fertilities of comparable groups of women not in the labor

    force before and after an increase in V ,                        and    2) , respec-
    tively, have no determinant relationship to one- another. In order to

    see this clearly it is sufficient to note that

                   (i) ((2)) >            ((l))          since 2) >
                                                                          l)         k=1,...
                  (ii) h(w2               < h(w , since w2           >

                   The analysis of Model V can continue in the same vein until

    it is shown that for every implication for fertility in Model IV is

    matched by an analogous result for average fertility in Model V. Let

    us consider next what happens when T is greater in situation 2 than

    in situation 1. This case is shown in Figure 13.

I   In    Figure 13 the axes in the upper panel are the reverse of what they

    were in Figure 12. The constraint a1a2a3 is associated with the

    distribution function d1d2d3 and the constraint b1b2b3 is associated

    with the distribution function

    force participation rate in situation 2, which 100 —                            per     cent, must
    be greater than 100 —               per cent, the wives' labor force participation
    rate in situation 1. In the case of a discrete number of families, if T

    is higher in situation 2 than in situation 1, then the wive's labor force

    participation rate must be at least as great in situation 2 as in situation 1.

           Let qW be the number of women in the labor force in situation 1

    and let q(2) be the number of women in the labor force in situation

    The observation that                >          follows      directly from the Normality

decreases as T increases.

the labor force, if T is greater in situation 2 than in situation 1 then

average fertility can be no lower in situation 2 than in situation 1.

            The implications of Model V f or the signs of changes in average

fertility due to changes in the wives' market wage rate are again analogous

to the implications of Model IV. Let the wives' market wage rate be greater

in situation 2 than in situation 1. This case is shown in Figure 14.

The constraint a1a2a3a4 is associated with the distribution function

d1e1d2d3 and the constraint a1a2b3 is associated with the distribution

function d1e1e2e3                .           The distribution function beneath that portion of

the constraint which does not shift cannot shift either.81 Thus both

situation 1 and 2 share the arc a1a2 on the constraint and the arc

d1e1 on the distribution function. Since point a2 must lie to the

right of a3 ,           with     a higher market wage rate, the wive's labor force

participation rate, 100 —                               per   cent must be greater than 100 —

per cent, the wive's labor force participation rate when their market wage
rate is lower. In the case of a discrete number of families, increasing

the           wage rate can never cause a decrease in their labor force

participation rate.

              Let us suppose that in situation 1, with the lower wage rate,

       women do not work and that in situation 2, r2 women do not work.

Clearly r (1)       >    r (2)           .       In   this case it may easily be shown that


                               (2)                                               (1)

(6)                                          hn(W2
                                                                 (c) =                 hn(W1     ((1))
              r(2) jl                                                    r2)   j=l

Equation must hold because

              (i)                    =        (1)
                          j                  J
                                                                    r

                                             W
In other words, equation (66) must be true because the first r2 points

on the constraints in both situations must be identical. We have just

shown that the average fertilities of comparably defined groups of women

who do not participate at either the higher or the lower wage rate remain

identical regardless of the wage rate change.

            The average fertility of comparably defined groups of women

in the labor force may either be greater or smaller in situation 2 as

compared to situation 1. Let q(l) be the number of women who parti-

cipate in the labor market in situation 1 and q(2) be their number in

situation 2. Clearly q(2) >                   qW    •    Let   us define the following average

This completes the discussion of the implications Of Model                         V

           We have just demonstrated that without the assumption                        of

utility   maximization it       is       possible to construct        a household production

model   which comes to essentially the same conclusions as the original
Willis model. The main          differences             between the Willis model and the
statistical     aggregate model presented here are:
                                  -63-



          1. The Willis model assumes that a single household maximizes

its utility function whereas the present model deals with aggregates and

substitutes postulates on group behavior for the postulates on indivi-

dual behavior used in the Willis model.

          2. The present model yields implications for changes in aver-

age behavior for discrete changes in the independent variables while

the Willis model yields implications for a single family's behavior for

infinitesimal changes in the independent variables.

          3. More general homothetic production functions were used

in the present model as opposed to linear homogeneous production func-

tions in the Willis model.


That with all these changes the implications of the Willis model remain

essentially unchanged shows that the features of the production

ture embedded in the original Willis model give rise to conclusions

which are quite robust.



The Non—Utilitarian Model of Fertility: Some Future Developments

          In addition to implications analogous to those of the Willis

model, Model V potentially has implications which go quite beyond any-

thing in the Willis model. Of all the models considered in this chapter

only Model V could have implications for changes in the partiy distri-

bution of fertility. The other models deal only with a single family so

that their parity distributions of fertility are nothing but single

points. In contrast, Model V deals with a large group of families; it
                                       —64—



p
    envisions   a situation in which, given the same values of the exogenous

    variables, some families will have many children, some will have a few,

    and some will have none at all. Since marked changes over time have

    been observed in parity distributions of fertility in the U.S., it

    would be interesting to discover if the implications of Model V for

    changes in   the parity distribution accord with the observed changes.
    This is   a new and complex topic whose full treatment would require a

    separate monograph. Rather than treating it here, the derivation of

    these implications shall be deferred until after the observed changes

    in parity distributions have been discussed in Chapters 3 and 4.

                Another possible line of development of Model V is toward a

    reinterpretation of the Easterlin—Fuchs intergenerational relative income

    hypothesis. Since Model V allows for the consideration of discrete

    changes in exogenous variables, we may use It as an intergenerational

    model of fertility. Let us consider two situations, the first repre-

    senting the lifetime economic conditions facing the parent generation

    and the second representing the lifetime economic conditions facing their

    children's generation. We assume that the husbands' real income and the

    wives' real wage rate are higher in the children's generation than in

    the parents;, but that the wives' time constraint is identical in both

    generations. The production possibilities frontiers for the parents'

    and the children's generations are shown below in Figure 15. As it

    stands, this intergenerational model of fertility has no implications

    for fertility either for women who are in the labor market or for those

    who are not.

p             The reason for this lack of implications is not because of a

    change in tastes, for in Model V this would have to be manifested by a

    violation of the Normality Assumption stated above. Rather, with the

    Normality Assumption inviolate, the absence of implications arises

    because increases in husbands' Income and the wives' wage rates gener-

    ate conflicting income and substitution effects, both in the case where

    the wife is in the labor market and in the case where she is not.82

    Must the model be discarded as unilluminating, or is it possible to

    obtain from it some reasonably firm implications about fertility behavior?

    In order to obtain some implications, it Is necessary to say something

    about the distributions of c and s and it is here that the inter-

    generational relative income hypothesis plays a role.

              The Easterlin—Fuchs intergenerational relative income hypo-

    thesis suggests that young people's tastes and expectations regarding

    their material standards of living are formed when they are adolescents

    in their parents' households. For ease of exposition let us consider an

    extreme form of this hypothesis which states that the distribution of

    s in the children's generation depends the economic conditions they

    experienced as adolescents, but not on their own   economic conditions.83
    If the economic conditions of the children's generation differ from

    what they expected on the basis of their adolescent experiences, the

    entire difference is absorbed by changes in their production of child—

    services. Clearly in this extreme form, the Easterlin—Fuchs hypothesis

    Is analogous to Friedman's permanent income hypothesis,84 with child—

    services playing the role of savings in the Friedman model.

                 However, even given the extreme version of the Easterlln—Fuchs

    hypothesis Model V is short on implications for intergenerational fertility

    differentials. In order to see this let us consider the following con-

    ceptual experiment. Let us consider dividing a cOhort of adults who

    have had the same adolescent background into two groups, one of which

    experiences lower economic growth and therefore faces the lifetime con-

    straint a1a5 and the other experiences more rapid economic growth and
                                      This situation is shown in Figure 16.
    therefore faces the lifetime constraint b1b5 .       / If
                                                          the distribution

    of s is the same for both groups because their adolescent experiences

    were identical then the jth (kth) family (in the distribution of s )
    would consume at a2(a4) given the lower rate of economic growth and

    at b (b )      given   the higher rate of economic growth. Nonetheless, the

    model has no implications for fertility since without further restric-

    tions it is impossible to tell whether fertility is higher or lower

    at b2(b4) than at a2(a4) since not only is            (c) higher at b2(b4)
    than at a2(a4) but the wives' wage rate is also higher at       b2(b4) than
    at a2(a4) .        The positive income effect and the negative relative price

    effect offset one another leaving no a priori sign for the change in

    fertility.

                 Thus even with the addition of the Easterlin—Fuchs hypothesis

    in its extreme form Model V is not sufficiently articulated to produce

    implications for intergenerational fertility changes. Clearly, additional

    specifications must be added to the model if it is to produce such impli-

    cations. But which ones? Perhaps the best approach would be to consider

    known   temporal   and cross—sectional fertility variations and to try to find
                                      —68—

restrictions on the model which cause it to reproduce those patterns of

variation. However, it was our original intent to discover what economic

models   of fertility told us   about time series movements in fertility.

Clearly, we have come full circle. In order to make our models better,

we must have a better and more detailed knowledge of the temporal behavior

of fertility.

18.   Becker calls average real expenditure per child "child quality".

      Generally, definitions are not subject to arguments pro and con but

      this particular definition, I believe, is particularly misleading.

      Among the general populace child quality is usually associated with

      health, beauty, talent, certain pleasing personality traits, and other such
                                    —71—

      characteristics of children to which the contribution of real ex-

      penditures is often quite minimal. Moreover, it is not generally

      accepted that average real expenditure per unit is a particularly

      good measure of quality for durable goods in general. Suppose two

      people bought identical automobiles one of which wOrked beautifully

      and th other of which was a lemon. The person who purchased the

      lemon is likely to spend considerably more ntoney on his auto than

      the person who bought the car which functioned perfectly. Yet, we

      are hardly likely to say that the person who bought the lemon had

      the higher quality automobile just because his real expenditure per

      unit was higher than that of the other person. Indeed, we would say

      just the reverse.

           Let us consider another example of how Becker's definition of

      child quality could be misleading. Suppose someone had a profes-

      sional photographer come to his home to take photographs of his

      children and his automobile. Most people would not think that either

      the quality of the car or the quality of the children would be en-

      hanced thereby. Nonetheless, Becker's definition of child quality
                                                   and the quality of the automobile
      would lead us to say that the quality of the children/increased be-

      cause their pictures were taken. In footnote 38, we argue that the

      confusion in terminology grows even worse in the context of models

      of household production.

           Economists have no monopoly on the study of fertility and if

      they are to interact fruitfully with people in other disciplines it

      is incumbent upon them to keep nonessential semantic difficulties
      to    a minimum.

                             For this reason, I do not accept Becker's definition
      of child quality and until something better comes along whenever I
                                                                                                .

22.   It is assumed in Model II that               the    price index for the child ex-

      penditure bundle is invariant with respect to birth order.                    This is

      not a crucial assumption of the model and its implications remain

      intact even if the price index varies with parity.

23.   A normal good is defined as one f or which the demand increases as

      income increases if all the relevant relative prices are held con-

      stant. There is one exception to this rule. If there was none of

      a good consumed before and               after   an income increase, it still may

      be    considered a normal        good.
24.   The reason that the two constraints both pass through the same point

      is that                 was   chosen     such that the point of tangency of equa-

      tion (4) with an indifference was a point on equation (5).

          effect on other goods of changing the price of one good while

          holding utility constant.

    27.   Another way to understand why even changes in         have an ambiguous

          effect on fertility in the Becker model is to notice that if the

          pure price elasticities with respect to simultaneous proportional

          changes   in   the shadow prices of n and e are not identical then
          the   differences   in the price elasticities cause induced relative

          shadow price changes between n and e which could offset the

          initial price change.

    28.   If both goods in the Becker model had a quality dimension then

          there would be four argimiants in the utility function, the quantity

          and quality of each of the two goods. In addition, there would be

          three   endogenous shadow price ratios as   opposed to two in the simpler

          model. There would also be considerably greater difficulties because

          the ambiguity is compounded by the interaction of yet another vari-

          able about which little is known a priori.

    29.   This result can simply be obtained by adding the first two equations

          labeled (A13) in Becker—Lewis (1973), p. S286.

36.   Models IV and V below are such models. The discussion of Model IV

      begins on page 34.

37.   Assumption ii) may be restated as follows: given any values of the

      wife's wage rate and the price of goods the ratio of wife's time to

      market goods used in the production of c is greater than the ratio

      of wife's time to goods used in the production of S.

38.   Willis follows Becker and calls e child quality. However, this

      term is quite misleading in the context of a model of household

      production. Although it is convenient to speak of household pro-

      duction functions and a household production structure, the activ-

      ities of the household which are represented in this fashion partake

      both of the character of production activities and consumption ac-

      tivities. Suppose parents take their children to a park on a Sunday

      for the purposes of admiring the scenery, drinking in some sunshine

      and playing with their children in the park environment. Some of the

      value of the parents' time spent at the park would be correctly allo-

      cated to the childservices production function, as would a portion

      of the cost of transporting the family to the park. Nonetheless, it

      is   quite confusing to claim that child quality has increased just
      because the   parents have played with their children. We do not claim

      that the quality of phonograph records increases as they are played

      more and more. We do not claim that the quality of an automobile

      increases as it is driven more miles. Why should we assume that all

                                                                               .

          time and goods spent on children increase child quality? But then

          again perhaps children are not like other consumer durables. See fn. 18.

    39.   The model is meant to be a one—period lifetime model of fertility

          where T is the length of a couple's married life together.

    40.   To avoid confusion, the wife's market wage rate is denoted w' and

          the wife's shadow wage rate when she does not participate in the labor

          market is denoted w*. In those contexts where either wage concept

          may be appropriate the symbol w is used.
                                                                                   hours
               The implicit assumption is that the wife is free to work any number of /

          she chooses at the market wage rate w'. If the wife's wage rate rose

          as her lifetime hours of work rose, this would complicate the model,

          but would not change its thrust. See Willis (1973), p. 38

    41.   The derived demand functions are simply functions which tell us the

          cost minimizing input mix for any quantity of output and any set of

          relative factor prices. In the case of production functions which

          are homogeneous of degree one, these derived demand functions must

          be multiplicative in output and a function of relative prices. If

          it were not mutiplicative then the ratio of factor inputs would de-

          pend on the scale of output and that cannot be the case for any

          homogeneous production function.

    42.   It must be true that          ht, and h are homogeneous of degree

          zero because the cost minimizing quantities of inputs demanded de-

          pends only on relative prices not the absolute level of prices. This

          is just one of the restrictions on the functions of the input prices.

      Another restriction, for example, would be that g(w(),p) <
            (2)       whenever w (1)   > w (2) .    Clearly   there are more re-
      g(w ,p)
      strictions on these functions, but this need not concern us here.

43.   See page 14:

44.   In the Becker model I, PC' and p5            are fixed exogenous variables.

      In the Willis model the exogenous variables are V, w', and

      The values of      I, p and p in that model depend on the values of

      V, w, and       and in that sense are endogenous.

45.   The constraint facing the household may         be   written as


      (1) V + w'T =                    + pg(w'             + c(w'h(w'       +
                        s(w'g(w'
                                       + ph(w'


      if the wife is in the labor force. If the wife is not in the labor
      force the following two constraints must be satisfied simultaneously.


      (2) V spg(w*,p) +            cph(w*,p)
      and

      (3) T =                +

46.   An expression for the wife's hours of labor market work may be derived

      from equations 13, 15, 17, and      22.      First, solving for C    in   equation

      22 we obtain

          Substituting the values of t and t from equations 15 and 17

                                sg(w',p)         cht(w',p)

          Substituting the value of c derived above in equation 1 into

          equation 2, we obtain the following expression for t


                    =
                                    )+ph(wt ,p )(T(Pxhx(w' ,p ))              — V(ht(w' ,p   ))   +

          Now, we can       answer the question of whether t                  increases or de-

          creases with s. The wife's time                 in     the labor force must   increase
          as & production increases (holding w' constant) because the co-

          efficient of a in equation 3 must be positive. The positivity of

          the coefficient of a would follow if


          (4) sx(w',p)ht(w',P) —
                                             h(w' p)g(w'           ,p ) > 0


          However, equation (4) must             be   true because of the time      intensity
          assumption made on page 29. The time intensity assumption requires

          that



          (5) h(w',p)> g(w',p)
                 h(w' ,p)        g(w' L'x)

          which   is sufficient to prove (4).

       It is also useful to note at this point that the value of s at

       point a in figure 8, the point at which the wife stops (starts)

       working in the labor market, may         be   expressed

51.    It is not strictly necessary in Model IV to assume that the produc-

       tion functions for childservices are independent of parity. Hicks—

       nuetral technological differences between production functions for

       different parities can be assumed without altering the analysis.

       The   assumption made in   the text that production functions for child-

       services are independent of parity is made purely for expositional
       ease.
52.    The flows of childservices from the m              possible   children may be
       aggregated into a single composite codity c                   because   since the
       shadow price of childservices does not vary across parities, the
       flows     c1,... ,   c   meet   the   conditions   for Hicks' composite com-
       modity theorem. See Hicks (1962)
 53.   The relative price of s and c only depend on the ratio of the

       wife's wage to the price of goods. If the latter is constant so is

       the former.

          portions of the constraint. An algebraic representation of s at

          the point of transition,which illustrates Rybczynski's Theoremcan

      more childservices than c* nor less s than s.

69.   By situation i, we simply mean some fixed configuration of income

      and prices. Situation 1 may differ from situation 2, for example,

      if the wives' wage rates differ.

      in situation i if given the resources available in situation i,

      it is impossible to produce those quantities of the household com-

      modities.

71.   Since, in reality, we usually deal with a finite number of families,
                                assumption
      we have written the normality/in terms consistent with this observa-

      tion. However, it usually is more aesthetically pleasing to draw

      the figures on the basis of a continuous distribution of families.

      To put the normality assumption in terms of continuous distribution

      functions, let us consider two    distribution        functions F0( )            and

      F2( )       defined over the closed interval [o,a]. The normality
      assumption may now be restated:

           if   the opportunity to consume     is greater (smaller)               in

           situation   2 than in situation 1 then F2(Z.k) <

          [(F2(z.k)    >
                           F(Z)]     for     o<

           exists   some value of Z in the interval [o,a], say

           such that F2 (Z) <       (l) (Z)       (F2 (Z()
                                                                      >


      In this definition F(1) is the distribution function for situation i.



                                                                                             .

    72.   It is not beyond belief that, holding other inputs into child—

          services fixed, the number of children which parents have is such

          that the contribution of an additional child to the production of

          childservices would be negative.

    73.   In order to understand why (      ) and V( )    must be strictly in-

          creasing functions of their arguments, let us consider the implica-

          tions of that not being so. Suppose s >           and        =

          That would imply that it is possible to produce more output with

          no increase in inputs which would be inconsistent with G being a

          production function.

    74.   See pages 37 and    38.
    75.   All   the   following figures are drawn on the assumptions that i) the

          wives' labor force participation rate lies between zero and      unity,
          and   ii)   the distribution function never has a slope of aero except

          at 100%.

    76.   In the case of a finite number of discrete households it is possible

          that there exist sufficiently small changes in the exogenous vari-

          ables such that the number of women in the labor force does not

          change.

    77.   Generally speaking, since the ordering of the families can change

          between situation 1 and situation 2, the same women need not be in

          the labor force in both periods. However, since people only have

          one lifetime, it is impossible to observe the same family before

          and after changes in lifetime exogenous variables.

    78.   This may be clearly seen from equation 3 in footnote 46.

      not shift because if it did it would necessarily violate either the

      Normality Assumption as it applies to c or as it applies to s.

82.   Below, the conflicting income and substitution effects which arise

      when the wife is out of the labor force have been discussed in some

      detail. Conflicting income and substitution effects now arise even

      when the wife is in the labor force because we have assumed that

      the children's generation has both a higher husband's income and a

      higher wives' wage rate than the parents' generation.

83.   In essence this assumption states that the distribution of s in

      the childrens' generation is invariant to their own economic con-

      ditions.
