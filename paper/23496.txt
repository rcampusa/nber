                                            ABSTRACT

Crop biodiversity has the potential to enhance resistance to strains due to biotic and abiotic factors
and to improve crop production and farm revenues. To investigate the effect of crop biodiversity on
crop productivity, we build a probabilistic model based on ecological mechanisms to describe crop
survival and productivity according to diversity. From this analytic model, we derive reduced forms
that are empirically estimated using detailed field data of South African agriculture combined with
satellite derived data. Our results confirm that diversity has a positive and significant impact on crop
survival odds. We show the consistency of these results with the underlying ecologic and agricultural
mechanisms.

1     Introduction
Diversity plays a key role in the resilience to external stresses of farm plants and animals.
In particular, crop species diversity increases productivity and production stability
(Tilman et al., 2005; Tilman & Downing, 1994; Tilman et al., 1996) in the sense that the
probability to find at least one individual that resists to an adverse meteorological
phenomenon (for example a drought or a heatwave), or pests and diseases, increases with
the diversity within a population. Furthermore, the larger is an homogeneous population,
the larger is the number of parasites that use this population as a host and therefore the
larger is the probability of a lethal infection (Pianka, 1999). Diversity also allows for species
complementarities and, as a consequence, a more efficient use of natural resources (Loreau
& Hector, 2001). In short, crop biodiversity has the potential to enhance resistance to
strains due to biotic and abiotic factors and to improve crop production and farm revenues.
    For these reasons, after the large development of monocultures in the last decades,
crop biodiversity is making a comeback. During the last century, farming activities spe-
cialized on the most productive crops, in particular in developed countries and in large
areas of emerging economies. The decrease in crop biodiversity resulted in increased pest
attacks (Landis et al., 2008) and has been compensated by the heavy use of agrochem-
icals. Nevertheless, chemicals generate negative externalities, irreversible in many cases,
on water and soil quality, on wildlife and on human health (Pimentel, 2005; Foley et al.,
2011; Jiguet et al., 2012; Beketov et al., 2013), which engender large economic costs (Gal-
lai et al., 2009; Sutton et al., 2011). One of the main challenges for the future is to
drastically reduce externalities while satisfying an increasing and changing food demand
(Gouel & Guimbard, 2017). In this context, crop biodiversity is more and more seen as a
promising way to raise, or at least maintain, agricultural yields while decreasing the use
of chemicals (McDaniel et al., 2014). However, more estimations of the actual impacts
of crop biodiversity on agricultural yields are needed to build solutions for farmers and
to adopt relevant public policies. To this end, we empirically investigate the role of crop
biodiversity on crop productivity. We build a probabilistic model based on ecological
mechanisms to describe crop survival and productivities according to diversity. From this
analytic model, we derive reduced forms that are estimated using data on South African
agriculture.
    Our results contribute to the existing literature in three main ways. First, we confirm



                                                                                               2
that diversity has a positive and significant impact on produced quantities. An increase in
biodiversity is equivalent to a third of the benefits of a comparable increase in irrigation,
where irrigation is known to be an important impediment to crop productivity in South
Africa, due to unreliable precipitation. Previous empirical investigations on the role of
biodiversity on production has produced sometimes contrasted results. Positive impact
of biodiversity is found by Di Falco & Chavas (2006) and Carew et al. (2009) in wheat
production, in Italy and Canada respectively. Smale et al. (1998) also focus on wheat
yield and find a positive impact of biodiversity in rain fed regions of Pakistan, while in
irrigated areas higher concentration on few varieties is associated with higher yields. Sec-
ond, we adopt an approach based on ecology literature, while previous contributions used
pure econometric methods, mainly moment based approaches, Di Falco & Chavas (2006,
2009) stressing the crucial role played by skewness in addition to mean and variance. In
these cases, the functional forms are disconnected from the ecology literature and there-
fore do not allow to go into deep details on the way biodiversity impacts productivity.
In the economic literature, models of endogenous interaction between biodiversity and
crop production have been developed in theoretical papers that analyze the role and the
value of biodiversity against specialization on the most productive crops (Weitzman, 2000;
Brock & Xepapadeas, 2003; Bellora & Bourgeon, 2016) but have never been coupled with
empirical investigations. In contrast, we build a probabilistic model that makes explicit
the relationship between biodiversity, biotic and abiotic factors that affect agricultural
production. It represents how biodiversity impacts agricultural production. Stochastic
shocks affecting agricultural production are endogenous, in accordance with ecology find-
ings.This model can easily be linked to data and grounds our analysis on findings of
ecology studies. This approach can also be extended to account for non crop biodiver-
sity (pastures, fallow land, non cultivated areas. . . ), which appears to also play a key
role (Tscharntke et al., 2005), and to characterize the impacts on production variability.
Third, we draw from the increasingly available satellite data (Donaldson & Storeygard,
2016) to build a rich dataset allowing us to estimate the impact of biodiversity on crop
productivity based on our probabilistic model. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
(NDVI) derived from the SPOT 5 satellite images, coupled with land use classification,
allow to quantify the crop biomass produced on nearly 65,000 fields covering around 6.5
million hectares in South Africa. We quantify biodiversity using an index taken from the
ecological literature, based on species richness (i.e. the total number of species) and their
relative abundance, the Shannon index (Shannon, 1948). This index captures the fact
that biodiversity is high when the total number of species is large and the distribution of
their relative abundances is homogeneous. We are then able to quantify the impacts of
inter-specific diversity on the productivity of various crops, while previous studies mainly
looked at genetic diversity (i.e. intra-specific diversity of a single crop). We confirm



                                                                                           3
that biodiversity has mainly a local impact: biodiversity is a significant predictor of crop
productivity on perimeters having a radius smaller than 2km.
   In the remainder of the paper, the theoretical model that motivates our empirical
investigations is developed in section 2 and section 3 details its empirical implementation.
Then, the database on South African agriculture is presented in section 4. In section 5,
we empirically investigate the impact of crop biodiversity on crop production.


2     The model
A very robust stylized fact in ecology describes the impact of biotic factors on agricultural
production: the more area is dedicated to the same crop, the more pests specialize on
this crop and the higher is the frequency of their attacks (Pianka, 1999). Relying on this
stylized fact, we build a general probabilistic model of crop production where crops are
affected by both abiotic (i.e. weather, water availability, soil properties. . . ) and biotic
(i.e. pests) factors causing pre-harvest losses.1 More precisely, we consider that the total
agricultural production depends on the survival probability of each crop, which is directly
linked to the probability of a pest attack. The frequency at which pest attacks occur
is linked to the way crops are produced: the more diverse are crops, the lower is the
probability of a pest attack, the higher is the survival probability and therefore the higher
is the expected agricultural production. To describe the diffusion of pests, or equivalently
the survival probabilities, we follow the literature in ecology and plant physiology and
adopt a beta-binomial distribution, which is usual to depict spatial distributions that are
not random but clustered, patchy or heterogeneous (Hughes & Madden, 1993; Shiyomi
et al., 2000; Chen et al., 2008; Bastin et al., 2012; Irvine & Rodhouse, 2010).
    We assume that a region (or a country) produces Z different crops on I fields of
the same size, each field being sowed with one crop only. Characteristics of field i are
gathered in vector Xi = (xi1 , . . . , xiK ) and are related both to abiotic factors and biotic
factors. In particular, Xi contains information on the way crops are cultivated (irrigation
but also soil quality and field location) and on biodiversity conditions. Depending on the
crop cultivated, each field is divided in n(z) patches that are subject to potential lethal
strains due, for example, to adverse meteorological conditions or pathogens. We suppose
that a patch on field i is destroyed with probability 1 − λi from one (or several) adverse
condition, and that otherwise it produces the potential yield a(z) independently of the
fate of the other patches on field i or elsewhere.2 With n(z) patches, the probability of
   1
     Losses due to biotic factors can be significant. Oerke (2006) finds that, during the 2001–2003 period,
without crop protection, losses in major crops due to pests were comprised between 50% and 80%, at the
world level. Thanks to crop protection, they fall between 29% and 37%. Similar results are found for the
US by Fernandez-Cornejo et al. (1998).
   2
     Obviously, this is a strong assumption. Pests and/or weather do not necessarily totally destroy a
patch, but rather affect the quantity of biomass produced. But, in order to maintain tractability, we


                                                                                                         4
having t patches within field i unaffected (and thus n(z) − t destroyed) follows a binomial
distribution,                                    

where Tei is the random variable that corresponds to the number of patches that are indeed
harvested among the n(z) patches of field i sowed with crop z. We consider that the sur-
vival probability of the patches of a field, λi , is identically and independently distributed
across patches. However, this probability may vary across fields of the same crop (we gen-
erally have λi 6= λj for any couple of fields (i, j) sowed with the same crop): it depends
on natural conditions but also on the characteristics Xi of the field. More precisely, the
survival probability of patches on a given field is a draw from a Beta distribution given
by
                                     Γ [Sui (z) + Sdi (z)] Sui (z)−1

where Γ(·) is the the gamma function, Sui (z) ≡ eγ(z)+θu (z).Xi and Sdi (z) ≡ eβ(z)+θd (z).Xi ,
γ(z) and β(z) being positive parameters that determine the randomness of the survival
probability of a patch of crop z absent any field specific effect, and the vectors θ u (z) =
{θuk (z)}k=1,...,K and θ d (z) = {θdk (z)}k=1,...,K capturing the influence of each field specific
effect Xi on the survival probability of crop z. The expected number of patches among
n(z) that are harvested on field i is given by E[Tei |Xi , z] = n(z)ψ(z, Xi ) where

                                                               Sui (z)
                            ψ(z, Xi ) = E[λi |Xi , z] =                                            (1)
                                                          Sui (z) + Sdi (z)

is the expected probability that a particular patch of field i of crop z is harvested given
its characteristics Xi . Absent field specific effects (θ u (z) = θ d (z) = 0), the expected
resilience of a particular stand of crop is given by exp γ(z)/(exp γ(z) + exp β(z)). An
increase in coefficient θuk (z) increases this resilience, while an increase in θdk (z) diminishes
it, the extent of these effects depending on the corresponding field characteristics xik . The
variance of the number of harvested patches on field i is given by σi2 = n(z)V (z, Xi ) where

                  V (z, Xi ) = ψ(z, Xi )[1 − ψ(z, Xi )]{1 + [n(z) − 1]ρ(z, Xi )}                   (2)

with
                                ρ(z, Xi ) = [1 + Sui (z) + Sdi (z)]−1 .

    Equation (2) corresponds to the variance of the survival probability of one patch on
a field with characteristics Xi . Compared to the Bernoulli distribution, (2) contains an
consider that a patch is either unaffected either totally destroyed, rather than partially affected, by
adverse conditions. Thus, our random variable is the number of harvested patches rather than the share
of biomass that is lost on each patch.



                                                                                                     5
additional term that accounts for the correlation between patches induced by the common
distribution of the survival probability, the correlation coefficient being given by ρ(z, Xi ).
    The production on field i is given by Yei = a(z)Tei . It can be equivalently written as

                                            Yei = E[Yei ](1 + ε̃i )                          (3)

where E[Yei ] = a(z)n(z)ψ(z, Xi ) and ε̃i = (Tei − E[Tei ])/E[Tei ] has a mean equal to 0 and a
variance given by
                                                               
                   1 − ψ(z, Xi )        1     n(z) − 1             1 − ψ(z, Xi )

when n(z) is large. This variance is mainly due to the correlation between patches on a
field that share the same survival probability, captured by ρ(z, Xi ). Indeed, λi follows a
beta distribution but the parameters of the distribution depend on the field characteristics
Xi and are thus different across fields. In other words, with a sufficiently large number of
patches on each field, the difference in the quantities produced is mainly driven by field
characteristics.
     This simple ecological model of crop production can thus be summarized as follows:
the number of patches that are harvested on field i, Tei , follows a beta-binomial distribution
determined by the parameters γ(z), β(z), θuk , θdk . Parameters θuk and θdk determine the
impact of the k th field characteristic xik on Tei , in addition to the parameters γ(z) and
β(z) that are shared by all fields that grow crop z. Depending on the values of θuk and
θdk , each characteristic xik can increase or decrease the expected number of harvested
patches on field i and skew the distribution of Tei to the right or to the left, modifying the
probability of extreme events like the loss of all the patches in a field.
     In the following section, we build an empirical strategy to estimate the impact of the
characteristics of a field on the distribution of Tei . In particular, we are interested in the
impact on crop production of the crop biodiversity surrounding the field considered and
expect this impact to be positive, according to findings and mechanisms described in the
ecology literature.


3     Empirical strategy
Starting from the probabilistic model, our aim is to estimate the parameters θu (z), θd (z),
γ(z) and β(z) of the distribution of the survival probability Te. We first have to derive
from each field production the corresponding survival probability λ̂i . They are obtained by
dividing the production level by the potential maximum production a(z)n(z) level. This
potential production is not observed in practice, it is derived in the following from the
maximum observed production level YM (z) ≡ max Yi (z) using a(z)n(z) = (1 + α)YM (z)

                                                                                              6
where α ≥ 0.3 With a linear regression of the equation

                                                1 − λ̂i

for each type of crop, we obtain the estimate δ̂(z) of γ(z) − β(z) and ∆(z) ˆ    of θ u (z) −
θ d (z). This first regression estimates the contribution of biodiversity (and other field
characteristics) to the ratio of survival and death probabilities. Coefficients ∆ show the
variation of the growth rate of the odds associated with a marginal increase in each
explanatory variable. These first results are interesting per se but also allow to derive an
expected patch survival rate for each field i using

                                                                     ˆ

                                                                                          ˆ
to obtain γ̂(z) and θ̂ u (z). We then get β̂(z) = γ̂(z) − δ̂(z) and θ̂ d (z) = θ̂ u (z) − ∆(z).

Combining different data sources, we construct a very detailed original database on South
African agriculture that quantifies the production and describes the characteristics of a

very large number of fields using satellite data. First, field boundaries are identified,
then agricultural production is characterised on each field by identifying the crops that
are grown and measuring the biomass produced. Field characteristics are then collected,
concerning in particular water balance, length of the growing season and crop interspecific
biodiversity.


4.1    Crop fields
Field boundaries, available for South African provinces of Free State, Gauteng, North
West and Mpumalanga, are determined using the Producer Independent Crop Estimate
System (PICES) which combines satellite imagery, Geographic Information System (GIS),
point frame statistical platforms, and aerial observations (Ferreira et al., 2006). Satellite
imagery of cultivated fields is obtained from the SPOT 5 satellite at a 2.5-m resolution.
Plot boundaries are then digitised using GIS and field cloud covered polygons are removed
before processing. Over the four regions of interest, PICES distinguishes circa 280 000
fields covering an area of around 6.5 million hectares. To approximately match the resolu-
tion of the crop production indicator we use (see 4.2), which is only available at the 250m
resolution, the analysis is limited to fields larger than 6.25ha. Additionally, we exclude
pasture and fallow land. This restricts the sample to 64,682 fields. Figure 1 presents the
location of the considered crop fields in South Africa. While the summary statistics in
Table 1 show that fields are on average about 28.4 hectares, the large standard deviation
(24.8) indicates that they vary substantially in size (the largest field is 720 hectares large).
    Using the digitized satellite images described above, the Agricultural Geo-referenced

                                                                                              8

Information System (AGIS) developed by the South African Department of Agriculture
provides information on the crop cultivated on each field. To do so, sample points were
selected randomly and surveyed by trained observers from a very light aircraft in order to
determine crop type (Ferreira et al., 2006). Crop information collected during the aerial
surveys on the sample points was subsequently used as a training set for crop type clas-
sification for each field and for accuracy assessment. These estimated crop classifications
were then checked against a producer based survey for the Gauteng region. The Gauteng
census survey showed that less than 1.8% of crop types had been misclassified. All in all,
seven summer crops were distinguished for the provinces of Free State, Gauteng, North
West and Mpumalanga for the summer season 2006/2007: cotton, dry beans, groundnuts,
maize, sorghum, soybean and sunflower. An example of the distribution of crop types is
provided in figure 2. The summary statistics for the entire sample in Table 2 show that
maize was the dominant crop cultivated in the three provinces: maize fields represent
nearly 70 per cent of the total number of fields we consider. Other important crops were
sunflower and soybean, standing at 15 and 11 per cent each. In contrast, all other crop
types constituted less than 2 per cent individually. One should note that even if one were
to adjust the crop type shares by their areas, a similar ranking remains, with a slight
redistribution of shares towards the smaller crop types. For instance, the share of maize
dropped to 62 per cent of the total crop area.
   The AGIS crop boundaries dataset also provides information regarding irrigation, from

   Finally, all fields can be linked to their respective farms with a unique farm identifier.
In total the fields were owned by 12,462 different farms, where on average each farm
was proprietor of 5 fields. However, ownership differed substantially, with the largest
ownership gathering 193 fields, and 3,704 single field farms.


4.2       Crop production measure
We estimate crop biomass production using the satellite derived Normalised Difference
Vegetation Index (NDVI). Vegetation indices provide consistent spatial and temporal rep-
resentations of vegetation conditions, when locally derived information is not available.
As a matter of fact, numerous studies have demonstrated that NDVI values are signifi-
cantly correlated with biomass production, and therefore yields, of various crops, including
wheat (Das et al., 1993; Gupta et al., 1993; Doraiswamy & Cook, 1995; Hochheim & Bar-
ber, 1998; Labus et al., 2002), sorghum (Potdar, 1993), maize (Hayes & Decker, 1996;
Prasad et al., 2006), rice (Nuarsa et al., 2011; Quarmby et al., 1993), soybean (Prasad
et al., 2006), barley (Weissteiner & Kuhbauch, 2005), millet (Groten, 1993) and tomato
(Koller & Upadhaya, 2005). Moreover, NDVI has also been shown to provide a very good
indicator of crop phenological development (Benedetti & Rossini, 1993).
    The NDVI index is calculated using ratios of vegetation spectral reflectance over incom-
ing radiation in each spectral band. The NDVI data are extracted from the MOD13Q1
dataset,4 which gathers reflectance information collected by the MODerate-resolution
Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument operating on NASA’s Terra satellite
(Huete et al., 2002). From these data, NDVI can be formulated as:

                                                  N IR − V IS
                                       N DV I =
                                                  N IR + V IS

where the difference between near-infrared reflectance (NIR) and visible reflectance (VIS)
values is normalised by the total reflectance and varies between - 1 and 1 (Eidenshink,
1992). The more biomass is produced, the more the NDVI is close to 1. Negative and very
low values corresponding to water and barren areas were excluded from the analysis by
design. Nevertheless, NDVI has some limitations. In particular, it enters an asymptotic
regime for high values of biomass. It reaches its maximum when leaves totally cover the
soil and does not allow to distinguish between dense or very dense vegetation, contrary
to other vegetation indices that do not saturate over densely vegetated regions (Huete
et al., 1997). In that sense, NDVI is less reliable to estimate the biomass production of
dense vegetation, like forest. However, it is very sensible to photosynthetic activity and
therefore remains highly indicative of the biomass produced in cultivated fields. Carl-

son & Ripley (1997) precisely describe the asymptotic regime of NDVI and Ma et al.
(2001) confirm this analysis and relate biomass produced to NDVI using the following
relationship, extrapolated for soybean:

                                          Y = d + bN DV I c                                            (7)

where Y represents the quantities produced (or the yield), d, b and c are three parameters.
The only parameter needed in the following is c, taken equal to 4.54, following Ma et al.
(2001).5 Denoting by
                                Ni = N DV Ii − N DV I0                                  (8)

with N DV I0 = |d/b|1/c , bNic gives an estimation of the quantities produced on field i,
Y (i).6
    Crop growing seasons are characterized by the planting date and the phenology cycle,
which determines the length of the season. In South Africa, planting generally occurs
between October and December in order to reduce the vulnerability to erratic precipitation
(Ferreira et al., 2006). However, phenology cycles, and hence growing seasons, can differ
substantially among crop types and even for fields of the same crop type. In order to take
account of this, we used the TIMESAT program7 (Jönsson & Eklundh, 2002, 2004) to
determine crop and field specific growing seasons. We are then able to approximate the
start and end of growing seasons based on distribution properties of the NDVI. Summary
statistics in Table 1 show that growing seasons are on average 130 days, with a standard
deviation of 35 days.
    Finally, as is standard in the literature of satellite derived plant growth measures,
we use the maximum NDVI over the growing season as an indicator of crop production
(Zhang et al., 2006). It takes on an average value of 0.61 with a standard deviation of
0.13 (see Table 1).


4.3     Crop water balance
An important determinant of crop growth is water availability. A common simple proxy
for it is the difference between rainfall and the evaporative demand of the air, i.e, evapo-
transpiration. To calculate this, we use gridded daily precipitation and reference evapo-
transpiration data taken from the USGS Early Warning Famine climatic database.8 More
specifically, daily rainfall data, given at the 0.1 degree resolution (approximately 11 km),
   5
      We take the estimate coming from the regression showing the best fit on data used by Ma et al.
(2001).
    6
      For value smaller than N DV I0 , the produced quantities are equal to 0, the NDVI capturing the light
reflected by the bare soil.
    7
      The algorithm within the TIMESAT software is commonly used to extract seasonality information
from satellite time-series data.

mented by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) - Climate
Prediction Center (CPC) using a combination of rain gauges and satellite observations.
Daily reference evapotranspiration data, available at a 1 degree resolution (approximately
111km), were calculated using a 6-hourly assimilation of conventional and satellite ob-
servational data of air temperature, atmospheric pressure, wind speed, relative humidity
and solar radiation extracted from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
Global Data Assimilation System. Using these gridded data each field was then assigned
a daily precipitation and potential evapotranspiration value over its growing season to
then calculate out its average daily water balance. The mean and standard deviation of
this measure are given in Table 1.


4.4       Biodiversity index
Among field characteristics, we are particularly interested in crop biodiversity. Diversity
measures, extensively used in biology and ecology literature, take into account specie
richness (i.e. the number of species present) and evenness (i.e. the distribution of species).
In the following, we quantify biodiversity at the field level adopting one of the most widely
used indicators, the Shannon index (Shannon, 1948):
                                               X
                                      H` = −        B` (z) ln B` (z)                        (9)
                                                z


where the subscript i refers to a specific field, ` defines the size of the perimeter considered
as relevant, and B` (z) is the proportion of area within perimeter ` that is of crop z type.
Hi` is then calculated for a given perimeter `, defined by its radius, applied to the centroid
of the field i considered. The more diverse crops are and the more equal their abundances,
the larger is the Shannon index. When all crops are equally common, all B(z) values will
equal 1/Z (Z being the total number of crops) and H will be equal to ln Z. On the
contrary, the more unequal the abundances of the crops are, the smaller is the index,
approaching 0 (and being equal to 0 if Z = 1). With respect to other common indicators,
like the Simpson’s index,9 the Shannon index is known to put less weight on the more
abundant species and to be more sensitive to differences in total species richness and
in changes in populations showing small relative abundances (Baumgärtner, 2006). In
our specification, the distance threshold for the radius ` is 0.75km; the distance is then
increased 250m by 250m to reach 3km, the maximum distance considered. We provide
summary statistics for the Shannon index in Table 3. Widening the perimeter under
consideration increases the value of the Shannon index substantially. For example, the
3 km index is nearly 5 times larger than the 0.75km index. This strongly suggests that

crop types are strongly spatially agglomerated, and thus locally less diverse.



5        Empirical analysis
Our first empirical task is to investigate whether biodiversity affects crop field production.
To this end, we rely on the strategy defined in section 3. In short, we build data on crop
production using (7) and (8). We use them to calculate the survival probability in each
field, λ̂i . Then, with a linear regression on specification (5), we estimate the impact of
biodiversity on the odds, i.e. the ratio of the probability for a given field to survive to the
probability of death.
    Crop productivity depends not only on crop biodiversity but also on more general
natural conditions (weather, season length. . . ), field attributes (irrigation, area. . . ) and
farm management attributes (pesticides, mechanization, economies of scale. . . ). There-
fore, the vector of control variables X includes crop fixed effects, crop water balance
(W B) and its squared value (W B 2 ), an irrigation dummy indicator (IR), the season
length (SEAS LEN GT H), the logarithm of the field area in hectares (ln(AREA)), the
latitude (LAT ) and longitude (LON ) of the centroid of the field, the percentage of crop-
land within a defined perimeter that is irrigated (P C AREA IR), and the percentage of
land devoted to the same crop that belongs to the same farm, within a defined perimeter
(P C AREA F ARM ). We also include farm fixed effects to capture crop management
techniques that are common within farms as well as farm wide economies of scale. Crop
specific dummies allow us to control for the fact that different crops will have different
vegetation growth intensity as captured by satellite reflectance data.
    The results of the regression on equation (5) for all crops pooled are presented in Table
4. In the first column, we simply include our field specific control variables (vector X).
The first column shows results for a perimeter defined by a radius ` equal to 0.75km. As
can be seen, crop water balance has a significant positive and exponentially increasing



                                                                                                                      14
impact on the survival rate of crops. However, having an irrigation system acts more to
increase the survival rate of crops and therefore fields’ productivity. It also makes crops
less reliant on water balance (in a linear fashion) as would be expected. The coefficient on
season length suggests that the longer the season lasts, the lower the crop survival rate is.
In other words, the longer the season, the higher the probabilities that an adverse event
affects crops. Larger fields have lower survival rates than smaller ones. Finally, being
located more in the East results in crop survival probability, possibly because of more
favorable climatic or soil conditions, while being further South or North is inconsequential
for field productivity within our sample.
    If we consider now the degree of crop diversity, as measured by the Shannon index, we
observe that an increase in surrounding biodiversity improves the survival ratio in a given
field, and consequently its productivity. Arguably, however, our diversity index may just
be capturing the fact that neighboring areas are different in ways that are correlated with
the diversity of crops. To take account of these factors, we thus control for the percentage
of the surrounding area that is irrigated and the percentage of the surrounding area of
fields of the same crop type that belongs to the same farm.
    When increasing the defined perimeter to calculate the Shannon index to 1 km, ad-
justing the variables P C AREA IR and P C AREA F ARM in an analogous fashion,
the impact of crop biodiversity on survival rate remains statistically significant, but de-
creases by 26%. As far as control variables are concerned, the share of area irrigated
unequivocally increases the biomass production while the share of area belonging to the
same farm within the perimeter we consider seems to have no significant impact on the
biomass production. Further increasing the perimeter similarly continues to produce a
significant positive impact of biodiversity, the coefficient increasing by 40% per cent. How-
ever, when further expanding the threshold of our definition of the relevant neighborhood,
biodiversity still acts as a significant predictor of survival probability but its contribution
decreases and finally disappears for a perimeter’s radius greater than 2km.10 This sug-
gests that biodiversity is relatively locally defined, i.e. within less than 2km, but likely
close to 1.25km.
    We then look at the heterogeneity of impacts across crops, considering sequentially
each of the six crops for which data are available (cotton is not considered in the regressions
by crop since the available sample – 106 fields, 0.16% of the total available fields and 0.1
of the total cropland considered – is too small). The results show that, on the one
hand, biodiversity has a significant impact on survival probability of maize, soybean
and sunflower, and that the relevant perimeter size of the biodiversity index depends on
the crop. Table 5 also reveals that biodiversity has no significant impact on dry bean,
  10
     We also experimented with increasing the perimeter up to 10km, but the coefficient on H remains
insignificant in all cases.

groundnuts and sorghum. This can be explained by the fact that each of the latter
crops represents less than 2% of the total number of fields. In other words, the area
dedicated to these crops is small, the fields are probably sufficiently scattered to not
suffer from the proliferation of their pests. Therefore, the biodiversity variation on the
perimeter that we consider has a negligible marginal effect on the biomass production.
When looking at the crops which biomass production is affected by crop biodiversity, we
see that the relevant perimeter for biodiversity varies: biodiversity has a positive and
significant impact on the production of maize only for perimeters equal to or smaller than
1.25km whereas the relevant perimeter for soybean is equal to or greater than between
1.25km. Surprisingly, biodiversity has a negative and significant impact on sunflower
biomass production on perimeters with a radius larger than 2.25km; a positive significant
impact is found only for ` equal to 1.00km. This heterogeneity is probably linked to
the fact that pests responsible for biomass losses differ among the the three crops we
consider. Generally, the main potential crop losses are caused by weeds but, thanks to
the improvement in weed control techniques, the main actual losses come from animals
(mainly insects) and pathogens (Oerke, 2007). More precisely, in South Africa, maize
is mainly attacked by insects (DAFF, 2014a), while sunflower and soybean are mainly



                                                                                                          17
attacked by diseases caused by fungi and viruses (DAFF, 2009, 2014b).
    The impact of irrigation also varies and depends on crop characteristics, as shown in
tables 8, 9 and 10. Maize is one of the most efficient cultivated plants in South Africa
as far as water use is concerned (DAFF, 2014a), hence a positive and significant impact
of irrigation. On the contrary, sunflower is highly inefficient in water-use and, as well
as soybean, is mostly rain-fed grown.11 This could explain the absence of a significant
impact of irrigation on biomass production for these crops. Finally, soybean biomass
production is positively affected by the size of the field while sunflower survival rate is
inversely related to field size and maize is unaffected. These effects could be related to
plant physiology or to higher mechanization allowed by larger fields and having a positive
impact on the final yield of soybean.
    These results confirm the positive impact of crop biodiversity on agricultural produc-
tion and underlines its heterogeneity across crops, with sunflower being an exception.
Furthermore, it is important to note that we estimate biodiversity effects in the pres-
ence of pesticides, for which we do not totally control. Indeed, farm fixed effects capture
practices that are common to all the fields within the same farm and crop fixed effects
capture practices common to all crops, but the level of pesticides actually applied remains
unknown. Then, the effects we observe can be considered as residual. The positive impact
of biodiversity on crop survival, only second to the one of irrigation and more generally
water management, is all the more important in that respect. Even when pesticides are
possibly applied, biodiversity still has the capacity to improve crop survival rate.
    The results presented above detail the impact of crop biodiversity on crop survival
rates. Our approach through a probabilistic model can be used to add a step to disentangle
more precisely the mechanisms at stake. In particular, the parameters of the beta-binomial
distribution of the survival probability of fields can be estimated, following the approach
detailed in section 3. We perform an OLS regression on equation (6) to directly estimates
the value of θ d ; θ u is given by the difference between the coefficients found in the linear
regressions on equations (5) and (6).
    Results are presented in Table 6, which reports the values of parameters θu and θd for
all the explanatory variables for selected values of `, and Table 7 which shows the values
of the parameters for the Shannon index, computed on all the possible perimeters. As it
is visible from Table 6, in practice significant individual values for the parameters of the
beta-binomial distribution can be found on in a limited number of cases. In particular, it
is interesting to note that biodiversity has a positive impact on the survival rate of maize
by increasing Su more than Sd (see equation (1)), while the positive impact found for
sunflower comes from a larger decrease in Sd than in Su . This difference in mechanisms
  11
     Soybean is mostly rain-fed grown because of low profitability and difficult water management. Indeed,
water shortage is critical during the pod set stage while excessive water supply prior or after the flowering
may jeopardize the final yield.

well as predominant pests) on the possible impacts of crop biodiversity on agricultural
production.



6     Conclusion
Using a new large database built from satellite imagery, we confirm that crop biodiversity
has a positive impact on agricultural production, which is heterogeneous across crops,
sunflower being an exception. Maintaining a large diversity of crops in the landscape
increases agricultural production level. These impacts, that were previously described at
regional scales, are robust when we consider a larger area. We show the consistency of
these results with the underlying ecologic and agricultural mechanisms. For this purpose,
we build a probabilistic model in which stochastic factors linked to biodiversity, namely
pests, are endogenous, as it is shown in the ecology literature, while previous results were
derived using functional forms arbitrarily chosen.
    In the absence of data on pesticides use, their effects are not precisely measured in this
model, which only evaluates the residual effects of biodiversity. However, our approach
can be easily extended to pesticides. This would have the advantage of measuring their
effects not on an isolated field, but rather within a varied set of agricultural productions.
Nevertheless, our analysis shows that residual effects are important and that a better
spatial distribution of crops could lead to a significant improvement in crop yields. This
could be achieved if farmers distribute their crops on their farms to take account of these
effects not only on their own yields but also taking into account their surroundings, which
supposes that they coordinate.
    Describing the mechanisms governing the impact of biodiversity on crop survival, our
model can also be extended to consider wild biodiversity. Indeed, maintaining uncul-
tivated small areas in agricultural landscapes is considered to diminish pests attacks.
Adding data on uncultivated areas to our dataset, the contribution of these initiatives
could be easily evaluated.
    Furthermore, enriching the dataset, in particular with data on pesticide use, could
help to precisely estimate the parameters of the beta-binomial distribution of survival
probabilities. Characterising the distribution could bring elements on the impacts of crop
biodiversity on the variance and the skewness of the distribution, i.e. on the probability
of extreme events, in particular the complete loss of the harvest. These results are rarely
analysed in the literature (Di Falco & Chavas, 2009), while they are particularly relevant
for farmers.
    Notwithstanding these limitations, our results confirm that crop diversification can be
seen as a possible strategy to increase agricultural productivity or to maintain its level
