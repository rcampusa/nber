Over the last 20 years, general equilibrium models of international trade featuring increasing re-

turns to scale have revitalized the international trade research agenda. Yet general equilibrium

econometric work remains underdeveloped: it has been scarce, only occasionally well-informed

by theory, and almost always devoid of economically-meaningful alternative hypotheses. There

are exceptions of course. These include Helpman (1987), Hummels and Levinsohn (1993, 1995),

Brainard (1993, 1997), Harrigan (1993, 1996), and Davis and Weinstein (1996). However, this list

is as short as the work is hard. The complexity of general equilibrium, increasing returns to scale

predictions has deflected empirical research of the kind that is closely aligned with theory.

   Surprisingly, one empirically tractable prediction remains overlooked, despite the fact that it is

central to the approach of Helpman and Krugman (1985). We are referring to a variant of Vanek’s

(1968) factor content of trade prediction. In its Helpman-Krugman form the factor content of trade

depends critically on the extent of scale returns in each industry. Scale matters because it deter-

mines both the pattern of trade and the amount of factors needed to produce observed trade flows.

As Helpman and Krugman showed, their variant of the Vanek prediction comes out of a very large

set of increasing returns models and so provides a robust way of evaluating these models. Yet re-

markably, this increasing returns to scale factor content prediction has not been explored empir-

ically. We know that the Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek factor content prediction performs poorly e.g.,

Trefler (1995). Yet there has not been one iota of evidence that the Helpman-Krugman class of

models performs better. Exploring this uncharted region is our first goal.

   The second and more important goal of this paper is to quantify the extent of increasing returns

to scale in the context of a general equilibrium model of international trade. This forces us to part



                                                 1
company with the existing scale literature which focuses on estimating scale effects separately for

each industry. Instead, we must seek a radically different general equilibrium strategy. It is as

follows. The Helpman-Krugman variant of the Vanek prediction imposes a precise relationship

between the elasticities of scale in each industry and a particular set of data on trade, technology,

and factor endowments. We search for elasticities of scale that make this relationship fit best. Like

cosmologists searching the heavens for imprints of the big bang, we are searching the historical

record on trade flows for imprints of scale as a source of comparative advantage.

   There are two reasons why 15 years of research has largely escaped exposure to general equi-

librium econometric work. As noted, one is the complexity of general equilibrium predictions. The

other is the lack of the internationally comparable cost data needed to make inferences about scale.

Surprisingly, both problems are resolved by shifting the focus from trade in goods to the factor con-

tent of trade. Comparative costs are so obviously the basis of international trade that no amount of

evidence to the contrary would dislodge this view. That is, trade flows from low-cost exporters to

high-cost importers. It should therefore be possible to use trade flow data to make inferences about

international cost differences. What makes this possibility so attractive is that detailed trade flow

data are available even where no cost data exist. Factor content calculations transparently structure

the problem of inferring costs from trade data. Remember that the factor content of trade is just a

set of derived demands for the factor inputs used to produce observed trade flows. By Shephard’s

lemma, these demands can be integrated back to obtain costs. That is, factor content predictions

provide a way of inferring international cost differences from trade flows.

   Just as you cannot squeeze water from a stone, you cannot infer costs without extensive data.



                                                 2
For this paper we have constructed a new and remarkable database covering all internationally

traded, goods-producing industries (27 in manufacturing and 7 outside of manufacturing) for 71

countries over the period 1972-1992. The database contains bilateral trade and gross output by in-

dustry, country, and year as well as factor endowments by country and year. The most difficult part

of this project has been the two years spent on database construction.

   Our conclusions are as follows. When restricting all industries to have the same scale elasticity

our method yields a precisely estimated scale elasticity of 1.05. This is small for mark-up mod-

els (Rotemberg and Woodford 1992), arguably large for endogenous growth models, and certainly

large for hysteretic models. However, there is considerable heterogeneity among industries. For

about a third of all industries the data are not sufficiently informative for making inferences about

scale. For another third of all industries, we estimate constant returns to scale. That is, allowing for

scale in these industries does not add much to our understanding of the cost basis for trade flows.

For the remaining third of all industries, including such industries as pharmaceuticals and machin-

ery, we find strong evidence of increasing returns to scale. For this group, our general equilibrium

scale estimates have a modal range of 1.10-1.20. Scale is central to understanding trade for these

industries.

   At this stage, an important caveat is in order. We will be working with industry-level data, not

plant-level data. Thus, we will be finding a relationship between industry output and trade-revealed

industry costs. This relationship may be partly induced by underlying plant-level scale economies.

However, it may also be induced by industry-level externalities (e.g., Paul and Siegel 1999) and,

for the most technologically dynamic industries, by new process technologies that are embodied in



                                                   3
an increased scale of operation (e.g., Rosenberg 1982, 1994). To smooth the exposition, we use the

term ‘scale’ to include both the many familiar sources of scale as well as industry-level externalities

and scale-biased technical change. Whence the ‘All That’ of our title. This point is developed in

section 3.4.

   The reader with no trade interests may want to skip section 1 (a data preview) and skim section

2 (trade theory and econometric identification). The estimating equation appears in section 2.4

(equation 12). The core empirical work appears in section 3, especially tables 3 and 4. Sensitivity

analysis appears in section 4.



1. Preliminaries

1.1. The Data


The database constitutes one of the most, if not the most, comprehensive descriptions of the global

trading environment ever assembled. Its construction consumed two years of intensive work. The

data have four dimensions. (i) Countries. There are 71 countries covering the entire development

spectrum. See appendix table A.1 for a list of countries. (ii) Industries. There are 34 industries cov-

ering virtually the entire tradeables or goods-producing sector. 27 of these are 3-digit ISIC manu-

facturing industries. The remaining industries are non-manufacturing industries ranging from live-

stock to electricity generation. A list of industries appears in the tables below. (iii) Factors. There

are 11 factors: capital stock (Summers and Heston 1991), 4 levels of educational attainment (Barro

and Lee 1993), 3 energy stocks (coal reserves, oil and gas reserves, and hydroelectric potential),

and 3 types of land (cropland, pasture, and forests). (iv) Years. There are 5 years: 1972, 1977,


                                                  4
1982, 1987, and 1992.

   The database contains the following: (i) deflated bilateral trade and deflated gross output by

country, industry, and year, (ii) factor endowments and income by country and year, and (iii)

double-deflated input-output relations by year for the United States. See appendix A for database

details. Finer details will appear as a separate paper when the database is made publicly available.


1.2. Data Preview


The single most important fact supporting the use of increasing returns models is the presence of

intra-industry trade, that is, of trade in similar products. Models by Krugman (1979), Helpman

(1981), and Ethier (1982) were designed to explain such trade. (Though note that Davis (1995,

1997) provides Ricardian and Heckscher-Ohlin explanations of intra-industry trade.) Figure 1 plots

each country’s 1992 imports and exports of Instruments against its output of the Instruments in-

dustry (ISIC 385). A country’s imports from the rest of the world appear as a point above the axis

and a country’s exports to the rest of the world appear below the axis. Imports, exports, and out-

put are scaled by the country’s gross domestic product (gdp). The main point about the picture is

that countries with large imports also have large exports. This is intra-industry trade and has been

well-documented. What is surprising is how extensive it is both for large and small producers. This

may be the graphical counterpart to Hummels and Levinsohn’s (1993, 1995) result about how well

monopolistic competition models perform for poor countries. Another surprise is the mirror-like

quality across the horizontal axis. Some of this is entrepôt trade as in the case of Singapore, but

symmetry extends to all countries. One gets no sense of the specialization that lies at the heart of

theories of comparative advantage. A possible explanation is offshore sourcing of parts, a phe-

                                                 5
nomenon which we term ‘intra-mediate’ trade.

   Does this pattern hold for bilateral trade as well? Figure 2 plots bilateral trade in instruments

for cases where the U.S. is the importer (top panel) or exporter (bottom panel). For example, the

‘HKG’ observation in the upper right plots U.S. imports from Hong Kong against Hong Kong out-

put. The data are scaled by the gdp of the (non-U.S.) producer country. Remarkably, symmetry

persists even at the bilateral level. Another feature of the data is a point made by Harrigan (1996).

The bilateral monopolistic competition model predicts that country i’s imports from country j will

be proportional to j’s output (Helpman and Krugman 1985). Harrigan re-writes this as a log regres-

sion of bilateral imports on output, that is, as the regression line plotted in the top panel of figure
                                                                       
2 (though without gdp scaling). He obtains a slope of 1.2 and an R of 0.7. The similar figure 2
                                    
statistics - a slope of 1.4 and an R of 0.5 - reinforce how robust Harrigan’s results are. An odd

feature stemming from symmetry is that the regression line in the bottom panel of figure 2 also fits
                               
well (a slope of 0.6 and an R of 0.4). This means that the United States exports instruments to

big producers of instruments. This is not a prediction that comes out of the standard monopolis-

tic competition model. It is consistent with multinational sourcing of intermediate parts (Brainard

1993, 1997 and Feenstra and Hanson 1996a, 1996b, 1997).

   Increasing returns models often predict extreme patterns of specialization and regional concen-
                                                                                                     
tration of industry. A measure of regional concentration is the Herfindahl index defined as     
where     is country  ’s share of world production of good  . Table 1 reports the Herfindahl index

for 1992. Note from the ‘1992-1972’ column that the index has fallen over time in almost all in-

dustries. This is the globalization trend that has received so much attention. The most simplistic



                                                  6
model of scale returns predicts that increasing returns to scale industries will be geographically spe-

cialized and thus appear at the top of the table 1 list. Not surprisingly, Instruments and Machinery

appear near the top. Footwear and Leather Products - a priori constant returns industries - appear

near the bottom of the list as expected. The table reports three commonly used, albeit weak, proxies

of scale. These are described in the notes to table 1. There is a weak correlation between these mea-

sures and the Herfindahl index. Further inspection of the table reveals unexpected industries near

the top and bottom of the list. Coal Mining and Pulp and Paper are natural resource- or endowment-

based industries. Their position near the top is consistent with scale returns as well as with the

Heckscher-Ohlin model. We also constructed Krugman’s (1991) population-scaled Herfindahl in-

dex. By this measure natural resource-based industries topped the list of regionally concentrated

industries. Clay and Cement Products bottom out the list because of high transport costs. Thus,

scale returns in its simplest form explains some of the regional concentration of production, but

endowments, trade restrictions, and transport costs also contribute.



2. Theory and Estimating Equation

2.1. The Vanek Prediction with Increasing Returns to Scale


Vanek’s factor content prediction transparently structures the problem of inferring unavailable cost

and scale-elasticity information from available trade flow data. In this section we review the well-

known observation that Vanek’s factor content prediction may hold for both constant and increas-

ing returns to scale technologies (Helpman and Krugman 1985). We then follow Trefler (1996) in

deriving a definition of the factor content of trade that is theoretically consistent with existing data.

Appendix B provides a simple derivation of equation (1). Aside from using factor market-clearing,

the derivation is purely algebraic and based entirely on manipulation of input-output identities. For

our purpose, which is to consistently estimate scale elasticities, we do not need to interpret equa-

tions (1)-(3). All we will need is that the residuals W               # satisfy a familiar econometric orthogonality
condition. However, equation (1) does have an interpretation. Under the strong assumption that

W #  3 , equation (1) is the Vanek prediction. By way of an extended aside, we turn to this inter-
pretation.

       Under the standard Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek (HOV) assumptions, the                               P # are internationally
identical and, with identical homothetic preferences and internationally common goods prices,

consumption satisfies the condition           + 6 5 :6 d- + 6 59) 6 . Hence, W #  3 and the Vanek prediction
holds. Under the assumptions of many increasing returns to scale models, there will be interna-

tional specialization of production. Even though the P                     # will not be internationally identical, the
usual HOV consumption condition               + 6 5 :6 e- + 6 59) 6 is again enough to generate W #  3 .1 In-

ternational specialization of production is associated with scale returns (Helpman and Krugman

1985, chapter 3), exogenous international technology differences (Davis 1995), failure of factor

price equalization (Deardorff 1979 and Davis and Weinstein 1998), or a mix of these (Markusen

and Venables 1998).

    More intriguing is the possibility that the W           # might vanish even without production specializa-
tion or internationally identical P      # . In models with taste for variety (Krugman 1979) or ideal-type
preferences (Helpman 1981), each country buys every final good from every other country in pro-

portion to its size. Mathematically, 5         76 n- 59) 6bo *p8 . Thus, if two countries produce cheese, all

countries buy from both producers, not just one producer. Note that 5                  76 q- 59) 6 applies only to fi-

nal goods, not intermediate inputs. With 5           :6 T- 59) 6 , W #  3 and the Vanek prediction holds. The

observation that the Vanek prediction holds for a large class of increasing returns to scale models

is one of the central insights in Helpman and Krugman (1985).2

    There is a potential disconnect between our industry-level empirical work and the models of

the previous paragraph which feature internal returns to scale. One issue is whether with internal

returns to scale there will be an industry-level relationship between output and output per unit of

input. The answer is yes. The only exception is the CES utility case, but as Lancaster (1984) and

many others have noted, one does not want to take this case seriously for empirical work. A sec-

ond issue is whether our industry-level data allow us to distinguish between internal and external

      Note that in the absence of trade in intermediate inputs, the condition h(i7j mqu ih&wj is just the regression line
plotted in the top panel of figure 2 and examined so thoroughly by Harrigan (1996). This follows from the facts that
output i equals world demand h wi and consumption h i:j equals imports  i:j . Plugging i m h wi and h i:j m  i7j
into h i7j mYu i h w[j yields  i:j mYu i j . Thus, h i7j mYu i h w[j is implicit in much of the literature on monopolistic

returns to scale. Here the answer is no. This is the point of the ‘all that’ in our title and of the ‘What

is Scale?’ section below. At first glance it seems unusual that we do not need to distinguish be-

tween internal and external returns to scale. After all, they are very different in their implications

for market structure, the location of production, and trade patterns. The remarkable insight that

pervades Helpman and Krugman (1985) is that the form of scale returns has only very modest im-

plications for the factor content of trade. Thus, while predictions about the location of production

and the pattern of trade are often complicated, model-dependent, and/or just plain indeterminate

in this class of models, predictions about the factor content of trade are relatively straightforward.

This is a key reason for why we have chosen the factor content route.

    To conclude our discussion of the consumption condition, the interpretation of equation (1) as

a Vanek prediction requires W   #  3 . However, consistent estimation of scale elasticities requires a
weaker condition, namely, a familiar econometric orthogonality condition involving the ‘residual’

W # . We return to this point below.
    We turn next to the interpretation of   # as the factor content of trade. With W #  3 , " # 2 - " #*)
is the productivity-adjusted factor content of  ’s trade. It follows that so is   # . The question arises
as to why the equation (3) expression for       # is so unfamiliar. In the absence of traded interme-
diates, equation (3) reduces to the usual definition                < 4+ 6 P # 6 ; :6< e.g., Helpman and

Krugman (1985), equation 1.11. That is, producer-country choice of techniques are used to calcu-

late the required factor inputs. With traded intermediates there is a subtle problem associated with

the measurement of P?# . Current practice by all national statistical agencies is to construct P?# by

lumping together the inter-industry purchases of domestically produced and imported intermediate



                                                    11
inputs. One needs somehow to net out the imported intermediates. The second term in equation

(3) is the theoretically correct way of doing this.

       In equation (3) it appears as if we are using net trade for the factor content of intermediates

and gross trade for the factor content of final goods. Nothing could be more misleading. The two

bracketed terms in equation (3) are not decomposable in this way. Intermediate input terms such

as P   # ;IH enter equation (3) for the entirely different reason of netting out imported intermediates.
Appendix B develops this point. A more complete discussion appears in Trefler (1996).


2.2. Isolating Scale and Exogenous International Productivity Differences


The Vanek prediction of equation (1) is an implicit relation between trade flows and costs. (By

Shephard’s lemma the P?# are derivatives of cost functions.) It remains to relate costs to the scale

of output. Recall that PQ#    ' Z #   # /\ where  #   is the amount of factor  needed to produce

one unit of good  in country  . Since          #    is derived from cost minimization it depends on inter-

mediate input prices, factor input prices              Z Q ! \ , and industry  output     . The aim is

to show how this dependence can be restricted in a way that identifies the role of                         . To motivate

the analysis we start with the simple case of homothetic production functions and no intermediates.

These are reintroduced in the next section.

       Homotheticity implies separability of average costs:

no other sources of international differences in the K                                       . That is,3

We do not observe the derivative in equation (6). Further, when we move to a general equilibrium

interpretation of the               # , the  #          will each depend on cost derivatives not just in industry  , but in

all industries. The data requirements will be enormous. We need to cut through this.

         It is a commonplace among economists that factor prices are primarily determined by factor

productivity. Following Trefler (1993), we take this observation very seriously by assuming that

2.3. A Generalization


We now introduce intermediate inputs and non-homotheticities. Let Ü~#                                                be the amount of primary

factor input  demanded per unit of industry  output. Since our empirical results are not sensitive

to the choice of functional form for                         , we avoid excessive generality by introducing the form

that appears most frequently in the empirical sections. This is                                                  Z  \!ÝÞß . In the empirical
work we also sometimes allow à                          to vary across countries and factors. The extra math that stems

from letting        à   depend on  and                is not complicated. See Antweiler and Trefler (1997). With

        Turning from primary factor inputs to intermediate inputs, let äå                                  be the amount of intermedi-

ate input æ demanded per unit of industry  output. Unlike primary factors, we assume that inter-

mediate inputs are costlessly traded internationally. Thus, each intermediate input has a common,

quality-adjusted price internationally. We have extensively examined the empirical possibility of

scale effects associated with intermediate inputs. See Antweiler and Trefler (1997). However, this

substantially complicates the model without offering any additional empirical insights. As a result,

we simplify the exposition by assuming that there are no scale effects associated with intermedi-

ate inputs. For example, two cars require twice as many tires as one car. With this, equation (7)

becomes

                                                                 äå   Täå  ¡£¢                                                            (9)


Note that the system of input demands in equations (8)-(9) is non-homothetic. Duality results in

Epstein (1982) ensure that the system is supported by an underlying production function.

        Our parameter of interest is the elasticity of scale                          ç . We treat it as being independent of 

2.4. The Estimating Equation


At this point we introduce time subscripts  . From equation (1) we are interested in



                                   # "! Z ç \ ' %&# "! "&# "! 2 - "! + 6 %&# 6#! "$# 6#! 2   # "!¹Z ç \  W # $!                       (12)



where W      # "! is given by equation (2), # "!¹Z ç \ is given by equation (3), and P # "! in equation (3) is given
by equation (11). Note that ç does not vary with time. We find no evidence of this empirically (see

Antweiler and Trefler 1997) and so forego the additional notation.

          # "! Z ç \ also depends on the %&# "! . With 71 countries, 11 factors, 5 years, and the normaliza-
tion %&# ¡V¢ !   '  , there are 3,850 %&# "! . Rather than estimate them, we use %&# "!  `# "! . `# ¡V¢ ! and
plug in data for          `# "! . `# ¡V¢ ! wherever %&# "! appears in equation (12). For labour factors, `# "! is
the average manufacturing wage (from the same source as the output data). For capital we use the

Penn World Table price of capital (Summers and Heston 1991). For cropland we use gdp gener-

ated by crops in 1985 per hectare of cropland. For pasture, we use gdp generated by livestock in

1985 per hectare of pasture. Data are from the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United

Nations (1992, tables 1.4 and 1.6). For forestry, data limitations force us to assume %&#                                    $! n . For
energy (coal reserves, oil and gas reserves, and hydroelectric potential), endowments and output

are either measured in joules in the source data or we have converted them to joules using interna-

tionally recognized converters. Since the conversion to joules is country-specific and already takes

into account international quality differences, the correct assumption for energy is %&#                                    "!  .
      Three data issues remain before we can examine equation (12). First, following Conway

(2000), -      $!    is based on PPP-adjusted income. See appendix A. Second, ÷                               #! ¡£¢ and ù ¡£¢ in equation

                                                                        17
(11) and   è in equation (10) use U.S. data. The source data are described in appendix A. Third,
we need to know the share of trade that is intermediate inputs trade. For example, we observe

B "!< &U B "!H , but not B "!< or B "!H separately. Appendix C details our method for allocating trade into
its intermediate and final goods components. We were initially concerned that our estimates of ç

would be sensitive to our allocation method. This turns out to be a misplaced concern. To persuade

the reader of this, appendix C also reports estimates of scale for many different allocation methods.

   We summarize by noting some differences between our general equilibrium approach and ex-

isting partial equilibrium approaches to estimating scale returns in a cross-country setting. On the

input side, data on industry-level inputs are notoriously bad or non-existent e.g., labour inputs by

educational attainment. While partial equilibrium approaches must use such data, our approach al-

lows us to use national-level aggregates. These aggregates are typically more reliable. In addition,

our approach easily allows us to model international differences in input productivities i.e., the %&# .

On the output side, we are able to shift some of the burden off of gross output data and onto trade

flow data. Real gross output data suffer a number of serious problems, especially for poorer coun-

tries. In contrast, trade flow data are more accurate, measured in dollars, and with the approximate

assumption of equal prices across countries, correspond more directly to physical quantities. Thus,

the general equilibrium approach allows us to exploit alternative and somewhat more reliable data

sources.

We re-write equation (12) as our final estimating equation

where the following holds.         # $! Z ç \ is defined in equation (12). The % # "! are generalized least

the     % # "! in detail. W # $! of equations (2) and (12) is now written as the sum of two components,

W # "! . % # "! '& U( # $! . The & are country fixed effects and the ( # "! are independently and identically
distributed disturbances with mean zero. We estimate equation (13) using maximum likelihood

(ML), non-linear least squares (NLS), and non-linear two-stage least-squares (NL2SLS) estima-

tors. These are reviewed in the next section.


3.1. Preliminary Estimation


To fix ideas about the specification we start with the strong assumption that all industries exhibit

the same degree of scale economies. We will relax this shortly. We pool across all 71 countries, all

11 factors, and all 5 years to give us *V   + 3-,   observations. The 5 years are 1972, 1977, 1982, 1987,

and 1992.

      Table 2 reports the estimated scale elasticities for a variety of estimators. We start with the ML

and NLS estimators. They are distinguished by their use of exogeneity assumptions. In general

equilibrium almost everything is endogenous including endowments of physical and human capi-



                                                         19
tal. Minimizing endogeneity bias would seem to require treating the most mis-measured variables

as left-hand side variables. (This is informally supported by Klepper and Leamer 1984). National

endowments and the data used to construct the %&#              "!   strike us as fitting the bill. For example, the

capital stock data and quality-adjusted measures of education stocks are troublesome. Therefore,

for the purposes of ML and NLS estimation, we treat %&#                 "! "$# "! 2 - "! + 6 %&# 6.! "$# 6.!   as a left-hand side

variable and   # "!¹Z ç \ as a right-hand side variable. From row (1) of table 2, the ML estimate is 1.051
and the NLS estimate is 1.050. The other estimated parameters of the model are the variance and

GLS parameters. These appear in appendix table A.3. Although not reported in table 2, similar

results obtain without the %&#   "!    or fixed effects. The %&#    "!    ML estimate is 1.043 and the no-fixed

effect ML estimate is 1.054. See Antweiler and Trefler (1997) for additional specifications.

    One null hypothesis is that there exists scale returns (H/10Sç                         0      ) and that the Helpman-
Krugman variant of the Vanek factor content prediction is ‘true.’ An explicit alternative hypothesis

is that there are constant returns to scale (H/20çl ), in which case our model reduces to the usual

Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek factor content prediction. The ML  -statistic of 13.41 is for the hypothe-

sis çX    . The  -statistic tells us that the data favour the Helpman-Krugman, increasing-returns
framework over the Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek model. This is a novel and important general equilib-

rium result.

    The ML estimate treats            # $! Z ç \ as exogenous. We examine endogeneity by using instrumental
variables methods. The ‘ 3IT    #  ! Ý 4 Z ç \ ’ columns use a standard Amemiya (1974) NL2SLS esti-
mator with # "! Z ç \ instrumented by its lagged value #  ! Z ç \ . (The NL2SLS minimand appears
                                                                  Ý4
in appendix E.) The longer is the lag 5 , the more likely is the instrument to be orthogonal to the

error. Recalling that we have data for 1972, 1977, 1982, 1987, and 1992, the longest possible lag is

20 years. However, the longer the lag, the fewer are the observations left for estimation. Given the

poor small-sample properties of IV estimators (Nelson and Startz 1990), we prefer to use a 15-year

lag. In this case,   Z #  6#7  #  8  \ is instrumented by Z #  7   #  77 \ . Row (2) reports the results for
15-year lags. This leaves us with            N:9ûN@ _ ,<; observations. The NL2SLS estimate of
1.095 is significantly larger than the NLS estimate of 1.044 in that the estimators’ 1% confidence

intervals are non-overlapping. This is the basis for a Hausman exogeneity test. While the Hausman

statistic is negative, it seems likely that exogeneity would be rejected by a refined test that takes

into account the correlation between the two estimators. We have not attempted this.

   We also considered a larger instrument set constructed from polynomials of the instrument

 #  ! Ý 4 . In rows (2)-(4), the instrument set is = Z #  ! Ý 4 \.>@?@>A F  where B       in row (2), B   C*
in row (3), and B       , in row (4). See the ‘B ’ column in table 2. As is apparent, the results are
insensitive to the size of the instrument set.

   Table 2 also reports results for different lag lengths. In rows (5)-(7), we consider the shorter

lag length of 10 years (     D*<E* observations). In rows (8)-(10), we consider the longer lag length of
20 years ( 9<FV observations). The results are insensitive to the choice of lag length.

   NL2SLS with our lagged instrument set is dominated in efficiency terms by NL2SLS with an
                                G                  G

estimates are mathematically equivalent.

        The bottom line from table 2 is that there is evidence of modest scale economies at the aggre-

gate level no matter how one tackles estimation. The elasticity estimate of 1.051 is well within the

bounds of what has been reported in the U.S. time series literature (e.g., Basu 1995 and Basu and

Fernald 1997). Against our conclusion of statistically significant scale returns must be weighed the

economically small size of the estimated ç . A 1% rise in output is associated with a 0.05% fall in

average costs. Further, a country operating at a tenth of U.S. levels has only 14% higher average

costs.8 Of course, in dynamic models such as those displaying endogenous growth and especially

hysteresis, ç­         3-,  can have important consequences.
        The factor demand implications of                 ç       3-,  are much larger than the average cost impli-
cations. From equation (8), the elasticity of factor demand per unit of output is à . From the last

footnote, ç­ 3-,        implies à1 3 HF . That is, a 1% rise in output leads to a 0.18% fall in demand
for primary inputs per unit of output. Further, a country operating at a tenth of U.S. output levels

uses 51%       Z   3 JÝ I 6 2  \ more productivity-adjusted factor inputs per unit of output. Thus, from
the perspective of factor endowments theory even this small scale estimate is very important. We

will see that it has some implications for the ‘mystery of missing trade’ (Trefler 1995).

3.2. Industry-Level Analysis


General equilibrium estimation is complicated. We have found it computationally infeasible to

simultaneously estimate separate scale elasticities for all 34 industries. Fortunately, there are other

paths to interesting results. Consider the following iterative three-step procedure:


   1. Rank industries by the size of their scale elasticities. In the first iteration this ranking is based

         on external information. In subsequent iterations it is taken from the output of the previous

         iteration.


   2. Pick a particular industry  , place all industries higher in the ranking in one group and all

         industries lower in the ranking in another group. Industry  sits in a separate, third group.

         Use ML to estimate equation (13) subject to the restriction that all industries within a group

         share a common scale elasticity. This yields scale estimates çVUXW
                                                                                      G             G                 G

         high, low, and  groups, respectively.9


   3. Repeat step 2 for each  . This yields a set of scale estimates                     = çG Z  \?]\^F  .   Return to step 1

         using   = çG Z  \? \ ^F    to rank industries.


Since the choice of initial rank does not matter, we defer description of this choice to the ‘Sensitivity

Analysis’ section. In that section we also note that there are no algorithm convergence issues.

                                                                                                G \

are insignificantly different from unity at the 1% level. In a few cases, such as electricity where
G
ç Z  \  3 E and  3  ; 9 , being in the CRS group really means that scale returns are imprecisely
estimated. The ‘Non-Robust’ group collects industries for which scale is not robustly estimated.

Robustness will be made precise in the ‘Sensitivity Section’ section below.

    Table 3 shows a number of striking patterns. First, the constant returns to scale industries are

all sensible. These include Apparel, Leather, and Footwear. Second, the industries estimated to

display scale returns are also all sensible. These include Pharmaceuticals, Electric and Electronic

Machinery, and Non-Electrical Machinery.

    To get a handle on magnitudes, consider a scale elasticity of 1.15. This implies that a 1% rise

in output leads to a 0.13% fall in average cost. Further, a country operating at a tenth of U.S. levels

faces 55% higher average costs. These are large numbers.

    How do our results compare to existing partial equilibrium production function-based esti-

mates? Tybout (2000) surveyed studies for many developing countries and found little evidence

of scale returns. This is a key finding. He partly attributed it to the fact that “small firms in de-

veloping countries tend not to locate in those industries where they would be at substantial cost

disadvantage relative to larger incumbents” (Tybout 2000, page 19). This squares readily with our

finding of constant returns to scale in all low-end manufacturing industries. The evidence of scale



                                                   24
from middle-income countries is less clear cut. Using Chilean plant-level data for 8 industries,

Levinsohn and Petrin (1999) estimated scale returns from value-added production functions that

are never less than 1.20 and reach as high 1.44. Using Mexican plant-level data, Tybout and West-

brook (1995) obtained almost no evidence of scale for large plants. It is not immediately clear

that our results are inconsistent with Tybout and Westbrook: we find constant returns for many in-

dustries and increasing returns primarily for industries not examined by them. For rich countries,

Harrigan (1999) found no evidence of scale in cross-country regressions. However, many other

OECD country studies point clearly to the existence of scale returns. Paul and Siegel (1999) es-

timated industry-level scale returns in the range of 1.30 for many U.S. manufacturing industries.

Estimates closer to our mode of 1.15 are common in OECD studies e.g., Fuss and Gupta (1981)

for Canada and Griliches and Ringstad (1971) for Norway. Thus, our general equilibrium results

are consistent with some, though not all of the existing partial equilibrium benchmarks.


3.3. Grouped Results


A drawback to the approach of the last section is that we did not simultaneously estimate each

industry’s scale elasticity. The estimation algorithm is only partially simultaneous. Further, we

did not deal with endogeneity. To address these issues we follow table 3 in classifying industries

into three groups: IRS, CRS, and Non-Robust.10 We then estimate the model under the assumption

that scale elasticities are the same within each group, but different between groups. Note that the

IRS group includes both manufacturing and natural resource-based IRS industries. Disaggregation

  10
    The classification of industries into these 3 groups is slightly different from that reported in table 3. This is a minor
point; however, we cannot properly explain it until after we have laid out the criteria for being in the ‘Non-Robust’
group. See the ‘Sensitivity Analysis’ section below.


                                                            25
of the IRS group into manufacturing and natural resources adds little to the analysis.

   The top panel of table 4 reports the results for the usual specification with 71 countries and 11

factors. The NL2SLS estimator uses the preferred instrument set from row 3 of table 2. That is, it

uses the   #  ! Ý 4 Z ç \ instrument set with a B   c* polynomial order and a 15-year lag length. This
leaves us with only the years 1987 and 1992. We do not report any of the other specifications that

appeared in table 2 since this would be too repetitive. Instead, we report the results for the sample

consisting only of our 23 OECD members. (See table A.1 for a list of these countries and the end

of appendix A for a discussion of how the world is defined with 23 countries.) From the bottom

panel of table 4, the 23-country results are very similar to the 71-country results, though somewhat

less significant. The reduced significance arises from having eliminated an important source of

sample variation, namely, trade with non-OECD countries such as Hong Kong and Singapore. For
                                  
23 countries, the Hausman d            test statistic of 490 strongly supports the hypothesis of endogeneity.
   The conclusions from table 4 are clear. The IRS group is always estimated to have significant

scale returns. As in table 2, the NL2SLS estimate is larger than its ML counterpart which assume

exogeneity. The CRS group is always estimated to have a scale elasticity that is insignificantly

different from unity. For the Non-Robust group, almost by definition, the conclusion depends on

the estimation method. Overall, the table 4 results are wholly consistent with the estimates reported

in tables 2-3. By implication we must abandon empirical models that treat all industries as if they

were subject exclusively to either constant or increasing returns. Both play an important role for

understanding the sources of comparative advantage.

3.4. What is Scale?


As discussed in the introduction, we are using scale (and ‘all that’) to mean something more than

just plant-level economies. For one, scale likely includes industry-level externalities. By way of

example, growth of the Petroleum Refining industry was accompanied by the development of a

host of specialized inputs including specialized engineering firms, industry-sponsored institutes,

and specialized machinery manufacturers. Paul and Siegel (1999) argued that more than half of

the relationship between cost and scale in U.S. manufacturing is due to such industry-level exter-

nalities. To the extent that this holds worldwide, it implies that a portion of what we are calling

‘scale’ is actually industry-level externalities.

   Also, scale likely includes aspects of dynamic international technology differences. In table 3,

the industries with the largest scale estimates are often those where technical change has been most

rapid e.g., Pharmaceuticals. New goods often engender new process technologies and these new

process technologies are often embodied in larger plants. As Rosenberg (1982, 1994) has tirelessly

argued:



      “In this respect it is much more common than it ought to be to assume that the exploita-
      tion of the benefits of large-scale production is a separate phenomenon independent of
      technological change. In fact, larger plants typically incorporate a number of techno-
      logical improvements ...” (Rosenberg 1994, page 199)


While it is important conceptually to distinguish between scale and dynamic technical change, the

fact that technical change is the hand maiden of scale makes this distinction empirically problem-

atic. Even with the unusually detailed McKinsey data, Baily and Gersbach (1995) were forced

to lump international technology differences together with scale as inseparable sources of global

                                                    27
competition. In short, for the most dynamic industries, available data do not allow us to distinguish

between scale and scale-biased technical change. This is a critical area for future research.

    Is it possible that our scale estimates also capture more traditional or static international tech-

nology differences? At the most obvious level the answer is no. Our                    %&# explicitly capture the
most important static international technology differences. A more subtle approach to answering

the question is as follows. Suppose that country  is particularly efficient at producing a good in

the sense of having a large ratio of output to employment. By Ricardian comparative advantage,

the country will expand output of the industry. Looking across countries for a single industry, the

larger is the level of industry output, the larger is the ratio of output to employment. The careless

researcher will incorrectly attribute this correlation to increasing returns to scale. Obviously we

have not been careless. However, to dispel any possible confusion we make the following obser-

vations.

    The first observation draws on an analogy between our general equilibrium econometric work

and the econometrics of production functions.11 Static international technology differences can

be thought of as unobserved productivity shocks that effect decisions about both inputs and out-

puts. They therefore induce endogeneity bias in regressions of output on inputs (e.g., Griliches and

Mairesse 1995). The techniques commonly used to control for unobserved productivity shocks

are fixed effects and IV estimators. These are exactly the econometric techniques we have used

throughout this paper. These techniques provided no evidence that our scale estimates are arti-

  11
     We hasten to add that the analogy with partial equilibrium production function estimation only goes so far. In our
general equilibrium setting, observations have a factor dimension and data from all industries enter into each obser-
vation. See equation (13).




                                                         28
facts of unobserved international productivity differences.12

    The second observation about the correct interpretation of our results comes from the cross-

industry distribution of our scale estimates. In the Ricardian interpretation, all relatively low-cost

producers are large producers. That is, static international technology differences will masquerade

as scale effects in all industries, be it Pharmaceuticals or Apparel. If so, we should have estimated

significant scale effects in every industry. We found nothing of the sort. To the contrary, we found

strong evidence of constant returns to scale in many industries e.g., Apparel. We thus find the Ri-

cardian interpretation untenable.

    To summarize this section, our scale estimates likely capture plant-level scale, industry-level

externalities, and scale-biased technical change. However, the idea that our estimates of increasing

returns to scale are really static international technology differences in disguise has about as much

life in it as old Ricardo himself.



4. Sensitivity Analysis

In assigning industries to the IRS and CRS groups, we have been using a stringent set of criteria:

the inference of increasing or constant returns was required to be robust across a wide variety of

specifications. Industries that did not meet the criteria were unceremoniously dumped into the Non-

Robust group. This section reviews the sensitivity analysis underlying our robustness criteria. In

   12
      To the contrary, the IV estimates were sometimes larger than the ML estimates. This IV-ML ranking deserves
further consideration. In a production function setting, endogeneity bias is usually taken to mean that the coefficient
on labour is upward-biased and the coefficient on less variable inputs such as capital are downward biased (Olley and
Pakes 1996). It need not imply that the sum of the coefficients (i.e., the scale elasticity) is upward biased. Indeed,
Levinsohn and Petrin (1999) found that a modified Olley-Pakes solution to endogeneity bias raises the estimate of
scale in 3 of 8 Chilean industries examined. Thus, there is nothing terribly unusual about our IV-ML ranking.



                                                         29
the interests of space, the discussion is terse.

    There are three issues to be clarified before robustness can be fully defined. The first deals with

whether the results depend on the initial ranking of industries used to kick off the section 3.2 esti-

mation algorithm. Consider table 5. Results in the ‘Initial Rank: Baseline’ column with 71 coun-

tries and 11 factors reproduce the table 3 results. A single asterisk indicates that
                                                                                                     G
                                                                                                     ç Z  \ is greater
than unity at the 1% level, two asterisks indicate            0e, and three asterisks indicate  0  3 . The
baseline initial rank uses an initial ranking that is an average of industries’ capital-intensity and

skill-intensity ranks. See the last column of table 1. Results in the ‘Initial Rank: Alternative’ col-

umn use an initial ranking based on the scale parameters reported in Paul and Siegel (1999).13 The

baseline and alternative initial ranks are very different. The correlation is only 0.13. It is therefore

re-assuring that the scale estimates produced by the two initial ranks are almost identical. That is,

the table 3 results are insensitive to the initial ranking.

    The second robustness issue deals with parameter stability across a variety of specifications.

Table 3 reports results for the specification with 71 countries, 11 factors, and 5 years. For robust-

ness, we require similar results from a specification using only the 23 OECD countries in our sam-

ple. We also require similar results from a specification that places more weight on capital and

labour and less weight on land and energy i.e., a specification with 7 factors (aggregate land, ag-

gregate energy, capital, and 4 types of labour). The last two columns of table 5 provide the scale

estimates for these two specifications.

   13
      Paul and Siegel (1999) work at a higher level of aggregation (19 manufacturing industries). We therefore repeated
their scale elasticity values at the disaggregated level (27 manufacturing industries) where necessary. For industries
not covered by Paul and Siegel (7 non-manufacturing industries), we set the scale elasticities to unity. In the case of
ties we used information from the baseline initial rank.



                                                         30
    Looking across the four table 4 specifications, the following emerges. There is considerable

stability across specifications for the ‘IRS - Manufacturing’ industries and somewhat less stability

for the ‘IRS - Natural Resources’ industries. The least amount of stability is for the ‘Non-Robust’

category. It is composed of industries that display significant increasing returns in one specifica-

tion and constant returns in another. By definition, the Non-Robust group displays the greatest

instability. Table 5 over-represents instability by omitting the CRS industries listed in table 3. By

definition of the CRS group, its member industries always display constant returns (insignificant
G
ç Z  \ ). Hence scale estimates for this group are very stable across specifications.
    Before turning to our last robustness issue we will need to comment on the convergence of

our section 3.2 algorithm. All the results reported in this paper are based on 10 iterations of the

algorithm. To examine convergence, at least for the table 3 specification, we allowed the algorithm

to run the extra two weeks needed to complete 20 iterations. The results were unchanged from those

reported in table 3. Thus, we have restricted ourselves to 10 iterations of the algorithm.

    The third and last robustness issue arises from the fact that the estimation algorithm converges

to a cycling pattern for some industries. For example, in the baseline initial rank specification with

71 countries and 11 factors, the Basic Chemicals and Plastic Products industries either both display

increasing returns (as in odd iterations of our algorithm) or both display constant returns (as in even

iterations). Cycling could never happen in traditional industry-by-industry production function es-

timation and captures in an obvious way the fact that we are estimating scale returns in a general

equilibrium setting. In tables 3 and 5, the cycling industries are added to the Non-Robust group.

In the absence of cycling it does not matter whether we report the 9¹æ or 10¹æ iterations. Thus, for



                                                  31
the IRS category we only report the 10¹æ iteration. For those Non-Robust industries that cycle, it

does matter which iteration we report. In order to keep the table manageable, for the Non-Robust

group we report the average value of ç
                                               G \   across the 9¹æ and 10¹æ iterations.
                                                 Z
    The classification of industries is based on robustness across specifications. However, for a

given specification some of the Non-Robust industries properly belong in the CRS or IRS groups.

In table 5, these CRS and IRS industries are indicated by the absence of an entry and by a f , re-

spectively. These Non-Robust industries are classified accordingly in table 4. For example, in the

table 4 specification with 71 countries, Furniture and Fixtures is included in the CRS group.

    We can now explain exactly how industries are classified. For each industry consider the 8

estimates of ç   Z  \ that come from 4 specifications (the 4 column headings in table 5) and 2 iterations
of our algorithm (the 9¹æ and 10¹æ iterations). If all 8 of these
                                                                                  G
                                                                                  ç Z  \ are insignificant at the 1%
level then the industry is classified as CRS. If all 8 of these
                                                                             G
                                                                             ç Z  \ always exceed unity and do so
significantly at least once, then the industry is classified as IRS. If the industry fails to meet either

criteria then it is classified as Non-Robust.14 This scheme ensures that only the most robust results

appear in the CRS and IRS groups.

    To conclude, table 5 pointedly illustrates two important features of our work. First, for about

a third of all industries, the data are simply not informative about scale economies. These are the

industries that appear in the Non-Robust group. Second, our criteria for classifying an industry as

CRS or IRS is that the inference about scale is the same across many different specifications. For

   14
      This classification criterion is for manufacturing industries. For natural resource-based industries the criterion is
the same except that we omit from consideration the specification with 71 countries and 7 factors. With energy and
land endowments so heavily aggregated, the 7-factor data convey very little information about natural resource-based
industries. This can be seen from table 5.



                                                           32
these industries, the inference about scale is remarkably robust.



5. Trade and Wages

We have been assuming that scale effects are the same across factors. This masks non-homotheti-

cities such as skill-biased scale effects. With factor non-homotheticities scale is more difficult to

estimate, but the elasticity of unit factor demand à#
                                                                               gh #     ig h 

ward concept.15 To examine factor non-homotheticities we drop our prevailing assumption that

àÕ# is independent of  and instead assume that it is independent of  .
       Table 6 reports the ML estimates of à# for the specification with 71 countries and 5 years. There

are only 355 observations. We do not report the instrumental variables estimates since in all cases

the Hausman test easily rejects endogeneity. The table evidences substantial non-homotheticities

across factors. A 1% rise in output leads to a fall of 0.21% in the demand for high school drop-

outs per unit of output and a rise of 0.21% in the demand for high school graduates. That is, the

                                                                       jE
                                                                              <k  Z   Z   \*\ . When further

disaggregated we see the same pattern magnified. Larger output is associated with skill-biased

demand. In their detailed study of the telecommunications industry, Denny and Fuss (1983) also

found skilled-biased output effects.

       Skill-biased output effects have important implications for the trade-and-wages debate. To the

extent that trade leads to specialization and greater output, it also leads to relatively greater demand

for skilled labour and hence to rising earnings inequality. Our skill-biased result also has implica-

tions for the rise of ‘intra-mediate’ trade (see section 1.2) since it is consistent with the Feenstra

and Hanson (1996a,b) picture of offshore sourcing as a cause of rising earnings inequality.



6. The Case of the Missing Trade and Other Mysteries

The fully simultaneous model that we have presented is sparsely parameterized: it has only three

scale parameters. It is thus not surprising that we do not dramatically revitalize the HOV model.

Consider the specification with 71 countries, 11 factors, and 5 years from the first row of table 4.

We use three statistics to evaluate it: (i) Trefler’s (1995) ‘missing trade’ statistic; (ii) the correlation

between the factor content of trade and its endowment predictor; and, (iii) the Bowen et al. (1987)

sign test. For the unmodified model (constant returns and %&#       "! ÿ ), the three statistics are 0.003,
0.14, and 0.67, respectively. For the modified model with three groups and %&#       "! 
                                                                                         >    (row 1 of table

4) the statistics are 0.117, 0.40, and 0.66, respectively. That is, there is a significant improvement

in the missing trade and correlation statistics. Much of the improvement in the correlation statis-

tic comes from introducing the         %&# "! . The improvement in the missing trade statistic comes from
both the %&#   "!   and the scale parameters. It is clear why there is less missing trade. As noted at the

end of section 3.1, even small scale estimates translate into large international differences in the

factor inputs needed per unit of output. It is interesting that the missing trade statistic improves

most for skilled labour (secondary and post-secondary education) and not at all for workers with

no education.




                                                      34
7. Conclusions

Do scale economies contribute to our understanding of the factor content of trade? To answer

this question we examined Helpman and Krugman’s variant of the Vanek factor content prediction.

The prediction is particularly interesting in that it arises from a large class of general equilibrium,

increasing returns to scale models. To examine the prediction, we proposed an estimating equation

that is tightly allied to the theory. The equation embodies three determinants of trade: endowments,

exogenous international productivity differences (%&# ), and increasing returns to scale. Admittedly,

this list is incomplete. However, in our quest for truly general equilibrium estimates of scale, the

requirement of tractability forced us to limit our consideration to only these three determinants

of trade. This said, our empirical results strikingly demonstrate that scale economies must figure

prominently for any understanding of the factor content of trade.

   We also asked a second question. What does international trade reveal about the extent of scale

economies? Much less of our formal structure was needed to answer this second question. Con-

sistent estimation of scale economies primarily requires a standard orthogonality condition on the

W # of equation (2). While the economics of this condition are not entirely clear, it is no surprise
that less structure is needed for estimator consistency. After all, the guiding empirical insight of

this paper is that trade moves from low-cost exporters to high-cost importers. By implication, trade

data must convey information about costs and scale elasticities.

   Just as you cannot squeeze water from a stone, you cannot infer scale without extensive data.

To this end, we constructed a unique and comprehensive database on trade flows, output, and fac-

tor endowments for 71 countries over the 1972-92 period. Even with this detailed data, we were


                                                  35
unable to completely disentangle the factors underlying our industry-level scale estimates. The

remaining entangled factors are plant-level scale, industry-level externalities and, for the most dy-

namic industries, scale-biased technical change. This list is the ‘all that’ of our title and a primer

for future research.

   Our main conclusions are as follows. (i) We estimated that output expansion is strongly skill-

biased. This has important and hitherto unnoticed implications for rising wage inequality. (ii) Pool-

ing across industries, we precisely estimated moderate scale elasticities (ç   d 3-, ). This has im-
portant implications for endogenous growth, particularly since our sample of countries spans the

entire development spectrum. (iii) At least a third of all goods-producing industries display con-

stant returns to scale. For this group, scale does not contribute to our understanding of international

trade. Another third of all goods-producing industries are characterized by increasing returns. The

modal range of scale elasticities for this group is 1.10–1.20. For this group scale is central to our

understanding of the factor content of trade.

   Our results point to the importance of integrating constant and increasing returns to scale in-

dustries within a single general equilibrium framework. We showed how to implement this em-

pirically. Further, we found that the Helpman-Krugman framework provides a remarkable lens for

viewing the scale elasticities encoded in trade flows. Finally, our results highlight the importance

of scale and ‘all that’ as a source of comparative advantage.

A. Data and Their Sources

Data on endowments are constructed as follows. Capital stocks are from Summers and Heston
(1991). When available, we used the capital stock series. Otherwise, we used Leamer’s (1984)
double declining balance method applied to investment. Educational-attainment in the population
is from Barro and Lee (1993). We updated it to 1992. Energy is the sum of joule-equivalent re-
serves of hard coal, soft coal, crude oil, natural gas, and hydroelectric potential. Data are from the
World Resources Institute diskette and other minor sources. Land is the sum of cropland, pasture,
and forests as reported in FAO diskettes. All endowments are stocks, not flows.
    For each country, industry, and year we have assembled data on international trade and produc-
tion. Table A.1 lists the countries in the database. (South Korea was inadvertently omitted from our
group of 23 OECD countries.) Trade data are from the Statistics Canada “World Trade Database.”
Production data are from the UNIDO INDSTAT production data base, from the UN General Indus-
trial Statistics (including its earlier incarnations), and from other minor sources. Our 34 industries
completely cover the tradeables sector except for metal mining, non-metal mining, and miscella-
neous manufacturing. These three have no sensible production data because of aggregation prob-
lems. As a result they are included in the analysis, but are treated as constant returns to scale in-
         ç   \ so that the estimating equations are independent of their data. We also applied the
dustries Zl
same ç­ constraint to the Crude Petroleum and Natural Gas industry for the 23-country results
in table 4. This makes little difference to the results, but seemed the sensible way to deal with trade
flows given that (i) the 23-country group omits the major oil producers and (ii) the 23-country ç

combined with Current Population Surveys. For capital they primarily come from the U.S. ‘fixed
reproducible tangible wealth’ series. For all other factors they come from the usual unique-use
assumption. For example, the coal mining industry is the only industry that uses coal reserves.
The P?#! ¡£¢ were deflated by the theoretically correct method of double-deflating using BEA price

   For è   in equation (10), we use the 1982 U.S. value of è       calculated across our 34+3 industries.
From the U.S. input-output table, this value is è     3  9mE .

Recall that;IH is country  ’s imports of foreign-produced intermediate inputs. Let n A be  ’s use

Subtracting equation (16) from equation (15) and using +     6 ú<# 6  3 yields equation (1).

gross output includes foreign-produced intermediates. P?# 'q÷ # Zø 2­ù \Ý is thus the amount of
factor  that would have been used to produce the required gross output had the required output all
been produced domestically. Since, roughly speaking, ; H of it was produced abroad, using PQ#
inflates the factor content of trade by an amount PQ# ; H . The equation (3) factor content expression
corrects for this by including terms like 2 P?# ; H .


C. Trade in Intermediate Inputs

In this appendix we investigate the role of our assumption about the share of trade that is trade in
intermediate inputs. Let ;         < :6#! and ; H :6.! be country  ’s imports of good  from country 8 in year 
for final goods and intermediate inputs, respectively. We observe ; 76.! ' ; < :6.! U ; H :6.! , but not
; < :6#! or ;IH :6.! . The problem is to choose an appropriate value for the share of intermediate inputs
in total trade, r :6#! ' ; H 76.! . ; 76.! .
       We begin by noting that the bulk of world trade is trade in intermediate inputs so that we might
conservatively expect the r        :6.! to exceed one half. Consider Canada-U.S. bilateral trade since we
are most familiar with these data. Careful examination of these data reveals that at least two thirds
of it is intermediates trade.16 This conclusion is consistent with the aggregate numbers. For the

  16
    Government of Canada (1997) reports the average of imports and exports for the following categories. Consumer
goods account for 7% of trade. None of this is intermediate inputs. Machinery and industrial goods account for 42%


                                                            39
United States in 1987, intermediate inputs plus private investment as a percentage of gross output
was 53%. The percentage is higher for the goods-producing tradeable sector i.e., for the industries
that concern us. Thus, we expect r            :6.! to exceed one half on average. We emphasize that one half
is a conservative number.
       We next turn to our choice of          r :6.! .     V¡ ¢ ! , n ¡V¢ ! , and ø ¡£¢ ! be U.S. gross output, in-
                                                          Let
termediate inputs, and investment in industry  in year  . We assume that r :6#! equals r :6#! '
Z n ¡£¢ ! U ø ¡£¢ !t\ .  ¡£¢ ! . r :6#! ranges from 0.28 to 1.00 across our 34 industries and 5 years.
     Table A.2 explores the sensitivity of our results to different choices of r :6.! . The first row of
the table reports the ML estimate
                                          G
                                       ç for the model with 71 countries, 11 factors, 5 years, and our
                                                      G
baseline assumption r :6#! 1r :6.! . It is the same ç as in the first row of table 2. The second row uses
a r :6.! that is halfway between r :6.! and unity. The third row uses a r 76.! that is halfway between
r :6.! and zero. It is clear that such radical changes in the choice of r 76.! make little difference to
our estimates of scale.
       The remaining rows of table A.2 set               r 76.!   to a constant. It is our strong contention that           r :6#!
averaged across industries should exceed one half. From table A.2, allowing r:6.! to fall to one half
                        G
makes no difference to ç . Further, the loglikelihood value declines monotonically as r 76.! moves
from unity to zero. This suggests, as expected, that the model fits the data better for large values
of r    :6.! . To conclude, our results are robust to a wide range of assumptions about the allocation of
trade between intermediate inputs and final goods.


D. GLS Variance Parameters

The estimating equation (13) involves a GLS correction %                    # "! . We parameterize % # "! as % # $! ' -s"! % # !
where     - s"! is a control for country size and % # ! is a control for factor size. t is a parameter to be

of trade. All of this is intermediate inputs. Automotive goods account for 29% of trade. From the Canadian 1988
input-output tables, under half of this or 12% is trade in parts. Parts are intermediate inputs. Assuming conservatively
that no finished automotive goods are intermediate inputs (e.g., treating trucks as final goods), only 12% of automotive
trade is intermediate inputs. ‘Other’ goods account for 23% of trade. ‘Other’ goods is dominated by forestry products
which in turn is primarily used as intermediates in the construction industry. We conservatively assume that only half
or 11% of ‘Other’ goods trade is intermediate inputs. The sum of 42% plus 12% plus 11% is 65%. That is, at least
two-thirds of Canada-U.S. trade is intermediates trade.



                                                                  40
estimated.       % #!   is defined as the cross-country variance of                        # $! Z ç d \ . - sv$! u where # "! is defined
in equation (12).  tX/ was chosen by an iterative procedure: pick an initial tX/ , estimate the model
              G                    G                                        G
to obtain an t , set tX/ equal to t , and repeat until tX/ converges to t . It quickly became clear that
     G
the t always lie in the tight interval Z 3 $F  3 j+* \ . As a result, we set tX/ equal to 0.9 for all the
                                                                                                 G
estimates reported in the paper. (Setting tX/ to 0.80 or 1.00 makes no difference.) The t for the ML
                                                                                               G
specifications in tables 2 and 4 appear in table A.3. All of them are close to 0.90. The t underlying
the table 3 estimates vary between 0.85 and 0.93 across the 34 industries.
      For NLS and NL2SLS, one typically replaces t with a consistent estimate. We chose tX                                                        3 j+ .
      Allowing the variance to vary additionally across factors and years or introducing factor fixed
effects makes no difference to the estimates. For one, the effect of scaling by                                            % #!    is that factors
have similar variances in each year. For another,                            # $! Z çl \ has a zero mean for each factor.


E. Details of the NL2SLS Estimators

Let     Ñ#/   be the years lost as a result of instrumenting using lagged regressors. We are
interested in ‘within’ estimators. Let w&#                  "!   be any variable and let x            be an operator that transforms
w&# "! by subtracting off its mean across all factors                         and years 1#/           U p . That is,

      The NL2SLS estimator is based on Amemiya (1974). Consider the ‘ 3                                                          #  ! Ý 4 Z ç \ ’ esti-

struments must be simultaneously estimated along with the rest of the model. That is, NL2SLS is
a 1-stage estimator, not a 2-stage one.

Notes: The Herfindahl index is a 1992 index of the cross-country dispersion in the location of output. Smaller
values mean less regional concentration. Capital intensity is 1992 U.S. data on each industry’s capital-labour
ratio. Skill intensity is 1992 U.S. data on the ratio of skilled workers (completed high school) to unskilled
workers (did not complete high school). The capital- and skill-intensity columns are scaled so that electricity
is unity. Average rank is the average of the ranks of capital intensity and skill intensity.
