Insurance Expansions and Children’s Use of Substance Use Disorder Treatment

                                         ABSTRACT

We provide the first evidence on the effects of expansions to private and public insurance
programs on children’s use of specialty substance use disorder (SUD) treatment. We combine
administrative government data over the period 1996 to 2017 with quasi-experimental
differences-in-differences methods to study this question. Expansions of the private market –
laws that compel insurers to cover SUD treatment services as parity with general healthcare –
increase admissions by 21%. Increases in admissions are driven by patients with private coverage
and receiving outpatient care. The number of admissions of patients with no insurance also
increases following parity law adoption. There is mixed evidence on changes in admissions
following a public insurance expansion that increases the income eligibility thresholds for
Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program.

1. Introduction

       Childhood is a key developmental period in establishing health and human capital

trajectories (Heckman 2006). During childhood the prefrontal cortex region of the brain is

developing and many substance use disorders (SUDs) emerge; therefore treatment receipt at this

time period can have lifecourse benefits (Winters, Botzet, and Fahnhorst 2011; Anderson et al.

2010; Clark, Thatcher, and Tapert 2008). Policy and economic ‘shocks’ experienced during

childhood can persistently shape SUDs (Kaestner and Yarnoff 2011; Maclean 2015). Therefore,

identifying factors that influence SUD treatment-seeking among children is important for

understanding lifecourse health trajectories. Key barriers to treatment-seeking are inability to

pay and lack of insurance coverage (Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality 2018).

Expanding insurance coverage may encourage treatment takeup by children and therefore

improve lifecourse health. To date the literature has not explored this important question, which

suggests that the full benefits of insurance policies that expand coverage, both private and public,

may not be recognized.

       According to the American Psychiatric Association (2013), SUDs ‘occur when the

recurrent use of alcohol and/or drugs causes clinically and functionally significant impairment,

such as health problems, disability, and failure to meet major responsibilities at work, school, or

home.’ Diagnosis is based ‘on evidence of impaired control, social impairment, risky use, and

pharmacological criteria.’ 4.3% of U.S. children 12 to 17 and 7.5% of the general population

meets diagnostic criteria for an SUD (Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality 2017).

SUDs impose costs on society including crime, healthcare costs, and reduced labor market

productivity (Terza 2002; Carpenter 2007; Balsa et al. 2009). The estimated annual costs of

substance use in the U.S. are $544B, inflated to 2019 dollars using the Consumer Price Index




                                                 2
(Caulkins, Kasunic, and Lee 2014). Effective SUD treatments are available (Rajkumar and

French 1997; Lu and McGuire 2002; Murphy and Polsky 2016), but only 10% of treatment needs

are met for children (Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality 2018).

        This study is the first to explore the effects of state-level private and public insurance

expansions on specialty SUD treatment utilization among children 12 to 17. A specialty SUD

treatment facility is a hospital, residential facility, outpatient treatment facility, or other facility

with an SUD treatment program. While not the only modality available to children, specialty

care accounts for 37% of all SUD treatment spending in the U.S. (Substance Abuse and Mental

Health Services Administration 2013) and reflects 65% of SUD treatment received by children

(Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality 2016).

        We apply differences-in-differences (DD) style models and exploit plausibly exogenous

variation in insurance coverage generated by two sets of state-level policies. First, passage of

state laws that compel private insurers to cover SUD treatment at ‘parity’ with general healthcare

services allow us to study expansions of the private market. Second, increases in the income

eligibility thresholds for state Medicaid programs and the Children’s Health Insurance Program

(CHIP) offer us the ability to study how increases in public coverage influence SUD treatment

use. While we do not study a public expansion of specialty SUD treatment coverage

specifically, both Medicaid and CHIP cover these services. Thus, raising the income eligibility

threshold increases the number of children eligible for coverage that includes specialty SUD

treatment services. We combine this state policy variation with the Treatment Episode Data Set

(TEDS), an administrative data source maintained by the federal government to monitor

specialty SUD treatment receipt, over the period 1996 to 2017.




                                                    3
       This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 outlines a conceptual framework,

background on private and public insurance programs in the U.S., and related literature. Data,

variables, and methods are listed in Section 3. Results are reported in Section 4. Sensitivity

analyses are discussed in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 concludes.

2. Conceptual framework, background, and literature

2.1 Conceptual framework

       Economic theory suggests that private and public insurance expansions, by reducing the

price of healthcare and/or increasing quality, should increase the amount of healthcare consumed

(Corman and Grossman 1985; Grossman 1972). Parity laws and public insurance expansions

reduce the cost of SUD treatment for covered individuals. For parity laws, in addition to

financial cost reductions, non-quantitative utilization management techniques (e.g., annual

service limitations and prior authorization) are also reduced. Thus, all else equal, the quantity of

services demanded should increase follow a parity law adoption or a public insurance expansion.

       Quality of care plausibly improves following insurance expansions, with variation across

private and public coverage. Gaining access to insurance can allow patients to receive care from

a wider range of providers (Sloan, Mitchell, and Cromwell 1978; McGinty et al. 2015). Newly

accessible providers may be objectively higher quality or, due to heterogeneity in patient-

provider match quality, allow for better matches. The ability to access cost-prohibitive treatment

modalities (e.g., residential vs. non-intensive outpatient) post-expansion may allow more

appropriate matching of patients to treatment, increasing quality. Reductions in non-quantitative

utilization management techniques by parity laws may allow privately covered patients to more

quickly access appropriate care and/or may allow adequate treatment duration, both of which

increase treatment quality (National Institute on Drug Abuse 2018). Through overall improved




                                                 4
alignment of patient need with providers and services, expansions may allow for better acute

care and disease management after initial SUD stabilization, also leading to higher quality care.

       Several factors may mute price and quantity effects. There are well-established capacity

constraints within the SUD treatment delivery system and many providers have limited capital

resources that may prevent them from absorbing increased demand from the individuals who

gain access to services following an expansion (Buck 2011). Insurance acceptance has

historically been low among SUD treatment providers; insurance that cannot be used to pay for

treatment is unlikely to affect quantity consumed. Stigma and/or lack of motivation to stop using

substances may temper increases in quantity consumed. However, we note that public discourse

that occurs with an insurance expansion – in particular a parity law which specifically targets

SUD treatment – may reduce stigma and/or increase awareness of treatment benefits. Insurance

may increase SUDs and need for treatment through income effects, ex ante moral hazard, and/or

increased access to addictive medications. Patients may prefer to receive care in outpatient

settings even when they have access to more costly residential settings (Boone et al. 2004).

       Finally, increases in premiums following a parity law adoption may lead some

beneficiaries to drop private coverage (French, Maclean, and Popovici 2017; Bailey and Blascak

2016; Bailey 2014). Further, if public insurance expansions crowd out private coverage (Cutler

and Gruber 1996), some patients will drop the more costly private insurance and take up the less

costly public insurance which should increase use. While public insurance offers broader SUD

coverage than private coverage (Garfield, Lave, and Donohue 2010), inability to access

providers for the publicly insured (Decker 2012) may mute enhanced quality. Declines in

effective quality attributable to crowd-out should reduce use.




                                                 5
       We estimate the net effect of insurance expansions on children’s use of specialty SUD

treatment in our empirical models. We hypothesize that post-expansion:

       H1: Total admissions will increase.

       H2: Admissions for patients with private and public coverage will increase

       H3: Admissions to more intensive treatment settings will increase.

2.2 Private insurance

       State parity laws that compel private insurers to provide the same level of coverage for

alcohol and drug treatment as they do for general healthcare services provide the variation we

use for identification in our empirical models. Starting in the early 1990s, states gradually began

to introduce such legislation, and the federal government followed suit with the Mental Health

Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA), passed in 2008 and effective in 2010 (with final

regulations established in 2013). This federal Act is a ‘parity-if-offered’ law for private insurers,

however, in combination with Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA) MHPAEA requires parity.

Pre-ACA, insurers were not compelled to offer SUD treatment, but, if offered, services had to be

covered at parity with general healthcare. Post-ACA, most private plans must comply with

MHPAEA, thus the two laws provide full parity. The state-level policies we utilize here are

more varied, and some states have gradually phased in stronger mandates after starting with

weaker ones (Maclean, Popovici, and Stern 2018). We focus our analysis on strong parity

mandates, but later examine potential differences of the parity laws’ effects in states that did and

did not already have (weaker) mandates in place.

2.3 Public insurance

       We leverage variation in income eligibility in two major insurance programs to measure

changes in children’s access to public insurance: Medicaid and CHIP. We take the perspective




                                                  6
of the parent/guardian contemplating enrolling a child in public insurance: the name of the

program is irrelevant, rather the more generous income eligibility level is salient.

       Medicaid, a joint federal-state program introduced in the 1960s, is the primary insurer for

low-income, non-elderly individuals in the U.S. Initially, states had primary control over

eligibility, which was usually tied to cash welfare receipt and covered only acute care services

(Office of the Assistant Secretary for Panning and Evaluation 2005). The scope of public

insurance changed in the 1980s as the federal and state governments expanded Medicaid

eligibility to less-poor populations. These expansions were targeted: federal coverage mandates

applied first only to pregnant women and infants, and later to young children through age five.

In the early 1990s, federal mandates and voluntary state expansions increased Medicaid

eligibility for older children (i.e., six to 18). In 1996, federal welfare reform separated Medicaid

from cash welfare benefits, establishing it as a standalone program. Since then, many states have

increased Medicaid eligibility thresholds further into the income distribution.

       Implemented in 1996, CHIP offers states a complementary policy lever to Medicaid.

States can use CHIP funds to expand coverage for children through Medicaid expansions or

supplemental CHIP programs. CHIP income eligibility thresholds are generally above

thresholds for Medicaid. Further, there is some variation in services covered by CHIP.

       In summary, Medicaid and CHIP form the public insurance landscape for low-income

children. Parents/guardians enroll their child in the program for which they are income eligible.

Over our study period, states have expanded Medicaid programs, developed CHIP programs, and

chosen income eligibility thresholds for both programs. In 2016, 46M children were covered by

one of these programs at some point (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 2017).

2.4 Literature




                                                  7
        This paper builds on two literatures: parity laws effects in private markets and expansions

of public coverage. Our contribution is to study effects on children’s specialty SUD treatment

use, which has not been assessed before.

        Our work contributes to further understanding of private coverage state and federal

mandates for SUD treatment. First, state parity laws increase treatment use and reduce SUDs

among adults. Dave and Mukerjee (2011); Maclean, Popovici, and Stern (2018); Wen et al.

(2013); Wen, Hockenberry, and Cummings (2017); and French, Maclean, and Popovici (2017)

show that passage of a parity law increased adult admissions to specialty SUD treatment by 9.0%

to 12.1%. French, Maclean, and Popovici (2017) also document that passage of a full parity law

reduced adult fatal alcohol poisonings and drug overdoses by 10%. Second, the federal parity

law noted earlier, MHPAEA, increased adult SUD treatment use (McGinty et al. 2015; Busch et

al. 2014; Ettner et al. 2016).

        An important question when investigating state parity law effects is: does private

coverage become more generous after the policy is adopted? To the best of our knowledge, there

are no studies that examine this question. This dearth in the literature is potentially attributable

to the difficulty in obtaining data on the specific details of private insurance plans over time and

across multiple states that adopt, and do not adopt, a parity law. However, a series of recent

studies establishes that, following passage of federal MHPAEA, private insurers increased SUD

treatment service coverage and equalized many, but not all, dimensions of utilization

management techniques between SUD and general healthcare services (Thalmayer et al. 2018;

Friedman, Thalmayer, et al. 2018; Friedman, Azocar, et al. 2018; Thalmayer et al. 2017;

Hodgkin et al. 2018; Horgan et al. 2015). These findings suggest that private coverage becomes

more generous following a parity law adoption.




                                                  8
       A broader set of private and public changes were introduced with the Affordable Care

Act of 2010 (ACA) and have also been examined for their effects on SUD treatment. On the

private side, the ACA dependent coverage mandate increased private coverage access for young

adults who could remain on parental policies through age 26 (vs. 19). Evidence on this provision

is mixed. Golberstein et al. (2015) show that the provision increased SUD-related

hospitalizations, but Saloner and Cook (2014) and Akosa Antwi, Moriya, and Simon (2015) find

no change in self-reported SUD treatment and SUD-related hospitalizations. Finally, Saloner et

al. (2018) document that specialty SUD treatment admissions decreased post-mandate. On the

public side, the ACA expanded adult Medicaid eligibility in states that elected to accept

enhanced federal funding for non-traditional adult populations and covered SUD treatment

services, but did not increase child eligibility. These expansions increased prescriptions for

SUD-related medications and adult admissions to specialty SUD treatment (Wen et al. 2017;

Maclean and Saloner 2019; Meinhofer and Witman 2018; Grooms and Ortega 2019). Wen and

colleagues (Wen, Hockenberry, and Cummings 2017; Wen, Druss, and Cummings 2015) show

that pre-ACA Medicaid income eligibility and SUD service coverage expansions increased SUD

treatment among adults.

       State-specific eligibility expansions have also influenced SUD treatment. The 2006

Massachusetts healthcare reform increased public and private coverage. Analyses of this reform

document that SUD-related hospitalizations and admissions to specialty SUD treatment

increased among adults (Meara et al. 2014; Maclean and Saloner 2018). Baicker et al. (2017)

study the effect of public insurance on SUD treatment using the Oregon Medicaid experiment.

Use of medications to treat opioid use disorder was not different across adults given easier




                                                 9
Medicaid access relative to the control group. No other medications used to treat SUDs were

included in the study.

3. Data, variables, and methods

3.1 TEDS

       We use TEDS, an all-payer administrative database compiled annually by the Substance

Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). TEDS contains the near

universe of specialty SUD treatment facilities that receive financial support from the state or

federal government, are certified by the state to provide SUD treatment, or are tracked for a

state-specific reason. Annually, TEDS includes information on two million specialty SUD

treatment admissions. Data are available from 1992 to 2017.

       TEDS is a standard dataset used within health services research to study SUD

treatment.(Maclean and Saloner 2019; Saloner et al. 2018; Anderson 2010; Grecu, Dave, and

Saffer 2019) The federal government uses TEDS to estimate the national costs of SUD

treatment (Office of National Drug Control Policy 2012). While TEDS is not nationally

representative, patients treated in TEDS-tracked facilities are representative of the SUD

treatment-receiving population (Gfroerer et al. 2014).

       We exclude admissions for patients older than 17 years; age categories in TEDS do not

allow us to include 18 year olds. We exclude detoxification-only services as they are not viewed

as treatment (Center for Substance Abuse Treatment 2006). Although TEDS initiated in 1992,

we begin our study period in 1996, a pivotal point in public insurance programs. In earlier years,

there was no separate public insurance for children 12 to 17. In 1996, Medicaid was delinked

from cash welfare and became a standalone program. Prior to 1996, we cannot sufficiently




                                                 10
disentangle public insurance effects from effects of other public assistance programs, which

prevents clean identification of treatment effects.

       We consider three samples: (i) all admissions, (ii) admissions not referred through the

criminal justice system, and (iii) admissions referred through the criminal justice system. We

suspect that admissions not referred from the criminal justice system are potentially motivated by

factors included in economic models of the demand for healthcare described in the conceptual

framework. In contrast, admissions referred to treatment through the criminal justice system

may be guided by other factors (e.g., judicial discretion in sentencing). Hence, we want to allow

for such heterogeneity in our empirical models. As we note later in the manuscript, not all

treatment modalities we study result in a patient being ‘admitted’ to treatment (e.g., outpatient

care) but we use the term ‘admissions’ for brevity and to align with previous work.

3.2 Private insurance

       We examine the effects of state laws that compel private insurers to cover SUD treatment

at ‘parity’ with general healthcare services. We use legal data from Maclean, Popovici, and

Stern (2018) to construct our parity law variable. We match law effective dates to the TEDS as

of January 1st in each year. During our study 12 states passed parity laws. Maryland was the

first state in the U.S. to do so in 1994. Figure 1 displays the geographic variation in the states

that passed a parity law by 2013. The majority of state laws were adopted in the 2000s and span

all four regions of the country. The ACA, in combination with MHPAEA, required parity for

SUD treatment services as of January 2014. Therefore, we code all states as having full parity

from 2014 to 2017.

       Appendix Table 1 reports the effective date for each parity law and whether states

transitioned from no regulation of SUD treatment to parity or from a weaker law (e.g., mandated




                                                 11
benefits) to full parity. The strength of a parity law potentially varies across states based on the

regulation in place prior to passage of the law. However, given differences in the states that

transitioned from no regulation and a weak law to parity in terms of driving frequency,

healthcare system, and social norms towards substance use and SUD treatment, the extent to

which we expect heterogeneity in the laws’ effects is ex ante unclear.

3.3 Public insurance

        There is no central repository of states’ Medicaid and CHIP income eligibility thresholds.

We use several sources to assemble older children’s thresholds (relative to the Federal Poverty

Level, ‘FPL’) in each state (full details available on request). Figure 2 reports states with

thresholds above 200% FPL (roughly the average our sample period) in four years of our study:

1996, 2002, 2009, and 2017. Appendix Table 2 reports the exact threshold for each state in each

year of our study period. We consider the more generous of a state’s Medicaid or CHIP income

eligibility threshold in a particular year to proxy for children’s public insurance access. We

combine data on each state’s Medicaid and CHIP income thresholds and select the higher value

in January of each year as our measure of the public insurance eligibility threshold.

        For Medicaid and CHIP expansions to influence SUD treatment, these insurance

programs must cover such treatment. The federally-mandated Early and Periodic Screening,

Diagnostic, and Treatment (EPSDT) benefit, implemented in 1967 by Congress, ensures that

Medicaid and Medicaid-CHIP cover medically-necessary SUD treatment. While stand-alone

CHIP programs are not under the mandate, our examination of state-specific coverage as

described in think tank reports and articles indicates that CHIP covers the services we study

(Pernice et al. 2001; Pernice et al. 1999; Kaye, Pernice, and Cullen 2006; Garfield et al. 2012);

full details are available on request.




                                                 12
3.4 Outcomes

         We consider several insurance and specialty SUD treatment outcomes. In particular, we

consider total admissions and admissions by patient’s insurance coverage: private, any public

(Medicaid, Medicare, and other public; recorded as a single category in TEDS), and no

insurance. We also study the effect of policy changes on treatment setting: residential or hospital

(‘residential’), intensive outpatient (i.e., treatment lasting two or more hours per day for three or

more days per week), and non-intensive outpatient (i.e., ambulatory treatment services including

individual, family, and/or group services, and may include pharmacological therapies).

         While states are mandated by federal law to provide admissions data to TEDS,

submission of patient insurance coverage information is voluntary. Thus, there is a non-trivial

amount of missing insurance information. We follow the literature and retain state/year pairs

with no more 25% of the insurance information missing (Maclean and Saloner 2019). Appendix

Table 3 reports the states in our analysis sample and the full TEDS sample. We have 42 states in

our analysis sample.

3.5 Empirical Model

         We estimate a differences-in-differences (DD) style model:

(1)       𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑠𝑠,𝑡𝑡 = 𝛼𝛼0 + 𝛼𝛼1 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑠𝑠,𝑡𝑡 + 𝛼𝛼2 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑠𝑠,𝑡𝑡 + 𝛼𝛼3 𝑋𝑋𝑠𝑠,𝑡𝑡 + 𝑆𝑆𝑠𝑠 + 𝜏𝜏𝑡𝑡 + 𝜀𝜀𝑠𝑠,𝑡𝑡

         𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑠𝑠,𝑡𝑡 is an insurance or SUD treatment outcome among children 12 to 17 years in

state s in year t. 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑠𝑠,𝑡𝑡 is an indicator for a parity law in state s in time t. 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑠𝑠,𝑡𝑡 is the

example, a state with a threshold of 150% FPL is coded as 1.5. 1 𝑆𝑆𝑠𝑠 and 𝜏𝜏𝑡𝑡 are vectors of state

 In an earlier version of this paper, we used a categorical public insurance variable. Based on very helpful
comments from several readers, we have elected to use a linear measure in this version. In particular, readers raised
concerns about the interpretation of the findings. Using the categorical variable suggests that lower income


                                                                     13
and year fixed-effects. 𝜀𝜀𝑠𝑠,𝑡𝑡 is the error term. We use a Poisson model and report marginal

effects with 95% confidence intervals that account for within-state correlations (Bertrand, Duflo,

and Mullainathan 2004), The state population ages 12 to 17 is the exposure variable; we

calculate age-shares from the American Community Survey (Ruggles et al. 2017) and obtain

state population from the U.S. Census (University of Kentucky Center for Poverty Research

2019). The data are unweighted.

4. Results

         Table 1 reports summary statistics for the full sample and samples defined by referral

status: non-criminal justice referred and criminal justice referred. The average number of total

admissions is 1,543 children with 340, 565, and 538 admissions for patients with private

coverage, public coverage, and no coverage. In terms of treatment setting, an average of 285,

218, and 1,030 children are admitted to residential, intensive outpatient, and non-intensive

outpatient treatment per state-year. Total admissions are roughly split between admissions not

referred and referred through the criminal justice system. During our study period, 28% of state-

year pairs have a full parity law in place and the average income threshold for public insurance

eligibility is 2.09 (or 209% of FPL).

         Table 2 reports results from our DD models. Panel A lists results based on the full

sample of admissions while Panels B and C list results based on the sample not referred through

the criminal justice system and referred through this system. For brevity, we focus on Panel A as

results are qualitatively similar across the three samples. We note that the similarity in

coefficient estimates itself is potentially interesting, as we hypothesized that admissions referred




enrollees may be more responsive to public insurance expansions that the estimates reported in this version of the
paper. Full details available on request.

to treatment through the criminal justice system and through other sources may be guided by

different factors, but such differences do not appear to be empirically important in our context.

       Following passage of a parity law total admissions increase by 308, with private

admissions accounting for perhaps one-third of the increase. This implies a 20% and 30%

increase relative to their sample means (all relative effect sizes are calculated in this manner

henceforth) and is in line with our hypothesis of increased admissions post-parity law.

Interestingly, the number of uninsured admissions also increases by 184 (or 34%), possibly

indicating that the premium increase associated with the more generous benefits may lead some

patients to drop coverage (French, Maclean, and Popovici 2017; Bailey and Blascak 2016;

Bailey 2014). The estimated effects of mandates on public insurance admissions are of similar

size but less precisely estimated.

       The response to public coverage expansions appears to be more limited, and may not

even be positive. Estimates are not statistically different from zero, and those for the non-

criminal-justice admissions are particularly close to zero.

       Table 3 reports effects of expansions on admissions by treatment setting. The observed

increases in admissions following parity law adoption appear to be driven by intensive and non-

intensive outpatient treatment, where admissions increase by 136 and 210 (62% and 20%)

respectively. Public insurance adoption effects are not precisely estimated in the overall sample,

but the criminal justice estimates are suggestive of some substitution in care intensity, with

movement away from non-intensive outpatient toward intensive outpatient care.

5. Sensitivity Analysis

       We report a range of different specifications. Our results are broadly stable across the

sensitivity checks that we apply, although we note that we lose precision in some specifications.




                                                 15
First, we exclude all time-varying state-level controls from the regression model (Appendix

Tables 4A to 4B). Second, we exclude the years in which the major Medicaid expansions of the

ACA were in effect (i.e., 2014 to 2017), since this Act transformed the healthcare delivery

system in ways that we may not accurately model (Appendix Tables 5A to 5B). Third, we apply

population weights where the weight is the state population ages 12 to 17 years (Appendix

Tables 6A to 6B). The estimated effects of parity in this weighted model remain similar to the

main estimates, while the estimated effects of public insurance expansion are more precisely

estimated and consistently negative than the main estimates. This apparently perverse effect of

expanded eligibility may reflect movement in the locus of care to primary care or other non-

specialty services (which we cannot explore in TEDS). Fourth, we estimate least squares

regression and convert outcomes to a rate per 100,000 children 12 to 17 years (Appendix Tables

7A to 7B). Failure to handle the count data with a count model seems to dilute the estimated

effects, sometimes to near zero. We exclude the state of Maryland as it had already implemented

parity before the study period and is therefore a ‘treated control’ (Appendix Table 1). Results

are listed in Appendix Tables 8A to 8B.

       Next we explore heterogeneity in treatment effects. We estimate our regressions

separately for states based on their pre-parity legal landscape. In one sample we use treatment

states (those that adopted a parity law) that had no legal protections for SUD treatment pre-law

(Appendix Tables 9A to 9B) and in another sample we use treatment states that had some legal

protection for these services that were less than full parity (Appendix Tables 10A to 10B). States

that do not adopt a parity law are included in both samples. Overall effects are more likely to be

statistically distinguishable from zero using states with a pre-law policy as the treatment group,

perhaps because these states had an SUD treatment delivery system better equipped to absorb




                                                 16
increased demand for services. That said, there are compositional changes across insurance

types even for the states without a pre-law policy; despite little aggregate change in admissions,

private and uninsured admissions both rise, consistent with mandates both improving quality

(leading to more private coverage) and premiums (leading to more uninsured). We include

TEDS years 1992 to 1995 and estimate parity law effects; we do not control for public insurance

as the variable is available only beginning in 1996 (Appendix Tables 11A to 11B).

       We estimate event-study models to explore the extent to which our data can satisfy

parallel trends. For the parity law variable, we estimate an event-study in the spirit of Autor

(2003): we construct leads and lags around the event (Appendix Tables 12A to 12C and 13A to

13C). For the public insurance variable, which is continuous, how best to test parallel trends is

less clear as there is no specific event, rather states increase, and in some cases decrease, income

thresholds. We follow recent work by Bondurant, Lindo, and Swensen (2018) and Swensen

(2015) and include the policy measured the years before (t-1) and after (t+1) the current period

(Appendix Tables 14A to 14B). If we observe that the coefficient estimates on the policy

variable measured in the t-1 period are statistically indistinguishable from zero, this pattern of

results would provide suggestive evidence that our data satisfy parallel trends. While we note

that some lead variables in the parity law event-studies do rise to the level of statistical

significance in the year before policy adoption, these estimates appear to capture anticipation or

ramp-up effects rather than clear differential trends (vs. comparison states) in the pre-period. We

view our event-study results as supportive of the ability of our data to satisfy parallel trends.

       We conduct an additional test of our design. We regress each of the insurance policy

variables on all other covariates included in the regression model, i.e. we test the conditional

independence assumption (Pei, Pischke, and Schwandt 2018). This exercise allows us to test




                                                  17
whether insurance policies are conditionally balanced across treatment and comparison groups;

in the context of the public insurance variable (which is continuous) this test amounts to testing

treatment intensity balance. Our covariates appear balanced (Appendix Table 15). ACA

Medicaid expansion predicts public insurance generosity, but this finding likely reflect a state’s

overall public insurance strategy rather than covariate imbalance.

6. Conclusion

       We provide the first evidence on the effect of U.S. state-level private and public

insurance expansions on children’s specialty SUD treatment use. While the insurance-elasticity

of healthcare is a well-studied object within economics, the importance of expansions for

children’s use of specialty SUD treatment has not been previously examined suggesting that the

full value of these policies has not been established. We leverage variation in coverage

generated by state laws that require private insurers to cover SUD treatment ‘at parity’ with

general healthcare, as well as increases in children’s public insurance eligibility afforded by

Medicaid and CHIP income expansions, over the period 1996 to 2017.

       We find that adoption of a state parity law increases the number of children in treatment

by 21% and this increase is driven by children with private coverage and receiving care in

outpatient settings. However, we also observe that the number of children with no coverage

increases following a parity law adoption, which suggests that price increases attributable to the

newly covered benefits – which are high cost to insurers (Gruber 1994)– lead some children to

lose private coverage and this coverage is not replaced with public coverage. We observe no

evidence that admissions increase as income thresholds for public insurance rise, though there

may be some movement across treatment modalities.




                                                 18
       Many governments are considering how to provide healthcare at reasonable cost.

Understanding how expansions affect service use is important. In the U.S. there have been

recent Congressional attempts to roll back SUD treatment provisions of the ACA, which compel

insurers to cover SUD treatment, and throughout its history CHIP has faced funding uncertainty

(Congressional Budget Office 2017; Kaiser Family Foundation 2018). Our findings can help

policymakers who are investigating these issues.

Notes: Unit of observation is a state-year. Data are unweighted. All models estimated with a Poisson model
(population ages 12 to 17 years as the exposure variable) and control for state characteristics, state fixed effects, and
year fixed effects. Beta coefficients are converted to average marginal effects. 95% confidence that account for
within state clustering are reported in square brackets.

   No parity law

Notes: See text for details. Alaska and Hawaii are suppressed for ease of viewing the figure, but these states did not
adopt a parity law. Note all states, due to the ACA and MHPAEA are considered full parity states over the period
2014 to 2017. We acknowledge that Rhode Island and Vermont appear in our sample. See Appendix Table 3.

Notes: See text for details. Alaska and Hawaii are suppressed for ease of viewing the figure. Alaska had an income
threshold below 200% of FPL in all years 1996 to 1999 and 2004 and 2013. Hawaii had an income threshold below
200% of FPL in all years 1996 to 2000. We acknowledge that not all states appear in our sample. See Appendix

Notes: See text for details on parity law sources. Mandated offer laws require private insurers to offer coverage for
SUD treatment to beneficiaries. This offer of coverage may or may not be at parity with medical/surgical services
benefits and may be declined by the beneficiary. Mandated benefit laws require private insurers to cover a specified
set of SUD treatment services. The set of covered services, which is typically not particularly generous (based on
the authors’ review of legal statutes, details available on request), can be subject to limits on service use and cost-
sharing arrangements that are typically less comprehensive than those offered for medical/surgical services. If no
month is listed, we assign July as the effective month. Some scholars classify Virginia as a parity state between
2000 and 2004,36 however, this state does not appear in our sample. Further, we acknowledge that Rhode Island and
Vermont do not appear in our sample. See Appendix Table 3.

or more years prior to passage of the parity law. The indicator for +5 years includes all state-year observations that
are five or more years after passage of the parity law. All states that do not adopt a parity law are coded as zero for
all event-time indicators. Beta coefficients are converted to average marginal effects. 95% confidence that account
for within state clustering are reported in square brackets.

through the inclusion of the one year lag (i.e., 1996) as public insurance policy information is only available
beginning in 1996. See the text for details. Data are unweighted. All models estimated with a Poisson model
(population ages 12 to 17 years as the exposure variable) and control for a full parity law, state characteristics, state
fixed effects and year fixed effects. Beta coefficients are converted to average marginal effects. 95% confidence
that account for within state clustering are reported in square brackets.

Notes: Unit of observation is a state-year. Sample sizes are smaller than the main sample as we lose one year of data
through the inclusion of the one year lag (i.e., 1996) as public insurance policy information is only available
beginning in 1996. See the text for details. Data are unweighted. All models estimated with a Poisson model
(population ages 12 to 17 years as the exposure variable) and control for a full parity law, state characteristics, state
fixed effects and year fixed effects. Beta coefficients are converted to average marginal effects. 95% confidence
that account for within state clustering are reported in square brackets.
