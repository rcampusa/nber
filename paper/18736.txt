Natural gas has emerged as an increasingly attractive source of energy since it is highly efficient, abundant,
and cleaner than any other fossil fuel. In this paper, we examine the impact of widespread adoption
of natural gas as a source of fuel on infant mortality in Turkey, using variation across provinces and
over time in the intensity of natural gas utilization. Our estimates indicate that the expansion of natural
gas infrastructure has resulted in a significant decrease in the rate of infant mortality. Specifically,
a one-percentage point increase in natural gas intensity - measured by the rate of subscriptions to natural
gas services - would cause the infant mortality rate to decrease by 3.9 percent, which would translate
into approximately 340 infant lives saved in 2011 alone.

I. Introduction

                                                           Concerns over the consequences of global climate change on public health and

communities around the world have raised widespread awareness of an urgent need for

developing technologies and practices that would enable a carbon-free future as well as

sustainable development (Acemoglu et al. 2012). There is little dispute that burning of

coal, which produces far more carbon than any other fuel, is a major contributor to global

climate change and worsening air quality in many parts of the world. Despite this

agreement, consumption of coal continues to rise at a pace that now presents a formidable

threat to some of the gains in health outcomes achieved by the developing world over the

last several decades. Furthermore, efforts aimed at reducing carbon emissions through

environmental regulations have produced little success.                                                                                                                                                                                                     This is in part due to the

reluctance of emerging economies to committing to legal obligations as they face

mounting pressure to sustain their economic development.1 Accordingly, it seems that

any viable solution to the problem of global climate change ought to involve actions that

are not only voluntary, but also in the economic interest of these countries. One such

example is the investments undertaken by countries to diversify their energy portfolios,

and thereby to reduce the vulnerability of their economies to global supply shortages in

any particular fuel. To the extent that these actions would result in less-carbon intensive

energy portfolios, they could reduce air pollution and produce benefits for the

environment and public health.

                                                           In this paper, we consider the health effects of one such action adopted by the

Republic of Turkey, which has begun investing in building a natural gas infrastructure in

  There are also challenges to effective enforcement of regulations due to weak governance and corruption
in many parts of the world (Jayachandran, 2009; Greenstone and Hanna, in press).
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    3	  
	  
	  
1980s by expanding a network of pipelines originating in its neighbors, including Russia

and Iran. This infrastructure, which has enabled 61 of the 81 Turkish provinces to gain

access to natural gas to this date, has led to a widespread replacement of the consumption

of coal by natural gas for residential and commercial space heating and cooking purposes

(see Figure 1 for the number of provinces with access to natural gas over time). As we

discuss below, this has led to significant improvements in air quality in these provinces.

This is not surprising because combustion of natural gas emits virtually no sulfur oxide,

which is a key component of acid rain. Furthermore, emissions of total particulate matter,

carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxide are also at much lower levels from burning of

natural gas compared to coal. Then an important question to consider is whether the

expansion of the natural gas infrastructure has had any impact on infant mortality. To the

best of our knowledge, the current study is the first attempt in the literature to examine

the effect of a nationwide change in a fuel delivery system on infant health. The

knowledge to be gained from this analysis has far-reaching implications as similar

investment processes have been taking place in other parts of the world, including Latin

America, Europe, and Asia2. As the consumption of natural gas continues to rise, any

impact is likely to be felt beyond the borders of investing countries through global air

circulation patterns.

                                                           The current investigation is particularly timely because of the recent spike in the

supply of natural gas, enabled by an extraction technology called hydraulic fracturing or

 A few examples include the recently opened North Stream pipeline from Russia to Germany through the
Baltic Sea, the Mazatlan pipeline project in Mexico, and Myanmar-China and Kazakhstan-China pipeline
projects.

“fracking.”3 The impact of fracking boom on energy markets has been especially

spectacular in the United States, which has seen its natural gas production to rise by 25

percent since 2010 and recently outstripped Russia as the world’s largest gas producer

(Morse, 2014). The proponents argue that fracking is not only an economically sound

practice, but also an environmentally friendly one as it replaces coal-fired power plants

with those using natural gas. Accordingly, they claim that natural gas could serve as a

“bridge fuel” towards the eventual replacement of carbon-based fossil fuels by renewable

energy sources (Podesta and Wirth, 2009; Paltsev et al., 2011). However, there is also a

deep skepticism among many experts and policymakers about the so-called benefits of

fracking for the environment and public health. The skeptics worry about the potential

environmental damages that might be caused by gas extraction through fracking, such as

the release of methane gas to the atmosphere, underground water contamination,

discharge of toxic chemicals during the process, and physical impacts in the form of

increased seismic activity, and argue that the net benefits may be negligible or even

negative as a result (Finkel, 2011; Krupp, 2014; Caulton et al., 2014).4

                                                           This paper also extends the growing literature on air pollution and infant mortality

in developing countries by using a novel source of variation from a country that has not

been studied in this context. Despite growing concerns about the harmful health impacts

of air pollution in developing countries, most of the available evidence on the subject

comes from the United States and a few other developed countries (e.g., Chay and

Greenstone, 2003a, b; Currie and Neidell, 2005; Currie, Neidell, and Schmieder, 2009;

  Fracking involves the process of injecting sand, water, and certain chemicals into shale rocks to crack
them open and release the natural gas trapped inside.	  
4
   There is currently little evidence available on the health impacts of fracking (Mitka, 2012; Mash et al.,
2014). While investigating the health impacts of this practice is an extremely important question, it is
beyond the main focus of our paper.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    5	  
	  
	  
Currie and Walker, 2011; Currie, Greenstone, and Moretti, 2011; Knittel, Miller, and

Sanders, 2011).5 One explanation for the relative paucity of evidence from developing

countries is the fact that policy changes and environmental regulations in the developing

world are rare and weakly enforced, failing to generate enough variation in air pollution

levels to detect statistically significant effects (Arceo-Gomez, Hanna, and Oliva, 2012;

Tanaka, 2012). In the absence of exogenous sources of variation, the associations

obtained in much of the earlier research on air pollution and health may reflect the impact

of omitted factors, such as socio-economic status, that are correlated with both pollution

exposure and health outcomes rather than the impact of air pollution per se. Only recently

have researchers responded to this challenge by turning their attention to identifying

exogenous sources of variation, which could yield estimates of the causal impact of air

pollution on health in developing country settings.6

                                                           In order to account for unobserved heterogeneity, we rely on the fact that the

adoption and the subsequent expansion of the use of natural gas across Turkish provinces

have been gradual. In particular, we exploit the variation in both the timing of the

adoption of natural gas across provinces and the intensity of natural gas consumption as

measured by the number of subscribers to natural gas services per 100 persons. As shown

  There are several explanations offered for the pathways through which prenatal exposure to air pollution
can affect infant health. For example, it has been suggested that exposure to pollutants like carbon
monoxide and particulate matter could lead to impaired fetal tissue growth through oxygen deprivation (Ha
et al., 2001; Dejmek et al., 2000; Maisonet, Correa, and Jaakkola, 2004; Siddiqui et al. 2008; Li et al.,
2003). These impacts can be particularly damaging for infants, whose lungs are not developed and immune
systems are weak. It is also argued that air pollution can harm the infant through adversely affecting the
health of the pregnant mother, for example, by weakening her immune system (Currie, Neidell, and
Schmieder, 2009).
6
  For example, Jayachandran (2009) studies the impact of particulate matter on infant health using variation
in pollutants caused by massive wildfires in Indonesia. Tanaka (2012) uses variation in the regulations on
emissions from power plants to examine the impact of air pollution on infant mortality in China. Arceo-
Gomes, Hanna, and Oliva (2012) exploit the number of thermal inversions as an instrument to investigate
the impact of air pollution on infant mortality in Mexico City. Finally, Greenstone and Hanna (in press)
study the impact of air and water pollution regulations on infant mortality in India.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    6	  
	  
	  
in Figures 1 and 2, both the number of provinces with a natural gas infrastructure and the

intensity of its consumption have grown rapidly in Turkey between 2001 and 2011.

                                                           Our results indicate that a one-percentage point increase in the rate of

subscriptions to natural gas services would result in a 3.9 percent decline in infant

mortality rate, which could translate into approximately 340 infant lives saved in 2011

alone. Our auxiliary analysis using supplemental data on total particulate matter suggests

that the reductions in infant mortality associated with the expansion of natural gas

services are driven by the improvement in air quality.



II. Expansion of Natural Gas Infrastructure in Turkey

                                                           Over the last two decades, the Turkish economy has gone through a major

transformation marked by rapid growth and structural changes, such as privatization of

state enterprises and integration into global economy.7 During the same period, Turkey

has also intensified its efforts to diversify its energy portfolio by investing in building a

network of natural gas pipelines. The country’s close proximity to some of the world’s

major natural gas producers such as Russia, Iran, and Azerbaijan, has especially played

an important role in its decision to raise the share of natural gas in its energy mix.8 These

efforts have led to an expansion of natural gas networks across Turkish provinces,

  Turkey’s recognition as a candidate for European Union membership in December 1999 and the accession
talks that started in 2005 have brought the country’s environmental record under increased scrutiny. This
has led to the Turkish government putting in place a number of legislations and regulations to improve
energy efficiency and address environmental concerns, including flue gas desulfurization requirements on
all newly commissioned coal-fired power plants, new by-laws on air pollution control from heating in
2005, 2007, and 2009, the ratification of the Kyoto protocol, and setting a unilateral target for carbon
emissions introduced by the 2009 National Climate Change Strategy (International Energy Agency, 2009).
Furthermore, the use of leaded gasoline was banned in 2004.
8
  Natural gas is imported from mainly Russia and a few other neighboring countries through pipelines that
are operated by the state owned company, BOTAS. It is then transmitted to individual provinces by private
distribution companies.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    7	  
	  
	  
resulting in a gradual migration from coal to natural gas for space heating and cooking

purposes by dwellings and businesses. First introduced in Ankara in 1988 and followed

by Istanbul and Bursa in 1992, the natural gas infrastructure has spread rapidly across

Turkish provinces since then, especially over the period of 2001-2011 (see Figure 1).

Consequently, this expansion has led to a significant increase in the overall consumption

of natural gas. According to the statistics from the International Energy Agency, the total

consumption of coal and peat in Turkey increased from 11 Million tons of oil equivalent

(Mtoe) to 14 Mtoe between 2000 and 2010, while the total consumption of natural gas

almost tripled from 4.9 Mtoe to 13.1 Mtoe during the same period (International Energy

Agency, 2012). Similarly, the share of natural gas in electricity production increased

from 37 percent in 2000 to about 46 percent in 2010. Concurrently, the share of coal

decreased mildly from 31 percent to 26 percent. In terms of residential use, the demand

for natural gas exhibited an average increase of 28 percent between 1990 and 2009, while

the demand for coal increased only by 3.6 percent (International Energy Agency, 2011).

Moreover, the average annual increase in the industrial use of natural gas has been 10.6

percent compared to only 1.5 percent for coal during that period.

       There are a number of factors that are associated with the timing of the adoption

and the rate of expansion of natural gas across provinces in Turkey. As we discuss below,

these factors are primarily related to economic viability and are unrelated to a particular

plan designed to improve health outcomes, especially once observed characteristics of

and permanent differences across provinces are accounted for. This is reassuring for our

identification strategy, which is explained in detail in Section IV. It is important to keep

in mind that the investments in infrastructure required to expand natural gas networks to

                                             8	  
	  
	  
individual provinces are very costly and often take many years to recoup. Since the

establishment and administration of infrastructure at the province level are controlled by

privately owned firms, the factors associated with economic viability, such as the number

of housing units (or the population size), the climate, the conditions of the geographical

terrain, and the proximity to main natural gas ports operated by the central government

appear to play an important role in the timing of adoption and the rate of expansion (Aras

and Aras, 2005). Therefore, it is not surprising that centrally located provinces with large

populations and relatively cold and long winters, like Istanbul, Ankara, Bursa, and

Eskisehir, are among the early adopters. It is also not surprising that many of the

remaining provinces without a natural gas infrastructure are located in the far eastern and

southern regions of Turkey since these are areas that are both mountainous and distant

from the main ports. Once a province gains access to natural gas, a household’s decision

to migrate to natural gas for the purposes of heating and cooking is determined by the

type of housing unit occupied by the household. For single household residential units,

the decision is voluntary. For residential buildings with multiple housing units – the vast

majority of living arrangements in Turkey – a majority decision among the residents is

required in order to change the system to either individual or central heating with natural

gas.9

  Since our unit of analysis is at the province level, we are unable to distinguish the private and public
health benefits associated with natural gas use. However, the analysis at the province level guards us
against the potential endogeneity of a household’s decision to switch to natural gas. Therefore, our

III. Data and Descriptive Statistics

Data on Natural Gas Intensity in Turkey

                                                           Data on natural gas availability come from the Dogal Gaz Dergisi (the Turkish

Natural Gas Journal).10 The number of provinces with natural gas increased from 5 to 61

between 2001 and 2011 (see Figure 1).11 However, as shown in Figure 2, the rate of

utilization or the intensity of natural gas use has been gradual and is currently far from

complete. Note that there is considerable variation in the rate by which natural gas has

expanded across provinces. To illustrate, we present the rate of intensity of natural gas

expansion for six select provinces, including Istanbul, Izmir, Bursa, Gaziantep, Kocaeli,

and Erzurum in Figure 3. Note that the first four of these provinces are in the top ten with

respect to their populations, while the last two are medium sized provinces. As shown in

the figure, there is considerable variation across provinces both in terms of the timing of

adoption and the growth in the intensity of natural gas.

Time-variant Province Characteristics

                                                           We control for a vector of time-variant determinants of infant mortality in our

empirical models. These variables are measured at the province-year level and include

the number of hospitals and hospital beds per 100,000 persons, the percentage of

population with a high school degree, the percentage with a college degree, the number of

students per teacher in secondary schools, the number of motor vehicles per 1,000

persons, the unemployment rate, the number of physicians per 100,000 persons, an

indicator variable for whether the province has a Family Physician Program, and an

indicator variable for whether the political party affiliation of the elected mayor of the

year of adoption and natural gas intensity in that year.

central district of the associated province is the same as the political party governing

Turkey.12 We also control for income per capita, which is only available at the sub-

regional level.13 Data on province populations are obtained from the Turkish Statistical

Institute (TurkStat) for years 2000 and 2007-2011 and from the Turkish Ministry of

Health between 2001 and 2006.14 Information on the Family Physician Program comes

from the Ministry of Health. The remaining control variables are obtained from the

TurkStat.

                                                           Table 1 shows the means and standard deviations for these characteristics for the

full sample as well as various sub-samples. The table reveals that the provinces with and

without natural gas differ from each other in a number of characteristics. For example,

provinces with natural gas are more likely to have a central district mayor who is

affiliated with the ruling party. This is not surprising in a country where the central

government maintains major control over resource allocation for local investment

projects. Provinces with access to natural gas also have higher number of motor vehicles,

per capita income, hospital beds and physicians, individuals with college education, and a

higher likelihood of having a family physician program initiated in the province by the

government. Again these differences suggest that natural gas penetration is more likely in

provinces that are wealthier, more urban, and with more educated populations.

   We construct dummy variables that equal unity for observations with missing data on the explanatory

   According to the Turkish Statistical Institute, Turkey is classified into 12 regions, 26 sub-regions, and 81
provinces. These regions and sub-regions are made up of clusters of provinces that are grouped together
based on geographical convenience and for statistical purposes. The Turkish Statistical Institute is the
official governmental agency, which gathers and processes data from a variety of different sources on
numerous topics ranging from agriculture to health. See http://www.turkstat.gov.tr for more information.
14
   Since no Census was conducted between years 2001 and 2006, the province populations for the period
2001-2006 are based on extrapolations implemented by the Ministry of Health. Alternatively, we imputed
the population figures between 2001 and 2006 using province-specific growth rates. Using these values
produce results almost identical to those presented in this paper. These results are available from the
authors upon request.

provinces.

Infant Mortality Rate in Turkey

                                                           We obtained annual province-level infant mortality data from the TurkStat and

Turkish Census Bureau for the periods of 2001-2008 and 2009-2011, respectively.15 Our

analysis sample consists of 877 province-year observations between 2001 and 2011.16 As

shown in Table 1, the average infant mortality rate across all provinces and over the

period between 2001 and 2011 is 9.27. However, the average infant mortality rate is

higher among province-year observations with natural gas than those without natural gas.

Similarly, there is a sharp difference in the rate of infant mortality between provinces,

which gained access to natural gas and those, which never did during our analysis period.

Under-reporting in Infant Mortality Rate

                                                           It is widely recognized that official statistics on deaths, especially for infants, are

incomplete in most developing countries due to under-reporting (e.g., Greenstone and

Hanna, 2011; Gruber et al., 2014; Victora and Barros, 2001; Anthopolos and Becker,

2010; Becker et al., 1998; Anderson and Silver, 1986).17 Accordingly, there are usually

   The province level mortality statistics between 2009 and 2011 were not available from the TurkStat at
the time this research was conducted. However, we were able to obtain data for these three years from the
Turkish Census Bureau. The data from the two sources are highly consistent. Moreover, year fixed effects
would largely account for differences in the data collection procedures between the two agencies to the
extent that such differences exist.
16
   Fourteen province-year observations with missing information on infant mortality are dropped from the
analysis.
17
   For example, Gruber et al. (2014) study the effects of a healthcare reform implemented in Thailand on
health care utilization and infant mortality. The infant mortality rates that they obtain from the Thailand
Ministry of Public Health exhibit large differences from those reported in the World Bank Development
Indicator Database. As they report in Table C1, the vital statistics registry estimates are lower than those of
the World Bank by a factor of about 2.5. In a recent paper examining the impact of environmental
regulations on infant mortality in India, Greenstone and Hanna (in press) report that the city-level infant
mortality data that they employ from Vital Statistics are about a third of the rate documented from state
level surveys. In the absence of data on infant mortality from Indonesia, Jayachandran (2009) imputes
deaths from “missing children” in the 2000 Census.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    12	  
	  
	  
vast differences in the infant mortality rates reported by the national statistical offices of

individual countries and those released by international agencies such as the WHO and

United Nations. The statistics compiled by these agencies usually adjust for under-

reporting by combining information from various demographic surveys, census data, and

the official vital statistics registries, and make certain modeling assumptions in order to

reduce the impact of under-reporting (Gruber et al., 2014; Lopez et al., 2001). The under-

reporting in the official statistics is caused by several factors. For example, many deaths,

especially those that occur outside of a hospital, go unrecorded (Gruber et al., 2014;

Tangcharoensathien et al., 2006; Anthopolos and Becker, 2010). Under-reporting is

particularly common for home deliveries and in cases where the newborn dies only a very

short period after birth. In fact, it is not uncommon for midwives to announce deaths as

stillbirth rather than a live birth shortly after death out of respect to a grieving family

(Anthopolos and Becker, 2010). In countries like Turkey, the dead are usually buried

shortly (typically before sundown or within hours) after death in accordance with the

Islamic tradition, which may also exacerbate the under-registering of infant deaths. Note

that the under-reporting is mostly one-sided, i.e., there are far more unreported infant

deaths than unreported live births that survive the first year in life (Anthopolos and

Becker, 2010).

       To illustrate the differences in data on infant mortality in Turkey across various

sources, we present the average annual mortality rates obtained from three different

agencies in Appendix Table 2. The first two columns report the average mortality rates

based on estimates from the WHO and the United Nations. The third column shows the

infant mortality rate obtained from the TurkStat. It is important to note that province level

                                             13	  
	  
	  
data on infant mortality do not exist from the WHO and the United Nations. The

estimates from the WHO and United Nations rely on data from the TurkStat, summary of

birth histories conducted in the Turkish Censuses, and information from various waves of

the Turkish Demographic and Health Surveys (TDHS).18 Therefore, any difference

between these three estimates arises from a combination of the way each organization

incorporates information from these sources as well as their own adjustments for under-

reporting. While the national averages of infant mortality rate from the TurkStat are

lower than those from the two other sources in each year, the trends in the TurkStat and

the other two series are similar and the pairwise correlations are very high. In fact, the

pairwise correlations between TurkStat and the series from the WHO and the United

Nations are both 0.97. Furthermore, the measurement error (or under-reporting) in the

infant mortality rate data obtained from TurkStat is not a problem for our analysis as long

as these data are not correlated with the time of adoption and the rate of penetration of

natural gas by Turkish provinces. Even under a scenario where such correlations are

plausible, the province-specific linear and quadratic trends in addition to province fixed

effects included in our models would likely capture those correlations.

                                                           To illustrate the issue of measurement error more formally, suppose that the true

infant mortality rate is IMRpt*. Then the observed infant mortality rate can be expressed

as

                                                                IMRpt= (1- kpt )IMRpt*

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
18
  	  Among these Turkish data sources, the TurkStat vital statistics are the only source which provides annual
infant mortality rate at the province level. The TDHS are conducted once every 5 years by the Institute of
Population Studies at the Hacettepe University in collaboration with the Turkish Ministry of Health. These
surveys are only representative at the national level, by urban and rural residence. Although the surveys
allow analyses for some of the survey topics for the 12 geographical regions of Turkey, they are
unavailable at the province level. Similarly, the Turkish Censuses are not available on an annual basis, and
it is not possible to derive province level representative infant mortality rates from them either.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    14	  
	  
	  
where IMRpt*=Actual_Deathspt/Live_birthspt; IMRpt=Reported_Deathspt/Live_birthspt;

and kpt= Unreported_Deathspt/Actual_Deathspt. As long as kpt is uncorrelated with the

natural gas intensity, the estimate of the impact of natural gas utilization on infant

mortality would be unbiased. It is difficult to conceive of a plausible scenario wherein

such a correlation should exist. One argument could be that there might be a positive

correlation between the adoption of natural gas and the overall quality in the government

services in health care. A failure to account for such heterogeneity would then cause the

estimate of the impact of natural gas intensity on infant mortality to be biased upward.

However, if the improved quality of care in hospitals results in an increased proportion of

births delivered in hospitals rather than homes, then the extent of under-reporting in the

infant mortality should go down. In essence, under-reporting should be almost zero if all

births are delivered at hospitals. In that case, our estimate would be biased downward.

Note that, in our regressions, we control for the number of hospitals, hospital beds, and

physicians per capita at the province level as well as an indicator for whether the

province has adopted the Family Physician Program. These variables should capture the

quality of health care delivery services to a large extent. Also the provinces that adopt

natural gas are typically more urban and have a higher average income than others.

Therefore, it is plausible to assume that in these provinces, a smaller proportion of births

are delivered at homes as opposed to hospitals relative to the provinces with low-incomes

and greater share of populations living in rural areas. Furthermore, under-reporting tends

to be larger in poor and less urban provinces (Anthopolos and Becker, 2010), but these

are also the provinces that are less likely to have access to a natural gas infrastructure.19 It

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
19
   In fact, the TurkStat vital statistics miss infant deaths from small villages and remote areas due to
reporting errors in death registries. The TurkStat birth statistics, however, cover the entire provinces
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    15	  
	  
	  
can also be argued that the improvements in the quality of health care services may

account for part of the reduction in infant mortality rate. Note that we further guard

against any bias from such omitted factors that may be correlated with both infant

mortality and the adoption and expansion of natural gas services across provinces by

controlling for province fixed effects and province-specific linear and quadratic time

trends in our models. In addition, we include region-by-year fixed effects in our most

comprehensive specification. As discussed below, our estimate of the impact of natural

gas intensity on infant mortality rate remains remarkably robust to controlling for

province-specific trends and region-by-year fixed effects. Similarly, it can also be argued

that natural gas penetration might have led to increased awareness in the public,

especially among pregnant women, of the harmful effects of air pollution. Then this

might have induced them to engage in avoidance behavior, which might have then

reduced their exposure to air pollution. Although any reduction in infant mortality in this

case can still be attributed to the treatment, the mechanisms would be different under this

scenario. In any case, province-specific linear and quadratic trends along with region-by-

year fixed effects would likely control for these unobservable factors.



IV. Identification

                                                           It is useful to highlight the differences between provinces with and without a

natural gas infrastructure before we discuss our identification strategy further. To

illustrate these differences, we report results from several regressions in Tables 2A and

2B. Specifically, each cell in column (1) of Table 2A corresponds to an estimate from a

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
including small village and remote area births. Hence, it is not surprising that the infant mortality rates from
the TurkStat appear to be lower than those from other sources.	  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        16	  
	  
	  
separate regression, where each of the time-varying province characteristic is regressed

on a binary indicator for whether a province has natural gas along with year fixed effects.

Not surprisingly, the estimates in column (1) support the argument made above, i.e.,

those provinces with and without natural gas exhibit differences on a wide range of

characteristics. However, accounting for permanent differences across provinces through

province fixed effects in column (2) mitigates many of these differences both statistically

and in magnitude. When we further add province-specific linear and quadratic trends and

region-by-year fixed effects in the subsequent three columns, we observe that none of the

characteristics considered in this analysis is associated with natural gas adoption at the

province level. We obtain a very similar pattern when we repeat the same analysis using

the natural gas intensity in Table 2B.

       To gain further insights about the differences in observable characteristics

between provinces with and without a natural gas infrastructure, we next run regressions

of the binary indicator of natural gas infrastructure and the rate of natural gas subscribers

on jointly specified time-varying province characteristics. These results are shown in

Tables 3A and 3B. Again, many of the control variables are significantly associated with

the presence of a natural gas infrastructure or the natural gas intensity in column (1),

lending support to the notion that distribution of natural gas networks across provinces is

non-random and thus could reflect some of the observed and unobserved factors that

might also be correlated with infant mortality. However, all of these differences become

statistically insignificant and much smaller in magnitude once we account for province

fixed effects along with province-specific linear and quadratic trends and region-by-year

fixed effects through columns (2) and (5). This is also evidenced from the F-statistics and

                                             17	  
	  
	  
the corresponding p-values reported at the bottom of the table, which underscore the

overall insignificance of all these characteristics once fixed effects and trends are

accounted for. We interpret these findings as strong evidence demonstrating that any

remaining variation in the binary natural gas indicator or natural gas intensity in column

(5) is plausibly exogenous to infant mortality.

                                                           A relevant question to consider is whether there could be other province level

policy changes that might be correlated with our treatment. We could not identify any

such policy that has been rolled out in conjunction with natural gas investments. It is

important to note that the central government has the ultimate authority for passing laws

and implementing policies related to energy and health in Turkey. Consequently, these

policies are either implemented at the national level (e.g., health insurance expansion) or

they start as a pilot program and then become effective nationwide.20 To account for the

possibility of differential investments by the central government at the provincial level,

we control for whether the central district mayor of the province is affiliated with the

governing political party. Additionally, we control for a full set of region-by-year fixed

effects, which should also capture some of these factors.

                                                           Note that our identification strategy does not require the levels in infant mortality

rates between provinces with and without natural gas to be equal prior to the adoption of

natural gas. Rather, it assumes that, in the absence of natural gas adoption, the rates of

   It can also be argued natural gas adoption and intensity may influence migration decisions of households
between provinces without natural gas and those with natural gas. The internal migration decisions are
almost entirely determined by economic factors in Turkey and the flow of migration has been from rural to
urban provinces in recent decades. To the extent that families migrating into provinces with natural gas are
from low socio-economic status, our estimates would be a lower bound. Data on the proportion of migrants
by province are available from the TurkStat only for the period 2008-2011. We estimated models of
migration as a function of natural gas adoption and expansion along with other control variables. The
estimates on the two natural gas variables were both small and imprecisely estimated, suggesting that
migration decisions are unrelated to natural gas. These results are available from the authors upon request.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    18	  
	  
	  
infant mortality could have trended similarly between the two types of provinces.

Although we cannot test this assumption directly, we further assess the credibility of our

research design by examining whether there are any systematic changes in infant

mortality prior to provinces gaining access to natural gas. This can be done using an

event study analysis, which would allow us to trace out the trend in the infant mortality rate

year-by-year for the periods leading up to and following access to a natural gas infrastructure.

In practice, we implement this by estimating a regression of the logarithm of infant

mortality rate on a set of indicators for the years to and from the year of adoption of

natural gas up to five years, along with province and year fixed effects. The estimates

from this analysis, which are shown in Figure 4A, suggest no evidence of systematic

changes in infant mortality in the years prior to gaining access to a natural gas

infrastructure. Therefore, it is unlikely that our results simply reflect continuation of pre-

existing trends. Next, we plot the logarithm of infant mortality rate against the measure of

natural gas intensity net of province and year fixed effects. As shown in Figure 4B, the

relationship between the infant mortality rate and natural gas intensity has the expected

negative sign once province and year fixed effects are accounted for. In addition to

province and year fixed effects, we also allow province-specific unobservables to trend

differently by controlling for province-specific linear and quadratic time trends in our

specifications. Therefore, conditional on the time-variant characteristics, fixed effects,

and provincial time trends, we are assessing whether provinces with a more rapid

penetration of natural gas have also experienced a more rapid decrease in infant mortality

than other provinces. Taken together, Figures 4A and 4B set the stage for our empirical

analysis, which is more formally described below.

V. Empirical Framework

                                                           If the widespread increase in the consumption of natural gas has indeed led to

improvements in infant mortality through reducing air pollution, then we would expect a

negative relationship between natural gas intensity and air pollution. In fact, there is

evidence to suggest that the increase in natural gas consumption has resulted in a

significant reduction in air pollution (Kaygusuz, 2007). Despite such anecdotal evidence,

we further motivate our main analysis by estimating a regression model for the impact of

the intensity of natural gas on a measure of air pollution, controlling for a set of province

characteristics along with province, year, and region-by-year fixed effects. Our air

pollution measure is particulate matter (PM10), which we obtained from the Turkish

Ministry of Health.21 The results from this regression are shown in Appendix Table 3.

The point estimate on the measure of natural gas intensity indicates that a one-percentage

point increase in the natural gas services subscription rate is associated with a statistically

significant 4 percent reduction in the level of particulate matter. This first stage analysis

also sets the stage for why natural gas intensity could actually matter for infant mortality.

                                                           In order to formally investigate the impact of provincial natural gas adoption on

infant mortality, we begin by a reduced form model expressed in the following form:22


	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
21
   Air pollution measure is the averages computed by the provincial meteorology centers. In calculating
annual averages, measurements are taken for a minimum of 21 days for each month for at least nine
months. Note that we have this measure only for the sub-period of 2002-2010 for an unbalanced panel.
However, majority of the missing observations on pollution variables come from the period prior to 2007.
In the end, we have 490 year and province observations on particulate matter. The descriptive statistics in
Table 1 indicate that the average levels of particulate matter are lower in provinces that have accessed to a
natural gas infrastructure at some point during our analysis period.
22
   Note that equation (1) can be rewritten as log(IMRpt*)= Xpt βo + β1Any_Natural_Gaspt + µpt, where µpt=εpt
– log(1-kpt). Therefore, as long as kpt is uncorrelated with the natural gas indicator, the estimate of β1 would
be unbiased.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    20	  
	  
	  
                                                           log(IMRpt) = Xpt βo + β1Any_Natural_Gaspt + εpt,                                                                                                                                                  (1)



where IMRpt represents the infant mortality rate reported for province p and in year t.23

Xpt is a set of exogenous determinants of infant mortality described above. The variable,

Any_Natural_Gaspt, is a binary indicator for whether the province p has natural gas in

year t. The εpt is the error term. Equation (1) estimates the effect of a binary treatment,

which is also the most frequently employed approach in the relevant literature. The

coefficient β1 would measure any permanent shift in infant mortality rate associated with

the adoption of natural gas, independent of the intensity of natural gas utilization in a

province. It is important to note that once a province adopts natural gas, the process by

which its intensity increases within the province is dynamic, i.e. it evolves gradually over

time. However, a specification with a binary natural gas indicator would fail to

appropriately capture the dynamic nature of this diffusion process over time, leading to a

biased estimate of the actual treatment.24 This issue may be particularly important in this

case, where the intensity of treatment exposure changes considerably across provinces

and over time. Furthermore, policymakers may be interested in the effects of different

levels of natural gas intensity, which cannot be discovered by using a binary treatment

model. To resolve this issue, we pursue a specification that explicitly models the dynamic

   It is common to use the log of infant mortality rate as opposed to the level in similar contexts (e.g.,
Murtin, in press; Ruhm, 2000; Tanaka, 2005; Farahani et al., 2009; Anand and Baernighausen, 2004; Flegg,
1982; Jamison et al., 2004). Those provinces in the treatment category that already have low rates of infant
mortality may experience only small improvements in their infant mortality rate in response to the adoption
of natural gas. This may be in contrast to provinces with high levels of infant mortality rate, which may
experience large swings in infant mortality. However, we also estimate our models using the level of infant
mortality rate as the outcome and the results from these models are similar to those presented here and are
available from the authors upon request.
24
   As an example, consider the extreme case where every province has a natural gas infrastructure in place,
but nobody utilizes it as a source of fuel. Since our treatment indicator is defined at the province level, a
binary treatment model may fail to reveal the effect of actual utilization in this case, which should be zero.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    21	  
	  
	  
nature of the treatment. In this specification we replace the binary indicator of any

natural gas in equation (1) with a continuous measure:



       log(IMRpt) = Xpt βo + β1Natural_Gas_Intensitypt + εpt,   (2)



where Natural_Gas_Intensitypt represents the measure of natural gas intensity defined as

the number of natural gas service subscribers per 100 persons in province p and in year t.

The number of subscribers is the total number of household and business units with

access to natural gas. The coefficient β1 would then represent the impact of the rate of

natural gas intensity on infant mortality rate. However, the causal interpretation of the

coefficient β1 is complicated due to omitted variables that are likely to be correlated with

both the availability of natural gas infrastructure and infant mortality. For example, as

shown in Table 1, provinces with natural gas infrastructure are more likely to be urban,

industrial, and with more motor vehicles per capita. Therefore, these provinces may also

have higher levels of infant mortality despite gaining access to a natural gas

infrastructure. In order to control for the impact of these factors, we rely on the

longitudinal nature of our data and incorporate a series of fixed effects into equation (2):



       log(IMRpt) = Xpt β0 + β1Natural_Gas_Intensitypt + ωp + λt + τpt + τ2pt + εpt,   (3)



where ωp is a set of province fixed effects that would capture any permanent differences

across provinces and λt is set of year fixed effects that would account for any unobserved

factors common to all provinces. It is important to note that if Natural Gas Intensity

                                               22	  
	  
	  
properly captures the dynamic nature of the treatment, then the estimate of β1 should not

be sensitive to controlling for province-specific trends as there would be little variation

left for these trends to capture or any remaining variation would be uncorrelated with the

intensity measure. Despite our prediction, we estimate specifications that control for

province-specific linear and quadratic time trends as denoted by τpt and τ2pt in equation

(3). Finally, we further enrich the specification in equation (3) by controlling for region-

by-year fixed effects that would account for any spillovers to neighboring provinces as

well as any time-variant differences in unobserved heterogeneity that are common to

provinces within a region.25



VI. Results

                                                           We begin by presenting the estimates of the impact of Any Natural Gas on the

logarithm of infant mortality rate in Table 4A. Column (1) presents the estimate for the

binary indicator of any natural gas adoption on infant mortality without any control

variables. Column (2) adds year fixed effects and column (3) incorporates both year and

province fixed effects that control for permanent differences across provinces. In columns

(4) and (5), we add province-specific linear and quadratic time trends, respectively, and

   The heavier economic activity in certain regions like Marmara, which includes major urban and
industrial hubs like Istanbul, Bursa, and Kocaeli, may have spillover effects on all the other provinces
within that region. For example, Bursa and Istanbul are connected to each other through highly congested
routes that have to pass through Yalova, a smaller and less urban province within the same region.
Therefore, any air pollution, for example caused by the traffic congestion between Bursa and Istanbul, may
also contaminate the air in Yalova. Controlling for region-by-year fixed effects would mitigate concerns
about the aggregate impact of these factors. As mentioned previously, the capital expenditures for natural
gas network expansions are provided by the central government. Due to economies of scale, provinces
within a particular region may gain access to a natural gas infrastructure as a cluster or soon after each
other, though we do not see such a pattern in Appendix Table 1. It is also possible that households in
regions experiencing rapid economic growth may collectively advocate for increased natural gas
availability in their regions. Therefore, in addition to accounting for regional income shocks, controlling for
region specific time dummies would also account for factors such as the availability and expansions of
natural gas networks at the regional level.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    23	  
	  
	  
in column (6) we control for time-varying province characteristics. Finally, in column (7)

we show estimates from a specification that also accounts for region-by-year fixed

effects. Standard errors are robust to any form of heteroscedasticity and clustered at the

province level to allow for correlation within a province (Bertrand et al., 2004).

       The estimates in the first two columns of Table 4A are positive, suggesting that

natural gas infrastructure is positively correlated with infant mortality. This is consistent

with the earlier evidence that we presented, and suggests that provinces with and without

natural gas infrastructure differ in ways that are correlated with infant mortality. For

example, provinces with natural gas are more likely to be urban and industrial than

others. Since urbanization and industrialization are likely to be positively correlated with

infant mortality, failing to control for these differences would cause the estimate on any

natural gas indicator to be biased downward, and like in our case, to possibly to switch

sign. As expected, accounting for permanent province characteristics in column (3)

makes a dramatic impact on the estimate of the effect of any natural gas and causes its

sign to switch to negative. Specifically, once we control for province fixed effects, having

access to a natural gas infrastructure is associated with a 27.1 percent decrease in the

infant mortality rate. However, as we explained in the previous section, it is unlikely that

this estimate actually draws an accurate picture of a treatment whose dosage increases

gradually. In fact, it becomes small in size and statistically insignificant when we add

province-specific linear and quadratic time trends in columns (4) and (5). At first glance,

the finding that the estimate on the binary natural gas indicator is sensitive to the

inclusion of province-specific trends appears to be at odds with the notion that the timing

of the adoption of natural gas is exogenous.          However, the dynamic nature of the

                                             24	  
	  
	  
treatment (i.e., gradual increase in the intensity of natural gas use) is unlikely to be

accounted for by a binary treatment model.26 Therefore, province-specific trends are

likely to capture not only the differences in pre-existing trends across provinces, but also

the differences in the diffusion of the natural gas intensity subsequent to the adoption of

natural gas.27 As a result, the coefficient on the any natural gas indicator in this

specification is likely to be a biased estimate of its counterfactual.

                                                           This takes us to our preferred specification, which replaces the binary indicator of

any natural gas with the continuous natural gas intensity measure. The results from the

dynamic response model are presented in Table 4B.28 Similar to the results presented in

Table 4A, the estimate on the natural gas intensity variable is still positive and

statistically significant in columns (1) and (2). However, once province fixed effects are

controlled for in column (3), the estimate switches sign and becomes negative in line with

our predictions. In the following two columns, we present estimates from specifications,

which successively add province-specific linear and quadratic trends. Consistent with our

predictions earlier, allowing for differential trends in the infant mortality rate across

provinces does not cause any appreciable change to the estimate on the impact of natural

gas intensity. According to the point estimate in column (5), a one-percentage point

increase in the natural gas intensity would lower the infant mortality rate by 4.1 percent.

                                                           If our identification strategy is credible, then the province fixed effects and trends

should capture all of the time-variant and -invariant factors correlated with both natural

   We also estimated weighted regressions using the mean population density and birth density as weights.
These estimations, shown in Appendix Table 4, did not cause any appreciable changes to the results
presented here.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    25	  
	  
	  
gas intensity and infant mortality. Therefore, as indicated by Tables 2A through 3B,

adding time-variant characteristics of provinces should not cause any appreciable changes

to our estimates. As shown in column (6), this is indeed the case in our analysis. In

particular, controlling for a comprehensive set of time-varying differences across

provinces does not change the estimate on the impact of natural gas intensity on infant

mortality. In essence, once permanent differences across provinces are accounted for, the

natural gas intensity can be considered as a natural experiment. Finally, in column (7) we

present the results from a specification that also controls for region-by-year fixed effects

along with all the other variables included in the previous columns. Controlling for

region-by-year fixed effects is likely to help mitigate the impact of positive spillovers on

air quality enjoyed by provinces without natural gas that are bordered to provinces in the

treatment group as well as to account for any differences in governmental policies

implemented at the regional level, such as healthcare interventions and university

research hospitals that typically serve entire regions. As it turns out, controlling for

region-by-year fixed effects leaves the estimated coefficient on natural gas intensity

unaffected. In particular, the coefficient estimate presented in column (7) indicates that

the effect of natural gas intensity on the rate of infant mortality is 3.9 percent.

        Next we conduct some back of the envelope calculations to put these estimates

into context. For instance, as shown in Table 1, the average natural gas intensity is 7.9 per

100 persons in province-year observations with a natural gas infrastructure. In 2011, there

were 8,714 infant deaths for 1,087,933 births in the provinces with a natural gas

infrastructure, resulting in an infant mortality rate of about 8 per 1,000 births. Holding the

number of births constant, this would suggest that there could be approximately 340

                                              26	  
	  
	  
fewer infant deaths in these provinces in 2011 in response to a one-percentage point

increase in the natural gas intensity.

Robustness and Sensitivity Analyses

       The results presented above could be driven by both a decrease in the numerator

(number of children who die in their first year) and an increase in the denominator (the

number of live births). For example, the infant mortality rate could go down due to an

increase in the denominator if the natural gas adoption is associated with an increase in

the overall quality of health care services. As explained previously, this is unlikely since

we control for the number of hospitals and hospital beds per capita along with the number

of physicians per capita and an indicator for whether the province implements a family

physician program. Furthermore, province level linear and quadratic trends should also

help gauge these effects. Another possibility is that the improvements in air quality might

lead to a reduction in the number of stillbirths and miscarriages, which would then result

in an increase in the number of live births. We test this hypothesis by estimating our

models with the logarithm of infant deaths as the dependent variable and the logarithm of

births as an additional control variable (Arceo-Gomez, Hanna, and Oliva, 2012). As

presented in Panel A of Table 5, performing this test yields estimates that are largely

consistent with those in Table 4B when province fixed effects, province-specific linear

and quadratic time trends and region-by-year fixed-effects are specified. Therefore, it is

unlikely that our results are driven by an increase in births. Next, we estimate models

using the logarithm of births as the outcome. As shown in Panel B of Table 5, the

estimates in specifications from columns (3) to (7) are all zero, suggesting that natural

gas adoption does not have an effect on the number of babies born.

                                            27	  
	  
	  
                                                           Note that we use data from all 81 Turkish provinces in our analysis. Among these

provinces, 20 of them have never gained access to a natural gas infrastructure during the

period of our analysis. To test for the possibility that there is something fundamentally

different about these provinces that might be affecting our results, we estimate our

models excluding these provinces from the analysis. Results from the estimation of these

models are presented in Panel A of Table 6. The pattern obtained here is

indistinguishable from the one in Table 4B. Specifically, the estimate in our richest

specification shown in column (7) is -0.041, which is nearly identical to the one in Table

4B.

                                                           Next we assess whether our results are driven by provinces, which have always

had natural gas during the period of our analysis. In the first test, we estimate our models

by excluding Istanbul, which, with its 13.5 million citizens, accounts for over 18 percent

of Turkey’s total population.29 As shown in Panel B of Table 6, the results again remain

almost identical to those in Table 4B when we perform this exercise. In Panel C, we

repeat the same test by excluding, Ankara, Bursa, Eskisehir, Istanbul and Kocaeli, which

are the provinces that have always had access to natural gas during our analysis period.

Again, excluding these provinces from our analysis does not affect the estimate on the

natural gas intensity. Taken together, results presented in Table 6 suggest that the main

   Istanbul is also one of the largest urban and busiest agglomerations in the world and responsible for over
a quarter of Turkey’s GDP. Concurrent with the expansion of natural gas infrastructure, Istanbul has
experienced a rapid transformation in a multitude of dimensions during the period of our analysis. For
example, it experienced a surge in the number of private hospitals, which doubled in numbers between
2000 and 2005. Although we control for a number of variables related to the capacity and quality of health
delivery services in our models, it can still be argued that there remain other related factors that might have
coincided with the expansion of natural gas services. One particular candidate is the mass-transit
underground railway network, which entered service in 2000 and has caused a major relief in traffic
congestion. Then the question is whether and to what extent the control variables and various fixed effects
in our models account for these developments in a potential outlier like Istanbul.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    28	  
	  
	  
finding obtained in Table 4B is not driven by any systematic differences between

provinces with and without natural gas.

        The specifications we discuss above assume that the natural gas intensity is

linearly related to the infant mortality rate. However, this does not have to be the case if,

for example, reductions in air pollution are more beneficial at higher levels of air

pollution than lower levels of pollution. Then any gains in infant mortality associated

with the intensity of natural gas use may be higher at the early stages of adoption to

natural gas than later stages. To assess the possibility of a non-linear relationship between

natural gas intensity and infant mortality rate, we estimate our main specification with

both linear and quadratic measures of natural gas intensity. This exercise does not change

any of the implications of the previously discussed results. Specifically, the estimates on

the linear and quadratic terms for natural gas intensity in the most comprehensive

specification (column 7) are -0.061 and 0.001, respectively, where only the former is

statistically significant at the 10 percent level. Given that the quadratic term is zero in

both economical and statistical terms, the causal relationship between natural gas

intensity and infant mortality rate is likely to be a linear one.

        Note that our intensity of natural gas variable is defined as the number of

subscribers to natural gas services per 100 persons. It may be argued that it would be

more informative to produce estimates based on a measure of natural gas intensity using

the number of households in a given province and year. Unfortunately, the TurkStat

sources provide information on the province level household figures only for 2000 and

2011. Nevertheless, we generated proxy figures for the province level household numbers

for each of the 81 province for all other years assuming that the rate of growth for the

                                               29	  
	  
	  
number of household is linear over time. Using these proxy figures, we then constructed a

measure of natural gas intensity per 100 households and estimated our main specification

with this new measure. Results from this exercise do not change any of the implications

presented above. More specifically, the estimate on the proxy measure of subscribers per

100 households is -0.011 (p=0.05), suggesting that a one-percent increase in the natural

gas intensity per 100 households would lead to a 1.1 percent decrease in infant mortality

rate. If there are approximately 3 to 4 persons per household, then the effect size of 1.1,

which is roughly a quarter of the magnitude of our main estimate, is sensible.

       A closer look over Figures 1 and 2 reveals that province level natural gas

subscriptions rate exhibited a tenfold increase among the provinces with natural gas

between 2001 and 2011, and these increases mainly took place after 2005. Accordingly,

if we take 2001 as the reference year, the effect of natural gas intensity on the rate of

infant mortality should be relatively greater towards the end of the analysis period (e.g.,

2011) in comparison to a time when provinces had just started to adopt natural gas (i.e.,

2005). To explore whether this is the case, we re-estimate our models by using two data

points as the initial and end dates for each province for the periods 2001-05, 2001-07,

2001-09, and 2001-11, respectively. This implementation is similar to the long-difference

estimate used in several other studies (e.g., Acemoglu and Johnson, 2007) and would

allow us to further test whether our results are driven by the systematic differences

between provinces with and without natural gas. Specifically, if the long-difference

estimates between 2001 and the middle of the analysis period (i.e., 2005 or 2007) are

similar to the long-difference estimates between 2001 and the end of the analysis period

(i.e., 2009 or 2011), then it is possible that our results reflect a combination of factors that

                                              30	  
	  
	  
make the two types of provinces different from each other in ways correlated with infant

mortality. In line with our prediction, the estimates on natural gas intensity are small (-

0.004 and -0.013) and neither are significant when we consider 2005 or 2007 as the end

points of the analysis. However, the estimate becomes larger and significant as we

approach towards the end of our analysis period. For example, if we consider 2009 and

2011 as our end points, the long-difference estimates on natural gas intensity are -0.044

and -0.049.



VII. Discussion and Conclusions

       Industrialization and economic development have brought with it dramatic

improvements in living conditions of vast populations in developing countries through

higher incomes and better health care. However, these benefits have come at the

substantial cost of deterioration in environmental conditions and air quality, which

threatens some of the gains achieved by these countries. Furthermore, there are very few

viable policy options or enforcement mechanisms available to developed countries or

international environmental organizations that could induce developing countries to take

meaningful steps toward addressing environmental problems. One policy instrument

commonly used to control air pollution is regulations. However, there are serious

challenges to implementing regulations successfully, especially in developing countries,

due to weak governance and corruption problems. Furthermore, concerns over global

climate change are often sidelined in these countries due to a strong desire to maintain

robust economic growth. Under these circumstances, natural gas has emerged as an

increasingly attractive source of fuel and one that could help efforts to limit carbon

                                            31	  
	  
	  
emissions globally without causing interruptions in the mounting energy needs of these

countries in the short run.

        In this paper, we consider the impact of widespread expansion of natural gas

services for residential and commercial use on the rate of infant mortality in Turkey. To

identify this impact, we utilize the variation in the timing of deployment and intensity of

expansion of natural gas infrastructures across Turkish provinces between 2001 and

2011. Our results indicate that the expansion of natural gas services has led to a

significant reduction in the rate of infant mortality. The estimate from our most

comprehensive specification indicates that a one-percentage point increase in the rate of

subscriptions to natural gas services would cause the infant mortality rate to decrease by

3.9 percent.

        The estimates from the first stage, i.e., the impact of natural gas intensity on

particulate matter, and the reduced form, i.e., the impact of natural gas intensity on the

rate of infant mortality, can be combined together to produce an instrumental variables

estimate of the structural relationship between air pollution and infant mortality. In

particular,    ∂log(IMR)/∂PM10    can   be     rewritten   as   [∂log(IMR)/∂(Natural   Gas

Intensity)]/[∂PM10/∂(Natural Gas Intensity)]. As shown in Tables 4B and Appendix

Table 3, both the numerator and the denominator on the right-hand-side of this expression

are close to -0.04 suggesting that the elasticity estimate for the IMR with respect to PM10

is close to unity. It is important to note that the validity of the instrumental variables

estimate hinges on the assumption that the expansion of natural gas networks can only

affect infant mortality through its effect on air pollution once time-varying province

characteristics and fixed effects are controlled for. This assumption would be violated if

                                             32	  
	  
	  
other factors exist, such as energy prices or other unmeasured air pollutants that might be

influenced by natural gas expansion. To the extent that these factors are not accounted

for by our controls, the IV estimate would be biased. Therefore, the IV estimate should be

viewed only as suggestive and caution must be exercised in its interpretation. Keeping

this limitation in mind, we next compare our elasticity estimate to those obtained in

several previous studies. For example, our estimate is particularly consistent with that of

Tanaka (2012), who reports an elasticity of 0.95 for particulate matter in a study of the

impact of air pollution on infant mortality in China. Focusing on the estimates derived

from the United State context, the elasticity estimates for particulate matter documented

by Chay and Greenstone (2003a), Currie, Neidell, and Schmieder (2009), and Currie and

Neidell (2005) are 0.285, -0.008, and 0.001, respectively.30 In a recent study focusing on

Mexico, Arceo-Gomez, Hanna, and Oliva (2012) find an elasticity of 0.42 for particulate

matter, which is smaller than our estimate, but larger than those generally reported for the

United States. To the extent that our estimate is larger than those reported by studies

using data from the United States and consistent with those obtained for China, and to

some extent, Mexico, the number of lives of infants saved due to improved air quality is

likely to be higher in the developing countries than it is in the developed countries.31

                                                           The results in this paper are especially useful in light of the ongoing public and

political debate about the future of fracking revolution that has recently started in the

United States and is now spreading elsewhere. Advocates argue that there may be real

environmental benefits to fracking because natural gas replaces dirty coal. As suggested

by our findings, the health benefits of widespread replacement of coal by natural gas can
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
30
  These figures are obtained from Table 8 in Arceo-Gomes, Hanna, and Oliva (2012).
31
  One exception is Knittel, Miller, and Sanders (2011), who find an effect corresponding to an elasticity of
1.88 in a study of the impact of air pollution on infant mortality in California.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    33	  
	  
	  
indeed be nontrivial. However, fracking has also its sharp critiques, who worry about the

potential negative impacts of this practice on the environment. Until the environmental

consequences of fracking are fully assessed, the net effect of this practice on health will

remain ambiguous.
