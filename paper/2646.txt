                  CONVENTIONAL FIXED-RATE MORTGAGE YIELDS


                                 ABSTRACT



      Between the early l980s and 1986, the share of new conforming (under

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgage pools increased from under 5 percent
over 50 percent. The impact of these agencies movi.ng from negligible

participants to dominant players in this market is investigated
by an analysis of yields on 4,900 loans closed in California during May-June
1978 and 1,800 closed inMay—June 1986.

      Our analysis indicates that the loan rate depends on the loan-to-value
                                            the loan is far above, just above,
ratio, the loan size, and, in 1986, whether
or below the conforming loan limit. Rates on loans far above the conforming
loan limit exceed those on otherwise comparable loans below the limit by 30
basis points and those on loans destined to exceed the limit within a year by
15 basis points. That is, the expanded agency securitization of conforming
FRMs has significantly lowered the rates on both conforming loans and loans
somewhat above the conforming limit (27 percent of nonconforming loans in
1986) relative to what they would otherwise have been.

      The effects of a 30 basis point lower FRM rate are many: households are
more likely to choose FRMs than ARMs, to decide to own rather than rent, and
to own larger houses. Moreover, traditional mortgage portfolio lenders will
                                                                             A
have fewer ARMs to purchase and will earn lower returns on FRM investments.

these effects

     The Impact of the Agencies on Conventional Fixed—Rate Mortgage Yields


                   Patric H. Hendershott and ,James D. Shilling


        Tha fedaral agencies' role in the conventional fixed-rate mortgage market

has expanded sherply in the 1980s.    FNMA purchased some conventional mortgages

in the 1970s, but at the end of the decade its portfolio of conventional

single—family mortgages was still under $20 billion.       Also, while FHLMC's

pass-through program existed in the 1970s, the outstanding level of its pass—

throughswas also still under $20 billion at the end of the decade.          In

contrast, FNMA initiated its pass-through program in 1g82 and issues for both

of the agencies exploded, rising to nearly $150 billion per            in   1986—87.

        The best measure of the agencies' expanded role is the increase in the

percentage of "new" conventional fixed-rate loans (generally defined as less

than one year since origination) eligible for secoritization that are, in fact,

securitized by FHLMC and FNMA.    Column 8 in Table   1   shows that the percentage

of new conventional FRMs secoritized by these agencies has increased from 3 to

40 percent in the l98Ds.    Moreover, about a quarter of FRMs, the so-called

jumbo loans, cannot be secoritized by the agencies becaose the size of these

loans exceeds the conforming loan limit.    Dividing column 8 by 0.75, the share

of new conforming FRNs securitized in recent years is thus seen (column          9)   to

be in excess of 50 percent.    That is, in five years the agencies have gone from

a negligible participant to the dominant player in the market for conforming

FRMs.

        The principal hypothesis tested in this paper is that the recent

dominance of the conforming FRN market by the agencies has reduced new issoe

yields on conforming loans relative to those on jumbo loans.        The test consists

of an analysis and comparison of yields on samples of conventional FRMs closed
                                         —2—




in California in May—June of 1978 (4,750)      loana)   and 1986 (1,875 loans),

periods before and after the agency dominance.          Concentrating on one state

allows os to ignore many regional effects, such as variations in state

foreclosure laws, on yields.      Moreover, California accounts for a substantial

frsction of the dollar volume of all FRMs closed, 27 percent in 1986, and of

jumbo FRMs closed, 53 percent in 1986.

     We begin with a discussion of the data examined, report some empirical

estimates, and close by summarizing the results and drawing some implications

of the results.   We find that the increased securitization of the conventional

fixed—rate market has lowered yields on conforming loans by about 30 basis

points relative to those on large jumbo loans and yields on small jumbos (soon

to be conforming) by about 15 basis points.


                             I.    The Closed Loan Data

      Each month since 1963, the FMLBB has conducted a survey of conventional

loans closed (loans "approved", prior to 1973) during the first five days of

the month.   The loans are on single—family non—farm residential properties,

both newly built and previously occupied.      The loans are permanent, fully

amortizing, first mortgages on properties transferred.         Thus refinancings,

second mortgages, and interim financing are excluded, although a small number

of combination constructiun-purchaae loans are included.          The loans are those

made by all major lenders (originators)        savings and loans, mutual aavings

banks, commercial banks, and mortgage bankers.          The loans have both fixed and

adjustable rates.

     The survey provides the contract interest rate, initial fees and charges,

the term to maturity, the mortgage loan amount, and the purchase price of the

property.    The effective interest rate is officially calculated in the survey

as the contract rate plus the initial fees and charges amortized over ten
                                        —3—




years; the loan—to-value ratio is the loan amount divided by purchase price.

Since 1986, the base note rate (contract rate less temporary buydowns or

discounts) for all loans and the interest rate adjustment-period and life-of—

loan rate caps for ARMs have been reported.

       The interest rate survey data are easily subdivided into conforming and

jumbo loan categories.    The maximum loan size eligible for agency purchase

programs was set directly by statute from 1970 through 1980.      Since 1980, the

ceiling has been adjusted annually according to a formula incorporated in 1980

legislation.   The adjustment formula increases the limit at the beginning of

each year by the percentage change in the average purchase price for homes

financed by conventional mortgages as reported by the FHLBB during the 12—month

period ending with the previous October.      Figure 1 illustrates how the maximum

loan size limit (and that for ERA loans in high cost areas) has increased over

time

       To minimize the effect of regional factors, particularly differences in

expected default losses, we decided to choose a single state for our analysis.

Given our need to include numerous jumbo loans, California was the obvious

choice.   To test the hypothesis that the relation between yields on conforming

and jumbo loans has been changed by the expanded role of the agencies in the

1980s, we chose two dates for analysis:    1978, before the agencies expanded

their activities, and 1986, by which time the agencies seemed to dominate the

conforming market.   Data for May, June and July, peak loan closing months, were

analyzed for each year.   The volumes of loans closed in these years was larger,

many times larger in some cases, than the volume in the intervening years.

       The basic loan sample was reduced in five ways.     First, adjustable rate

loans were deleted; our hypothesis relates to FRMs only (the agencies

aecuritized less than 5 percent of new ARM originations in 1986).      Second,

loans by mortgage and commercial bankers were deleted.      Because only a handful
                                         —4—



of loans originated by mortgage bankers were included in the 1986 california

sample, they had to be deleted from both dates to keep the data comparable.

commercial banks originated such a small percentage of the loans in both years

that we decided to exclude these originations also.     Because no mutual savings

banks exist (or were sampled) in california, savings and loans are the only

originators for our sample.     Third, combination construction—purchase loans

were excluded.   These were only one percent of the sample, and the contract

rate here could easily be mismeasured.     Fourth, loans with loan—to—value ratios

under 70 percent were excluded to make sure that no second mortgages or

mortgages with significant seller—financing buy downs built into the price )and

thus the loan—to—value ratio) were included.     Fifth, loans with less than 25

years term-to—maturity were excluded for similar reasons.     Sixth, the 28 loans

in 1986 that had a base rate below the coupon rate were deleted.

      The distributions of the 1978 and 1986 data samples, broken down by

loan-to—value ratio and loan size )as a percentage of the conforming loan

limit), are given in Tables 2 and 3.     Over seventy percent of the loans in our

sample had 70 to 80 percent loan—to—value ratios )over ninety—five percent of

the 80 to 84.9 percent loans are 80 percent loans) , and about a fifth of all

loans were jumbos.    In 1978, all the jumbos had loan-to—value ratios under 85

percent; in 1986, jumbos constituted over a tenth of loans with loan—to—value

ratios above 85 percent.     In 1978, fifty—nine percent of the loans were less

than 80 percent of the conforming limit and twenty—eight percent were between

80 and 115 percent.   By 1986, these percentages had shifted to forty—seven and

thirty—nine, respectively.

      One additional point about the data:     they are extremely "noisy."   More

specifically, the effective FRM rate at a given point in time for loans at or

under the conforming loan limit with similar loan—to—value ratios varies by as

much as 4 to 5 percentage points!    To illustrate, in June 1986, the 306 loans
                                          —5—




closed with loan—to-value ratios of 75 to 80 percent had effective loan rates

ranging from 7.47 to 11.67 percent (mean of 10.40, standard deviation of 0.45)

For the 156 loans with loan-to-value ratios of 85 to 90 percent, the range was

an even wider 8.71 to 13.97 percent     (mean of 10.60, standard deviation    of

0.67) .     While variation of up to 1½ percentage points could conceivably be

rationalized (and over 95 percent of the loan rates fall within this range(

owing to differences in the date the loan was originated and in loan size, the

observed larger variation implies significant reporting errors.1

          The apparent significant reporting errora suggest three things.     Firat, a

large data sample ia needed ao that the errors will not diatort the results;

the significance (and plauaibility) of our estimates improved noticeably when

we went from one to three months of data in each year.2         Second, the data cells

should be chosen carefully to insure ample data pointa.         Third, our ability to

'explain      the effective loan rate data will not be great.


                              II.   The Empirical Results

          Variationa in effective FRM yields on conventional loana originated in a

particular region of the country at a given point in time ahould be

aysteaatically related to two variables:        the aize of the loan and the loan—

to—value ratio.     The effective rate should decline with loan aize because the

costs of originating and servicing contracts per dollar of loan decrease as the

loan size increases.      The effective rate should riae, at an increaaing rate,

with the loan—to—value ratio (after it exceeds, say, 80 percent) because

expected losses from default increase.       (Effective rates on equal—sized loans

collateralized by equal—valued houses may vary across regions because the

expected losses from default may vary owing to differences in expected houae

price inflation/volatility and/or in state foreclosure laws.)
                                               —6—



        To test the hypothesis that the loan rate declines with loan size, we

have computed the average effective rates on loans of increasing size (percent

of the conforming loan limit( for loans with similar loan—to—value ratios                  (75

to 80 percent(   .   This   also provides a crude test of the main hypothesis that

the relationship between qualifying and jumbo loan ratea changed between 1978

and 1986.

        The data in Table 4 provide support for both hypotheses.            First, consider

the declines in effective rates for both 1978 and 1986 as the loan size risea

from under half the conforming limit to the limit.            Second, note the sharp rate

jump at the loan limit in 1986, in contrast to the leveling off in 1978.                   In

fact, the 26 basis—point jump for loans 91—100 percent of the limit to loans

equal to 101—115 percent may understate the impact of the agencies' expansion.

The 101-115 percent rate may be lower in 1986 than it would be in the absence

of the agency expansion because these loans would be under the limit within a

year    (the limit increased   by 15 percent on January 1, 1987(
        Table 4 also contains data on the contract loan rate and standard

deviations of the effective and contract rates.           The contract rates follow

roughly the same pattern as the effective rate.           The standard deviations are a

little higher for smaller loans (under 80 percent of the conforming limit(

Somewhat aurprisingly, the standard deviations for the contract rata are

slightly amaller than those for the effective rate; we expected that accounting

for points would reduce the dispersion in contract rates.

        With this encouragement, we have proceeded to a formal teat of the

hypotheses by running OLS regressions, for 1978 and again for 1986, of the

form:

The independent variable is the effective loan rate, r,, for each of the 4,870

loans closed in May—July 1978 and the 1,856 loans closed in May—July 1986.              The

principal co-variates are the natural log of the real loan size, L. (in 1978

dollars), dummy variables, LV,., for the three larger loan-to-value ranges

hated in     Table   2    (the 70 to 79.9 range is the standard against which the

others are compared), and a dummy variable, C., for loans at or under the

conforming loan limit.           other regressors include a constant term, dummies for

the precise month the loan was closed (June and July, May being the standard)

dummies for the various geographic subregions in California             (12 in 1978 and 13

in 1986)          and a dummy for loans on new properties, N.       .   Loans on new
             G,
properties have historically been viewed as having less default risk than those

on existing properties so we would expect this dummy to have a negative

coefficient.      A negative coefficient could also reflect preferred financing

rates    purchased" by builders, where the cost of the preferred rates is not

captured in the survey.4

        The coefficient estimates and their standard errors are reported in Table

5   for effective loan rates measured in percentage points.5            Three equations are

listed for 1986; we begin by comparing the 1978 equation with the first

equation for 1986.            The coefficients on loan size and the loan-to-value and

new-property dummies are similar for the two years and, except for the 80—84.9

percent loan—to—value dummy, are statistically different from zero with the

expected signs.          The loan size coefficient translates into a —0.015 percent

elasticity of the interest rate with respect to the loan size.              Thus a 20

percent increase in loan size, say from the 1976 mean of $60,000 to $72,000,

implies roughly s         3   basis point decrease in loan rate.   The loan-to-value

coefficients suggest little extra charge for 80 to 85 percent loans relative to

70-79 percent loans, but roughly a 10 basis point extra charge for 90 percent

loans.     The average loan—to—value ratios in the 85—89.9 and 90—95 percent
                                              —8—



classes are quite close (89.4 versus 91.1 in 1978 and 89.0 versus 91.2 in

1986)   .     This   may explain the similarity of the coefficients on these two

dummies.        Finally, the rate for new properties is about 7 basis points less

than that for existing properties.

            Now for the coefficients that changed from 1978 to 1986.     Of course, the

intercepts and June and July dummy coefficients are different because the level

and evolution of mortgage rates in the spring of the two years was different.

Also different, though, is the coefficient on the conforming loan dummy.           The

coefficient declines from —5 basis points in 1978 to —29 basis points in 1986.

That is, the expanded activities of the agencies seem to have lowered yields on

conforming loans by 24 basis points relative to yields on jumbo loans.

            The second equation for 1986 in Table S tests a more sophisticated

hypothesis:          agency activities lowered the rates on jumbo loans just above the

loan limit as well as those on loans below the loan limit.           Because the limit

was raised by 15 percent on January 1, 1987, only six to eight months after the

loans were closed in May—July, a dummy variable was created for all loans

between 100 and 115 percent of the 1986 conforming limit.           This range

encompasses 27 percent of jumbo loans closed.         The addition of the just—over—

the—limit dummy has a negligible impact on the coefficients for loan size and

the loan—to-value and new—property dummies.         However, the coefficient on the

just—over—the—limit dummy is statistically different from zero, and the

coefficient on the conforming loan dummy increases by        7   basis points in

absolute value.         According to these estimates, the expanded securitization of

the agencies lowered the loan rates on qualifying loans by roughly 3S basis

points and those on "soon to be" qualifying loans by 20 basis points.

        This hypothesis csn be refined even further.       While the loan limit

increased by 15 percent on January 1, 1987, this increase was not known when

the loans closed in May—July 1986 were originated.         Nonetheless, such an
                                                        —9—




increase was highly likely because the index had risen at a 22 percent annual

rate over the first half of the adjustment period, October 1985 to March 1986.

On the other hand, a loan—rate impact could well exist on loans just above                             115


percent of the conforming limit because a reasonable possibility existed that

these loans would fall under the limit in 1987 or if not then in 1g88.                            To

allow for this further impact, a dummy for loans between 115 and 130 percent of

the loan limit was added           (this    range includes another 20 percent of the jumbo

loans.)       The third equation for 1986 does not indicate a significant loan—rate

impact for these loans.

      The effective loan rates shown in Table 4 and explained in Table 5 are

likely measured with substantial error.                   These rates were calculated as


      r. =        c.   + AOJ.,                                                           (2)
          J        J          J



where ADJ. = PT/PVAF1O., the ratio of the up-front points and fees to the

present value annuity factor using r. as the discount rate and a 10 year

assumed mortqage life.            This is an incorrect adjustment for two reasons.

First, the loans might be expected to prepay in more or less than 10 years

(probably less in California)           6      Second, some of the up-front charges just

cover the costs of origination and thus do not add to the yield.                         A more

where COST, is the dollar cost of originating loan                      and         is the actual

mortgage life expectation.           Unfortunately, neither                   nor      is observable.

If,   for example, PVAFX = 5 and COST = $500, then

                                                      =               0.2   and
                                                                                   a2
                                                                                        = $100.     In

this framewnrk, lenders are assumed to offer households alternative

combinations of c. and PT. for a given             r'!,   and households select their
                    J            3                   3

preferred combination.

        A formal test of the hypotheses consists of regressing                 r     on the various

covariates    (loan—to-value ratio, loan size, etc.) discussed above.                       Because
                                                                                                         a1
and a are unknown, we instead regress c. on PT., ilL.                      and the      variables

reject this framework.

        As an alternative, we presume that lenders set points so as to cover

origination costs (PT.       = COST./L.)    .    In   this case, c.       should be regressed on

the covariates of    r   only.       These results are reported in Table             6.       The

coefficients on the loan—to-value and new-loan dummies change little from those

in Table 5, but that on loan size is about halved and the conforming—loan dummy

coefficients decline slightly.          Except for the latter, the coefficients are

remarkable similar in 1978 and 1986.8            We note that the R2 are roughly 10

percent higher when the coupon rates, rather than effective rates, are

explained, and, more importantly, the equation standard errors are 15 to 20

percent lower,    on these grounds we prefer the estimates in Table 6 to those in

Table 5.

        By these estimates, the agencies hays lowered yields on conforming and

just—above conforming loans by 30 and 15 basis points, respectively, relative

to yields on large jumbo loans.          The 30 basis point spread between yields on

large—jumbo and conforming loans is at the low end of the observed spread

between yields on private and agency pass-through securities                      (Woodward, 1987)

Thus, yields on large jumbo loens mey be being set by the private securitizers,

rather than by traditional portfolio lenders.

                             III.   Summary and Implicationa

        Our analysia of conventional FRMa cloaed in California in May-July of

1978 and 1986 auggests that the loan rate depends on the loan-to-value ratio,

the loan size, and in 1986, whether the loan is far above, just above, or below

the conforming loan limit.       Loans with loan—to-value ratios of 90 percent have

rates 10 basis points higher than loans with 80 percent ratios, and $60,000

loans   (in 1986(   have rates 10 basis points higher than $130,000 loans.

Moreover, in 1986 the rates on loans far above the conforming loan limit exceed

those on otherwise comparable loans below the conforming loan limit by 30 basis

points and those on loans destined to exceed the limit within a year by 15

basis points.       That is, the expanded agency securitization of conventional FRNs

has significantly lowered the rates on both conforming loans and loans somewhat

above the conforming limit (27 percent of jumbo loans in l986( relative to what

they would otherwise have been.       While the analysis was restricted to

California, this state accounted for roughly one-quarter of the dollar volume

of all conventional FElls closed in 1986 and over half of all jumbos closed.

        Of interest is when this conforming loan—rate impact first occurred.       The

data in Table 1 suggest that the agencies' share of the new origination market

for conforming FRMs did not exceed fifty percent until 1986, but conceivably

the thirty—six percent share in 1985 was sufficient to determine prices.       A

brief examination of rates on loans closed in May-July 1985 suggests that this

was not the case.      Yields on conforming 75 to 80 percent loan—to-value loans

exceeded those on similar jumbo loans.       Thus 1986 seems to be the first year of

the agency impact on FRN rates.

        The effects of a 30 basis point lower FRM rate are many, and some of them

could be significant in magnitude.       Households are more likely to choose FRMs

than ARMs, to decide to own rather than rent,      and to own larger houses.

Traditional mortgage portfolio lenders will have fewer ARMs to purchase and
                                          —12—



will earn lower returns on FRM investments.       We conclude our paper with a few

sample calculations to illustrate the possible magnitudes of some of these

effects.

         Brueckner and Follain (1988)   and Ohillon, Shilling and Sirmans (1987)

have recently estimated equations explaining the household FRM/ARM decision.

Using the Brueckner—Follain estimates, a 30 basis point decline in the FRM

rate, at spring 1986 interest rate levels, would have lowered the ARM share

from 65 percent to 29 percent.9     In the 1988 environment of a wider FRM—ARM

rste spread (assumed 50 basis—point lower ARM rate) ,    the   same FRN rate decrease

would lower the ARM share from 95 to 75 percent.      Using the Ohillon—Shilling-

Sirmans estimates gives impacts about half as large.      These seem more plausible

to us.    Thus we conclude that the lower FRM rate induced by the agencies

probably lowered the ARM share of new originations in recent years by 10 to 20

percentage points.

      A 30 basis point decline in the FRM rate would have a large negative

long—run impact on returns to traditional FRM portfolio investors. To

illustrate, say that such investors could expect to earn a 15 percent pretax

return, in the absence of the 30 basis point FRM rate decline, by investing 96

cents of debt and 4 cents of equity in a dollar of mortgages.       A 30 basis point

decline in the FRM rate would halve the expected return on equity (to below the

return on Treasuries) .   Moreover, the tilt in households toward FRMs would
reduce the ARMs available for portfolio investment.

      Finally, a lower FRM rate would raise homeownership and the quantity of

housing demanded by owners.    This impact is not large, however.     For example,

if the elasticity of housing demand with respect to the user cost is negative

unity, then housing demand would increase by less than 2 to 2½      percent.1°
Because most price—elasticity estimates are closer to —0.5 (Mayo,      1981 and

Goodman, 1988), the expected increase in demand is closer to one percent.
                                        —13—



      The above is not meant to be either a full list of potential effects of a

lower FRM rate or a full analysis of the effects considered.        For example, a

relatively lower FRM rate likely means a higher level of other interest rates

and thus (slightly) less nonhousing capital.       The analysis should indicate,

however, that a 30 basis point lower   FR!.!   rate is not a trivial matter.

1.   For jumbo loans, more variation might be expected.             Borrowers of such loans

can be highly desirable customers for whom landers may lower the borrowing rate

in order to establish an ongoing relationship.              For example, the effective rate

on a jumbo loan may be reduced depending on the size and number of certificates

of deposit placed in the lender's institution by the borrower.                   Further,

without the agencies' standardization         and the general discipline of an active

secondary market, underwriting standards may vary significantly, and some local

oligopoly power may exist.


2.    Initially some attempts were made to "clean up" the data by deleting loans

with interest rates that were "too low".            This did not significantly alter the

empirical estimates.


3.   The 1978 survey also reported the month the loan was originated.                  Dummy

variables for the origination month were included in the 1978 regression.


4.   We thank Michael Carliner for pointing out this possibility.


5.    The coefficients on the geographic dummies are not listed.                 The maximum

difference between the coefficients was 16 basis points for 1978 and 25 basis

points for 1986.


6.    The ten—year assumption is especially suspect in periods when the term—

structure is downward sloping         (much of 198D—82( .     When we recomputed      the

effective   loan   rate   based   on an assumed seven—year     mortgage   life   and used this

rate as the dependent variable, the coefficient estimates were virtually

identical to those in Table 5.
                                         —15—



7.    when points are added to these equations, the points coefficient is

positive   (and significantly different from zero in 1978) ,    not negative as   might
he expected.


8.    If the agencies dominate the market and do not pay lower prices for riskier

high loan—to—value loans, then one might think loan rates would not vary with

the loan—to—value   ratio.   However, originator/servicers    will still require a

higher coupon (high price from agencies) to offset lower servicing value
                                                                         owing
to greater expected default.


9.    These calculations aaaume a 10.60 percent FRM rate (before the 30 basis

point decline), an 8.15 percent ARM rate, a $40,000 income level, and the mean

values of the other variables in the Brueckner—Follain               With these
                                                       paper.

parameters, the values computed from their equation     (2)   are 0.382 before the 30

basis point decline and -0.563 afterwards.      Assuming a standard normal error

term, these values translate into the ARM percentages given in the text.


10.   Taking the "typical" owner to be in a 25 percent tax bracket, a 30 basis

point lower FRM rate lowers the after—tax rate (and thus the user cost) by 22

basis points.   With an initial user cost of 10 percent, demand rises by 2.2

percent.
