                                                 ABSTRACT

While the link between physical activity and health has been studied, there are several limitations that
persist in this literature relating to external and internal validity of the estimates, potential measurement
error in self-reported weight and risk factors, failure to account for physical activity beyond exercise,
and failure to separate the effects of exercise from other forms of physical activity. This study addresses
these gaps and assesses plausibly causal effects of recreational exercise and other physical activity
(including work-related activity) on the risk factors for heart disease, utilizing a population-based longitudinal
dataset that contains objective information on key risk factors. We estimate fixed effects specifications
that account for a host of unobservable confounding factors, and further estimate specifications with
lagged outcome measures that allow us to bound plausibly causal effects under reasonable assumptions.
There are four key patterns of results that emerge. First, the lagged effect of physical activity is almost
always larger than the current effect. This suggests that current risk factors, not only obesity but also
high blood pressure and heart rate, take years to develop, which underscores the importance of consistent
physical activity to ward off heart disease. Second, we find that in general physical activity reduces
risk factors for heart disease even after controlling, to some extent, for unobservable confounding
influences. Third, not only recreational but work-related physical activity appears to protect against
heart disease. Finally, there is evidence of a dose-response relationship such that higher levels of recreational
exercise and other physical activity have a greater protective effect. Our estimates of the contemporaneous
and durable effects suggest that the observed declines in high levels of recreational exercise and other
physical activity can potentially account for between 12-30% of the increase in obesity, hypertension,
diabetes, and heart disease observed over the sample period, ceteris paribus.

1.     Introduction

       A comprehensive report of the U.S. Surgeon General (U.S. Department of Health and

Human Services 1996) concluded that physical activity ameliorates many of the risk factors for

heart disease, such as obesity, high blood pressure, and a rapid pulse, as well as reduces the

incidence of diseases such as Type 2 diabetes, angina, heart attack, and stroke with which they

are associated. However, the studies upon which these conclusions rest suffer from a number of

weaknesses. While the effects found in randomized controlled studies are plausibly causal, they

may lack external validity since these studies are based on small, convenience samples of

persons whose behavior may not generalize to the overall population (Stamler et al. 1989; Arroll

and Beaglehole 1992; Kelley and McClellan 1994). In contrast, studies that have utilized

population-based samples generally do not control for the many confounding factors that affect

both physical activity as well as health, and thus it is not clear whether their results can be

considered causal (Arraiz, Wigle, Mao 1992; Sherman et al. 1994; Hu et al. 2007). Thus, these

studies often lack internal validity. In addition, the population-based samples used in these

studies mainly contain self-reported rather than objectively-measured characteristics, such as

height, weight, and the presence of high blood pressure, which may be subject to systematic

misreporting or under-reporting and thus lead to biased estimates.

       In this study, we address these limitations and assess plausibly causal effects of physical

activity on the risk factors for heart disease using the first National Health and Nutrition

Examination Survey (NHANES I) and its follow-up study, the NHANES I Epidemiologic

Follow-up Study (NHEFS). The NHANES and NHEFS constitute a population-based

longitudinal survey that objectively measures weight, blood pressure, pulse, and a host of other

behaviors and characteristics for approximately 9,300 persons. To the best of our knowledge,


                                                                                                     2
this is the only population-based dataset in the U.S. that provides longitudinal information on

measured (as opposed to self-reported) risk factors for heart disease.

       The nature of the NHANES thus enables us to make a number of contributions. First,

unlike virtually all prior studies, we estimate the effects on health of both recreational exercise as

well as of physical activity at work and elsewhere. The importance of disentangling the effects

of recreational exercise from other physical activity stems from the likelihood that both types of

activity may have differential effects on health. The importance of considering physical activity

levels beyond just recreational exercise derives from the fact that for the average individual

recreational exercise typically constitutes only about 3-4% of their total daily physical exertion

(Colman and Dave 2011). In addition, our measure of physical activity also includes activity at

work, which is often excluded in prior studies. Work-related physical activity constitutes the

largest component of total physical exertion for the average individual: approximately 32% for

working-aged males, and 20% for working-aged females (American Time Use Surveys-ATUS

2010). Hence, it is important to consider the totality of an individual’s physical activity

including their work-related activity, while separating the effects of exercise from that of other

activities, which we do in this study.

       Saffer et al. (2011) and Colman and Dave (2011) also show that there is considerable

substitution between work-related physical activity, exercise, and other forms of recreational

activity. Specifically, during an economic downturn, job loss induces individuals to increase

their recreational exercise though their total physical activity level declines due to a large

decrease in work-related physical activity (Colman and Dave 2011). It is difficult to assess the

implications of these shifts on health without evidence on the differential effects of recreational

exercise and other physical activity on health - evidence which we provide in this study.



                                                                                                      3
Second, the availability of repeated observations on the same persons makes it possible to

control for many of the unobserved confounding factors that affect both physical activity and

health. Third, the objectivity of the measurements enables us to avoid the measurement error

that has plagued prior research. Finally, NHANES I and its follow-up study generally predated

the sharp rise in obesity in the U.S. and thus bypass some of the time-series confounding relating

to the bi-directional link between obesity (and its adverse health consequences) and physical

activity. Hence, we are able to establish baseline effects of physical activity on the risk factors

for heart disease over a time period when obesity was stable, which can then be used to inform

whether and to what extent physical activity can account for subsequent observed trends in these

risk factors.

        The rest of the manuscript is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data used in

the empirical analyses. Section 3 outlines our empirical methodology in identifying the effects

of physical activity measures on health. Section 4 discusses the results, and Section 5 concludes

with a discussion of the implications of our estimates.

2.      Data

2.1     National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)

        The NHANES I is a national probability sample of 31,973 persons ages 1 to 75 in the

U.S., interviewed from 1971 to 1974. A random subset of 23,808 persons, the “examination

sample”, provided more detailed information. Examiners measured respondents’ heights,

weights, skinfolds (measure of body fat), and other features, and doctors examined them for

signs of nutritional deficiency as well as any obvious medical problem. An additional random

sample of 6,913 persons ages 24 to 75, the “augmentation sample”, was interviewed in 1974 and

                                                                                                      4
1975. These respondents provided virtually the same information as the examination sample, and

in addition were given complete physical examinations by physicians, and answered a series of

questions on general psychological well-being (GWB).

        The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) conducted a Follow-up

survey to NHANES I spanning the years 1982 to 1984. The follow-up was meant to locate the

14,407 person who were part of the examination sample of NHANES I and were between 25 and

74 years old during the original survey. Ninety-three percent were either located or ascertained

to have died; of these, valid responses were obtained from 91%, providing a sample of 12,220

persons. For persons who had died before the Follow-up survey, proxy responses were obtained

from family members or friends. The Follow-up survey collected information on the

respondents’ current health or, if not still living, cause of death, income, medical history since

the first survey, how often the respondent ate various foods, and also measured their weights,

blood pressure, and pulse.

2.2     Measures of Risk Factors, Health, and Physical Activity

        We compute the individual’s body mass index (BMI) based on the conventional

definition, that is weight in kilograms divided by height in meters-squared. The calculation of

BMI in the first wave used the values of height and weight measured during the examination,

which took place in mobile examination trailers, where subjects wore paper uniforms and rubber

slippers provided by the NHANES staff.1 Height was not measured in the Follow-up interview.

Therefore, the BMI calculation in the second wave uses the respondent’s measured height from

the first wave on the assumption that height is stable for working-aged adults.
1
 The Follow‐up survey measured respondents’ weights in their usual clothing. Thus the follow‐up weights were
heavier by the amount of the subjects’ clothing. There is no need to explicitly adjust for this since as long as the
weight of the respondents’ indoor clothing is approximately the same from one person to the next it will not affect
correlations between weight and other variables. On average clothes weigh about 4‐5 pounds, and the mean
effect of clothing on weight is captured by the year fixed effects included in all models.

                                                                                                                   5
       In addition to BMI, we use three other objectively-measured risk factors for heart disease:

systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and the resting heart rate. In NHANES I, these

measurements, like height and weight, were taken in the mobile examination trailer, whereas in

the follow-up they were taken largely in the respondents’ homes. It is plausible that both pulse

and blood pressure would be higher in a government trailer than in one’s home. But as long as

the difference between home and trailer measurements was about the same for each respondent,

the wave/year indicator included in all models will capture this difference. Subsequently, the

different circumstances of measurement will not affect the correlations between the

measurements and other characteristics of the respondents.

       NHANES I asks two questions on physical activity, one regarding recreational exercise

and another regarding physical activity other than exercise. The question on non-recreational

physical activity is the same in the first NHANES I sample (from 1971 to 1974), in the

Augmentation sample (from 1974 to 1975), and in the Follow-up survey. It probes: “In your

usual day, aside from recreation, are you physically very active, moderately active, or quite

inactive?” We create dichotomous indicators for each response. The question on recreational

exercise differed slightly between the initial survey and the Augmentation survey. In the initial

survey the question reads: “Do you get much exercise in the things you do for recreation (sports,

or hiking, or anything like that), or hardly any exercise, or in between?” The possible responses

are: “much exercise”, “moderate exercise”, and “little or no exercise”. The Augmentation sample

questionnaire asks: “In things you do for recreation, for example: sports, hiking, dancing and so

forth, do you get much exercise, moderate exercise, or little or no exercise?” We consider these

questions similar enough to code the responses the same way, and create dichotomous indicators

for each response.



                                                                                                    6
        Both surveys also ask whether the respondent had certain medical conditions. The

Follow-up interview does not inquire about all the conditions queried in the original survey, and

asks about additional conditions not asked in the first survey. For many of the conditions, the

follow-up asks when the condition or event occurred, from which we can infer whether the

respondent had the condition at the time of the first survey. We create dichotomous indicators for

the conditions covered in both surveys as well as for those whose presence in the first survey can

be inferred from the follow-up. These are: 1) arthritis; 2) asthma; 3) colitis; 4) diabetes; 5)

emphysema; 6) gallbladder; 7) heart attack; 8) high blood pressure; 9) kidney disease; 10)

nervous breakdown; 11) stroke; 12) thyroid disease; 13) ulcer; and 14) cancer.

        We also create dichotomous indicators for various socio-demographic measures

including different categories of marital status, gender, labor force status, and race and ethnicity.

Both the original and follow-up surveys report income in categories, though the categories differ

substantially to reflect the large inflation between 1971 and 1984. We create a continuous

income measure by imputing to each respondent the midpoint of his or her income category, and

for those whose income is in the top category, we assign the average income above the cut-off

based on a Weibull distribution.2 Education is measured by indicators for the highest grade

completed.

2.3     Analysis Sample

        The size of the final analysis sample depends on the outcome being studied. For purposes

of illustration, we use BMI, although the calculations are virtually identical with other outcomes.

Of the 12,220 participants who were traced in the Follow-up survey, 1,697 died prior to the

Follow-up interview, 560 have missing values of either BMI or one of the activity variables, and
2
 We confirm that our estimates are not sensitive to alternative imputations: 1) other extreme value distributions;
2) imputing the highest income category at the top‐coded value; and 3) controlling for income in the models as
dichotomous indicators for the income categories.

                                                                                                                 7
1,274 have missing values for the other covariates. Finally, we drop 3,256 respondents over 60

years old in either wave, for two reasons. First, since height is only measured in the first wave,

and declines with age, BMI is measured with increasing error for older respondents. Second,

much of the variation in non-recreational physical activity reflects differences between persons

working and not working, and between those in physically active occupations and other

occupations. As noted earlier, among working-aged adults, about 26% of total daily physical

exertion is derived from work-related activities (ATUS 2010). This variation is lost among

seniors because very few of them are in the labor force.

3.       Analytical Framework

         The objective of this study is to assess the effect of recreational exercise and other

physical activity on the risk factors for heart disease. A number of prior studies, such as those

referenced above, have considered this question with longitudinal data; in fact, one prior study of

one of our outcomes (BMI) also used the NHANES I and the Follow-up (Williamson et al.

1992). However, the models used in prior studies have not taken full advantage of the

longitudinal nature of their data and fail to control for the many confounding factors that cause a

person both to be physically active and to have risk factors for heart diseases.3 More specifically,

the two most common models estimated in prior studies are the following:

                                                                                                                     (1)

and

                                                                                                                     (2)




3
 In the language of the treatment effects literature, prior studies have not availed themselves of the possibilities
of controlling for selection into “treatment”, which in this case is “physical activity”. This limits the internal validity
of the estimates from this literature due to the possibility of selection bias.

                                                                                                                           8
where       is a vector of individual characteristics or behaviors that vary over time (such as

health),     is a vector of individual characteristics that do not vary over time (such as race),                  ,

is a measure of physical activity, and          includes all the time-varying unobserved influences on

the outcome. The subscripts denote the ith individual observed in time period t.

        The weakness of such models is that there are almost certainly many variables in                     and

    that affect physical activity but cannot be observed. For example, the respondent may have

inherited a tendency to worry about his health or the individual may be relatively more forward-

looking or risk-averse, which would cause him to watch his diet as well as to exercise. Since the

inherited portion of someone’s heath anxiety or their risk-aversion or future-orientation (time

preference in the economics jargon) cannot be observed, it becomes part of the error term, and,

being correlated with physical activity, biases the coefficients in these prior studies.

        Hence we estimate a version of equation (1) that allows us to remove many of the

unobserved confounding variables. Including controls for national trends (γt) in the outcome, our

model is:

                                                                                                             (3)

To estimate it, we take first-differences (FD) of both sides between the two NHANES waves.

                                 ∆        ∆          ∆       ∆           ∆                                   (4)

Differencing removes the variables collected in            , since these variables are the same in each

time period. In a practical sense, we actually estimate equation (4) using the fixed-effects (FE)

routine.4 Since we have only two waves of data, FE and FD produce identical results.5 Our key


4
  We test for the consistency of fixed versus random effects for all models based on the Hausman test, and in all
cases we reject the random effects model suggesting that the Zi are correlated with physical activity and hence the
fixed effects model is preferred.
5
  One weakness of the FE (or FD) method is that it may be more vulnerable than ordinary least squares (OLS) to
measurement‐error bias, the bias being higher, the higher the correlation between the independent variables and
their lagged values (Griliches & Hausman 1986). In our case the time between waves—about 10 years—is

                                                                                                                   9
parameter of interest is δ, the effect of physical activity (PA) on health-related outcomes and risk

factors for heart disease. Equations (3) and (4) can be interpreted as an individual-level health

production function, which relates health inputs and health investments such as physical activity

and education to health outputs such as obesity, diabetes, and heart conditions (Grossman 2000).

         First-differencing and FE methods solve the omitted variables problem as long as all the

important omitted factors that affect selection into treatment are time-invariant. Indeed, these

methods allow us to account for key unobserved time-invariant confounding factors (Angrist and

Pischke 2009) such as risk preference, time preference (whether the individual is present- or

future-oriented), stable personality traits, parental investments, family background,

genetic/hereditary traits, and other prior health investments. But it is possible that important

time-varying factors also influence both physical activity and the outcome. Among the most

important such factors is the prior level of the outcome. Suppose, for example, the outcome is

BMI. It is not only likely that physical activity reduces BMI contemporaneously, but also that

BMI affects future physical activity. For example, a person who becomes obese may switch to a

more sedentary job. Thus prior obesity affects selection into the current level of physical activity.

To account for this, we also estimate the following model.

                                                                                                                  (5)

Estimating (5) will produce consistent estimates of               so long as selection into physical activity

depends only on the lagged value of the outcome once we control for the other characteristics of

the respondent that we can observe. One advantage to estimating both (4) and (5) is that if at

least one of the models is correctly specified, and if selection into physical activity is negatively


sufficiently long that the change in physical activity is relatively large, which would tend to minimize this bias. For
instance, the share of respondents who are very physically active drops by about a third from the first to the
second wave, while the shares that are moderately active and that exercise with moderate intensity rise by about
the same amount.

                                                                                                                     10
correlated with the lagged outcome (which it is, in all of the outcomes we consider), the true

causal effect will lie between the two estimates (Guryan 2001; Angrist & Pischke 2009). That is,

if the true model is (5) but we estimate (4), the coefficients on physical activity will be too large.

On the other hand, if the true model is (4) but we estimate (5), the coefficients will be too small.

More formally, we can bound the true causal effect of physical activity on health as follows, by

considering the estimate of δ from equations (4) and (5).



                                                                                                 (6)

As a further robustness check, we can gauge whether we have uncovered causal effects by

assessing outcomes that are themselves caused by the risk factors we examine. For examine, if

an increase in physical activity reduces blood pressure, and if a decrease in blood pressure

reduces heart disease, we should find that heart disease is negatively related to physical activity

as well. Therefore we also estimate the effect of physical activity on other heart- and obesity-

related outcomes that are available for both waves of the NHANES, including self-reported

diabetes, high blood pressure, angina, and heart trouble.

4.     Results

       As evident from the means reported in Table 1, the persons sampled in the NHANES I

became substantially less active in general during the ten years that on average separated their

two interviews. The proportion of respondents reporting they that were very active outside of

recreational exercise fell by about 37% among non-Hispanic whites (from 48.8% to 30.7%), and

by about 30% for the other racial and ethnic categories. Similarly, the prevalence of a high level

of recreational exercise also declined among non-Hispanic whites (by about 20%) but increased

among the other racial and ethnic groups.


                                                                                                    11
       It is difficult to discern from the means the trends in the objectively-measured risk

factors, partly because, as mentioned above, the circumstances of measurement may have

differed between the NHANES I and the Follow-up interviews. This is especially noticeable in

the average pulse rate, which appears to have declined by 10 beats per minute between the two

surveys. This likely reflects differences in the circumstances of measurement since, as far as we

know, no medication to slow the pulse rate spread rapidly between the early 1970s and the early

1980s. Medication may, however, explain the decline in average blood pressure over this period

(Kumanyika et al. 1998). As a further check, we also analyze self-reported hypertension. As

shown in the Table 1, including those whose measured blood pressure is high as well as those

who take medicine to reduce their blood pressure, the proportion with high blood pressure

approximately doubled across all racial and ethnic groups. These unconditional means suggest

that the decline in physical activity between the two waves coincided with a worsening of the

risk factors for heart disease. However, due to possible confounding with national trends, with

the aging of the sample, and with other factors, we cannot infer causal effects from a comparison

of means. We therefore turn to the multivariate regression results. For all regression models, the

reported standard errors are adjusted for arbitrary correlation in the error term over time for each

individual.

       Table 2 presents models for body mass index (BMI). Specification 1 estimates an OLS

model relating lagged activity measures to BMI. Specification 2 estimates the first-differenced

(identical to fixed effects) model specified in equation (4), and the final specification estimates

the model with the lagged dependent variable specified in equation (5). Several patterns stand

out in these models. First, the lagged effect of physical activity is almost always larger than the

current effect. For instance, individuals who were very active (excluding recreational exercise) in



                                                                                                      12
the previous wave had a lower BMI by about 1.07 points in the follow-up wave, relative to

individuals who were inactive. In contrast, contemporaneous levels of high activity (excluding

recreational exercise) also reduced BMI, but by a smaller margin (0.42 points in model 2 and

0.31 points in model 3). That is, while current physical activity levels have a protective effect

towards reducing the risk factors for heart disease, the estimates suggest that there are strong

lagged and durable effects of physical activity. This may indicate that current risk factors, not

only obesity but also high blood pressure and heart rate, take years to develop, which emphasizes

the importance of consistent physical activity to ward off heart disease.

         Second, almost all results for all outcomes conform to equation (6): in general,

controlling for the lagged dependent variable suggests a larger effect than controlling for fixed

effects. This implies that the true effect is between the coefficients in columns 2 and 3 of each

table, implying that in general physical activity reduces risk factors for heart disease even after

controlling, to some extent, for unobservable influences. Thus, with respect to BMI, high-levels

of physical activity (excluding recreational exercise) reduce BMI by between 0.31 to 0.42 points

(relative to inactivity) and high levels of recreational exercise reduce BMI by between 0.28 to

0.78 points (relative to little or no exercise).

         Third, not only recreational but other physical activity (most of which is work-related)

appears to also protect against heart disease. We cannot reject the null hypothesis that the

magnitudes of the protective effect for both types of activities (recreational exercise versus

other/work-related physical activity) are the same.6 Colman and Dave (2011) show that

individuals who lose their jobs during an economic recession raise their exercise levels due to a


6
 However, this is not to say that the effects of work‐related or other physical activity are necessarily uniform
across all individuals. It is possible that work‐related physical activity may have muted effects on health, or even
adverse effects, for individuals in certain physically‐demanding occupations that have very high sustained energy
demands. For a discussion, see Kukkonen‐Harjula (2007).

                                                                                                                   13
greater availability of time, though their total physical exertion declines due to a larger drop in

work-related physical activity. Our estimates imply that this net decline in physical activity

during an economic downturn would have a net adverse effect on individuals’ risk factors for

heart disease.

         Fourth, the models indicate suggestive evidence of a dose-response relationship. In

general, the protective effects of high levels of recreational exercise and other activity are

stronger than the protective effects of moderate levels, relative to the effects of no exercise or the

effects of inactivity.7

         Tables 3 and 4 present models respectively for measured systolic and diastolic blood

pressure, and Table 5 presents models for the measured pulse rate. While most of these effects

are imprecisely estimated with large standard errors, the patterns remain robust. In general,

physical activity measures (especially other physical activity besides recreational exercise, most

of which is comprised of work-related activities) has a strong durable protective effect in

reducing blood pressure and reducing the resting heart rate. A number of studies indicate that a

faster resting heart rate is a risk factor for cardiovascular mortality (see for instance, Kannel et al.

1987). Again, we find protective effects for both recreational exercise and other work-related

physical activity, at least with respect to blood pressure. With respect to the pulse rate, estimates

suggest that a high level of other work-related physical activity has a lagged durable effect

(reducing the pulse rate by about 1 beat per minute) though no discernible contemporaneous

effect. A high level of recreational exercise, on the other hand, has both strong contemporaneous

7
 The effects of the other included covariates (not reported) on risk factors for heart disease and the other health
conditions are consistent with the literature. In general, educated individuals tend to be healthier, which is
consistent with Grossman and Kaestner (1997) who suggest that educated individuals tend to be more efficient in
“producing” health and engage in more (less) healthy (risky) behaviors. Higher levels of income also generally have
a protective effect on health. Risk factors for heart disease and health tend to worsen over the life cycle. The
effects of marital status and race/ethnicity vary depending on the risk factor and morbidity in question. Full results

                                                                                                                   14
effects (reducing the resting pulse rate by between 1.1 to 2.6 beats per minute) as well as a strong

lagged effect (reducing the pulse rate by about 1.2 beats per minute).

       Table 6 specifically considers the incidence of hypertension. Across all models, all

coefficient estimates are negative implying that both forms of physical activity reduce the

prevalence of high blood pressure contemporaneously as well as in the long term. We estimate

that a high level of recreational exercise reduces the probability of having high blood pressure by

between 2.8 and 8.4 percentage points, which represents a 10-31% reduction in the prevalence

relative to the mean in the Follow-up interviews. A high level of other physical activity reduces

the likelihood of hypertension by between 2.3 to 4.3 percentage points (about a 9-16% reduction

relative to the mean).

       Given that both recreational exercise and other physical activity reduces the risk factors

associated with heart disease (BMI, high blood pressure, and a high resting heart rate), we would

expect favorable effects on heart-related morbidities. Thus, Tables 7-9 present a plausibility

check by assessing effects on outcomes that are themselves caused by these risk factors.

Specifically, we consider diabetes (Table 7), angina (Table 8), and heart disease (Table 9). In

general, these estimates suggest that physical activity measures are associated with a reduced

prevalence of each of these heart- and obesity-related morbidities. For instance, a high level of

recreational exercise and other physical activity reduces the probability of diabetes by as much as

2 percentage points (Model 3 in Table 7) and the probability of heart disease by as much as 2-4

percentage points (Model 3 in Table 9). These results are validating in that they confirm the

causal chain from physical activity to a reduction in risk factors for heart disease to ultimately a

reduction in heart-related and obesity-related disease conditions.




                                                                                                    15
       It may be that estimating a causal effect requires controlling for time-varying factors that

may influence both the outcome and physical activity. We include a number of such factors, such

as the respondent’s age, marital status, state or region of residence, and month of interview to

account for seasonality in all reported models. From the NHANES questionnaire, we can also

construct a great many indicators for health conditions. Some of these conditions, or the lack of

them, may be caused by physical activity, such as heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure,

angina, cancer, and a number of other morbidities. Since these conditions affect the outcomes we

study, it might seem reasonable to include them as covariates. But doing so would bias the

coefficients on physical activity because in part these conditions also result from physical

activity (Rosenbaum 1984). Therefore, in supplementary analyses (not reported but available

upon request), we include indicators for a number of conditions that may affect the outcomes

under study -- but do not, as far as we can determine, result from physical activity -- conditions

such as epilepsy, detached retina, glaucoma, cataracts, diverticulitis, Parkinson’s, cirrhosis,

psoriasis, migraines, kidney disease, and emphysema. The estimates from these extended models

are virtually the same as those reported in Tables 2-9. This robustness is further validating and

adds a degree of confidence to our causal bounds of the effects of activity measures on risk

factors and morbidities.

5.     Summary & Discussion

       While the link between physical activity and health has been studied in the past, there are

several limitations that persist in the literature. Estimates from randomized controlled studies are

often based on small, convenience samples and difficult to generalize to the population-level,

while observational population-based studies often fail to account for the various confounding

factors that drive both physical activity and health. Furthermore, many of the prior studies have


                                                                                                    16
either only considered recreational exercise, which provides an incomplete picture since such

exercise typically constitutes only about 3-4% of an individual’s total physical exertion, or failed

to separately consider other forms of physical activity, especially activity levels that include

work-related physical activity. This latter point is significant since work-related physical activity

is the single largest component of total physical exertion for working aged adults, and work-

related physical activity and recreational exercise often move opposite to each other over the

business cycle. That is, as individuals increase their labor supply during periods of high

employment, they tend to reduce their recreational exercise on average. Hence, it is important to

consider both of these forms of activities separately when assessing their effects on health

markers. Finally, much of the prior work has relied on self-reported measures of weight and

height, and risk factors such as blood pressure, which may be subject to measurement error.

       In this study, we addressed these limitations and assessed the plausibly causal effects of

recreational exercise and other physical activity, including work-related physical activity, on the

risk factors for heart disease using a longitudinal population-based dataset with objectively

measured risk factors. Fixed-effects models control for all time-invariant observed and

unobserved confounding factors. In addition, comparing these estimates with those derived from

models with a lagged dependent variable allows us to bound the causal effect under reasonable

assumptions (Angrist & Pischke 2009).

       We find robust evidence that both recreational exercise and other physical activity have a

similar protective effect on health by reducing the risk factors (BMI, high blood pressure, and

resting heart rate) associated with heart disease. In supplementary models, we also find positive

effects on actual health outcomes, including a reduction in diabetes, angina, and heart disease.




                                                                                                   17
There is also some suggestive evidence that physical activity has durable effects on health,

emphasizing the importance of engaging in a consistently active lifestyle over time.

         Table 1 documented the reduced prevalence in high levels of exercise and other physical

activity between the two waves of the NHANES. Given the health-promoting effects of

recreational exercise and other forms of physical activity, these declining trends in activity levels

have adverse implications for population health. Brownson, Boehmer, and Luke (2005) report

longer-term trends (up to 50 years for certain measures) in physical activity in the U.S. They

also conclude that there is an overall trend of declining total physical activity due to a decrease in

work-related physical activity, declining transportation activity, declining home-based activity,

and increased sedentary activity. Church et al. (2011) document a decrease in daily occupation-

related energy expenditure by more than 100 calories between 1960–62 and 2003–06, based on

the NHANES, suggesting a declining trend in work-related physical activity levels.

         The results from this study suggest that the reduced levels of physical activity will lead to

adverse consequences on weight-based health and heart-related morbidity by increasing the

incidence of obesity, high blood pressure, and the resting heart rate, ceteris paribus. Based on

the midpoint of the bounded effects (Models 2 and 3 for each outcome), our contemporaneous

estimates indicate that the reduced levels of high recreational exercise and other physical activity

(and shifts in other activity measures) can explain about 3-10% of the increase in BMI and

hypertension, and consequently about 2-8% of the increase in diabetes and heart disease,

between the two waves of the NHANES. We note that since physical activity has a strong

durable effect on risk factors and morbidities, these explained effects are understated.8 Further

accounting for the durable effects (Model 1 for each outcome), the reduced high levels of

8
 Our durable effects are estimated over a 10 year period on average. To the extent that physical activity has a
cumulative effect that persists beyond this period, the observed declines in high levels of exercise and physical
activity can lead to further worsening of the risk factors and an increase in weight‐ and heart‐related morbidities.

                                                                                                                   18
exercise and physical activity observed over the sample period can account for an additional 10-

20% of the increase in the noted risk factors and illness conditions.
