Vertical Integration and Optimal Reimbursement Policy

                                             ABSTRACT

Health care providers may vertically integrate not only to facilitate coordination of care, but also for
strategic reasons that may not be in patients' best interests. Optimal Medicare reimbursement policy
depends upon the extent to which each of these explanations is correct. To investigate, we compare
the consequences of the 1997 adoption of prospective payment for skilled nursing facilities (SNF PPS)
in geographic areas with high versus low levels of hospital/SNF integration. We find that SNF PPS
decreased spending more in high integration areas, with no measurable consequences for patient health
outcomes. Our findings suggest that subjecting integrated providers to higher-powered reimbursement
incentives, i.e., less cost-sharing, may enhance medical productivity. More generally, we conclude
that it may be efficient for purchasers of health services (and other services subject to agency problems)
to consider the organizational form of their suppliers when choosing a reimbursement mechanism.

Introduction

        Over the past 20 years, markets for health services have become significantly

more vertically integrated. Producers of complementary services that were once

independent are now increasingly commonly-owned. By the end of the 1990s, three-

quarters of acute-care hospitals had acquired a supplier of post-acute care such as a

rehabilitation hospital, home health service, or skilled nursing facility (SNF) (CBO

1997). The most important of these from the perspective of the Medicare program are

SNFs, which account for the largest share of post-acute spending (MedPAC 2010).

        In theory, the optimal response of Medicare to the integration of hospitals into

post-acute services is indeterminate. Because providers have better information on the

severity of patients' illness, optimal reimbursement policy generally allows them to pass

on some but not all of the costs of treatment. This well-known result reflects the tradeoff

between incentives not to skimp on treatment and incentives to contain costs (Ellis 1998).

Because integration may change the terms of this tradeoff in either direction, or not at all,

whether integrated post-acute care providers should be offered more or less cost-sharing

than their stand-alone counterparts is an empirical question.

        On one hand, integration may enhance these providers' incentives to supply

unnecessary treatment. This could occur, for example, if integration is used as a vehicle

to pay kickbacks for inefficient referrals (Pauly 1979).1 Inefficient referrals for post-

acute care are of particular interest in the Medicare program, because acute-care hospitals




1
  Explicit payments for referrals are banned by Medicare (and Medicaid), effectively eliminating them, but
the legal prohibition can be circumvented by integration, because policing transfer payments among parties
that share fixed assets within an organization is extremely difficult.


                                                                                                         2
have traditionally faced higher-power reimbursement than post-acute care providers. 2

This anomaly could give integrated hospitals greater incentives to discharge patients to

post-acute facilities prematurely, thereby resulting in more avoidable post-acute stays

(e.g., Morrisey, Sloan, and Valvona 1988). In this case, giving integrated providers more

powerful incentives for cost containment could limit spending and improve efficiency.

        On the other hand, integration may enhance post-acute providers' incentives to

skimp. This could occur, for example, if integration inhibits Medicare's ability to

monitor quality of care, or if integration enables providers to better align the incentives of

physician decision-makers with their own at patients' expense. In this case, giving

integrated providers less powerful incentives for cost containment could be optimal.

        Integration may also have no effect on the principal/agent relationship between

Medicare and post-acute care providers, if (for example) it is simply a way to facilitate

coordination of care. In this case, integration would not change incentives for skimping

or cost containment, and should therefore not be a factor in determining the optimal cost-

sharing rule.

        Despite the importance of this question, little research has examined the

relationship between hospital integration and Medicare reimbursement policy. In this

paper, we evaluate the effects of a change in such policy on health spending and the

quality of care. In 1997, Congress adopted prospective payment for skilled nursing

facilities (SNF PPS), under which SNFs are paid a largely fixed amount per patient per

day based on the patient's anticipated resource use.3 Prior to this change, Medicare


2
  Before 1997, acute-care hospitals were reimbursed under a prospective payment system and post-acute
facilities under a cost-plus system, which creates an opportunity for profit from shifting care
inappropriately from the acute to the post-acute setting.
3
  Congress later adopted prospective payment for other forms of post-acute care.


                                                                                                        3
reimbursed SNFs on the basis of their costs. This change therefore led to decreased cost-

sharing for both stand-alone SNFs and those that were integrated with an acute-care

hospital.4

        We analyze the Medicare spending and health outcomes of all elderly patients

admitted to an acute-care hospital with stroke in 1997, 1998, and 1999. Rehabilitation

services provided by SNFs are frequently, but not always, indicated for patients who are

hospitalized with this disease (Gropen et al. 2009).

        We compare the pre/post-SNF-PPS change in the spending on and the health

outcomes of an episode of illness in geographic areas with a high versus a low level of

hospital/SNF integration. We hold constant the characteristics of patients, hospitals,

geographic markets, and other aspects of Medicare reimbursement policy that were

changing over our study period, including area-level measures of the generosity of

Medicare for both hospital and SNF services. This enables us to assess whether

enhanced incentives for cost containment have different effects on spending and health

outcomes, depending on the extent of vertical integration.

        The paper proceeds in five sections. Section I outlines the previous research on

the role of vertical integration in markets for health care, with a focus on strategic uses of

integration in a principal/agent context. Sections II and III present our data and models.

Section IV presents our results, and Section V concludes with an exploration of potential

implications for Medicare policy and contracting more generally.




4
  We describe SNF PPS as leading to decreased cost-sharing, rather than no cost-sharing, because it still
allowed for cost-plus reimbursement on some margins such as the number of days in the SNF and certain
therapy services (White 2005/6).


                                                                                                            4
I.     Previous Literature

       Conventional models of the boundaries of the firm explain how vertical

integration in markets for health services can enhance efficiency. Common ownership of

each part of the "supply chain" involved in caring for patients who need hospital services,

for example, can facilitate coordination of care, address incomplete contracting problems,

and otherwise reduce transaction costs (Robinson 1996).

       More recent models explore how vertical integration can inhibit competition.

Several papers demonstrate how vertical relationships can confer market power if there

are barriers to entry (e.g, Riordan and Salop 1995; Bernheim and Whinston 1998). Gal-

Or (1999) applies these concepts to a model of bargaining between hospitals, physicians,

and managed care plans. Empirical papers reach opposing conclusions about the

applicability of these models to markets for hospital services. Using data from Arizona,

Florida, and Wisconsin for 1994-1998, Cuellar and Gertler (2006) examine whether

hospitals that are integrated with their physicians have different accounting costs per

patient, adjusted charges per patient, and quality of care than hospitals that are not. They

find no systematic effects of integration on costs or quality of care, but a positive effect

of integration on charges. However, using data from California for 1994-2001, Ciliberto

and Dranove (2006) find no systematic effects of integration on charges per patient.

       Fewer papers model how vertical integration affects the principal/agent

relationship between providers and insurers and the associated tradeoff between cost

containment and skimping that is at the heart of reimbursement policy design. Pauly

(1979) explains one reason why this may be important: integration allows providers, at

least implicitly, to pay one another for referrals. Providers sell not only treatments




                                                                                               5
themselves, but also advice about what treatments to obtain. Because providers may not

act as perfect agents for patients or their insurers, allowing providers to make and receive

payments for referrals may lead to medically unnecessary health spending (e.g.,

Afendulis and Kessler 2007). To the extent that this occurs, giving integrated providers

more powerful incentives for cost containment could limit spending and improve

efficiency.5

         Vertical integration may affect the principal/agent relationship in other ways.

Integration may make it more difficult for Medicare to monitor the quality of service

provided by individual entities, or may enhance the ability of hospitals and/or post-acute

care facilities to manage their physicians for the facilities' financial benefit. These sorts

of effects are consistent with models such as Laffont and Martimort (1997) and Baron

and Besanko (1999), which show how vertical integration can be used to alter the

information structure in a more general principal/agent context. To the extent that this

occurs, giving integrated providers less powerful incentives for cost containment could be

optimal.

         One recent empirical paper suggests that integration by hospitals may be

facilitating payments for referrals.        Using data from Florida and New York from 1994-

2002, Nakamura, Capps, and Dranove (2007) find that large tertiary care hospitals that

acquire community hospitals increase their referrals, particularly among patients

undergoing more profitable procedures and with more generous insurance. However,



5
  The canonical concern is that payments for referrals may induce providers to recommend more profitable
treatments even if they are not in patients' interest. However, even if payments for referrals induce
referring providers to give more efficient advice (by allowing them to capture gains from referring patients
who would be better served by someone else), it might still be optimal to offer integrated providers more
powerful incentives for cost containment, if such incentives encourage providers to improve their division
of labor (e.g., Garicano and Santos 2004).


                                                                                                           6
although this work is informative, it can neither reject conventional transaction-cost

explanations for integration nor provide guidance to purchasers and policy-makers about

their optimal response to providers' decisions about organizational form.

       In this paper, we seek to fill this gap. We evaluate the consequences of SNF PPS

by examining the spending on and the health outcomes of elderly Medicare beneficiaries

admitted to an acute-care hospital with stroke. Our research design is essentially a

difference-in-difference (DD) framework: we compare spending before versus after SNF

PPS in geographic areas with a high versus a low level of SNF/hospital integration. We

examine not only spending overall, but also spending on SNF care and its substitutes --

rehabilitation hospital, outpatient, and home health spending (Gresham 1997). We also

examine an extensive set of patient health outcomes, including several measures found by

previous research to be specifically related to the quality of SNF care. Finally, to isolate

the effect of the interaction between payment incentives and vertical integration, we

control for an extensive set of patient, market, and reimbursement policy characteristics.

       Our paper also contributes to the health services literature on the effects of

reimbursement incentives on cost and quality in markets for health care. Most of this

work (e.g., DesHarnais et al. 1987; Newhouse and Byrne 1988; Ellis and McGuire 1990;

Cutler 1995; McClellan 1997) has focused on Medicare's 1983 adoption of a higher-

powered payment system for acute-care hospitals. Fewer papers have examined the

effects of SNF PPS. Banks, Parker, and Wendel (2001) present a theoretical model that

highlights the conditions under which SNF PPS will induce hospitals and SNFs to

combine their services efficiently. Konetzka, Norton, and Stearns (2006) find that the

shift to SNF PPS, holding constant the average level of reimbursement, increased the rate




                                                                                               7
of adverse health outcomes for SNF patients. White (2005/6) suggests that this result is

due, at least in part, to declines in nurse staffing in response to the change in

reimbursement policy. In contrast, Wodchis, Fries, and Hirth (2005) find that SNF PPS

reduced mortality for Medicare beneficiaries admitted to a SNF and had no significant

effect on rehospitalizations.



II.     Data

        We analyze the spending and health outcomes of all Medicare patients 65 years or

older who were admitted to an acute-care hospital in the years 1997, 1998, and 1999 with

stroke. Because BBA 1997 and SNF PPS were partially implemented in 1998 and fully

implemented by 1999, we can estimate the partial and full consequences of the policies

with our study period.

        We examine patients with a principal diagnosis of occlusive stroke with infarction

(ICD-9-CM 433.x1 or 434.x1) or transient cerebral ischemia (ICD-9-CM 435). We

found 672,973 such strokes for 1997-99. To ensure that we have complete claims records

for all patients, we restrict our sample to patients who were enrolled in fee-for-service

Medicare continuously for the 365 days preceding and the 365 days following their initial

admission in each calendar year. We also exclude beneficiaries admitted for a stroke in

the 12 months prior to the index event and beneficiaries residing outside the United

States. These exclusion restrictions left us with 507,350 observations.6

        We assess the consequences of integration for the following financial and health

outcomes Y: total spending (including all inpatient and outpatient hospital care, and

6
 Our analyses of total and home health spending are based on a 20% random sample of beneficiaries,
because home health spending (and therefore total spending) is only available for this subsample. All other
analyses are based on the 100% sample of 507,350.


                                                                                                         8
patient out-of-pocket spending and Medicare payments on the patient’s behalf); whether

the patient received treatment from a SNF, a rehabilitation hospital, an outpatient

hospital, and a home health agency; the amount of spending on SNF, rehabilitation

hospital, outpatient hospital, and home health agency care; whether the patient was

readmitted to an acute-care hospital in the 31-365 days after admission7; and 365-day all-

cause mortality. In addition, we also used the primary and secondary diagnosis fields in

each stay in the 31-365 days after the index event to code six rehospitalization measures

used to measure quality of care for patients admitted to a SNF: congestive heart failure,

anemia, electrolyte imbalance, respiratory infection, sepsis, and urinary tract infection.8

         To isolate the effect of the interaction between payment incentives and vertical

integration, we control for an extensive set of patient, market, and reimbursement policy

characteristics. Patient characteristics include: age (66-69, 70-74, 75-79, 80-84, 85 or

older), gender, and race; the 30 risk-adjustment variables described by Elixhauser et al.

(1998)9; and total Medicare inpatient spending in the 365 days prior to the index event

(reflecting both patient out-of-pocket spending and Medicare payments on the patient’s

behalf).

         We calculate several characteristics of the health care market in the patient's

geographic area in 1997, which we define as the 3-digit Zip Code around the patient's

residence (K = 860). We calculate the percentage of SNF beds integrated with a

hospital, V, in the patient’s area in 1997, before the change in Medicare reimbursement

readmissions in the month after initial admission because these may be part of the initial course of care.

policy. In addition, we calculate the following other characteristics Z in 1997: the

percentage of hospital beds by ownership status (for-profit, non-profit, government-

owned), facility size (100 beds or fewer, 101-500, more than 500), teaching status, and

system membership; the percentage of SNF beds by ownership status and facility size (25

or fewer, 26-50, more than 50); the number of SNF beds per population aged 66 or older;

and Herfindahl-Hirschman indices of hospital and SNF competition, as measured by the

number of hospital and SNF beds, respectively. Each of these characteristics in V and Z

is coded as 1 if the area level of the variable was above the nationwide hospital-bed-

weighted median for each underlying measure, 0 otherwise.

       Finally, we calculate area-level measures of the generosity of Medicare

reimbursement for both hospital and SNF services G for each year from 1997-99.

Controlling for generosity is important in assessing the effects of the shift to higher-

powered payment incentives in BBA 1997. Several researchers (e.g., White 2005/6) have

pointed out that BBA 1997 affected both the level of reimbursement on average as well

its responsiveness to costs, and both of these parameters may affect the cost and quality

of care. The details behind the calculation of G are described in Appendix A.

       Table 1 presents descriptive statistics for the population of elderly beneficiaries

that we analyze for 1997 and 1999, and previews the results of our analysis. The top

panel of the table presents descriptive statistics on spending in the year after admission

for stroke; the second panel, on health outcomes; and the third panel, on spending in the

year prior to the index event. The table reports the expenditures, background

characteristics, and health outcomes of patients in two types of areas -- areas with a high




                                                                                             10
level of integration between hospitals and SNFs (V = 1) and areas with a low level of

integration (V = 0).

       The first row of the top panel shows that total spending declined nationwide for

this population from 1997-1999, but that it declined more for patients living in areas with

a high level of hospital/SNF integration. In the 365 days following admission, spending

in more-integrated areas declined by 11 percent, whereas spending in less-integrated

areas declined by 6.1 percent; SNF PPS thus reduced spending in integrated areas by an

additional 4.9 percent. The differential decline was particularly pronounced for spending

on SNF services, where SNF PPS should have had the greatest effect. In addition, there

were no offsetting increases on spending on other forms of post-acute care that might

serve as a substitute for SNF services, such as rehabilitation hospitals, outpatient

facilities, or home health.

       The second panel shows that there are no major trends in health outcomes for

stroke over our study period, in either in absolute terms or differentially across areas. A

substantial share of patients were readmitted to the hospital (approximately 42 percent),

but the pre-/post-PPS difference was at most 0.2 percentage points, or one-half of one

percent. Among the six outcomes highlighted by Kramer et al. (2007) as being specific

measures of the quality of SNF care, the differential trends in outcomes are even smaller.

Mortality in high integration areas increased more than mortality in low integration areas

(0.2 percentage points), but this too amounts to a relatively small change on a base of

approximately 16 percentage points.

       The third panel presents patients' average spending on acute-care hospital services

in the year prior to the index event, as a summary measure of patients' health status on




                                                                                           11
admission. Although this measure is much coarser than the detailed controls for health

status that we ultimately use in estimation, it suggests that the differences in trends in

spending reported in the top panel are not due to differences patient health status between

high and low integration areas. If anything, patients in high integration areas had slightly

greater growth in their year-prior-to-index-event hospital spending (0.9 percent as

compared to -0.1 percent).

       The simple differences in trends in spending in the year after onset of illness,

along with a lack of difference in outcome trends, suggest that increasing incentives for

cost containment is an optimal response to vertical integration between hospitals and

SNFs. When Medicare shifted to a higher-powered reimbursement scheme for SNFs,

SNF spending on patients from high integration areas declined more than spending on

patients from low integration areas. The trends in spending were not accompanied by

any trend in health outcomes, suggesting that the medical productivity of the eliminated

services were low. It also suggests that such integration is a strategic decision to

facilitate payment for referrals. If integration were solely a means to reduce transaction

costs, there would be no reason to expect SNF PPS to have different effects in high

versus low integration areas. Of course, these conclusions are only speculative, since the

descriptive statistics presented above do not comprehensively control for the

characteristics of patients, hospital and SNF market areas, and other changes in

reimbursement policy that occurred over our study period. In the following section, we

formalize the intuition behind these differences and state the assumptions that are

necessary to test our hypothesis.




                                                                                             12
III.     Model

         In each 3-digit Zip Code k = 1, …, K during t = 1997, 1998 , 1999, we examine

the spending on and quality of care of each elderly fee-for-service Medicare beneficiary i

= 1, …, Nkt who was admitted to an acute-care hospital with stroke. We estimate how the

spending on treatment and health outcomes of each patient, Yikt, differed in areas with and

without significant vertical integration between hospitals and SNFs, Vk. We also estimate

how this difference changed contemporaneous with adoption of SNF PPS. In addition to

each patient's financial and health outcomes, we also observe each patient's personal

characteristics Xikt, hospital and SNF market characteristics Zk, and generosity of

Medicare reimbursement for acute-care and SNF services Gkt.

         Our regression models specify Yikt as a function of time fixed effects θt, Xikt, Gkt,

Zk, and Vk; interactions between Gkt and Vk; interactions between θt and Zk,Vk; and an

error term εikt:10

         Yikt = θt + Xiktβ + Gktγ + Zkφ + Vkδ + (Gkt × Vk)γV + ZkθtZ + VkθtV + εikt.                    (1)

In this model, the coefficient of interest is θtV, the differential 1997-99 growth rate of

medical spending or health outcomes in a geographic area with a high versus a low

density of vertical integration.


10
  For two reasons, we model Yikt as a function of 1997 area-level measures of hospital characteristics Zk
and Vk, rather than contemporaneous individual-level measures Zikt and Vikt. We use area-level rather than
individual-level measures to eliminate omitted variable bias due to patient selection of hospitals. Omitted
variable bias arises in this context because patients choose hospitals on the basis of their health status;
health status is not fully observable; and the unobservable dimensions of health also affect skilled-nursing
spending. As a result, OLS estimates of the effect of individual patients' hospital characteristics are in
general inconsistent. (Consistent estimates of the effect of hospital characteristics can be obtained using
area-level measures as instruments, but this approach requires the additional assumption that area-level
measures have no effect on spending, except through their impact on patients' hospital choice, which may
be incorrect.) We use 1997 (baseline) measures instead of contemporaneous measures to eliminate
simultaneity bias due to hospital responses to SNF PPS. Simultaneity bias arises in this context because
hospitals may seek to change their organizational form in response to changes in Medicare reimbursement
policy. As a result, OLS estimates of the effect of contemporaneous measures of hospital markets may be
inconsistent.


                                                                                                          13
       Interpreting estimates of θtV as evidence of an interaction between more powerful

incentives for cost containment and vertical integration requires three important

assumptions. First, it requires the assumption that the residual difference in 1997-99

trends between high and low integration areas is attributable to SNF PPS. Over our brief

study period, SNF PPS was the only important change to the market for skilled nursing

care, and SNF PPS had two effects: to decrease the responsiveness of reimbursement to

costs, and to decrease the overall level of reimbursement. We control for Gkt and the

interactions between Gkt and Vk to make this assumption as plausible as possible.

Although it is certainly possible that other, longer-term changes to health care markets

were occurring at this time, we do not know of any that we would expect to have affected

SNF spending on elderly Medicare beneficiaries differently in integrated and

nonintegrated areas. Second, it requires the assumption that we have modeled all of the

other differences across areas that might have mediated the effects of the changes in

reimbursement policy imposed by BBA 1997. We control for the interactions of other

hospital market characteristics Zk with θt to make this assumption as plausible as possible.

Third, it requires the assumption that there are no differential changes across areas in the

unobserved characteristics or health status of patients. We control for the demographic

characteristics and diagnoses of patients at their index admission, and for their diagnoses

and inpatient spending in the year prior to admission, to make this assumption as

plausible as possible.



IV.    Results




                                                                                           14
       Table 2 presents estimates of θt, δ, and θtV from equation (1), using various

measures of health spending as the dependent variable Yikt. The reported standard errors

allow for arbitrary clustering of εikt within a 3-digit Zip Code k. Column (1) of the table

contains the paper's key results. The first two rows present estimates of θt, which capture

the baseline trend in spending, holding constant individual, market, and reimbursement

policy characteristics. These estimates are statistically insignificant, which suggests that

our controls for Gkt are capturing the decreasing generosity of reimbursement of SNF

PPS that other researchers have documented. The level of overall spending in high

integration areas also does not differ significantly from that in low integration areas.

However, by 1999, the payment reforms in BBA 1997 had phased in for most providers

and transformed Medicare reimbursement for SNF care. Concurrent with this was a

statistically significant negative integrated-area spending differential, θtV , of 5.2 percent

(standard error 2.2).

       As the table indicates, this estimate was obtained on a 20 percent random sample

of 101,137 patients rather than on the full population of 505,076 patients because home

health spending data are only available for the 20 percent random sample. To verify that

our finding is not due to an anomaly of the 20 percent sample, we also estimated the

model on the 100 percent sample, using as the dependent variable total spending net of

home health. Results from this model are virtually the same. The baseline trend in

spending was statistically insignificantly negative; the level of overall spending in high

integration areas does not differ significantly from that in low integration areas; and the

estimate of θtV was -4.1 percent (standard error 1.6).




                                                                                             15
        The remaining columns of table 2 report estimates of θt, δ, and θtV on selected

components of spending. Column (2) shows that the probability of any SNF spending

declined by 1.2 percentage points more in integrated areas; the column (3) shows that the

level of SNF spending, conditional on a SNF admission, also declined, by 5.3 percent.

Columns (4) - (7) show that the decline in SNF utilization was accompanied by some

offsetting increases in rehabilitation and outpatient utilization. Patients in more-

integrated areas were 1.2 percentage points more likely to be admitted to a rehabilitation

hospital (although, conditional on admission, spent 7.4 percent less (columns (4) - (5)),

and 1.1 percentage points more likely to have an outpatient visit (although only

marginally statistically significant, column (6)). There is no evidence of offsetting

spending on home health; in fact, patients in high integration areas had 8.1 percent slower

growth in home health spending (although only marginally statistically significant,

column (9)).

        Table 3 presents estimates of θt, δ, and θtV from equation (1), using various

measures of health outcomes as the dependent variable. The table shows that there is no

evidence of adverse effects on health outcomes of the increasing incentives for cost

containment associated with SNF PPS. For no measure is the baseline 1997-99 trend

positive and statistically significant; for mortality, the baseline trend is negative and

marginally statistically significant, consistent with Wodchis, Fries, and Hirth (2005).

There is also no evidence of a greater incidence of adverse outcomes in high versus low

integration areas. For no measure is the difference in trend in adverse outcomes

statistically significant, either positive or negative.




                                                                                            16
       Regardless of the statistical significance of the interaction between PPS and

integration on outcomes, differences in trends in outcomes between high and low

integration areas are very small and precisely estimated. Estimated coefficients on θtV are

at most two-tenths of one percentage point with standard errors of approximately the

same magnitude. This underscores that the additional services supplied in high

integration areas before BBA 1997 had very minimal benefits for patient health.



V.     Conclusion

       Typically, economic models assume that vertical integration is either driven by a

desire to minimize transaction costs or a desire to foreclose competition. In markets for

health services, sellers may have another reason to integrate: to enable them to pay one

another for referrals. Payments for referrals are banned for Medicare and Medicaid

patients, and either banned or highly restricted for patients covered by private insurance.

However, if the integrating parties share fixed assets, then common ownership can

circumvent these controls through creative cost accounting.

       If vertical integration is used to make payments for referrals, its implications for

optimal reimbursement policy are theoretically ambiguous. If integration enhances

incentives to supply unnecessary treatment, then giving integrated providers higher-

powered incentives for cost containment could reduce health spending without harming

patient health outcomes. But if integration enhances incentives for skimping on care,

then optimal policy should offer integrated providers greater opportunities for cost

sharing.




                                                                                          17
       In this paper, we investigate the extent to which the implementation of a higher-

powered, prospective payment system for skilled nursing care (SNF PPS) affected the

consequences of integration between hospitals and skilled nursing facilities. We examine

the health spending and health outcomes of elderly patients admitted to the hospital with

a stroke, an illness for which skilled nursing care is sometimes (although not always)

medically indicated. Our research design is essentially a difference-in-difference

framework that compares areas with high versus low levels of integration between

hospitals and SNFs before versus after Medicare adopted SNF PPS, holding the other

characteristics of areas constant.

       We find that SNF PPS reduced spending more in high integration areas. Holding

constant the generosity of reimbursement, other market characteristics, and the

characteristics of patients, integrated areas showed greater declines in SNF spending

when Medicare shifted to a higher-powered reimbursement mechanism. Declines in

spending were statistically significant and economically important, approximately 5

percent of the total costs of care for patients with stroke, or $1,000. There is no evidence

that these declines were due to changes in the observable characteristics of patients, and

no evidence that they were accompanied by changes in health outcomes. There is also no

evidence that SNF PPS harmed patients in low integration areas. Our findings therefore

suggest that it may be optimal for integrated providers to face higher-powered

reimbursement incentives, i.e., less cost-sharing, than their stand-alone counterparts.

Given that there are approximately 170,000 elderly beneficiaries with this illness

admitted to the hospital every year, we estimate that SNF PPS saved $170 million in this

population alone.




                                                                                          18
       Our analysis has several limitations. Most significantly, it depends on the

assumption that the residual difference in 1997-99 trends between integrated and non-

integrated areas is attributable to Medicare's shift to higher-powered payment incentives.

To make this assumption as plausible as possible, we hold constant the detailed patient

characteristics, several variables measuring market conditions, and the generosity of

payment. The fact that our regression estimates are very close to and not statistically

distinguishable from simple differences in mean trends gives us confidence in the validity

of this assumption, because unobservables are generally correlated with observables. In

addition, our finding of no effect on health outcomes should be interpreted cautiously

because of the coarseness of our measures. For example, our analysis fails to account for

benefits such as faster or more complete rehabilitation, to the extent they are not captured

by claims data; for patients with stroke, these benefits may be important.

       Yet, our findings do suggest that purchasers of health services (or other services

subject to agency problems) should consider the organizational form of their suppliers

when choosing a reimbursement mechanism. Even if integration among suppliers of

complementary inputs does reduce transaction costs, it may be second-best optimal for a

purchaser to offer integrated suppliers a higher-powered payment regime. Future

research might investigate more generally the extent to which incentives in

reimbursement and contracting can be used to induce agents with private information to

choose their organizational form to enhance overall efficiency.

Appendix A: Construction of Generosity Measures

For each ZIP3, we calculated measures of Medicare payment generosity for hospitals and
SNFs.

For hospital generosity, we started with claims data for all PPS hospital stays from 1997-
1999. We used charge data from these claims records and cost-to-charge ratios from the
hospital cost reports to deflate hospital charges to costs. Using PPS hospital stays from
1996-1999, we constructed year prior Elixhauser risk adjustment measures and PPS
hospital expenditure measures associated with each admission in 1997-1999. Using
Medicare enrollment data, we excluded stays for patients who were younger than 66 at
admission, or did not reside in the 50 states or the District of Columbia. We then ran the
following two regressions:

exp enditure  black  female  prior _ exp  A  R  Z  
cos t  black  female  prior _ exp A  R  Z  

The regressions were run separately for each year. The dependent variables are the
expenditure and cost associated with the stay, respectively. The independent variables
are a Black/non-Black indicator, a female/male indicator, a measure of hospital spending
in the year prior to admission, age dummies (66-69, 70-74, 75-79, 80-84, 85-plus), risk
adjustment indicators, and ZIP3 dummies. We then used the regression results to predict
expenditure and cost holding constant the demographic and health characteristics of
patients at their 1997 levels:

Ê y ,z  X 1997 ,z  yE
Ĉ y ,z  X 1997 ,z  yC

Our SNF generosity measures were constructed in an analogous way.
