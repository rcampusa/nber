The empirical analysis in "International R&D Spillovers" (Coe and Helpman, 1995) is first revisited
by applying modern panel cointegration estimation techniques to an expanded data set that we have
constructed for the purpose of this study. The new estimates confirm the key results reported in Coe
and Helpman about the impact of domestic and foreign R&D capital stocks on TFP. In addition, we
show that domestic and foreign R&D capital stocks have measurable impacts on TFP even after controlling
for the impact of human capital. Furthermore, we extend the analysis to include institutional variables,
such as legal origin and patent protection, in order to allow for parameter heterogeneity based on a
country’s institutional characteristics. The results suggest that institutional differences are important
determinants of total factor productivity and that they impact the degree of R&D spillovers.

1. Introduction

The importance of international R&D spillovers has long been recognized, although
estimates of their empirical significance at the macroeconomic level were often elusive. The
search for R&D spillovers across countries received a boost in the 1990s with the
development of new growth models by Romer (1990), Grossman and Helpman (1991), and
Aghion and Howitt (1992), and by the application of the ideas from these models together
with new empirical techniques to expanded data sets by Coe and Helpman (1995) and Coe,
Helpman, and Hoffmaister (1997). The then-new endogenous growth models focused on
commercially-oriented innovation efforts by profit-seeking firms as a major engine of
technological progress and productivity growth, in contrast to the exogenous treatment of
technological progress in neoclassical theory.1

In “International R&D Spillovers,” Coe and Helpman (1995) (hereafter CH) presented new
estimates of R&D spillovers. Whereas many earlier studies of R&D spillovers had been
based on sectoral or industry data for single countries,2 CH used pooled macroeconomic data
for 21 OECD countries plus Israel over the 1971-90 time period. They estimated equations
explaining a country’s total factor productivity (TFP) as a function of the domestic R&D
capital stock and a measure of the foreign R&D capital stock, where all the measures of
R&D capital were constructed from the business sectors’ R&D activities. While equations
relating output or TFP to the domestic R&D capital stock had been estimated previously, the
extension to include an explicit measure of the foreign R&D capital stock was new. In
another innovation, CH focused their estimation on long-run relationships, taking advantage
of the attractive econometric properties of cointegrated equations. This was one of the early
empirical studies to estimate panel cointegrating equations, despite the fact that, at that time,
“the econometrics of pooled cointegration [were] not yet fully worked out” (CH, 1995, p.
870).

“International R&D Spillovers” inspired a large number of empirical studies, which can be
grouped into three broad categories: studies addressing the appropriate definition of the
foreign R&D capital stock, studies proposing additional determinants of TFP, and studies
proposing alternative econometric techniques. Keller (2004) reviews a large part of this
literature. To place the current paper in context, however, we briefly discuss some of the
empirical studies based on panel estimates at the aggregate level.

For each of the 22 countries in their sample, CH defined a foreign R&D capital stock as the
weighted average of the country’s 21 trading partners’ domestic R&D capital stocks, using
bilateral import shares as weights. Subsequent papers proposed a number of alternative
definitions of the foreign R&D capital stock, based on different methods for aggregating

    For example, the studies reviewed by Griliches (1992) are for agriculture or industry.

trading partners’ domestic R&D capital stocks into a foreign R&D capital stock. The main
differences between these methods is in the weights applied to foreign R&D capital stocks.
These include equal weights (Keller, 1998),3 weights based on bilateral export shares (Funk,
2001), weights based on the fraction of trading partners’ output exported to the recipient
country (Lichtenberg and van Pottelsberghe de la Potterie, 1998), weights based on inward
and outward FDI flows (van Pottelsberghe de la Potterie and Lichtenberg, 2001) and stocks
(Zhu and Jeon, 2007), weights based on the bilateral technological proximity between
countries (Park, 1995; Guellec and van Pottelsberghe de la Potterie, 2004), weights based on
indirect trade (Lumenga-Neso et al., 2005), and weights based on information technology
(Zhu and Jeon, 2007).

Keller (1998) and Coe and Hoffmaister (1999) demonstrated that a measure of foreign R&D
capital defined as a simple average of trading partners’ domestic R&D capital stocks
performed about the same as the definition using bilateral import weights. Lichtenberg and
van Pottelsberghe de la Potterie (1998) argued that CH’s weighting scheme is subject to an
aggregation bias, in that a merger between countries would always increase the stock of
foreign R&D capital, and showed that a measure based on the fraction of bilateral trading
partners’ output exported to the recipient country yielded somewhat better results than the
measure used in CH.4 Funk (2001) presented results, using newly developed panel estimation
techniques, showing that a definition of foreign R&D capital based on bilateral export shares
performed better than CH’s definition, suggesting the importance of R&D spillovers
emanating from exporters’ customers. More recently, Lee (2006) has shown, based on a
different data set and modern panel cointegration techniques, that a definition of foreign
R&D capital based on inward FDI or bilateral technological proximity do a better jobs than
other definitions.

A number of other studies have focused on various explanatory variables in addition to the
domestic and foreign R&D capital stocks. Determinants of TFP that have been shown to be
significant, cointegrated, or to improve explanatory power, include human capital
(Engelbrecht, 1997; Khan and Luintel, 2006), the import share (Coe and Hoffmaister, 1999;

3
  Keller (1998) proported to show that a foreign R&D capital stock defined with “random” weights, which he
noted were similar to equal weights, explained TFP developments as well or better than CH’s bilateral import
weights. Coe and Hoffmaister (1999) demonstrated analytically in the case of two trading partners and
numerically for n trading partners that Keller’s weights are essentially simple averages with a random error.
Coe and Hoffmaister (1999) also showed that when three alternative sets of random weights are used to
construct foreign R&D capital stocks, the estimated spillover elasticities are extremely small and the estimated
equations explain less of the variation in TFP than if CH’s original definition based on bilateral import shares,
as would be expected if truly random weights were used.
4
  Lichtenberg and van Pottelsberghe de la Potterie (1998) also correctly pointed out that CH’s indexation of the
R&D capital stocks was problematic in CH’s specification where the foreign R&D capital stock was interacted
with the import share. Coe and Hoffmaister (1999) showed that correcting this has little effect on the estimated
coefficients.

Edmond, 2001), productivity catch-up (Engelbrecht, 1997), measures of government funded
R&D and the business cycle (Guellec and van Pottelsberghe de la Potterie, 2004), and
infrastructure and stocks of inward and outward FDI (Khan and Luintel, 2006).

With advances in the econometrics of panel cointegration, a number of studies applied new
techniques that were not available at the time of CH’s research. Kao et al. (1999), for
example, re-examined the econometric foundations of CH’s results using newly developed
techniques.5 Although a number of Kao et al.’s (1999) estimates generally confirmed the
results in CH, their dynamic OLS estimates, which they considered to be superior to the other
estimation techniques, indicated that the estimated coefficients on the foreign R&D capital
stock were insignificant. A number of other studies based on panel cointegration techniques
found that TFP was cointegrated with domestic and foreign R&D capital, although the latter
was often defined in one of the alternative ways discussed above (Lichtenberg and van
Pottelsberghe de la Potterie, 1998; Edmond, 2001; Funk, 2001; Guellec and van
Pottelsberghe de la Potterie, 2004; and Lee, 2006).

Panel cointegration techniques are particularly well suited for the study of the impact of
R&D capital on total factor productivity for a number of reasons. One is the focus on the
long-run relationships, which would be obscured if, for example, the equations were
estimated on first differences rather than on the levels of variables. A second is the increased
power that comes from exploiting commonalities across countries, given the limited number
of time-series observations. A third, important reason is that, under cointegration, parameter
estimates are super consistent, and hence are robust to problems such as omitted variables,
simultaneity, and endogeneity.6 Thus, using panel cointegration techniques to estimate the
long-run effect of domestic and foreign R&D capital on TFP overcomes the endogeneity
problem, thereby avoiding the difficult task of finding valid instruments for R&D capital,
which would be necessary if the focus was on the short-run relationship.

Estimating R&D spillovers on a pooled dataset highlighted the issue of heterogeneity in
parameter estimates. CH incorporated some heterogeneity in their pooled estimates by
estimating separate elasticities of TFP with respect to domestic R&D capital for the G7 and
for the smaller countries and by including fixed effects (i.e., country-specific constants). In
addition, heterogeneity in the effect of foreign R&D on TFP was introduced by interacting
the foreign R&D capital stock with the import share. In contrast to pooled estimates, which
generally assume homogeneity of parameter estimates, group mean estimates average single
country (i.e., time-series) estimates, thereby allowing for full heterogeneity. Edmond (2001)
applied group mean estimates to the CH data set and found that TFP was cointegrated with
domestic and foreign R&D capital if the latter was defined as a simple sum of trading
partners’ R&D capital stocks, but not if it was defined with bilateral import shares as in CH.

Luintel and Khan (2004), based on a different sample, conclude that pooling was not valid,
although they did find cointegration between TFP and domestic and foreign R&D capital.
Khan and Luintel (2006), on the other hand, addressed heterogeneity in their pooled
estimates by interacting both domestic and foreign R&D capital stocks with a variety of other
determinants of productivity.

The purposes of this paper are twofold. The first is to revisit the empirical analysis in CH
using a data set updated to 2004 and expanded to 24 countries, and applying panel
cointegration estimation techniques not available in the early 1990s. We find that the
estimates based on the new data set and using modern econometric techniques give broadly
similar results as those reported in CH. There is, moreover, robust evidence of cointegration
between total factor productivity, domestic R&D capital, foreign R&D capital based on a
number of definitions, and a measure of human capital. Measures of foreign R&D capital
incorporating information about bilateral imports, such as those used by CH and Lichtenberg
and van Pottelsberghe de la Potterie (1998), perform better than a measure based on equal
weights. These results are obtained using either dynamic OLS on the pooled data or using
dynamic OLS group mean estimates.

The second aim of the paper is to expand the empirical analysis to examine the impact of
institutional factors that are now viewed as important determinants of economic growth. In
particular, we study the impact of these institutions on the degree of R&D spillovers and the
contribution of domestic R&D capital to TFP, thereby allowing for heterogeneity in
parameter estimates. The paper thus contributes to the broader growth literature emphasizing
the importance of institutions for economic growth.7 We find evidence that countries where
the ease of doing business and the quality of tertiary education systems are relatively high
tend to benefit more from their own R&D efforts, from international R&D spillovers, and
from human capital formation. We also find that strong patent protection is associated with
higher levels of total factor productivity, higher returns to domestic R&D, and larger
international R&D spillovers. Finally, we find evidence that the origins of a country’s legal
system also has an influence on the extent to which it benefits from its own and foreign
R&D.

The next two sections summarize the key features of our data and present a brief overview of
the econometric techniques of panel cointegration. Section 4 revisits the empirical analysis in
CH and addresses some of the issues raised in the subsequent literature. Section 5 presents
evidence on the importance of institutions for the effectiveness of domestic R&D and the
extent of international R&D spillovers. Section 6 concludes.

2. Data

The database used in CH, which covered the period 1971-90, has been reconstituted with
revised data and updated to 2004.8 The increase in the time-series dimension from 20 to 34
annual observations is important in the context of our cointegration analysis focusing on
long-run relationships. The database has also been expanded to include Korea and Iceland,
which brings a welcome increase in the cross-country variance in the data. Summary
statistics for the data are presented in Table 1 and data for selected countries are shown in
Figures 1-5. A brief description of the main features of the data follows; details about data
sources and definitions are provided in an annex.

exhibits a positive trend, as illustrated in
Figure 1 for a selection of countries.

Compared with the rise in TFP, the increase in domestic R&D capital stocks (Sd), measured
in constant dollars for the business sector, was much larger and much more variable across
countries. Starting from very low levels in 1971, R&D capital in Iceland and Korea increased
sharply in the following 3½ decades, as it did, albeit to a much smaller extent, in Greece,
Israel, and Spain; in all of these countries
there is a clear deceleration in domestic                   Figure 2. Domestic R&D Capital Stocks

stocks display a clear, monotonic upward
trend, as shown in Figure 2.

Not surprisingly, increases in foreign R&D capital stocks (Sf-biw) are much more uniform
across countries. This uniformity reflects (i) their construction as the bilateral-import
weighted average of each countries’ 23 trading partners’ domestic R&D capital stocks, and
(ii) the fact that the countries where increases in domestic R&D capital stocks were unusually
large are also countries were bilateral import weights tend to be relatively small. The United
States’ foreign R&D capital stock increased the most, reflecting the fact that all other
countries’ foreign R&D capital includes the U.S. domestic R&D capital stock, often with
relatively large weights, which increased relatively little in percentage terms. Similar factors
explain why foreign R&D capital increased relatively little in Japan, Spain, and a number of
continental European countries. The increase in foreign R&D capital is relatively smooth

3. Econometric Preliminaries

Panel cointegration techniques have become increasingly popular for a number of reasons.
As with time series cointegration, estimates from a cointegrated panel are robust to a variety
of problems that often plague empirical work, including endogeneity, omitted variables, and
measurement error (Banerjee, 1999; Phillips and Moon, 2000; and Baltagi and Kao, 2000).
Moreover, panel cointegration techniques can be implemented with shorter data spans than
their time series counterparts and statistical inference is simplified because limiting
distributions are standard normal.9

Before estimating the long-run cointegrating relationships, the relevant variables are pre-
tested for unit roots and cointegration. We use so-called second-generation panel unit root
tests, which are analogous to time-series augmented Dickey-Fuller tests. These tests allow for
heterogeneous dynamics and include tests proposed by
                                                                        Table 2. Panel Unit Root Tests

A number of panel cointegration tests have been proposed, analogous to time series
cointegration tests (Pedroni, 2004).10 The null hypothesis is that all of the countries in the

  This paper refers to panel cointegration as a stable long-run relation between the dependent variable and the
independent variables in countries in a panel. This concept is distinct from cross-member cointegration whereby
the dependent variable in one country is cointegrated with the dependent variable of another country in the
panel (Evans, 1998).
10
   These differ from panel unit root tests due to the estimated regressor effect (Pedroni, 1999); panel
cointegration tests coincide with residual-based panel unit root tests when cointegrating vectors are identical for
all panel members and regressors are exogenous (Pedroni, 1995).


                                                        8
panel are not cointegrated; the alternative hypothesis is that all countries are cointegrated.11
Similar to panel unit tests, panel cointegration tests come in two varieties: pooled (within
dimension) tests and group mean tests. Monte Carlo simulations suggest that, while both
varieties are conservative—rejecting the null hypothesis less than expected by the marginal
significance level—at sample sizes such as the one in this study, pooled tests are less so. The
degree of size distortion also depends on the specific test used, with t-type statistics being
less conservative than rho-type statistics. Both tests are one-sided.

Panel cointegration tests corresponding to the panel analogues of the time series rho-statistic,
t-statistic, and the ADF tests—Phillips and Perron (1988), Phillips and Ouliaris (1990), and
Dickey and Fuller (1979)—are reported in Table 3. In the first two sets of panel unit root
tests, pooled PP-rho tests reject the null hypothesis when the various measures of logSf are
interacted with m but not when logSf is included alone. When logH is added, however, the
interaction with m is not required for cointegration. The same holds for the last two sets of
tests when the variables are extended to also include logPP. Regardless of the number of
variables included in the tests, evidence of cointegration is found for both pooled and group
mean tests. Taken together, cointegration typically requires including the interaction of m and
logSf, and thus these models form the basis for the empirical results reported below.12 These

   This assumption follows previous empirical work that assumes that R&D spillovers extend to all countries. If
the data generating process does not imply that all countries cointegrate, then the alternative hypothesis would
be that a substantial number of countries cointegrate.

results also suggest stable long-run relations can be estimated using either pooled or group
mean estimation techniques.

In the following sections, we use pooled and group mean dynamic OLS (Kao and Chiang,
2000; Pedroni, 2001) to estimate long-run relationships. These single-equation methods
extend to panel data the time-series dynamic OLS (DOLS) estimates proposed by Stock and
Watson (1993).13 Panel DOLS is fully parametric in their treatment of endogeneity and
autocorrelation and, just as their time-series analogues, are asymptotically equivalent to full
information maximum likelihood estimators. In pooled samples, Kao and Chiang (2000)
found that panel DOLS have less size distortion than fully modified OLS for panels proposed
by Pedroni (2000).

4. “International R&D Spillovers” Revisited

Grossman and Helpman (1991) provide theoretical underpinnings for the empirical
specifications used below with the aid of two canonic models of endogenous growth: the love
of variety approach due to Romer (1990) and the quality ladders approach due to Grossman
and Helpman (1991) and Aghion and Howitt (1992). In the love of variety approach an
expansion of the range of available inputs raises total factor productivity, and investment in
the development of new inputs raises the stock of knowledge, which reduces future R&D
costs. As a result, there are spillovers from current R&D to future R&D activities. In an
international context these spillovers cross national boarders, implying that R&D of one
country impacts not only the future R&D costs of domestic firms, but also the future R&D
costs of foreign firms. The extent to which foreign firms benefit from these spillovers may
depend on the economic relations between the countries, such as the volume of their bilateral
trade or the characteristics of the traded products.

In the quality ladders approach an improvement in the quality of an input raises its
productivity by a fixed proportional factor, which defines a rung size in the quality ladder. As
a result, today’s improvement of a product enables future innovators to begin their own
improvements from a higher quality level, and therefore contributes a larger absolute
addition to the quality of the input at comparable costs. Consequently there are R&D
spillovers. Naturally, these spillovers apply to all innovators who build on the quality of the
available products, domestic and foreign alike. The degree to which foreign innovators can
improve on a domestic product may depend, however, on the bilateral economic relations
between the countries, as in the case of expanding variety. Grossman and Helpman (1994)
discuss the application of these ideas to the construction of knowledge stocks, and argue that

13
  Single-equation methods assume that the model can be expressed in triangular form so that normalizing the
cointegration vector identifies the vector of interest. General vector error correction models (VECMs) with
multiple equations are typically not feasible with panel data given the large number of parameters. Although
restricted VECMs are feasible (Groen and Kleibergen, 2003), they are not used as often as the single-equation
methods used here.



                                                      10
empirically observed investment rates in R&D can generate observed levels of total
productivity growth in the United States. These insights guided the empirical specification in
Coe and Helpman (1995), which we also adopt below.

Coe and Helpman (1995) estimated three specifications. The simplest is,

         logFi = αi0 + αidlogSid + αiflogSif + εi ,                                                         (1)

where i is a country index, F is total factor productivity, Sd is the real domestic R&D capital
stock, Sf is the real foreign R&D capital stock, and ε is a well-defined error; time subscripts
have been omitted. A second specification allows the impact of domestic R&D to differ
between the largest seven economies and the others,

         logFi = αi0 + αidlogSid + αidG7G7∙logSid + αiflogSif + εi ,                                        (2)

where G7 is a dummy variable equal to one for the G7 countries and zero otherwise. The
third specification allows the impact of foreign R&D to vary with the level of imports by
interacting the import share with the foreign R&D capital stock,

         logFi = αi0 + αidlogSid + αidG7G7∙logSid + αifm mi∙logSif + εi ,                                   (3)

where m is the share of imports in GDP.

Table 4 presents panel estimates of the three specifications.14 The columns labeled CH report
the OLS estimation results reported in CH based on pooled data for 1971-90 for 22 countries
for each of the three specifications.15 After the CH columns, dynamic OLS estimation results
are reported using (i) the revised data for the same 1971-90 time period and for the same 22
countries, (ii) the updated data for 1971-2004 for the same 22 countries, and (iii) the updated
data expanded to 24 countries. As in CH, all equations include unreported fixed effects, and
foreign R&D capital is defined as a bilateral-import weighted average of trading partners
domestic R&D capital. The equations estimated on the updated and expanded data set are
cointegrated, as shown in Table 3.




14
   As noted, the data for Germany are for West Germany until 1990 and for unified Germany thereafter.
Excluding Germany makes virtually no difference compared with the reported estimation results, which include
Germany.
15
   CH did not report standard errors for the OLS coefficient estimates because they are biased and their
distribution is not asymptotically normal, although CH did note that the estimated standard errors were all small
relative to the coefficient estimates, with t-statistics of four or larger.

Notes: The dependent variable is log(total factor productivity ). Columns labelled CH are the OLS regression results
reported in Coe and Helpman (1995). T-statistics in italics below coefficient estimates.


Dynamic OLS estimates on the revised data for the same time period and countries give
broadly comparable results to those reported in CH. The estimated coefficients on logSd are
similar to those in CH, but the estimated coefficients on logSf-biw increase substantially in the
first two specifications. The coefficients on m∙logSf-biw in the third specification are not
comparable since Sf-biw was transformed into an index in CH, as discussed above, whereas
Sf-biw is not transformed in the new results reported here. Standard errors are smaller by a
factor of about 0.1, which mainly reflects that total factor productivity, the dependent
variable, is indexed on a more recent base year, implying that the mean of the dependent
variable is smaller in the updated data set than in CH. When the sample is extended to 2004
and to 24 countries, the main changes are that the estimated coefficients on G7∙logSd decline
sharply, becoming insignificant in the second specification when the sample is extended to
24 countries; the elasticities of TFP with respect to foreign R&D capital increase; and the
elasticity with respect to domestic R&D capital tends to fall in the G7 countries but increase
in the non-G7 countries.

These estimates confirm the key empirical results from CH. Econometric techniques not
available in the early 1990s indicate that there is robust evidence that total factor
productivity, domestic R&D capital, and foreign R&D capital are cointegrated, and that both
measures of R&D capital are significant determinants of TFP. Broadly consistent results are
obtained from a revised data set for the same time period and countries used by CH and for
the updated and expanded dataset.




                                                             12
The specifications in CH focus on domestic and foreign R&D capital as the key long-run
determinants of TFP, consistent with the theoretical model. Another important determinant of
productivity is human capital (Engelbrecht, 1997). Including a measure of human capital
becomes more important as the time period is lengthened, since for most economically
advanced countries measures of human capital tend to change slowly, and as countries such
as Korea, which have invested heavily in human capital formation since the early 1970s, are
included in the analysis.16 This is confirmed by regressions on the updated and expanded
dataset, which indicate that human capital is cointegrated with TFP and domestic and foreign
R&D capital, and that human capital is a significant determinant of TFP under a variety of
specifications. From a broader perspective, other theoretical models would suggest a number
of additional determinants of TFP, as emphasized by Khan and Luintel (2006), although lack
of data availability precluded the inclusion of many potential candidates in this study.17

Table 5 presents estimates including the logarithm of human capital (H) as an additional
explanatory variable, and compares dynamic OLS within estimates, i.e., DOLS estimates on
the pooled data, with DOLS mean group estimates. As noted, the estimated coefficients on
human capital are highly significant in all specifications and with both estimation techniques.

16
   Coe et al. (1997) include human capital in their analysis of R&D spillovers from developed countries in the
north to developing countries in the south.
17
   We did include measures of publicly financed R&D, distance to frontier, and a variety of other variables, but
did not find that these were significant or robust determinants of total factor productivity in our data set.

The DOLS within estimates include regressions comparable to the three specifications
reported in Table 4. Including logH reduces the size of the estimated coefficients on logSf-biw,
but not on m∙logSf-biw, and makes the estimated coefficients on G7∙logSd insignificant; all
other estimated coefficients remain highly significant.18

The mean group estimates, which are based on DOLS time-series estimates for each country,
are broadly similar to the DOLS within estimates, with all of the estimated coefficients
remaining correctly signed and significant. The main differences are that, compared with the
“within” estimates, in the mean group estimates the estimated coefficients on logSd are larger
while the coefficients on logSf-biw and on m∙logSf-biw are smaller, and the measures of
goodness of fit are better. Of course, the MGE results are averages of the estimated equations
for the individual countries, each of which are only based on 34 annual observations, and
some of the estimated coefficients in these country-specific equations are incorrectly signed
or insignificant, or both.

Foreign R&D capital in the results presented thus far is defined as a bilateral import share
weighted average of the domestic R&D capital stocks of trading partners (Sf-biw), as in CH.
Table 6 presents estimation results using two alternative definitions: bilateral imports as the
fraction of trading partners’ output multiplied by trading partners’ domestic R&D capital

  Experiments entering logH interacted with either logSd, logSf-biw, or m∙logSf-biw did not yield results that were
correctly signed and significant across a variety of specifications.

(Sf-LP), as proposed by Lichtenberg and van Pottelsberghe de la Potterie (1998), and a simple
average of trading partners’ domestic R&D capital (Sf-avg). To keep the presentation concise,
results are only presented for the specification with the import share interacted with foreign
R&D capital; estimation results for the specification with foreign R&D capital not interacted
with import shares are presented in appendix Table A1.

Regression estimates using either of the three definitions are very similar, as shown in the
first three columns of Table 6. When m∙logSf-biw or m∙logSf-LP is included in the same
regression with m∙logSf-avg, the estimated coefficients on the former remain significant while
the coefficients on the latter become negative and insignificant. While this mainly reflects
multi-colinearity, it also suggests that the definition of foreign R&D capital based on either
bilateral import shares or the definition proposed by Lichtenberg and van Pottelsberghe de la
Potterie (1998), which is also based on bilateral imports, perform somewhat better than the
definition based on a simple average. When m∙logSf-biw and m∙logSf-LP are included in the
same regression, the estimated coefficients become negative or insignificant. However, in the
alternative specification without the interaction with the import share, the estimated
coefficient on logSf-biw remains significant whereas the coefficient on logSf-LP is insignificant,
as shown in the final regression in Table A1. Our interpretation of these results is that foreign
R&D capital defined with bilateral-import weights (Sf-biw) performs somewhat better than the
definition proposed by Lichtenberg and van Pottelsberghe de la Potterie (1998) (Sf-LP), both
of which perform much better than a simple average. In the next section, we only report
results with foreign R&D capital defined with bilateral-import weights; results based on the
LP measure are broadly similar.

5. Institutions and International R&D Spillovers

Institutions are increasingly viewed as key determinants of total factor productivity and,
hence, of economic growth. In this section we test if the estimated parameters on domestic
and foreign R&D capital and on human capital vary among countries according to various
proxies for institutions. Thus we seek to account for heterogeneity based country-specific
institutions rather than by estimating country-specific parameters based on limited time-
series observations.

We focus on four institutions that have been emphasized in the literature:19

        The ease of doing business, which is an average ranking of countries according to the
         ease of doing the following ten actions: starting a business, dealing with licenses,
         employing workers, registering property, getting credit, protecting investors, paying


19
   We also tested for the importance of various other institutions, such as measures of financial development,
labor market institutions, governance, and ease of trading across borders, but did not find significant differences
in the estimated coefficients.


                                                        15
         taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts, and closing a business (World
         Bank, 2007).
        The quality of tertiary education, which is a composite measure of the extent to which
         tertiary institutions have: freedom to manage resources, including the selection of
         students, autonomy to decide on the sources and structure of funding, and staff
         personnel policies; freedom in setting objectives, including deciding on course
         content; and are accountable, including various types of evaluation (Oliveira Martins
         et al., 2007).20
        The strength of intellectual property rights, as measured by an index of patent
         protection (Park and Lippoldt, 2005).
        The origins of legal systems in either French, German, Scandinavian, or English law
         (La Porta et al., 1999; La Porta et al., 2008).

       Notes: For ease of doing business (World Bank, 2007) and quality of tertiary education (Oliveira Martins, et al.,
       2007) rank indicates if country is in the top (Hi), middle (Mid), or bottom (Lo) third of the 24 countries. An
       estimate of the quality of tertiary education is not available for Israel, which is assumed to be in the middle
       category. Patent protection (Park and Lippoldt, 2005) is an index with values from 1 (low) to 5.

   Values for Belgium, Canada, and the United States are population-weighted averages of the, respectively,
linguistic, provincial, and state groups reported in Oliveira Martins et al. (2007). An estimate of the quality of
tertiary education is not available for Israel, which is assumed to be in the middle group in Table 7.


                                                                 16
Each of these institutional variables could potentially affect the degree to which domestic and
foreign R&D capital affects total factor productivity. In the quality ladders approach, for
example, a given R&D effort could result in larger quality improvements in countries where
the quality of tertiary education is relatively high since these countries may produce more
productive researchers than other countries. Similarly countries where the ease of doing
business is relatively high or intellectual property rights are well protected may encourage
more entrepreneurial R&D that results in larger quality improvements for a given R&D
effort. Different legal systems may also affect the type or productivity of R&D.

The values for the institutional variables are reported in Table 7. Except for the index of
patent protection, the other measures of institutions are either time invariant or not available
as a time series. Although for most countries, changes over time in the ease of doing business
and the quality of tertiary education are likely to be modest at best, they are not necessarily
constant. However, our tests only assume that the rankings across countries of these two
institutional variables remain constant over time: we do this by dividing the sample into
groups of eight countries with the highest, middle, and lowest rank or score, and use these
rankings to define dummy variables (Hi, Lo) that are interacted with the determinants of total
factor productivity.

Estimation results for the ease of doing business are reported in Table 8. To facilitate
comparisons, the first regression in the table is identical to the first regression in Table 6. The
estimated coefficients on the interaction of the Hi ease of doing business dummy and each of
the determinants of TFP is positive and highly significant. Thus countries where it is

relatively easy to do business—i.e., the top third countries in the ranking in Table 7—benefit
more from their own R&D efforts, from international R&D spillovers, and from their own
investment in human capital formation than do other countries. Conversely, countries where
it is relatively hard to do business benefit less from their own R&D efforts and investment in
human capital and significantly less from international R&D spillovers than do countries
ranked in either the middle or the high group. Indeed, the estimates suggest that countries
where the ease of doing business is lowest do not benefit at all from international R&D
spillovers. It is clear that country differences in the ease of doing business imply substantial
heterogeneity in the estimated coefficients, as summarized in the memorandum items in
Table 8 reporting the highest and lowest estimated coefficients for each variable.

Broadly similar results are obtained for the quality of tertiary education, as shown in Table 9.
Countries where the quality of tertiary education is relatively high benefit more from their
own R&D efforts, from international R&D spillovers, and from their own investment in
human capital formation than do other countries. Indeed, these estimates imply that only
countries where the quality of tertiary education is in the highest one-third benefit from
international R&D spillovers, with countries in the middle and lowest group deriving no
significant benefits from foreign R&D. There is also no significant difference between the
middle and the lowest group in terms of the impact of own R&D and human capital.
Differences in the quality of tertiary education also imply substantial heterogeneity in the
estimated coefficients.

Patent protection is a significant additional determinant of total factor productivity, as shown
in the second regression in Table 10. Patent protection might also affect TFP through its
impact on R&D: by encouraging innovators to work on risky projects where the potential
return is higher, for example, strengthened patent protection may result in an R&D capital
stock that has a larger impact on TFP. This is supported in the third and fourth regressions in
Table 10, which suggest that countries where patent protection is relatively strong tend to
benefit more from a given level of domestic and, to a lesser extent, foreign R&D capital
compared with countries where patent protection is relatively weak.21 Given that the

  If patent protection is included in the same regression with either or both of the capital stocks interacted with
patent protection, it was either insignificant or incorrectly signed.


                                                                  19
differences in patent protection across countries is not large, and that patent protection has
strengthened and converged, the heterogeneity of the estimated coefficients implied by the
last three equations in Table 10 is not large and decreases over time. In the fourth equation,
for example, the range of the lowest and highest estimated coefficients on m∙logSf is about
0.03-0.05 in 1971 and 0.05-0.06 in 2004.

Countries with different legal systems may offer different degrees of investor protection,
including patent protection, which could be reflected in the estimated coefficients on R&D
capital. To test for this, dummy variables for countries whose legal systems originate in
French (Fr), German, and Scandinavian (Sc) law (cf. Table 7) were interacted with the
domestic and foreign R&D capital stocks.22 The estimated coefficients for countries with
legal systems based on German law were not significantly different from those based on
English law. The results reported in Table 11 suggest that countries with French- and
Scandinavian-based legal systems benefit less from a given level of domestic R&D capital
than other countries. This result comes through strongly in the basic specification as well as
in specifications where patent protection enters separately or interacted with the domestic

  We found no evidence that the estimated coefficients on foreign R&D capital were different for trading
partners with the same legal origin than for trading partners with different legal origins.


                                                                   20
R&D capital stock. The estimated coefficients on foreign R&D capital interacted with the
legal origins dummies are only significant in the specification where patent protection enters
as a separate variable (compare columns 3 and 5). For countries with Scandinavian-based
legal systems, the results suggest that the coefficient on domestic R&D capital is reduced by
about one-half. For countries with French-based legal systems, however, the estimated
coefficients imply that both domestic and foreign R&D capital have essentially no significant
impact on total factor productivity.23 Thus legal origins in French and, to a lesser extent,
Scandinavian law imply considerable heterogeneity in parameters compared with countries
with legal origins in English or German law.

6. Conclusions

The key results reported in Coe and Helpman (1995) are, in general, confirmed by estimation
on an updated and expanded database using modern panel cointegration techniques not
available in the early 1990s. There is robust evidence that total factor productivity, domestic
R&D capital, and foreign R&D capital are cointegrated, and that both measures of R&D
capital are significant determinants of TFP. Although not included in CH’s analysis, there is
strong evidence that human capital is also cointegrated and is an additional significant
determinant of TFP, as emphasized by Engelbrecht (1997). Including human capital does,
however, change the result in CH that the estimated coefficient on the domestic R&D capital
stock is significantly higher in the G7 countries than in other countries. Regressions using the
definition of foreign R&D capital based on either bilateral import shares, as in CH, or the
definition proposed by Lichtenberg and van Pottelsberghe de la Potterie (1998), which is also
based on bilateral imports, perform equally well, and better than the definition based on a
simple average.

When the equations are estimated individually for each country, the DOLS mean group
estimates give broadly similar results to the DOLS estimates on the pooled data, although the
estimated coefficients on foreign R&D capital decline substantially while those on domestic
R&D capital rise somewhat. These two estimation techniques are based on extreme
assumptions about parameter heterogeneity: the pooled estimates assume homogeneity,
except for fixed effects, whereas the mean group estimates allow complete heterogeneity,
albeit based on limited time-series observations.

We address the issue of parameter heterogeneity by extending the empirical analysis in Coe
and Helpman (1995) to examine institutional sources of heterogeneity. We find evidence that
countries where the ease of doing business and the quality of tertiary education systems are
relatively high tend to benefit more from their own R&D efforts, from international R&D

23
  The estimated coefficients on Fr∙logSd or Fr∙m∙logSf are negative and greater in absolute value than the
estimated coefficients on logSd or m∙logSf , although the sums of the two coefficients may not be significantly
different from zero.

spillovers, and from human capital formation. We also find that strong patent protection is
associated with higher levels of total factor productivity, higher returns to domestic R&D,
and larger international R&D spillovers. Finally, we find evidence that countries whose legal
systems are based on French and, to a lesser extent, Scandinavian law benefit less from their
own and foreign R&D capital than countries whose legal origins are based on English or
German law.

These results on the importance of institutions are consistent with the broader growth
literature emphasizing the importance of institutions for economic growth and suggest
specific channels through which institutions may affect TFP and growth. A fruitful area for
future research would be to extend the analysis in Coe, Helpman, and Hoffmaister (1997) to
examine the role of institutions in explaining why some developing countries benefit more
than others from international R&D spillovers from advanced countries.

Appendix A: Alternative Specification

Regression results comparable to those presented in Table 6 and Tables 8-11 but based on an
alternative specification where foreign R&D capital (logSf ) is not interacted with the import
share (m)—i.e., based on equation (2) rather than equation (3), but without the G7 dummy
interacted with logSd —are presented in Tables A1-A5. In general, the results are similar to
those discussed in the main text, although there are some noteworthy differences:

      In the alternative specification, foreign R&D capital defined with bilateral import
       shares (Sf-biw) dominates foreign R&D capital defined as proposed by Lichtenberg and
       van Pottelsberghe de la Potterie (1998) (Sf-LP) when both are entered in the same
       equation, whereas both were insignificant in the specification reported in the text (cf.
       the fourth equations in Tables 6 and A1).
      The evidence of a significantly lower coefficient on foreign R&D capital in countries
       where the ease of doing business is lowest is absent in the alternative specification
       (cf. the third equations in Tables 8 and A2).
      In the alternative specification, there is evidence of a significantly lower coefficient
       on foreign R&D capital in countries whose legal origins are French (cf. the third
       equations in Tables 11 and A5) and Scandinavian (cf. the fifth equations in Tables 11
       and A5).

Appendix B: Data Sources and Definitions

The database is similar to CH but updated to 2004 and expanded to include Korea and
Iceland and estimates of human capital and a number of institutional variables. As noted in
the text, data for Germany refer to West Germany from 1964-1990 and to unified Germany
thereafter.

Total factor productivity (F) in the business sector is defined as,

       F = Y / ( Kβ∙L(1-β) ) ,

where Y is real value added in the business sector, K is capital stock, L is labor input (defined
as business sector employment times average annual hours worked), β is the average labor
share, and all variables are indices with 2000=1. All data are from the OECD’s analytical
database or the OECD Economic Outlook database except for Israel where the data were
provided by Ms. Soli Peleg of the Central Bureau of Statistics. For Belgium, Finland, France,
Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, Sweden, and the United
States, the OECD only has capital stock estimates for the total economy; for the other
countries, including Israel, the capital stock is for the business sector. For some countries
missing data for business sector output or employment were filled in using the growth rate of
the corresponding economy wide variable; missing data for the capital stock were filled in by
assuming a constant scrapping rate and the perpetual inventory model; missing data for
hours worked were filled in by assuming it remained constant at the last observation.

Data for business sector R&D expenditure (R&D) for most countries are from the OECD
Directorate of Science Technology, and Industry, published in Main Science and Technology
Indicators. For Korea, R&D data are from the Ministry of Science and Technology. For
Israel, R&D data are from the Central Bureau of Statistics supplemented by estimates from
1970/71 to 1985/86 from Ms. Soli Peleg of the CBS.

Most countries do not have data for all years from 1970-2004, either because the data do not
start until after 1970 or because there are gaps in the data, which were only collected every
other year or even more sporadically. The OECD also publishes data on R&D expenditure
for total industry (R&DI) in the STAN database, and for some countries these data are
available for more years than the data for the business sector (R&D). For these countries the
correlation between R&D and R&DI is very high (0.99 except for Australia where it is 0.72).
The ratios of R&D/R&DI, which are relatively stable and close to 1, were interpolated and
used to estimate missing values of R&D for those observations where only R&DI data were
available. An analogous procedure was used for Austria, for which there are many more
observations for total R&D expenditure than for R&D in the business sector.




                                               26
Business sector R&D expenditure in constant 2000 dollars valued at purchasing power
parities (R&DV) were obtained by dividing R&D by GDP deflators (2000=1) to convert from
nominal to real,24 and by multiplying by the 2000 purchasing power parity exchange rate in
U.S. dollars per local currency. Missing observations for R&DV were estimated using the
predicted values from OLS regressions of logR&DV on logGDPBV and logIBV, where
GDPBV is real value-added in the business sector and IBV is real non-residential private
investment (for a few countries it was necessary to use aggregate GDP and total investment).
If significant, a time trend (T) and T 2 were also included. The change in the predicted values
from these regressions, which typically had R 2s of 0.95-0.99, were used to fill in the
remaining missing observations for R&DV.

R&D capital stocks in the business sector (Sd), defined as beginning of year, were calculated
using the perpetual inventory procedure,

        Sdt = (1-δ)Sdt-1 + R&DVt-1 ,

where the depreciation rate, δ, is assumed to be 0.05.25 The benchmarks are calculated as,

        Sd1970 = R&DV1970/ (δ + g) ,

where g is the annual average logarithmic growth rate from 1970-1985, i.e., g =
log(R&DV1985/R&DV1970) / 15. To take advantage of the availability of data on R&DV from
the early 1960s for the G7 countries, the benchmarks for G7 countries are calculated for
1962, g is calculated from 1963-1985, and the capital stocks are calculated from 1963. For
the other countries the benchmarks are calculated for 1970 and the capital stocks from 1971.

A number of alternative measures of foreign R&D capital were defined for each of the 24
countries, each of which is based on the domestic R&D capital stocks of the countries’ 23
trade partners. Following CH, the bilateral-import-share-weighted foreign R&D capital stock
for country i is defined as,

        Sf-biwi = ∑ j≠ i wij Sdj ,

where wij = Mij / ∑ j≠ i Mij , ∑ j≠ i wij = 1, and Mij is country i’s imports of goods and services
from country j. Bilateral imports, which are on a c.i.f. basis, are from the IMF Direction of
Trade database. Lichtenberg and van Pottelsberghe de la Potterie (1998) propose an
alternative definition of foreign R&D capital stocks

   The lack of consistent data for wages prevented deflating nominal R&D expenditure by an average of PGDP
and an index of wages, as was done in Coe and Helpman (1995).
25
   CH and other studies have found that empirical results are not sensitive to the assumed value for the
depreciation rate.
