Entry and Exit of Informal Firms and Development

                                           ABSTRACT

Non-farm informal businesses comprise the majority of the firm distribution in developing
countries. We document novel stylized facts about entry and exit of informal, non-farm firms
using nationally representative panel data over 15 years and across regions with varying levels of
local economic development in Vietnam. First, we find that informal businesses exhibit rates of
entry and exit around 14-18% annually. Entry and exit rates are similar and highly correlated at a
point in time, within industries, and within regions. They both decline over time and across space
with economic development. Second, although market selection influences which firms survive,
entry and exit has little net effect on aggregate (revenue) productivity or hiring of workers outside
the household. This owes to overlapping labor productivity of entering and exiting firms and low
subsequent productivity growth and hiring among the surviving entrants. Nonetheless, entry and
exit are associated with large changes in individual income. Third, the large overlap in revenue of
entering and exiting informal businesses and the high correlation between entry and exit rates are
related to the education of owners and their economic activities before and after operating an
informal business. Informal business owners are less educated on average than wage workers in
the formal sector, but more educated than agricultural workers. The transitions in and out of
operating an informal business reflect the underlying structure of economic activities of the
working age population, with education gaps also playing a role. The most common transition
into non-farm businesses is to and from self-employment in agriculture. The likelihood of this
transition declines with economic development, highlighting the role of net entry from agriculture
into informal non-farm businesses in structural change.

1       Introduction
A large literature has emphasized the importance of firm entry and exit in developing coun-
tries (see Roberts and Tybout (1996), Tybout (2000)), highlighting their contribution to
aggregate productivity and their role in firms' responses to policy changes (such as trade
policy) and business cycles. Because of data constraints, most of the literature on facts about
firm entry and exit focuses on formal establishments (Li and Rama (2015)).1 In contrast,
we have less systematic evidence on entry and exit of informal firms (Woodruff (2012), Li
and Rama (2015), McKenzie and Paffhausen (2019), Ulyssea (2020)).
    Why should one focus on entry and exit of informal businesses? These businesses comprise
the majority of firms in developing countries (Gollin, 2002, 2008; La Porta and Shleifer, 2008,
2014; Hsieh and Olken, 2014).2 They influence aggregate productivity because they tend to
be less productive than larger, formal firms (La Porta and Shleifer, 2008, 2014; McCaig and
Pavcnik, 2018) or face different distortions in labor and capital markets, leading to potential
misallocation of resources (Atkin and Khandelwal, 2020). Importantly, informal firms matter
for the livelihoods of households in poorer countries. They are a notable source of household
income (Benjamin et al., 2017) and account for a large share of employment (Gollin, 2002,
2008; Nataraj, 2011).3 Their performance and dynamics are therefore key to understanding
the livelihoods of poor households, generation of jobs, and aggregate labor productivity in
low-income countries.
    In this paper, we document several facts about the entry and exit of informal non-farm
businesses. We overcome the usual data constraints by using a large sample of almost 130,000
informal non-farm businesses based on nationally representative household surveys over a
period of 15 years in Vietnam.4 Although we focus on a single country, we observe informal
    1
      Firm-level datasets usually cover registered firms or registered firms above a certain employment thresh-
old in manufacturing.
    2
      For example, in Vietnam in 2010, there were 9.1 million informal businesses compared to 287 thousand
formal firms. These figures are based on authors' calculations using the 2010 Vietnam Household Living
Standards Survey for the estimate of informal businesses and the 2010 Enterprise Census for the estimate of
formal businesses.
    3
      For example, they account for 21% of household income in Vietnam (Benjamin et al., 2017). They
account for 80% of manufacturing employment in India (Nataraj, 2011). In Vietnam, 58% of non-agricultural
workers worked in informal businesses at the time of the 2009 population census (authors' calculation).
    4
      We focus on informal firms precisely because they are usually excluded from other datasets and they
account for a large share of employment and household income in poor countries. However, we do not focus


                                                      1
businesses in about 60 local economies within Vietnam with levels of economic development
ranging from about 1800 to 12,000 USD and differing sectoral compositions of employment.5
The panel component allows us to follow about 48,000 informal firms over a period of up to
four years (something most studies cannot do). We more systematically document prevalence
and facts about entry and exit of informal firms over longer time periods, across industries,
and with levels and sectoral structure of economic development than is usually possible with
smaller, not nationally representative samples. Importantly, we can simultaneously examine
the rate of entry and exit of informal businesses and the implications of entry and exit for
labor productivity, paid employment and household income. Our results thus complement
McKenzie and Paffhausen (2019) which focuses on small firm exit.
   Finally, we relate entry and exit patterns of informal businesses to the education and eco-
nomic activities of their owner before or after operating a business. Most informal businesses
have only one worker, the owner, who is the business's key input (Gollin, 2008; La Porta
and Shleifer, 2008, 2014; de Mel et al., 2010). This person owns the business, works at
the business, and manages its daily operations. We perform these comparisons by linking
the longitudinal data on informal businesses to a panel of households and individuals. Im-
portantly, we systematically compare education and economic activities of informal business
owners that are starting or shutting down a business to the education and economic activities
of the overall working-age population. This enables us to examine selection of individuals
into and out of informal businesses in a comprehensive fashion over long periods of time and
across locations. Our work complements studies that have largely focused on the largest
cities (de Mel et al., 2010) or urban centers in middle-income countries (Maloney, 2004).
   We find that informal businesses exhibit rates of entry and exit of around 14-18% annually,
which is higher than what is typically observed for formal firms in developing countries.
Entry and exit rates are similar and highly correlated at a point in time, within industries,
and within regions that vary in economic development. They both decline with economic
development over time or across space. Second, although market selection influences which
firms survive, informal business entry and exit has little net effect on aggregate (revenue)
on why these firms are informal. See Ulyssea (2018, 2020) for recent contributions to that literature.

      The amounts are from 2010 and based on GDP per capita, PPP adjusted in constant 2017 USD. See
section 4 for further details on provincial GDP per capita estimates.

labor productivity or hiring of workers outside the household. We find that there is a large
overlap in the revenue and total factor productivity distribution of entrants and exiters.
Moreover, almost half of the entrants exit within two years and the surviving entrants do not
significantly improve their performance over time or begin to hire paid workers. Overall this
suggests that market-selection is one factor influencing entry and exit of informal businesses,
with a broader range of owner-specific characteristics and shocks (Maloney, 2004; Hurst and
Pugsley, 2011; Astebro et al., 2014), alternative employment options (La Porta and Shleifer,
2008, 2014), and household-specific shocks (such as age of the owner, illness in the family)
potentially also playing a role. Importantly, business exit and entry is associated with large
decreases and increases, respectively, in individual and household income.
    Third, the large overlap in revenue of entering and exiting informal businesses and the
high correlation between entry and exit rates are related to the education and economic
activities of business owners prior to starting, or after closing down, an informal business.
Informal business owners are less educated on average than wage workers in the formal
sector, which is consistent with Gollin (2008), but have higher levels of education than
workers in agriculture. Entering and exiting owners have very similar levels of education.
Additionally, they are more likely to transition to and from other activities with similar
levels of educational attainment.
    The economic activities that owners transition to and from reflect the structure of eco-
nomic activities of the working age population at a point in time and location.6 Owners
most often transition to and from self-employment in agriculture, accounting for about a
third of informal non-farm business entrants and exiters. Net entry from self-employment in
agriculture is consistently positive and the rate falls with economic development, both over
time and locations. This underscores the role of net entry out of agriculture into informal
non-farm businesses in the process of structural change. Transitioning to and from the for-
mal sector, which accounts for about 10% of entrants and exiters, is less common than the
overall prevalence of work in the formal sector (in part because formal wage work requires
   6
     Economic activities include self-employment in agriculture, self-employment in the informal sector, self-
employment in the formal sector, wage work in agriculture, wage work in the informal sector, wage work in
the formal sector, and not in the workforce. Our data also enables us to take into account measurement of
informal business entry and exit due to changing composition of the household.

higher education).
    Overall, these results highlight the importance of simultaneously examining entry and exit
of informal businesses with nationally representative data that fully captures the variation of
economic activities (and thus outside opportunities for informal business owners) over time
and locations.
    The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 summarizes related theoretical and empirical
literature. Section 3 describes the legal framework for private businesses in Vietnam and
data. Section 4 provides background information on the prevalence of informal businesses
over time and across locations. Sections 5 and 6 report patterns of informal business en-
try and exit and the economic activities of owners before and after operating an informal
business.



2       Related Literature
In this section we discuss theoretical and empirical literature related to informal firm entry
and exit in developing countries and the relation of our study to this literature.


2.1     Theoretical reasons for informal firm entry and exit

What determines entry and exit of informal firms in low-income countries?
    We focus on entry and exit of informal firms because they are usually excluded from
datasets of formal registered firms used for studying firm entry and exit in low-income
countries. However, they account for a large share of employment and household income
in poor countries. Most informal firms are very small, often operated by only the owner.
Because our focus on informal firms is motivated by their exclusion from the data (rather
than their informal status), we provide an overview of what drives the existence, and entry
and exit decisions, of small firms as opposed to the informal status of most small firms.7
    7
     We do not focus on why these firms are informal rather than formal. Recent papers studying the
decision to formalize and discussing conceptual issues around formalization include Maloney (2004), Levy
(2008), de Mel et al. (2013), La Porta and Shleifer (2014), and Ulyssea (2018). See Ulyssea (2020) for a
recent review.




                                                   4
   Lucas (1978) and Gollin (2008) tie the existence of small firms to economic develop-
ment. They posit models where individuals vary in their entrepreneurial ability and this
variation leads to endogenous selection between wage work (the least entrepreneurial) and
entrepreneurship (the most entrepreneurial). Gollin (2008) features an intermediate case,
self-employment without employees, where the self-employed can split their time between
being a wage worker and managing their own business, a common occurrence in many low-
income countries. The models suggest that with low levels of wealth or aggregate produc-
tivity, the average firm size will be small, consistent with the empirical firm size distribution
in many low-income countries.8 As the economy develops, average firm size will increase as
marginal entrepreneurs (or the self-employed) find outside wage opportunities to be more
attractive. This suggests declines in self-employment and a reduction in the number of the
smallest firms with development. This view of the world is consistent with the idea that
many individuals in developing countries run an informal business out of necessity and lack
of other employment opportunities and that these individuals tend to switch to paid work
as the economy develops (La Porta and Shleifer, 2008, 2014).
   Other frameworks link the existence of smaller firms to a market imperfection, whereby
productive entrepreneurs are precluded from expanding due to imperfections in the capital
market, barriers to hiring labor outside the family, costs of registration and formalization,
or lack of business training (see Banerjee (2013) and Banerjee et al. (2015) for the impacts
of microcredit, de Mel et al. (2019) and McCasland and Hardy (2020) for hiring barriers,
Bruhn and McKenzie (2014) for registration, and McKenzie and Woodruff (2014) for business
training). To the extent that policy interventions reduce these distortions, these businesses
could better flourish, expand, and formalize.
   Beyond entrepreneurial ability or luck and market frictions, several studies have empha-
sized the role of individual characteristics such as nonpecuniary tastes, risk aversion, and
overconfidence to explain entry and persistence of entrepreneurs (Maloney, 2004; Hurst and
Pugsley, 2011; Astebro et al., 2014). Importantly, these studies note the large heterogeneity
in why individuals choose to run a business.
   8
    Note that the small firm size with low levels of development in these models is not due to distortions
(Atkin and Khandelwal, 2020).

   What determines entry and exit of businesses? Hopenhayn (1992) and Jovanovic (1982)
build on Lucas (1978), but propose a model of business entry as a process of learning.
In this setting, a business owner needs to operate the business to learn about his or her
abilities and profitability of the business, as opposed to knowing his or her productivity as
in Lucas (1978). These models predict simultaneous entry and exit of businesses, with the
less successful businesses exiting.
   This discussion suggests that the decision to start a business could be due to the owner
having a good business idea or foreseeing a market opportunity. The decision to exit could
be driven by firm-specific shocks (such as low productivity, increased product market com-
petition, increase in costs of inputs). These market-selection related reasons for entry and
exit of informal firms are similar to the considerations of formal firms. However, informal
businesses often have only one worker, the owner, who is the business's key input. Hence
their entry and exit might be closely tied to the owner's characteristics, alternative employ-
ment opportunities (Gollin, 2008; La Porta and Shleifer, 2008), or household-specific shocks
(such as age of the owner or illness in the family). As noted by Ulyssea (2020), we know
little about the dynamics of informal firms. The discussion above suggests that the entry
and exit of informal firms might not be related just to market-selection mechanisms, but
also to the owner's characteristics, individual and owner specific shocks, and labor market
opportunities available to owners.
   Why would economic development be related to entry and exit rates? Higher levels of
economic development might be associated with more or better outside opportunities for
business owners, leading to lower voluntary entry (and thus also) lower exit rates. Models
from industrial organization likewise suggest that entry (and thus) exit rates are lower in
tougher/more competitive markets, highlighting the positive correlation between entry and
exit rates within an industry or a local market. Higher economic development is associ-
ated with fewer constraints on informal business operations (such as access to credit), thus
higher entry and lower exit rates (McKenzie and Paffhausen, 2019). Overall, this discussion
highlights the importance of simultaneously studying the entry and exit of firms.

2.2     Empirical evidence on informal firm entry and exit

Our study relates to several empirical literatures. A large literature examines the effect of
a wide range of input-market interventions on the performance of microenterprises.9 These
interventions include microcredit provision, business training, and easing formalization re-
quirements. As noted by McKenzie and Paffhausen (2019) most of the above studies do not
focus on firm exit.10
    The challenges in examining the dynamics of microenterprises and transitions of busi-
nesses over long periods are well known (de Mel et al., 2010, 2013; Woodruff, 2012; Pages,
2012). As a result, much of what we know about informal firm entry and exit stems from pan-
els of household businesses over short periods of time.11 Alternatively, people have used labor
force surveys from urban areas in middle-income countries in Latin America (see a survey by
Maloney (2004), Mondrag´
                       on-V´          na (2010)), or the Townsend Thai Project.12 We
                           elez and Pe~
contribute to this literature by systematically examining entry and exit over a long period
of time and localities with a broad range of economic development.
    Our study is most closely related to McKenzie and Paffhausen (2019), which studies small
firm exit. It provides descriptive analysis of why firms exit, characteristics of those that exit
(relative to existing business owners), and how exit varies with economic development using
samples that cover 14,000 small firms across 12 countries.13 Our study is complementary,
providing simultaneous analysis of entry and exit using nationally representative data. Al-
though our data covers a single country, we are able to follow businesses that operate in local
economies that differ in income per capita and the sectoral distribution of employment.
   9
      The definition of a microenterprise varies across studies, but will typically cover most, if not all, in-
formal businesses since few informal businesses ever become very large. See surveys by Banerjee (2013)
and Banerjee et al. (2015) for the impacts of microcredit, Bruhn and McKenzie (2014) for registration, and
McKenzie and Woodruff (2014) for business training and Jayachandran (2020) for a comprehensive review
of microenterprises in developing countries. Most of the studies find little evidence of large impacts of these
interventions on firm growth or job creation.
   10
      For example, less than a third of recently published randomized control trials report an exit rate or uses
microenterprise exit as an outcome variable (McKenzie and Paffhausen, 2019).
   11
      See the extensive review in McKenzie and Paffhausen (2019) and Vijverberg and Haughton (2002) for
evidence from Vietnam during an earlier period, a one-period panel between 1993 and 1998.
   12
      See, for example, Paulson and Townsend (2004); Paulson et al. (2006); Kaboski and Townsend (2011,
2012); Samphantharak and Townsend (2012).
   13
      These samples continue to be small and not nationally representative. See McKenzie and Woodruff
(2014) for a discussion of issues related to small and selective samples.



                                                       7
   We also relate to an older literature on the facts of entry and exit among firms in de-
veloped countries as well as formal firms in developing countries. Using data from the U.S.
manufacturing census, Dunne et al. (1988) reports entry rates over 5-year periods of around
0.52 (an annualized rate of about 0.14) and exit rates over the same periods of 0.45 to 0.50
(annualized rates of 0.11 to 0.13), with higher entry and exit rates among small manufac-
turing plants. Dunne et al. (1989) reports that exit rates decrease with plant age and size
as do growth rates, conditional on surviving. Tables A9 through A14 report exit and entry
rates across various studies and are organized by microenterprises (developing countries) and
formal firms (from developing and developed countries). The annual entry and exit rates
among microenterprises are much more varied than among formal firms, ranging from about
8 to 32% annually for entry and from 3 to 31% annually for exit. Entry and exit rates for
formal firms in developing countries are almost as varied, ranging from 4 to 26% annually
for entry and from 3 to 17% annually for exit.14 Lastly, among developed countries, entry
rates range from 5 to 20% and exit rates vary between 6 and 11%.
   Our paper also relates to a literature on firm growth, particularly for small firms. Astebro
et al. (2014) and Haltiwanger (2015) report that a small share of new firms experience
significant growth, while the majority remain small. Similar evidence has been found in
India and Mexico by Hsieh and Klenow (2014). They follow cohorts of informal and formal
firms and report dramatically lower growth of these firms relative to in the US. McCaig
et al. (2021) track private, formal firms over 16 years in Vietnam and report similarly low
average growth rates, especially in comparison to foreign-invested firms. Among informal
firms and microenterprises in developing countries, the consensus is that few of these firms
grow (McKenzie, 2017; Fafchamps and Woodruff, 2017; Diao et al., 2018).
   Finally, while most of the literature on the consequences of trade policy or export pro-
motion has focused on firms and workers in the formal sector, there is a nascent literature
on the link between microenterprises, trade policy (and other market access interventions),
and transitions from the informal to the formal sector (Nataraj, 2011; Brambilla et al., 2012;
Startz, 2016; Atkin et al., 2017; McCaig and Pavcnik, 2018; Bergquist and Dinerstein, 2020).
  14
     Note that the highest entry rates among formal firms in developing countries are found in countries
transitioning away from a centrally planned economy, such as Estonia, Slovenia, and Vietnam.



                                                   8
The facts about informal firm entry and exit provide a useful input for understanding how
informal firms and their owners are affected by general equilibrium changes brought about
by policy changes.



3        Informal firms in Vietnam and data description

3.1      Informal firms in Vietnam

Our analysis focuses on informal businesses, which are referred to as household or individual
businesses in Vietnam.15 In Vietnam, a household or individual business is one that is not
registered with the national government under the Enterprise Law. Hence, our definition
of an informal business is based on the registration status of the business.16 All state,
foreign and collective businesses are legally required to register as enterprises under Vietnam's
Enterprise Law.17 However, private businesses can legally operate in two different modes, a
household business and a private enterprise, depending on their size and number of locations.
All private businesses with 10 or more regular workers or more than one location are legally
obligated to register as an enterprise.18 Malesky and Taussig (2009) report that enterprises,
relative to household businesses, have easier access to export licenses, customs certificates,
opportunities to bid on government contracts, the right to open branches and to operate
outside their home district, but running an enterprise, as opposed to a household business,
entails the registration cost and more rigorous accounting.19 Enterprises (formal firms) are
also required to contribute to social insurance for their workers McCaig and Pavcnik (2018).
    15
       Vietnam transitioned from a low- to lower middle-income country according to the World Bank's clas-
sification in 2010.
    16
       The definition of an informal business based on registration status is common in the literature (La Porta
and Shleifer, 2008, 2014; Ulyssea, 2020).
    17
       See the Law on Enterprises passed in 1999.
    18
       See Decrees No. 02/2000/ND-CP and No. 109/2004/ND-CP.
    19
       Similarly, Taussig and Hang (2004) reports the benefits of being an enterprise, relative to a household
business, as greater ability to trade beyond their home district, ability to expand, value added tax receipts,
legal ability to establish branch locations, a stamp for making transactions more official, more predictability,
law based interactions with government, ability to access equity for limited and joint stock companies, and
greater access to government investment incentives while the costs of formalization include registration costs,
annual registration fee, certified chief accountant, greater reporting requirements, potential for increased
attention from local authorities, and potential for increased taxes with movement from lump sum to standard
tax calculations. The information on the costs of registering as a private enterprise in Vietnam is summarized
by the World Bank's Doing Business Survey.

3.2        Household survey description

We use the 2004 to 2018 rounds of the Vietnam Household Living Standard Surveys (VHLSS).
The surveys are conducted every two years. These household surveys are nationally repre-
sentative and contain a detailed business module on non-farm businesses owned and run
by the households. The surveys capture both formal (i.e., private enterprises) and informal
businesses operated by the household. Our data thus enables us to study a representative
sample of informal businesses owned by households, which is rare. Most of these businesses
are usually not covered in the more widely available firm-level data, which tend to focus only
on registered (or formal) firms or formal firms above a certain employment size cut off.
   Each survey round contains information on about 20,000 businesses. The business mod-
ules consistently collect the following information for all businesses, both formal and infor-
mal: the industry of operation, the number of months it operated during the past 12 months,
monthly revenue (including the value of self-consumption), the annual wage bill, and other
annual expenditures (materials, repairs, water, etc.).20 For all surveys except 2004, it also
asked whether the business was registered as an enterprise (our definition of formal). The
2006 and 2008 surveys additionally contain information on who is the most knowledgeable
person (hereafter referred to as the owner), the number of workers, the number of paid work-
ers, and the year the business started. Information on the number of workers, the number
of paid workers, and the start year is available in the 2004 survey for only about 1/5th of
the businesses. For the surveys other than 2006 and 2008, we have designed an algorithm
to predict the owner of the business within the household. Since most households operate
only one business and most businesses have only one individual working in the business,
predicting the owner is straightforward for most businesses. Appendix B contains further
details.
   Importantly, the surveys contain panel components that allow us to examine entry and
exit using large, nationally representative datasets covering 15 years. Table 1 displays the
number of households in each panel.21 Between each successive survey, with the exception of

      According to the Operational Handbook for the 2004 survey, "The enumerator interviews those people
who have the most information about each activity [business], who usually coordinate or manage these
activities." The handbooks for later surveys provide the same guidance to the enumerators.
   21
      The VHLSSs feature a rotating panel by enumeration area. Thus, not all enumerations areas surveyed

between 2008 and 2010, there is a panel of approximately 20,000 households.22 Additionally,
we have 3-survey panels of approximately 9,500 households. These panels start with the
2004, 2010, 2012, and 2014 surveys. Nationally representative longitudinal data on informal
businesses owned by households that spans four years is very rare in low-income countries
(Woodruff, 2012). Longitudinal data is useful for two reasons. First, it provides for a
representative sample of households who could potentially start a business, an important
piece of information not available in the usual firm-level data sets. This enables us to
measure informal business entry and exit, correlates of informal business formation, and to
follow informal businesses over time. The household surveys include data on all businesses
owned by a household, regardless of their formal registration status. As a result, we can
distinguish between true exit and formalization. Second, the household panel allows the
creation of a panel of businesses. We create a panel of businesses operated by the household
by taking advantage of the information on the number of businesses a household operates
and the information about the business that is not likely to change in a short period.

    For each two-survey panel, Table A3 shows the number of businesses operated by panel
in 2004 were intended to be resurveyed in 2006, for example, but all households in a panel enumeration
area were to be surveyed again. This accounts for why the number of panel households is noticeably lower
than the total number of households surveyed in each VHLSS, as only about half of the enumeration areas
surveyed in 2004 were surveyed again in 2006, for example.
   22
      The authors have cleaned and verified the originally suggested household and individual panels. Details
of the cleaning can be found on McCaig's website for the 2004 through 2008 VHLSSs while details for the
2010 through 2018 surveys can be found in Appendix B.

                                                     11
households at the beginning of the panel, at the end of the panel, and the number that
were matched between surveys (see Appendix B for details on the matching procedure). In
this context, we define entry as a business that was operated at the end of the panel, but
cannot be matched to a business operating within the household at the beginning of the
panel. Similarly, we define exit as a business that was operated at the beginning of the
panel, but cannot be matched to a business operating within the household at the end of the
panel.23 Our definition of informal business entry and exit could lead to an overestimation
due to individuals joining and leaving households. For example, consider an individual who
was a member of a household and was operating a business, but then left the household
and took their business with them. In this case, we no longer observe the business and we
record it as a business exit when in fact the business continues to be operated, but no longer
by a household member. To address these concerns, when we present entry and exit rates
we present alternative estimates that remove from the calculations businesses operated by
individuals that join or leave the household.
    Finally, we link the business module to the information about its key input, the owner,
from the survey modules related to demographics, education, and employment. For each
working individual, the employment module collects information on the industry, occupation,
ownership category, hours worked during the past 12 months, and wages and other payments
for both the most and second most time consuming jobs during the past 12 months. Demo-
graphic modules contain information on the individual's age, gender, ethnicity, completed
level of education, and location. We also use information from the employment modules to
measure the number of household members working in the business.24 Note that the VHLSSs
also include a longitudinal dimension at the individual level.25 The individual panel enables
  23
      Appendix B discusses in detail the high degree of consistency between the employment information
reported in the employment module by members of the household and the business information reported in
the business module. In other words, for a business to be missing from those reported by the household,
and thus contributing to false exit or entry, it must be unreported in both modules. Nonetheless, this is a
possibility.
   24
      This is based on the household member reporting being self-employed in the same industry as the
business. We cannot do this for household members for which self-employment in a non-farm business is
neither their primary nor secondary job during the past year. Additionally, we cannot do this for businesses
that operate in the same industry as another business in the household since we do not know which household
member to assign to which business. Overall, we are able to estimate the number of household members
working in the business for 91% of informal businesses in our sample.
   25
      The surveys do not follow individuals that left a household, although the datasets often provide some

a business.

nesses. In the appendix, we provide summary statistics from all businesses, including formal

    Before leaving the data section, we briefly discuss concerns about reporting error. As
very few informal businesses keep formal accounts, this is a greater concern than among
formal firms. de Mel et al. (2009) find that microenterprises in Sri Lanka under report
basic information of why they left (i.e., for marriage, for work, etc.) and where they moved to.

                                                     13
revenue by about 30 percent on average. They note this is not necessarily intentional, for
example to avoid taxation, but rather due to recall error. They suggest that sales revenue,
as compared to implicit revenue from self-consumption or exchanging good and services, is
measured with less error. Motivated by this, our main measure of revenue is sales, which
account for 95 percent of total revenue among informal businesses, with goods or services
exchanged, goods or services consumed by the household, and by-products consumed by the
household representing the remaining 5 percent.
     Under reporting to avoid taxation is not likely to be a big concern in our context because
companies with less than 10 workers are simply not required, given their size, to formally
register as an enterprise and operate under the legal framework of the Enterprise Law.
90% of informal businesses have 2 or fewer workers and thus are well away from the legal
requirement to formally register as an enterprise. Furthermore, a significant percentage of
informal businesses (around 35-37%) report positive taxes and/or fees paid in the annual
expense category "Taxes, fees, and other fees considered as taxes."



4        Informal businesses over time and space
In order to provide a broader context for the analysis of informal business entry and exit in
Sections 5 and 6, we first document a few facts about the prevalence of informal businesses
over time and space. Our data spans 15 years of economic growth, during which GDP per
capita nearly doubled and was accompanied by significant structural change (McCaig and
Pavcnik, 2013).26
     Fewer Vietnamese households operate non-farm businesses over time during this period of
economic growth. Figure 1 plots the share of households that operate a business and shows
    26
     According to estimates in the World Development Indicators database, between 2004 and 2018, Viet-
nam's GDP per capita PPP adjusted grew from $3,690 to $7,586 in constant 2017 international dollars for
an average annual growth rate of 5.3%. For comparison, the business samples included in McKenzie and
Paffhausen (2019) range in terms of GDP per capita from about $400 (Malawi) to over $8,000 (Mexico).
The data on owner transitions in Maloney (2004) primarily comes from middle-income countries such as
Argentina and Mexico.




                                                  14
a noticeable decline from 0.38 in 2004 to about 0.32 in 2018, a 16% reduction.27,28 This
reduction is due to a decline in the share of households operating informal businesses and is
only partially offset by an increase in the share of households operating formal businesses.
Figure A14 shows that the incidence of operating a formal business is extremely low, about
1% in 2006, and grows to 1.3% by 2018. The drop in the share of households operating
a business is consistent with Gollin (2008), which predicts a decline in self-employment
businesses as the economy grows. As the share of households operating an informal business
has fallen, the informal businesses look marginally more successful, as measured by the share
that hire workers, operate as the owner's primary job, and operate as a year-round business
(see section A.1).

 Figure 1: Share of households operating any business and operating an informal business


    The share of households operating an informal non-farm business increases with provincial
income per capita. Figure 2 shows a strong positive relationship between provincial income
per capita in 2006 and the share of households within a province that operate an informal
  27
      All figures in this section rely on repeated cross sections and national estimates are obtained using
survey sampling weights. We find a very similar pattern without using sampling weights. The decline is
occurring in both urban and rural areas (Figure A15), but more so in urban areas, which started off with a
greater prevalence of households operating a business.
   28
      This reduction is consistent with the results of McCaig and Pavcnik (2015) which reports a reduction
in the share of workers in the informal sector between 1999 and 2009 using population census data.

business.29 However, the positive relationship weakens over time. Households in the initially
richest provinces have become less likely to operate an informal non-farm business over time.
The lines of best fit are statistically different starting at about 14 million VND (see Figure
A20). Thus, the aggregate decline in the share of households operating an informal business
from Figure 1 is driven, on average, by households in initially richer provinces.
   Existing literature documents a negative relationship between the prevalence of self-
employment (in agriculture and non-farm businesses) and development across countries
(La Porta and Shleifer, 2008) and over time within countries (Gollin, 2008). Our results
in Figure 2 seem inconsistent with this pattern. However, when we include both farm and
non-farm businesses (as is customary in the cross country literature), we in fact see the same
pattern across provinces. In Figure 3a, we find that the prevalence of operating any busi-
ness, farm or non-farm, declines with development across provinces. The contrast across the
two figures reflects the differences in the underlying sectoral employment structure across
provinces. Figure 3b shows that the share of employment in agriculture decreases and the
share of employment in manufacturing and services increases across provinces with income.
  29
     The income per capita estimates are from Benjamin et al. (2017). The informal businesses in richer
provinces are marginally more successful than in poorer provinces, as measured by the share that hire
workers, operate as the owner's primary job, and operate as a year-round business (see Figure A2).



                                                      16
Our data distinguishes between owning an informal farm and a non-farm business. This
allows us to focus on the role of non-farm informal businesses in the process of development,
taking into account the sectoral structure of employment.

     This analysis yields two important takeaways. First, the large variation in the incidence
of households operating informal businesses over time and across provinces at different levels
of development might be an important consideration for studies that examine the effects of
interventions on informal businesses or microenterprises in a specific location. It is useful
to interpret the results of those studies keeping in mind the level and sectoral structure of
local development. Second, a better understanding of the prevalence of informal non-farm
businesses requires more facts about the patterns of entry and exit of informal non-farm
businesses over time and space, what informal business owners do before and after they run
the business, and how these transitions relate to the level and structure of local development.
We turn next to dynamic analysis focusing on entry and exit of informal businesses.



5           Informal business dynamics
We first document several facts about entry and exit rates of informal businesses over time,
industries, and locations. In order to better understand the implications of entry and exit for
aggregate productivity of the informal sector, we establish several facts about entry and exit


                                                                           17
and informal business performance in Section 5.2 and post-entry performance of entrants in
Section 5.3. We examine how entry and exit affect the livelihoods of business owners through
income in Section 5.4.


5.1     Entry and exit rates are similar and correlated over time,
        industries, and space

We begin our analysis of the dynamics of informal businesses by examining exit and entry
rates. As McKenzie and Paffhausen (2019) note, relatively little is known about the exit of
small firms in developing countries, despite the large literature on (formal) firm dynamics in
developing countries (Tybout, 2000). Even less is known about entry and overall informal
firm dynamics (Ulyssea, 2020). One of the greatest strengths of our data is the existence of
multiple large, nationally representative panels of informal businesses that span a period of
15 years, which enable us to simultaneously examine entry and exit of informal businesses.
We provide several facts about entry and exit rates over time, within industries, and across
space with economic development.
    We estimate annual entry and exit rates of informal businesses using each of the six
two-survey panels. We define an entrant as a business that did not operate in year t-2, but
operated in year t and an exiter as one that did not operate in t+2, but operated in t.30
These are reported in Figure 4. Several facts emerge.
    Exit rates range from about 18% in the 2006-08 panel to about 14% in the 2012-14 panel.
In Tables A9 through A11 we report exit rates from existing studies. The exit rates in Figure
4 are slightly higher than the mean exit rates in McKenzie and Paffhausen (2019), but well
within their range of reported estimates across surveys and countries as well as for other
studies of microenterprise and informal firms in developing countries (see Table A9). These
rates are slightly higher than what are typically observed among formal firms in developing
countries (Table A10) and firms in developed countries (Table A11).
  30
     We calculate the annual exit rate as follows. We calculate the share of firms operating in year t that
are still operating in year t+2. We calculate the square root of this to calculate the annual survival rate
that is consistent with the two-year survival share. The annual exit rate is then 1 minus the annual survival
rate. For the annual entry rate, we first calculate the two-year share of continuing firms and convert this to
a one-year survivor share by taking the square root. We then calculate the one year entry rate as 1 minus
this rate.

                                                     18
    There is substantial simultaneous entry and exit. Entry rates range from about 17.5%
to 15.5%, and are relatively similar to the exit rates in a given time period. In Tables A12
through A14 we report entry rates from existing studies. The entry rates in Figure 4 are
within the range of reported entry rates for informal and microenterprises in developing
countries (Table A12), slightly higher than what is typically observed among non-transition
developing countries (Table A13) and higher than commonly observed in developed countries
(Table A14).31
    Importantly, exit and entry rates are similar within a period and decline over time from
17.5-18% in 2006 to around 15% in 2016, as Vietnam experiences economic growth.32 We
observe similar, but slightly lower, rates of exit and entry when we exclude businesses run
by individuals joining or leaving the household (Figure A18). We also observe quantitatively
similar rates of exit and entry when we include all businesses reported by the household, in
case of misclassification of businesses as formal or informal (Figure A19).
    While entry and exit rates vary across industries, the differences across industries are
not large. Figure A21 plots entry and exit rates for services and manufacturing, followed by
entry and exit rates in the most common industries (retail, hotels and restaurants, food and
beverages, and land transportation). The rates are relatively similar across industries (with
manufacturing experiencing higher entry and exit rates than services). For the most part,
industry entry rates tend to be a similar magnitude as industry exit rates in a given time
period. This is consistent with models from industrial organization that suggest that entry
(and thus) exit rates are both determined by industry-level conditions such as the fixed cost
of entry (and thus exit) and the competitiveness of the market (Dunne et al., 1988; Asplund
and Nocke, 2006).
   31
      Although informal business exit and entry rates are only slightly higher than what is typically observed
for formal firms in developing countries, this nonetheless likely means greater employment churning since
there is little size variation among informal firms and larger formal firms are less likely to exit than smaller
formal firms. Hence, similar rates of entry and exit would be associated with a greater share of employment
turnover in the informal sector.
   32
      The decline in the exit and entry rates is not simply due to better matching of businesses within
a household in the more recent surveys. As we saw in the repeated cross section analysis, the share of
households operating a business has fallen over time. Additionally, if we aggregate over all businesses run
by a household and examine household-level entry and exit from/to operating any businesses, the rates also
decline over time. As expected, the rates are lower with aggregation across businesses. See Figures A16
and A17 in the appendix for households operating any business and for households operating an informal
business.

                    Figure 4: Annual exit and entry rates of informal businesses


   The prevalence of exit and entry is negatively correlated with economic development
across provinces. Using the 2006-08 panel as an example, in Figure 5 we plot the annual
exit and entry rates of informal businesses in a province relative to income per capita in
2006 across provinces. On average, more developed provinces experienced lower rates of
entry and exit. The lower exit rates in richer provinces is consistent with the evidence from
Mead and Liedholm (1998) that the exit rates of micro and small enterprises (<50 workers) in
Botswana, Kenya, Malawi, Swaziland, Zimbabwe, and the Dominican Republic were lower in
urban areas than in rural areas, but contrasts higher rates of exit in larger cities in developed
countries (Asplund and Nocke, 2006). The pattern is consistent over time and as such we
only report it for one panel.33 We find a very similar pattern when we exclude businesses
run by individuals joining or leaving the households (Figure A23) or to major industries,
such as retail (available upon request).
   Why would economic development be related to entry and exit rates? Higher levels of
economic development might be associated with more outside employment opportunities for
business owners (such as formal wage work), leading to lower voluntary entry (and thus also)
lower exit rates. At the same time, higher economic development is associated with fewer

       Figure A22 shows that the 95% confidence intervals for the entry and exit lines of best fit overlap.

constraints on informal businesses (such as access to credit), thus higher entry and lower
exit rates (McKenzie and Paffhausen, 2019). Our findings that entry and exit rates both
decline with economic development is consistent with models that suggest a high correlation
of the entry and exit rates with industry or market characteristics and the importance of
outside employment options for microenterprise owners. Although all else equal, one might
expect that exit would be higher in more developed areas with more outside options for a
business owner (and hence lead to a positive relationship between economic development
and exit (see McKenzie and Paffhausen (2019)), outside opportunities also reduce entry and
thus subsequent exit. This highlights the importance of simultaneously examining entry and
exit for understanding the dynamics of informal businesses.


5.2    Performance of entrants and exiters overlaps

Entry and exit could contribute to improvements in aggregate productivity of the informal
sector if less productive businesses exit and entering businesses are more productive and
ultimately grow. In this subsection, we focus on the link between entry and exit and informal
business performance.
   To the extent that exiting informal businesses are less productive than continuing and

entering ones, the informal business dynamics from section 5.1 could contribute to a better
allocation of resources and aggregate labor productivity improvements. In Figure 6a, we
plot real monthly revenue for entering, exiting, and continuing informal businesses based on
pooled 3-survey panels.34 We plot residualized revenue by removing survey fixed effects. In
Figure 6b we also plot the number of household members working in these businesses.

Note: We removed survey fixed effects from the revenue distribution by regressing ln monthly revenue on survey fixed effects
      and then plotting the residuals. In panel (d), revenue per worker is calculated using only the 2004-06-8 panel.



    First, market selection is at work: the surviving informal businesses tend to perform
better than those that exit. The revenue distribution for the continuing informal businesses
is shifted to the right of the distribution of those exiting, although there is substantial
  34
     We define an entrant as a business that did not operate in year t-2, but operated in year t and an exiter
as one that did not operate in t+2, but operated in t. A continuer operated in all three surveys in the panel.


                                                                                       22
overlap.35 The patterns for informal firms are consistent with the role of exit in weeding out
inefficient firms in the formal sector (Roberts and Tybout, 1996; Tybout, 2000). A decision
to exit could be driven by firm-specific shocks that influence its profitability, such as low
productivity, increases in costs of inputs, or increased product market competition. These
are common reasons for exit of formal firms and the market selection evidence suggests they
also play a role among informal firms.
   Importantly, the entering informal businesses tend to perform equally to their exiting
counterparts. The two distributions nearly perfectly overlap in Figure 6a and are statistically
indistinguishable (see Figure A4 for the same figure with confidence intervals). We find
similar results using measures of revenue labor productivity in Figures 6c and 6d. This
pattern is at odds with the higher productivity of entrants relative to exiting firms found
among formal firms in developing countries (Roberts and Tybout, 1996; Aw et al., 2001),
where net entry can account for a sizable share of industry-level productivity improvements.
In Appendix section A.3, we plot distributions of estimated total factor productivity based
on a residual approach and find similar results.
   Many studies of informal firms focus on their employment as a key measure of their size
and performance (Hsieh and Klenow, 2014; Haltiwanger, 2015; McKenzie and Paffhausen,
2019). We find similar overlap in the number of household members that entering and
exiting informal non-farm businesses employ (Figure 6b). A little over 80 percent of exiting
and entering businesses have only 1 household member working in the business as compared
to slightly less than 70 percent for continuing businesses. Continuing businesses are about
twice as likely to have 2 household members working in the business and very few businesses,
continuers, entrants, or exiters, have more then 2 household members working in the business.
In Figure A7, we confirm these findings using the total number of workers, both household
members and from outside the household, for the 2004-06-08 panel (the only panel for which
this information is available). We also find overlap in education and hours worked by the
business owner for entrants and exiters (see Appendix section A.2).
   We have ruled out several explanations for the large overlap in performance between

entering and exiting informal businesses. The overlap is not primarily driven by creation
of informal non-farm business as a coping mechanism to smooth agricultural shocks as in
Adhvaryu et al. (2019). The overlap does not simply reflect adding and dropping of business
activities that are complementary to existing household activities, mismeasurement of busi-
nesses within a household, or churning in underlying household composition (see subsection
A.2 for details).
   Thus, despite market selection through the exit of less efficient informal firms, it is unlikely
that point-in-time entry and exit of informal firms contribute much to improvements in
aggregate productivity of the informal non-farm sector. We next examine post-entry growth
of entrants.


5.3    Modest survival and growth for entrants

The longer-term implications of entering firms on aggregate sector performance depend not
only on the initial performance of entrants, but also their post entry growth. Additional
analysis of post-entry performance suggests relatively modest performance of entrants two
years following entry.
   First, almost half of the informal entrants do not survive until the next survey. Figure
7 plots, for each three-survey panel, the share of businesses that enter in the middle survey
t (relative to the survey at t-2) and exit by the t+2 survey, spanning a period of 14 years.
Around 49% of informal entrants exit within 2 years, about twice the average rate of exit.
This large turnover contributes to the high degree of overlap between entrants and exiters
in Figure 6a, although substantial overlap persists after the removal of exiting entrants.
   Second, the initial revenue of entrants predicts post entry performance, highlighting that
market selection is at work. Figure 8 plots the initial monthly revenue distribution as well
as the number of household members working in the business for informal entrants at time t
for those that survive to t+2 and those that exit by t+2. Consistent with market selection,
the initial distribution of surviving entrants is positioned to the right of the distribution
of exiting entrants. Surviving entrants also somewhat increase monthly revenue two years
after the entry (see Figure A24 for a version with confidence intervals that demonstrates
the statistically significant differences in the distributions). However, the growth in revenue

                                         Figure 7: Share of entrants that exit by next survey


among surviving entrants is largely due to growth in the number of workers in the business
as Figures 8c and 8d show that the revenue per worker distributions for surviving entrants
at entry and two years later overlap to a much greater degree. Thus, it is not an increase
in labor productivity that is driving the revenue growth in Figure 8a, it is growth in the
number of workers.
   High exit rates of entering informal businesses and the survival of initially better per-
forming entrants are consistent with settings where firms learn about their productivity or
demand after entry and the lower performing firms exit (Jovanovic, 1982; Foster et al., 2008).
Some of this entry and exit might also reflect individual or household specific shocks (such as
dealing with a household income shock or an illness). They are also consistent with evidence
of exit being the highest among young small firms in studies that examine the link between
firm age and survival (Dunne et al., 1989; Haltiwanger et al., 2013), including in developing
countries (McKenzie and Paffhausen, 2019). We find evidence of this as well (Panel B of
Table A6).
   The modest average growth may hide significant growth among a small number of suc-
cessful surviving entrants if most entrants do not grow. Haltiwanger (2015) reports that
most young firms in the U.S. do not grow, but a small fraction experience rapid growth.

                      Figure 8: Distributions of surviving and exiting informal entrants

Note: We removed panel fixed effects from the revenue distribution by regressing ln monthly revenue on a series of indicators
for which 3-survey panel the business belongs to. We plot the residuals. In panel (d), revenue per worker is calculated using
                                                  only the 2004-06-8 panel.



A similar pattern is found among firms in developing countries (Fafchamps and Woodruff,
2017; McKenzie, 2017). Indeed, when we focus on employment (Figure 8b), we find that the
distribution of the number of household members working in surviving entrants two years
after the entry was not different from the employment at the time of the entry. Figure A25
shows the same plot using the total number of workers, household and non-household mem-
bers, for the 2004-06-08 panel and demonstrates marginally higher growth on average. We
explore transitions to higher employment using an employment transition matrix. Among
surviving entrants, in Table A7 we report the share of businesses based on the number of
household members working in the business in their start year and in the subsequent survey.
We pool across all 3-survey panels. We find that most businesses remain very small two


                                                                                26
years after entry, with only one or two household members working in the business.36 In
Appendix Section A.5, we provide additional evidence that surviving entrants experience
modest growth relative to continuing informal firms, in terms of the likelihood of survival
and the contribution to the share of firms, revenue and hiring of workers in the informal
sector in the two years following the entry.
   In the analysis so far, we can only follow entrants for two years after entry. Hsieh and
Klenow (2014) and Foster et al. (2008) note that it might take time for firms to grow after
entry. Although this is an important concern, it is useful to keep in mind that almost 50%
of entrants exit within the first two years. We, in part, overcome this concern by additional
analysis of performance of continuing firms.
   In Appendix Section A.6 we find gradual improvements in the performance of continuing
informal businesses with age, relative to 0-2 year old businesses. Businesses that survive
8-12 and 13-17 years post entry are more likely to hire outside workers, have more workers,
and higher monthly revenue. Unlike the panel-data analysis above, the observed trends
could reflect performance improvements or selection of better firms over time. It is thus
important to keep in mind that about 25% of continuing firms survive to age 8-12 and
10% to 13-17 years. Further analysis of continuing firms in Appendix Section A.7 confirms
that despite market selection at work, most informal firms to do not contribute much to
aggregate employment (beyond the family work). The existing literature has emphasized
hiring of paid workers (outside of the family) and formalization as indicators of business
expansion (de Mel et al., 2010, 2013). Yet, we find that transitioning to employing paid
workers and formalization is rare even for continuing firms.
   In summary, although we find some evidence in Sections 5.2 and 5.3 that market selection
influences informal business dynamics, the large overlap in performance of entrants and
exiters and modest post-entry growth of entrants are consistent with little net effect of entry
and exit on aggregate (revenue) productivity or hiring of workers outside the household.
Market selection is only one factor influencing entry and exit of informal businesses, with
a broader range of owner-specific characteristics and shocks potentially also playing a role
  36
     In Table A8 we report the same transitions matrix but focus on the total number of workers, both from
within and outside the household. The results are very similar as most businesses do not employ workers
from outside the household.


                                                   27
(Maloney, 2004; Hurst and Pugsley, 2011; Astebro et al., 2014). The overlap in performance
is consistent with the idea that informal businesses might enter (or exit) the market because
their owners do not have alternative means of employment and need to rely on the informal
business to generate income (Gollin, 2008; La Porta and Shleifer, 2008, 2014). In these
cases, underlying entrepreneurial ability or productivity of the business is only one factor
influencing entry and exit decisions. Consistent with Hurst and Pugsley (2011) and Astebro
et al. (2014), owners list a wide range of exit reasons (Section A.4). The most common
is "other activities with more income," accounting for 27% of all exits and which is more
common in richer areas, where entry and exit are lower on average (Figure 5). We further
explore how entry and exit affect individual income in Section 5.4 and the role of the owner's
education and outside employment opportunities that vary with the level and structure of
development for entry and exit in Section 6.


5.4     Entry and exit matter for individual income

Entry and exit could still contribute importantly toward the livelihoods of their owners. To
the extent that informal business income accounts for a sizable share of household income,
entry and exit could expose households to large income fluctuations. Income from informal
businesses accounts, on average, for 20% of household income in Vietnam.37 In this subsec-
tion, we examine whether business entry and exit is associated with significant changes in
individual income.
   To do so, we construct a sample of informal business owners that either (i) operated
an informal business in surveys t and t+2, (ii) operated an informal business in survey t,
but not t+2 (an exit), or (iii) operated an informal business in survey t+2, but not t (an
entrant). We sum profits from the business and any additional wage jobs reported by the
owner. We exclude any informal business owners that also report additional self-employment
income, such as from household agriculture, due to the difficulty of assigning such income
across multiple household members participating in the activity.
  37
     Benjamin et al. (2017) estimate that formal and informal businesses accounted for 22.4% of household
income in the 2008 survey and informal businesses accounted for 91.9% of profits in the cross section of
businesses in 2008.



                                                   28
    We estimate the following equation using data from each of the 2-survey panels:


                                Yit = 1 exitit + 2 enterit + t +         it                            (1)


where Yit is the change in owner i's income during panel t, exit is an indicator variable
for business exit, enter is an indicator variable for business entry, and t are panel fixed
effects. Owners that continue to operate an informal business are the reference group.
This specification is similar to McKenzie and Paffhausen (2019) except that it also includes
informal business entry.
    We find that informal business entry and exit indeed significantly contribute to changes in
the owner's income, as reported in Table 3. In columns 1 and 2 the dependent variable is the
change in owner income, with observations in the top and bottom percentiles windsorized
in column 2. Since informal business earnings are measured with potentially large errors
(de Mel et al., 2009), we also report a specification based on an indicator for a positive
change in household income in column 3. We find that exit is associated with a reduction in
an owner's income and entry is associated with an increase in an owner's income. Relative
to the overall mean change in owner income of 13, the loss and gain of income associated
with closing and starting a business is important. The reduction in income in connection
with exit is consistent with results from McKenzie and Paffhausen (2019).38 In appendix
section A.8 we use household income and thus capture all income generating activities in the
household, even those attributed to multiple members. We find a similar pattern of results.
    Overall, this analysis highlights that even though entry and exit of informal businesses
might not contribute significantly to the aggregate share of household income derived from
informal businesses, it does have a significant impact on individual and household income.
Entry enhances individual and household and income and exit reduces them. Entry and
exit of informal businesses are therefore important factors to consider when thinking about
income fluctuations for households in low-income countries.
  38
     Unfortunately, the VHLSSs do not survey individuals about reasons for shutting down their business
to directly examine whether individuals that shut down their business for better economic opportunities
observe increases in income. McKenzie and Paffhausen (2019) find that negative exit gets reversed for those
the owners that report they are exiting due to better opportunities. However, their data does not enable
them to examine entry.

 Notes: The dependent variable in columns 1 and 2 is the change in individual income (including wages and
profits) and in column 3 is an indicator for a positive change. The sample is all individuals that operated
an informal businesses in either or both surveys of each 2-survey panel. We exclude individuals that worked
in self-employment in agriculture. Observations in column 2 have been windsorized at the 1st and 99th
percentiles. Panel fixed effects are included in each regression. All income are reported in million VND (Jan
2018 prices).


6     What do owners do before and after operating a
      business?
We further connect entry and exit patterns of informal businesses to the education and
economic activities of their owners, who are the key production input in an informal business.
Our data allows us to systematically compare education and economic activities of informal
business owners that are starting or shutting down a business to the education and economic
activities of the overall working-age population. This analysis sheds further light on the high
overlap in the performance of entering and exiting informal businesses, the high correlation
between entry and exit, and how entry and exit vary across time and space with the level
and sectoral structure of economic development.


6.1     Owners have intermediate levels of education

To set the stage, we compare the education of owners of informal businesses and workers
economy-wide across economic activities. We focus on an individual's most time consuming
job during the past 12 months and distinguish between wage work and self-employment
in agriculture and the informal and formal sectors outside of agriculture. Self-employment
includes both owners of businesses as well as unpaid family members.


                                                      30
   Individuals with relatively low levels of education are self-employed in informal businesses,
especially when compared to wage workers in the formal sector (Table 4).39 With an average
of 8.3 years of education, the self-employed in the informal sector are more educated than
self-employed and wage workers in agriculture. However, they have substantially lower levels
of education than wage workers in the formal sector, who have completed on average 10.5
years of education.

   Even informal business owners that hire workers tend to be less educated than wage
workers in the formal sector. In Table 5 we focus specifically on owners of informal businesses
and distinguish between owners that hire and those that do not.40 Owners of informal
businesses that hire workers have 9.1 years of education, less than wage workers in the
formal sector. Informal business owners that do not hire (which accounts for most of the
informal businesses) have similar education levels as wage workers in the informal sector.
These patterns persist throughout our 14-year sample. Years of education is clearly an
imperfect measure of an individual's ability. However, studies such as de Mel et al. (2010)
that measure ability based on years of education and more specific tests (such as score on
digit span recall test, Raven test, and Cognitive reflection test) reach similar conclusions
across these measures.
  39
     The mean grade reported is based on highest grade completed up to grade 12.
  40
     We include all owners, including those running a business as a job beyond their most time consuming
job. In instances in which an owner operates more than one business, we only include the owner once.

    Our results have several implications. This analysis highlights relatively low levels of
education among informal non-farm business owners, especially relative to wage earners
in the formal sector. Earlier studies find that microenterprise owners tend to have lower
levels of education than owners of businesses that hire workers and comparable education
to wage workers (La Porta and Shleifer, 2008; de Mel et al., 2010; Woodruff, 2012). We
show that it is important to distinguish comparisons with informal and formal wage work.
Even owners of more successful informal businesses that hire workers are on average less
educated than formal wage workers. This is consistent with theories that suggest that more
educated individuals select into wage work in the formal sector (rather than run an informal
business) when formal wage work is available (Lucas, 1978; Gollin, 2008). Other studies
have emphasized the role of owner characteristics such as risk aversion, overconfidence, and
nonpecuniary tastes to explain entry and persistence of entrepreneurship (Maloney, 2004;
Hurst and Pugsley, 2011; Astebro et al., 2014), which our data does not allow us to examine.
As the literature review in Section 2 suggests owners could also differ in their exposure to
market imperfections, including access to credit. However, the large differences in education
might affect individuals' ability to transition in and out of owning an informal business into
other activities and thus influence the patterns of entry and exit. We next more directly
focus on these transitions and the education of individuals that transition in and out of
informal businesses.

6.2     Economic activities of owners prior to starting and after shut-
        ting down a business overlap

We systematically examine the economic activities of business owners prior to starting or
after closing down an informal business. We compare owner transitions to the rates of
transitions between activities among the working age (15 to 64) population. Table 6 presents
the results.41 The activities in which the working age population is engaged are listed in row
headings. The share of informal owners entering from and exiting to each activity is reported
in columns 1 and 2, respectively. The average grade of a person starting a business after
each activity is reported in column 3 and the mean grade of the informal business owner
shutting down the business and transitions to each activity is reported in column 4. Several
interesting patterns emerge.

    There is a large overlap in economic activities and in levels of education of most entering
and exiting informal business owners. In particular, the share of individuals that start or
shut down an informal business from a particular activity is very similar, with activities that
account for a high share of activities of business owners before the entry also accounting for a
  41
     The analysis for the working age population proceeds as follows. We look at all working age individuals
in the survey in year t and then track what activity they are doing in year t+2 and report this as second
survey. Similarly, we look at all working age individuals in survey t+2 and track what activity they were
doing in survey t and report this as first survey.

                                                    33
high share of activities to which the business owners return after closing down the business.
Along the same lines, education levels of business owners leaving/returning to a category
before and after running a business are similar to each other, as well as similar to the general
education levels for that category in Table 4.42 This overlap in economic activities and levels
of education of most entering and exiting informal business owners might contribute to the
overlap in performance of entering and exiting informal businesses noted in Subsection 5.2
and Figure 6.
    Importantly, the last two rows of the table show the importance of transitions in and
out of the household and in and out of the workforce. Jointly, these two categories account
for 20-26% of owner transitions. Individuals joining households account for 10% of entry
of informal businesses, while individuals departing households account for 16% of informal
business exit. These might not reflect true entry or exit as we cannot track the owner before
joining or after leaving the household. Such changes in household composition introduce
a common measurement issue that we have dealt with throughout the paper and others
working on this topic must address as well. Transitions in and out of the workforce, 10-
11% of owner transitions, also matter and illustrate the role of individual characteristics or
household-specific shocks affecting entry and exit of informal household businesses. Some
of these movements are consistent with a number of these businesses being run alongside
household responsibilities such as housework (the reason for not working given by around
50% of non-working individuals).43 Other household or individual specific shocks play a role
in business entry and exit. The second most common reason for being out of the workforce
is small/at school before entry (16%) and too old/retired, particularly after exiting (25% of
business owners that exit to out of the workforce report being too old/retired). Disabled/ill
is another notable category, especially after exiting.
   42
      The exception is education of formal wage workers that start a business being noticeably higher and
education of those moving from the formal sector self-employment being lower than the average education in
the formal wage and self-employment sector. This is consistent with more marginal people moving between
the two sectors as in McCaig and Pavcnik (2015).
   43
      The 2008, 2014, 2016, and 2018 surveys ask respondents who answered that they did not work during
the past year to indicate the main reason for not working. We use this data restricted to informal business
owners age 15 to 64 prior to opening a business or after closing a business.




                                                    34
6.3     Transitions in and out of informal businesses reflect the struc-
        ture of employment

The transitions to starting or exiting an informal business in large part reflect the under-
lying structure of employment/participation of the working age population across economic
activities. The most common transition to starting or exiting an informal business in Table
6 is self-employment in agriculture, accounting for 37% of entrants and 34% of exit. Note
that education levels of owners in agriculture are the lowest among all groups in Table 4.
Transitions from and to wage work or self-employment in the informal sector are also com-
mon, jointly accounting for almost 30% of transitions. Fewer individuals are transitioning to
and from wage work in the formal sector. About 10% of owners start an informal business
after being employed as a wage worker in the formal sector (and 9.7% leave for that sector).
Transitions from and to wage work in agriculture and self-employment in the formal sector
are very rare.
    The right panel of Table 6 confirms the transitions to and from operating an informal
business in columns 1 and 2 are relatively similar to the overall distribution of workers across
these activities in the economy. The panel reports the share of participation in each activity
among the overall working age population. The first such column is based on members of
panel households in the end survey of the two-survey panels and reports what they were
doing in the start survey (to be compared to activities before business entry in column 1).
The second such column is based on members of panel households in the start survey and
reports what they were doing in the end survey (to be compared to activities after business
exit in column 2). For example, among the overall working age population, 33 to 34% are
self-employed in agriculture, which is very close to the rate of transitions into self-employed
agriculture to and from operating an informal business.44
    Nonetheless, there are some education-related deviations from these economy-wide pat-
terns in Table 6. Most notably, relative to the working-age population, informal business
owners are more likely to work in informal wage work before or after running a business
  44
      The larger share of not in the workforce in the working age population, especially in the first survey,
is largely driven by individuals age 15 to 20, likely due to still being in school. If we restrict the sample
to individuals ages 20 to 64, the share out of the workforce becomes more similar to transitioning informal
business owners.


                                                     35
and they are less likely to work in formal wage work. These deviations might be related to
differences in education levels across these categories. Education levels of wage workers and
self-employed in the informal sector are comparable, particularly for owners that do not hire
(see Tables 4 and 5), as are the average levels of education of informal business owners that
enter and exit from these two activities (see columns 3 and 4 of Table 6), making these activ-
ities more substitutable for each other. On the other hand, informal business owners are on
average less educated than wage workers in the formal sector (see Table 4) and individuals
that start or shut down an informal business from and to formal wage work tend to have on
average two more years of education than than informal business owners that start or shut
down an informal business. More educated individuals with formal wage jobs potentially
have better employment opportunities than running an informal business, consistent with
(Gollin, 2008).45


6.4     Structure of employment matters for transitions over time and
        space

The importance of the underlying structure of employment for transitions in and out of
owning an informal business is further confirmed by examining what informal business owners
do before and after operating a business at the beginning and end of our sample, a period
during which GDP per capita nearly doubled and significant structural change occurred
(see Section 4 for details). Recall that entry and exit rates fell over this period (Figure 4).
Appendix Table A5 repeats the analysis of Table 6 but reports the transitions separately
for the first two-survey panel, 2006-08, and the last two-survey panel, 2016-18. In general,
as the underlying structure of employment changes away from agricultural self-employment
toward wage work in the formal sector, so has the nature of transitions for owners of informal
businesses. Transitions to and from self-employment in agriculture have become less common
  45
      In addition, relative to the working-age population, informal business owners starting a business are
less likely to be out of the workforce and somewhat more likely to be joining or leaving a household than
the overall working age population. This highlights that these transitions, which tend to be associated with
individual or household specific-shocks, need to be considered in studying of entry and exit of informal
businesses. Individuals that have a business are more likely not to be part of the household in the previous
period than general working-age population. Individual that have a business are more likely to leave the
household than the general population.


                                                    36
for informal business owners over time, while transitions to wage work in the formal sector
have increased.
   Finally, the entry and exit transitions are also influenced by the level of local economic
development. In Table 7 we separate the results from Table 6 by provincial income, focusing
on the 15 richest and 15 poorest provinces. There are large differences in the pre-entry and
post-exit economic activities of business owners across the two sets of provinces. Transitions
from and to self-employment in agriculture account for 67 and 59% of transitions in the
poorest provinces, while only for 23 and 17% of transitions in the richest provinces. In
the richest provinces, it is more common for informal business owners to be transitioning
from and to informal wage work and informal self-employment than in the poorer provinces.
Likewise, the richest provinces also have a higher share of transitions to and from wage
work in the formal sector than in the poorer provinces. This evidence is consistent with the
differences in employment opportunities present in these two sets of provinces and consistent
with lower entry and exit rates of informal businesses in richer provinces noted in Figure 5
in Subsection 5.1.
   Overall, this analysis suggests that transitions mostly reflect the underlying structure of
employment in the economy, with education gaps also playing a role. Net entry into infor-
mal non-farm businesses from self-employment in agriculture is consistently positive, both
across time and locations. Transitioning to and from self-employment in agriculture falls
with economic development both over time and across provinces. This underscores the role
of net entry into informal non-farm businesses from agriculture in the process of structural
change, particularly in poorer provinces where employment opportunities in the formal sec-
tor are more limited than in richer provinces. This suggest that informal businesses may
serve as a stepping stone out of agriculture. Overall, this evidence is consistent with out-
side employment opportunities of individuals affecting exit and entry of informal businesses
(Gollin, 2008; La Porta and Shleifer, 2008). This highlights the importance of examining the
dynamics of informal business entry and exit in the economy-wide context.

7     Conclusion
Our study highlights several advantages of studying informal business entry and exit with
nationally representative panel data that matches owners and businesses in a fast-growing,
low-income country, spanning a period of 15 years. We can follow about 48,000 informal
firms over a period of up to four years (most studies cannot), including the activities of
their owners before and after operating an informal business. The analysis improves our
understanding of the economics of informal firm entry and exit in several dimensions.
    For example, it highlights the importance of simultaneously examining entry and exit
for understanding the dynamics of informal businesses. Entry and exit rates are similar
(14-18%) and highly correlated at a point in time. Aggregate entry and exit decline with
economic development over time, while previous work found a positive relationship between



                                                    38
economic development and exit across countries (McKenzie and Paffhausen, 2019). Despite
a greater prevalence of non-farm informal businesses in richer provinces, entry and exit rates
are lower in these provinces relative to poorer provinces. Although everything else equal,
one might expect that exit would be higher in more developed areas with better outside
options for a business owner (and hence lead to a positive relationship between economic
development and exit), better outside opportunities are also associated with reduced entry.
   Second, despite a significant amount of churning, net entry and market selection has
little effect on aggregate productivity and hiring of workers outside the family in informal
firms. Although less productive informal businesses are more likely to exit, the productivity
of new entrants perfectly overlaps that of exiting businesses. This is in contrast to what has
been shown for formal firms in developing countries (Aw et al., 2001; Roberts and Tybout,
1996) and to our knowledge this has not been studied for informal firms. Moreover, almost
half of the entrants exit within two years and the surviving entrants demonstrate modest
growth in revenue and employment, not contributing much to improvements in aggregate
productivity in the sector nor hiring of workers outside the family. This is consistent with
Hsieh and Klenow (2014) who follow cohorts of firms over time, but don't observe gross
exit and entry. Despite churning mattering little for aggregate performance, it matters
for individual households: business exit and entry are associated with large decreases and
increases in household income, respectively. Moreover, the entry and exit might be closely
tied to the owner's characteristics (Maloney, 2004; Hurst and Pugsley, 2011; Astebro et al.,
2014), alternative employment opportunities (La Porta and Shleifer, 2008; Gollin, 2008), or
individual or household-specific shocks (such as age of the owner, illness in the family).
   Third, the large overlap in revenue of entering and exiting informal businesses and the
high correlation between entry and exit rates are related to the education and outside employ-
ment opportunities of business owners. The individuals that start or shut down a business
have very similar levels of education. They are less educated on average than wage workers
in the formal sector, which is consistent with Lucas (1978); Gollin (2008), but they are better
educated than workers in agriculture.
   Fourth, our analysis highlights the importance of examining economic activities of owners
before and after operating a business with nationally representative data, which is rare. We


                                              39
show that the share of individuals that start or shut down a business from a particular
economic activity reflects the underlying structure of economic activities of the working age
population, with education also playing a role. The most common transition into non-farm
businesses is to and from self-employment in agriculture within a location. The likelihood of
this transition declines with economic development (both across provinces and over time),
highlighting the role of net entry into informal non-farm businesses in structural change out
of agriculture. This suggest that informal businesses may serve as a stepping stone out of
agriculture and complements existing work focused on informal businesses in major cities or
urban areas (de Mel et al., 2010; Maloney, 2004). Our analysis suggests that it is important
to keep in mind labor market linkages across agriculture and non-farm informal businesses.
As the formal sector has grown, we see more transitions to and from wage work in the formal
sector.
   Our analysis focuses on informal businesses and shows that their dynamics are influenced
by the underlying local economic structure. This demonstrates the importance of studying
more broadly how the informal sector interacts with both agriculture and the formal sector.
Our current analysis suggests that informal businesses in Vietnam do not often formalize,
but individuals­particularly younger ones­ do transition from employment in the informal
to the formal sector (McCaig and Pavcnik, 2015, 2018). Recent literature from other coun-
tries demonstrates important interactions between the informal and formal sectors (see, for
example, evidence from Bangladesh (Gutierrez et al., 2019), Brazil (Ulyssea, 2018), India
(Allen et al., 2018) and Mexico (Koelle, 2019)). This highlights the importance of examining
both the informal and formal sector to understand the sources of economy-wide growth and
the allocation of resources between the informal and formal sectors.

A      Supplementary Analysis
In this appendix, we provide supplementary analysis that either extends or confirms the
results presented in the main text.


A.1      Trends over time and variation over space

In this subsection, we extend the results from section 4. We do so by discussing additional
evidence on trends over time and variation across space in informal business performance.
    As the share of households operating an informal business has fallen, the informal busi-
nesses look marginally more successful, as measured by the share that hire workers, operates
as the owner's primary job, and operates as a year-round business. Table 2 displays the
share of informal businesses that hire workers, operates as the owner's primary job, and
operates as a year-round business. Hiring of workers is measured with reports of positive
labor expenses, while year-around operation is measured as the share of businesses that re-
port operating for all 12 months during the previous year.46 It shows increases over time in
these three dimensions of business performance.47 The share of informal businesses operated
as the owner's primary job has grown from 0.76 in 2006 to 0.84 in 2018, while the share
of year-round informal businesses increased from 0.59 to 0.73. Although very few informal
businesses hire paid workers (only 9% in 2006), the share has been increasing over time to
12% in 2018. The existing literature has emphasized hiring of paid workers (outside of the
family) as a particularly important milestone of business performance and expansion (de Mel
et al., 2010, 2013). The low share at the end of the sample highlights how rare it is for an
informal business to hire paid workers (outside of the family members).
    The most common industries in which informal businesses operate have not changed
much over time. Figure A1 reports the share of informal businesses operating in the five
  46
      The business module of the 2006 and 2008 surveys asked directly about the number of paid workers
and positive labor expenses. Across these two surveys, 96% of informal businesses give consistent answers
across these two questions.
   47
      We do not include standard errors in the table given the already large size of the table, but the change
between the start and end surveys are statistically significant at the 5% level.

most common industries. Retail remains the most common industry by far, although its
share fell from 39 to 35%. In total, the share of informal businesses in the five most common
industries fell from 75 to 67% between 2006 and 2018. In section 5, we return to these
industries to compare their entry and exit rates.

                  Figure A1: Most common industries for informal businesses


   Provinces within Vietnam range in their level of income and differ in their underlying
economic structure. This provincial variation enables us to compare informal business char-
acteristics across space, ranging from GDP per capita PPP 1796 USD in 2017 dollars to
12,053 USD over a period of 15 years.48
   Figure A2 displays that the share of informal businesses that hire outside labor, that
operate as the owner's primary job, and that operate year-round is higher in provinces with
higher income. Hence, not only the incidence of operating an informal business, but also the
characteristics of these businesses vary with the level and structure of development across
  48
     These estimates are derived from estimates of GDP by province in 2010 from statistical yearbooks.
The weighted sum of provincial estimates of GDP per capita exceeds the national estimate. As such, we
adjust the provincial estimates of GDP per capita downward such that they sum to the national estimate
of GDP per capita as reported by the General Statistics Office and reproduced in the World Development
Indicators (WDI) database. We then convert the estimates to PPP adjusted 2017 constant USD using an
adjustment factor derived from the WDI database. The range is from Vietnam's poorest province, Ha Giang,
to Vietnam's second richest province, Binh Duong. We exclude Ba Ria-Vung Tau due to its significantly
higher level of GDP per capita from oil deposits.

A.2                                     Robustness and extension of revenue overlap among entrants
                                        and exiters

In this subsection, we describe robustness checks and extensions to the evidence provided in
subsection 5.2 that the performance of entrants and exiters overlaps.
    We have examined (and ruled out) several explanations for the large overlap in perfor-
mance between entering and exiting informal businesses. The creation of informal non-farm
business as a coping mechanism to smooth agricultural shocks as in Adhvaryu et al. (2019)
cannot explain most of the overlap. If non-farm informal businesses mainly help household

                                                                                                     49
smooth agricultural shocks, the new businesses might not necessarily be more productive.
The overlap would then be predominately driven by informal businesses whose owners enter
from agriculture and/or exit to agriculture. However, the overlap exists for businesses of
owners that enter/exit from agriculture and non-agriculture. The overlap is present in rural
and urban samples (although is somewhat stronger in rural areas) and in all industries.
   Second, the overlap does not simply reflect adding and dropping of business activities
that are complementary to existing household activities or mismeasurement of businesses
within a household. It persists when we repeat the analysis using a household (rather than
a business) as the unit of observation. The overlap persists when a household adds or drop
a new business (when it did not have one) versus adding an additional businesses. Finally,
the overlap does not simply reflect churning in underlying household composition, that is,
it is not driven by people that own a business joining or leaving the household (see Figure
A3).

   In Figure A5 we display the distribution of monthly hours worked by the owner. Recall
that a large majority of informal businesses have only the owner as a worker and thus the
hours spent working by the owner is the only labor input for the majority of these businesses.
Here too we see strong evidence of an overlap in hours worked by the owner for entering and
exiting businesses and the owners of exiting and entering businesses work fewer hours in a
month, on average, than owners of continuing businesses.
   In addition to similar hours worked by owners in entering and exiting businesses, the
human capital of the owners, as measured by highest grade completed, also substantially
overlap. In Figure A6 we report the share of owners by highest grade completed. We pool
across 2-survey panels. Entering owners are those that operated a business at the end of the
panel, but not at the beginning, and exiting owners are those that operated a business at
the beginning of the panel, but not at the end. The share of exiting owners with a specific

Note: The sample is informal businesses in the middle survey of all 3-survey panels. A continuer is a business that operated in
all three surveys. An entrant is a business that operated in the middle survey, but not in first survey. An exiter is a business
 that operated in middle survey, but not in the last survey. We removed survey fixed effects from the hours distribution by
 regressing hours on a constant and survey fixed effects for 2012, 2014, and 2016. We then subtracted the estimated survey
                                             fixed effects for 2012, 2014, and 2016.



highest completed grade is extremely similar to the share of entering owners with the same
highest completed grade. The results are very similar for each 2-survey panel and thus we do
not report them. Thus, the evidence for two important factors of production, hours worked
by the owner and the human capital of the owner, show the same high degree of overlap as
revenue for entrants and exiters.
    We conclude this subsection by examining the robustness of Figure 6b which shows the
high degree of overlap between entrants and exiters in terms of the number of household mem-
bers working in the business. The 2004-06-08 panel allows us to address whether the same
pattern is observed using total number of workers in the business. Figure A7 demonstrates
that using the total number of workers leads to the same conclusions: the vast majority of
entrants and exiters have only one worker (the owner) and more broadly that the distribution
of the number of workers is very similar for entrants and exiters. This confirms the results
in Figure 6b.

A.3      Residual based measure of productivity

In subsection 5.2 we showed that the revenue distribution of entrants and exiters nearly
perfectly overlapped. Here, we pursue a residual-based way of estimating total factor pro-
ductivity (TFP).
    Measuring TFP is challenging in most firm datasets, but the challenges are even greater
in this context where we do not have reported capital for the businesses. Nonetheless, we can
incrementally move closer to TFP by using information on the number of reported workers
in the business and information on expenses. We have information on the number of workers
in the business (both household and non-household members) in the 2006 and 2008 surveys
and thus limit the analysis to these surveys. We estimate a residual based measure of TFP
based on the following specification:


                                                                  j
                                    yik = k + li +             j Di +   i                                (2)
                                                          j

    where yik is the ln of real revenue of business i in industry k , k is an industry fixed effect,
                                 j
li is ln number of workers, and Di is a series of indicator variables for positive expenses for
expense item j (materials, non-durable tools, repairs, depreciation, rent, labor, interest,
taxes, energy and water, and other).49 When we do this in the 2006 and 2008 repeated cross
sections, we find that the correlation between ln revenue and the residual from the above
equation is 0.74 in 2006 and 0.75 in 2008. The high correlation suggests that using revenue
may be a reasonable proxy for TFP in this context.
    Figure A8 shows the distribution of this residual-based estimate of TFP for entrants,
exiters, and continuers in the 2004-06-08 panel. It is consistent with the revenue distributions
shown in Figure 6 as the distributions for entrants and exiters are essentially identical and
shifted to the left of that for continuing informal firms.
  49
     We remove observations in industries with fewer than 10 businesses. In the 2006 cross section this leads
to the removal of 42 out of 20,001 informal businesses.

                                          that operated in 2006, but not in 2008.



A.4        Why do informal firms exit?

The analysis in subsections 5.1 and 5.2 highlights that informal business entry and exit
are in part systematically related to the level of economic development and productivity of
informal business. More generally, a decision to exit could be driven by firm-specific shocks
that influence its profitability, such as low firm productivity, increases in costs of inputs, or
increased product market competition. These are common reasons for exit of formal firms.
Because informal businesses usually have only one worker, the owner, the decision to close
down the business can also depend on alternative employment opportunities of the owner
(such as wage employment), or shocks to the owner health or household (such as age and
health of the owner or illness in the family).
   In order to further examine the reasons for informal business exit, we rely on a survey
of former business owners that asked the owners about specific reasons for exit. Table
A1 displays the results. It reports the reasons for all businesses, as well as for businesses
located in provinces above and below the median provincial per capital income.50 First,

       These results are based on all exiting businesses owned by the household surveyed in a special module

more profitable economic opportunities are the most common reported reason for exit. In
particular "Other activities with more income" is the most common reason stated for exit,
accounting for 27% of the exits. This answer is more prevalent in richer provinces. To
the extent that "Other activities with more income" also influence entry, this evidence is
consistent with the negative relationship between exit and entry rates and provincial income
per capita in Figure 5.51 Production-level shocks are also important jointly as a reason for
exit, including because of "Lack of capital/credit" (9.2%), "Increase in production cost"
(6.5%), and "Loss of main source of inputs" (4.5%). 4.2% of owners mention lower price for
the reason to exit. Finally, owner and household-specific factors also play a role. 10% of
businesses exit because the owner is "Too old and not strong enough" and 9.9% due to "the
drop in number of laborers within the household." Both of these reasons are more prevalent
in poorer provinces, where we would more likely expect imperfections in the labor market,
in part due to outmigration of younger workers to more prosperous provinces. Finally, 27%
of exiting business report the residual category "i.e. other," as a reason to exit, highlighting
the heterogeneity in reasons for exiting across owners.
of the 2004 VHLSS. The survey includes both informal and formal businesses, but the vast majority of
businesses owned by the household at the time are informal. Even two years after this survey, only 2.2% of
businesses owned by households were formal.
   51
      Unfortunately, the surveys do not provide information on reasons for why informal businesses enter. The
decision to enter could be due to the owner having a good business idea or foreseeing a market opportunity,
lack of other employment opportunities, or coping with negative household shocks.

A.5       Growth of surviving entrants

In this subsection, we expand on the results shown in subsection 5.3 on the performance of
entering informal firms.
   Survival among entrants is less likely than the survival of equally performing continuing
firms. Figure A9 plots the probability of survival of entrants and continuing informal firms in
t+2 in relationship to their monthly revenue. Although the probability of survival increases
with revenue for both set of firms, informal entrants are less likely to survive than continuing
informal firms with the same revenue. This illustrates the difficulties of survival for new
informal businesses.

             Figure A9: Share of informal businesses that survive by initial revenue

 Note: The sample is based on all informal businesses that operated in the first survey in the 2-survey panels. We removed
  survey fixed effects from the revenue distribution by regressing ln monthly revenue on survey fixed effects. We plot the
                                                          residuals.



   Finally, although initially more successful entrants survive, they do not contribute much
to aggregate outcomes in the informal sector, including the share of firms, revenue, or em-
ployment. Figure A10 (a) plots the entrants that survive to t+2 as a share of all informal
firms. Surviving entrants constitute 15-17.5% of all informal firms. Panel (b) plots the share
of total informal sector revenue in the year of entry, survey t, and in the subsequent survey
at t+2 for entrants that will survive up to t+2. The surviving informal entrants account on

average for about 12-13% of total revenue among informal businesses, less than their share
of informal businesses. Interestingly, while the surviving informal entrants do not expand
substantially between 2006 and 2008 or between 2014 and 2016, there is some evidence of
relative expansion in the other years, consistent with positive growth subsequent to entry.
This perhaps highlights the positive selection into entrants over time (and their subsequent
higher growth).
    Figure A10 (c) plots the share of informal businesses that hire workers that is accounted
for by surviving entrants. About 15% of informal businesses that hire workers are surviving
entrants, right around their respective share of informal businesses. Hence, surviving entrants
are smaller on average in terms of revenue, but about equally likely to be engaged in hiring
workers outside the household as other informal businesses. There is no clear pattern that
the share of businesses hiring workers moves disproportionately toward entrants over time,

A.6     Informal business performance and age

In this subsection, we build on the results in subsection 5.3 by focusing on the relationship
between the age of informal businesses and several performance measures (see Hsieh and
Klenow (2014) for analysis with formal and informal firms in India and Mexico). In partic-
ular, we plot the relationship between informal business age and five outcomes: the share
of businesses that report positive labor expenses, the average number of workers, average
monthly revenue, the share of businesses that operated for the past 12 months, and the share
that are the owner's primary job. We also report the age distribution of informal firms. We
use the 2006 and 2008 repeated cross sections as the age of the business is only available in
these surveys. These plots are presented in Figure A11. The informal firms are grouped into
0-2, 3-7, 8-12, and 13-17 year old firms. Of course, unlike the panel-data analysis above, this
analysis cannot distinguish whether the observed trends are related to changes within infor-
mal businesses or simply reflect the selection of better firms over time. With that in mind, all
five figures show a gradual increase in the performance measure with the age of the business.
Importantly, there is no statistically significant difference between the performance of 0-2
year old informal businesses and 3-7 year old businesses for positive labor expenses, number
of workers, and monthly revenue. However, businesses that survive 8-12 and 13-17 years
post entry are more likely to have positive labor expenses, have a higher average number
or workers, and higher monthly revenue than businesses that 0-2 years old. The estimates
suggest a 33% increase in the incidence of positive labor expenses, a 20% increase in the
number of workers, and almost a doubling of monthly revenue over a period of 11-15 years.
However, note that only 10% of businesses survive 13-17 years post entry. Operating for
the past 12 months and being the owner's primary both show the same positive relationship
with age as the other measures, but with a more pronounced increased between 0-2 and 3-7
years old.

A.7     Do informal businesses get better over time?

In this subsection, we expand the analysis from subsection 5.3, which examined growth
among surviving entrants, to focus on growth among continuing informal businesses.
   How likely are continuing informal firms to grow and transition to formal businesses
over time and across provinces that vary in initial prosperity? The existing literature has
emphasized hiring of paid workers (outside of the family) and formalization as indicators
of business expansion (de Mel et al., 2010, 2013). Recall from Table 2 that the share of
informal businesses that hire workers beyond family labor in Vietnam, that is, have positive
labor expenses, is very low, but increases from 9.0% in 2006 to 11.6% in 2018. In addition,
the share of formal businesses is also very low (Figure A14). Operating as the manager's
main job and all year round are more common (and also increases over time). However, that
analysis does not distinguish how transitioning from no workers to hiring non-family workers
(or formalization) changes over time and space with economics development.
   Further analysis indicates that transitioning to employing paid workers is rare among
continuing informal businesses. Only 4.5% of surviving informal firms that do not initially
hire paid employees report doing so within 2 years (Figure A12a).
   Becoming a formal business is even more rare. Figure A12b plots the share of informal
businesses that become formal. Interestingly, this probability increases slightly over time
from 1.5% in 2008 to about 2% in 2018, but it still remains very low.
   In contrast, it is more common for an informal business to operate as the owner's main
job and operate all year around, as well as to become the owner's primary job or to start
operating all year (Figures A12c and A12d). Around 40% of surviving informal businesses
that were not the manager's primary job become so within two years. Similarly, between
42 and 44% of surviving informal businesses that were not operating all year begin to do so
within two years. The higher likelihood of transitioning to being the manager's primary job
or to operating all year is consistent with the aggregate trends shown in Table 2. However,
over the span of 15 years (during which the share of households having an informal business
is declining), these relationships are relatively stable over time, suggesting that even in times
of economic growth, transitioning to hiring and formalization is hard.

Figure A12: Share of informal firms that start to hire, formalize, become the primary job,

    The probability of starting to hire workers, formalize, become the primary job of the
owner, and operate all year is closely related to informal business performance. In particu-
lar, it increases with past revenue (see Figure A13a).52 This figure further highlights that
even the best performing informal firms face a low likelihood of formalizing, while the like-
lihood of starting to hire workers outside the family is more responsive to firm performance
(although continues to be low). Transitioning into a business being the primary activity of
the owner (and operating it all year around) also increases with initial business revenue, but
this transition is more likely to occur at all levels of initial revenue.53
    In sum, our analysis suggests that continuing informal firms that are more successful
   52
      Our longitudinal analysis proceeds as follows. We pool the data from the all the two-survey panels and
in each panel focus on continuing informal firms. Among the firms that did not hire workers in the initial
survey, we examine the probability that the firm hires workers in the subsequent survey as a function of its
revenue in the initial survey. We do the same for formalization, becoming the primary job of the owner, and

are more likely to start hiring workers and register as an enterprise, although in general
these changes are uncommon. However, informal businesses that start hiring workers, and
transition to the formal sector are rare. This is consistent with the finding on the role of
selection in hiring and formalization by Maloney (2004), La Porta and Shleifer (2008), and
de Mel et al. (2013),


A.8                 Household income and informal business entry and exit

Similar to section 5.4, we examine the impact of entry and exit at the household level.
For although individual income fluctuates considerably with opening or closing an informal
business, this may be smoothed within a household.
    We focus on households exiting and entering the informal business sector relative to
households continuing to operate in the informal business sector. We use households that
continue to operate an informal businesses as a reference group. We define an exiter as
a household that operated one or more informal business at the start of 2006-08 panel
operating a business all year.
   53
      Most informal businesses with high initial revenue operate year-around, hence the estimates of operating
full year at high levels of revenue are very noisy and based on a few observations.


                                                                               64
and no informal businesses at the end of the panel. An entrant is defined as a household
that operated no informal businesses at the start of the 2006-08 panel and one or more
informal businesses at the end of the panel.54 We exclude all households that operated any
formal businesses in 2006 or 2008. The exiters and entrants are compared to households
that operated at least one informal business in both 2006 and 2008. Table A2 reports the
results. In columns 1 and 2 we focus on the change in household income per capita as a
dependent variable, with column 2 using values windsorized at the 1st and 99th percentiles.
Households that start an informal business observe an increase in household income, while
informal business exit is associated with a reduction in household income. The reduction
in income in connection with exit is consistent with results from McKenzie and Paffhausen
(2019). Since informal business earnings are measured with potentially large errors (de Mel
et al., 2009), we also report a specification based on an indicator for a positive change in
household income in column 3. We find that households households starting an informal
business are more likely to experience a positive change in income, while households exiting
the informal business sector are less likely to experience a positive increase in income relative
to continuing households. These results confirm the importance of informal businesses for
income in households, with entry significantly adding to income and exit contributing to
declines in income.




  54
     Our household income estimates come from Benjamin et al. (2017). We restrict our household income
analysis to the 2006-08 panel because Benjamin et al. (2017) only had access to smaller samples of the 2012
and 2014 household surveys.

The sample includes surviving informal entrants across all 3-survey panels. A surviving informal entrant is
a business that appeared in the middle and end surveys of the 3-survey panel, but not the start survey and
was informal in the middle survey. In each row, we report the share of businesses that had the indicated
number of household workers at entry by the number of household workers 2 years later. The shares sum
to 1 across a row.

The sample includes surviving informal from the 2004-06-08 panel. A surviving informal entrant is a
business that operated in 2006 and 2008, but not in 2004, and was informal in 2006. In each row, we report
the share of businesses that had the indicated number of workers at entry by the number of workers 2 years
later. The shares sum to 1 across a row.

B      Data Appendix
In this appendix, we describe six data preparation steps:

    1. Verifying the reported business manager

    2. Cross checking business and employment information within households

    3. Predicting the manager for businesses in surveys in which the manager was not reported

    4. Matching the manager's job to the business

    5. Verifying the household and individual panels

    6. Creating business panels


B.1      Verifying the reported business manager

Both the 2006 and 2008 VHLSSs identified the most knowledgeable household member for
each business, hereafter referred to as the owner. We checked whether the owner reported
information in the employment module that is consistent with owning the business. In
particular, the owner should report being self-employed in the same industry as the business.
Both the 2006 and 2008 VHLSSs follow the same structure in the employment module. There
is a question identifying whether the individual was self-employed in a non-farm business in
any of their jobs during the past 12 months. Additionally, the employment module collected
detailed information on the most and second most time consuming job during the past 12
months, including the industry of employment and whether the individual is self-employed
or works for others. They also report whether the individual worked a third job during the
past 12 months, but no detailed information is provided concerning this job. Across the 2006
and 2008 VHLSSs, we find that the vast majority of reported managers provided consistent
information in the labor module (B1). In the 2006 and 2008 surveys, we found 2.8 and
2.8% of businesses for which the reported owner did not provide consistent information in
the employment module. The inconsistency could be due to reporting or coding errors in
either the business module or the employment module. Table B1 provides an example of

where the available evidence suggests that the wrong household member was identified at the
owner in the business module. The hypothetical business in this example operates in retail
and household member 1 was reported as the manager. However, based on the employment
information, it appears as though household member number 2 is more likely to be the
manager. Neither household member reports working more than one job in this example,
household member 1 reports working in the wrong industry and not in self-employment,
whereas household member 2 reports working in the same industry as the business and in
self-employment.
   Thus, we have changed the manager for only 2.2 and 2.4 percent of businesses in 2006 and
2008 respectively. We find it very reassuring that the vast majority of reported managers
provided consistent data in the labor module.


B.2     Cross checking business and employment information within
        households

More generally, we can compare the employment module data with the business module data
to verify the industry of the business and to check for possible missing businesses (i.e., one or


                                               90
more household member reports being self-employed in a business, but there is no matching
business).


B.3      Predicting the manager for businesses in surveys in which the
         manager was not reported

With the exception of the 2006 and 2008 surveys, the VHLSS business module does not in-
clude information on the most knowledgeable person/business manager. Hence, we predicted
the manager of each business in the other surveys. This is useful for two reasons. First, part
of our analysis requires looking at the relationship between various business outcomes and
characteristics of the manager. Second, knowing the manager of the business helps to facil-
itate the matching of businesses over time. We developed an algorithm for predicting the
manager and tested it using the 2006 VHLSS. We correctly predicted the manager for 92.9%
of businesses. For each survey, we combine data from the employment and business modules
that can be matched. In particular, from the employment module we identify individuals
that reported being self-employed in a household business for either their primary or sec-
ondary job during the past year. All of these jobs should have a matching business and vice
versa.
   In Table B3, we provide a summary of the matches by the step within the manager
prediction algorithm at which the match was made for the 2004 VHLSS along with the
corresponding success rate using the 2006 VHLSS. The table is organized sequentially such
that the first step of the algorithm was to identify the manager for businesses in which only
one household member reported being self-employed in the industry of the business and then
only businesses without a predicted manager would proceed to the next row. The first step
of the algorithm matches an individual as the manager for the business for 70.5% of all
businesses in the 2004 VHLSS. The corresponding rate of success using the 2006 VHLSS is
98.9%. Thus, for a large share of businesses we have a very high degree of confidence in our
predicted manager. Next, we identified a manager for any remaining businesses when there
was only one household member that reported being a manager of a business in the same
industry in the 2006 VHLSS, taking advantage of the panel information, and so on down

The success rate is based on applying the same algorithm to the 2006 VHLSS.



the rows of the table. In sum, the algorithm correctly identified the manager for 92.9% of
businesses in the 2006 VHLSS. Thus, our manager prediction algorithm is doing a very good
job of identifying the manager of the business.
   The employment modules in the 2010 through 2018 VHLSSs did not ask the same com-
bination of questions related to months, days, and hours worked. As such, minor changes
were required for the algorithm. Table B4 reports the number of matches by step for these
surveys. As for the 2004 survey, the vast majority of managers are predicted based on there
only being one worker in the household with a job that matches the business.


B.4     Matching the manager's job to the business

Each survey collected detailed information on the most time consuming (i.e., primary) and
second most time consuming (i.e., secondary) jobs during the past 12 months. The surveys
also asked whether the individual worked more than two jobs, but did not collect detailed
information on the third job.

   We begin by creating a list of all possible jobs, primary, secondary, or other, among
managers that could be consistent with managing a business. Next, we loop through the
businesses reported by the household, starting with business 1 and ending, if applicable, with
business 4. For each business, we identify the best matched job, update the jobs available
to be matched to businesses, and then move onto the next business in the household. By
looping through businesses one at a time, this ensures that an individual that manages two
businesses in the same industry, for example, has one job assigned to each business.


B.5     Verifying the household and individual panels

We previously verified the 2004-06 and 2006-08 panels for McCaig and Pavcnik (2015).
For this project we further verified the panels for 2010-12, 2012-14, 2014-16, and 2016-18.
We identified inconsistencies in both the household panels (e.g., the same household being
matched to two households, a household being matched to a household that does not exist,
etc.) and the individual panels (e.g., the same individual being matched to two individuals,
an individual being matched to an individual that does not exist, an individual match with
inconsistent gender or year of birth information). We then used a combination of algorithms
and visual matching to fix the inconsistency where possible or to remove the match. We
subsequently searched for missing matches, both at the household level and at the individual
level within households. The verified panels, both household and individual, are available


                                             93
for download on McCaig's website.


B.6     Creating business panels

The surveys contain both household and individual-level panels. The household surveys were
not designed to directly follow businesses and thus we use characteristics of the business
that should not change for most businesses in order to match them over time. We use the
longitudinal dimension of our data at the household and individual level.
   Note that we cannot match over time all businesses run by a panel household. For
example, any household that reports running a different number of businesses across the
two years has experienced net entry or exit of businesses and thus we cannot match at least
one business within the household. Thus, for any given household the maximum number of
matched businesses is the minimum of the number of businesses run in either year. Table
B5 summarizes the number of businesses run by panel households in each of the two-survey
panels. Many households experienced net entry or exit. For example in the 2004-06 panel, a
total of 1,603 operated no businesses in 2004 but at least one business in 2006. None of these
2006 businesses can be matched to a 2004 business within the household. More generally,
the total number of possible matches is equal to the sum over all cells of the number reported
times the minimum number of businesses operated at the start or end of the cell.55
   We start by matching businesses using information on the industry of operation and the
manager of the business. We subsequently relax the matching criteria and consider matching
the remaining unmatched businesses first by industry (allowing the manager of the business
to change over time) and then by manager (allowing the industry of the business to change
over time). Table B6 shows the distribution of match types by panel.




   55
      For example, in the 2004-06 panel, the maximum possible number of            matches   is
1*(4222+581+54+7+637+46+7) + 2*(647+75+9+81+10) + 3*(42+3+8) + 4*2 = 7,365.
