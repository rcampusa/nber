1.    Introduction

        As     rational expectations have become a popular benchmark in                    thinkctng

financial        and   macroeconomic   hypotheses,    many economists have          become more

interested in          directly measuring expectations of             market       participants.

Although         survey data on many domestic variables,          including   interest rates

and     inflation rates, have been frequently analyzed by               many       investigators

(see,    for example. Miahkin (1983; ch. 4)). it is only recently that                       survey

data on         foreign exchange rates have become available           and    been analyzed.

Dominguez (1986) and Frankel and Froot (1987a.b) have exploited the                          survey

data made available by the Money Market Service (MMS). the Amex Bank                         Review

and the Economist Financial Report.1

        The     surveys   that were investigated by Dominguez.         and by      Frankel       and

Froot        have only their median responses reported.       Heterogeneity among                the

market participants,          if    it existed, is aggregated out.            If     the     market

consists of homogeneous agents which share the same forecasting model                          with

common belief          (priors)    and information,    then the    median     response would

sufficiently describe the market in terms of forecasts.                 However,      if    market

participants differ in their forecasting characteristics,                    focusing on         the

median misses the most interesting questions such as whehter the differences

persist or         are temporary, whether the difference is           correlated with            the


participant's traits, and whether a rationality hypothesis is more Likely to

be    rejected in individual data.         Only individual responses of            survey      data

could answer these questions.

        In this paper, I will use the survey data collected by the Japan Center

for     International Finance (JCIF) in Tokyo, which allows me                to     investigate

the     individual responses in the survey.2 In particular the JCIF data                         set

has     two     distinct advantages over other data used by             Dominguem,         and   by


                                    -1-
Frankel      and    Froot.       First,      the JCIF data consist of           individual responses

with    no missing observations.                Second. not only financial               institutions but

other      companies       are     polled in the JCIF survey.               Therefore,              there        is   a

chance to associate possible heterogeneity to forecasters'                               industry traits.

       There       are     three     major       findings     in   this     paper.         First,            market

participants         are     found      to      be   heterogeneous.         There        are        significant

"individual         effects" in           their      expectation formation.                    Second,           many

institutions ace found to violate the rational expectation hypothesis.                                           Most

of     them underestimated the degree of yen appreciation.                               Third,           forecasts

with    long horizons showed                 less yen appreciation than ones with                                short

horizons. Put differently,                market participants appear to have a "bandwagon"

expectation in the short-run,                but a "stabilizing"          one in the long-run.                     The

"twist"    in forecast term structure could be "internally consistent"                                     (in    the

sense of Froot and Ito (1988)),                 if an iterated substitution of a                         short-term

forecast yields a long-term forecast,                       However,   cross-equation constraints

implied by the internal consistency are strongly rejected in the data,

       The JCIF has conducted             a telephone survey twice a month, in the                           middle

and    the end of the month, on Wednesdays,                   since May 1985.            Forecasts of             the

yen/dollar exchange              rate     for     one-, three-     and      six-month horizons are

obtained from            foreign exchange experts in 44                   companies;           15        banks    and

brokers,     4     securities companies,             6 trading     companies.        9    export-oriented

companies S life insurance companies, and 5 import-oriented industries,4 The

list respond every week,

        ihen    a data set is analyzed as a panel data,           the mean     across           rndivi-

duals       and the mean across time should not be confused.            :n        the     following,

the     mean across forty-four individuals at a time wrll be referred to as                          an

(cross-section.          total) average:   the mean across individuals at a time in                  an

industry group will be referred to as a group average.                 The mean across time

of an individual,          of a group, or of the total       "average" will be referred              to

as    the      (time)     mean of the individual, of the group. or           of    the      avetage,

respectively.

        The JCIF calculates       the total average,    standard deviation,             maximum,    and

minimum        of forty-four responses       and also industry group averages and                 group

standard deviations.             On the day after che survey, the        ICIF informs               ita


members,        including     those who are polled, of the summary           statistics.            The

overall        (cross-section)     average    is also released to the        press        and     other

media.

        I   will use, in addition to the panel data of forty-four companies,                        the


public       information part of the survey: the cross-section average                     (AyE)     of


forty-four companies and group averages for                  different industries:                banks

(BAN),       securities companies (SEC)         trading companies    [Sogo        Shosha]        (TRA),

companies in            the export industries (EXP), insurance      companies (INS),                and

companies in            the import industries (IMP).         The unit is yen per           one     U.S.


dollar,        so that negative movement indicates       yen "appreciation."               The     spot

exchange       rate, s(t), is measured at the closing quote          in Tokyo on           Wednesday

of the survey week.

2.B     Overview

        Let us illustrate the average          (aggregate)    expectation and the           movement

of actual exchange rates during the one-year turbulent                period following the

            of Five, Plaza Agreement of September 1985.            In Figure      1,      the     solid
Oroup


                                    -3-
line is the actual daily spot rate, while the base of each sequence of three

arrows shows the timing of the poll and the spot exchange rate of that day.

Three arrows,             respectively,      point to the forecasted exchange rate                       (the

average       of     the forty four) with the one-. thpee- and                   six-month horizons.

Therefore,         the vertical deviation of the tip of an arrow from the spot                           rate

(solid) line represents an ex                    mistake of     the expectation.



                                     FIGURE       1      ABOUT HERE


        From       this figure,    two preliminary observations emerge.                First, each         of

several       waves of aharp appreciation does not seem to have been                        anticipated

by     the    market,      (See Ito (1987) for "news" analyeia of                these     appreciation

waves,)       Second, the long-run expectation is not the simple extrapolation of

the     short-run         expectations.       In fact, there seems to             be   a    "twist"        in

expectation term structure,

        In    order to quantify these observations and to extend observations to

group aggregates and               individual     reaponaea,     Table      1    and   Figure        2    are

provided.          Table     1 shows that the time means of           (unconditional)           expected

changes      (in percent) from the spot rate at the, time of survey for the cross-

section total           average,    group averages, and (in           a     separate distribution

table)       for    each individual.         For the purpose of discussion,              the   mean        of

forward premium (FOR) and the actual (ex Q9,f) changes of the spot exchange

rate     (ACT)      for    each horizon are reported in the               same    table.       For       each

horizon and each individual or group, subtracting the forward premium from

the    forecasts        yields the implied risk premium and subtracting the                          actual

changes produces the forecast errors,


                                TABLE   1   and FIGURE   2   about here


                                     -4-
       In    the     one-month horizon,         the (total) average    on    a   typical     week

expected a 1.4 percent yen appreciation.               The group averages ranged from 0.8

percent      to 2 percent appreciation.          In relative to total average,      the export

industry was most biased toward yen depreciation and trading companies                        and

import industries were most biased toward yen appreciation.                      Looking     into

individual         data,     one extreme predicted    1.4 percent    depreciation of         yen.

while the other extreme predicted              3.1 percent of appreciation.      The    distri-

bution of individual forecasts has a nice unimodal distribution.                    The actual


change is at about one-fifth in the distribution,              that is. about 20        percent

of participants overpredicted rhe size of yen appreciation in the                      one-month

horizon.

       The    mean        of forward premium (FOR) was 0.15 percent.         indicating      that

there was a risk premium for most of the participants in favor of the dollar

asset.       The mean of actual changes for a one-month period was               2.1    percent

during the          two     years   of the sample period.     The    forecasts    by    trading

companies     with 2.0 percent and import companies with 1.9 percent came                   close

to the actual movement.             All groups and a majority of individuals did better

in forecasting than the forward rate in the one-month horizon.

       The expected appreciation of the yen in the three-month horizon for the

average was          1.4 percent,     about the same as the one-month        horizon.       (Note

that     no adjustment is made with respect to the length of                horizon.)      Hence,

the aggregate forecasts, one-month and three-month combined, imply that they

predict little             movement after the first month to the third month in               the

forecast horizon. However, this statement will be qualified shortly when we

examine the individual responses.                The actual change was 6      percent appre-

ciation in three months.             The total and group averages underpredicted the

size of yen appreciation by            3   to 5 percentage points.    In fact, the most yen


                                      -5-
appreciation predicted by an individual             is 4.3   percent.   and    no    individual

overpredicted the size of yen appreciation in the three-month horizon.

       As in the one-month horizon,           the export industry has a yen depreciation

bias     (from     the    total   average),   and the   trading    companies      have a       yen

appreciation bias           in the three-month horizon.      The   implied risk           premium

shows    that the export industry would have a negative risk premium                     for   the

dollar asset, while others have a positive risk premium as in the                       one-month

horizon.         This makes sense considering that exporters are long                in    dollar

assets in the medium run.

       Wide disagreement among individuals starts to show in the                    three-month

forecasts.        It becomes a bi-mod.al distribution:       one group believes that the

yen    depreciates from the one-month to three-month in the forecast horizon.

while the other believes that the yen continues to appreciate.                    The     distri-

bution also has long tails.           Therefore, although the group averages for one-

and    three-monthhorizons predict a yen appreciation of about the same size

(1.4 percent). distributions of individual responses are                  quite      different.

The last observation illustrates how important it is to have a data set with

individual responses rather than one with the summary statistics.

       For the six-month horizon, the total average practically shows that the

market     expects       the yen to return to the prevailing level at          the      time of

forecast.        This is a sharp turnaround from the forecast of 1.4 percent                   yen

appreciation in three months.           In fact, each of the group averages indicates

that    the group anticipates less yen appreciation in the              six-month horizon

than either        of     the one- or three-month horizons.         The   agreement among

different groups in forecasting the sharp yen appreciation from the third to

the    sixth month is quite striking, since they differ              in   forecasting the



                                    -6-
direction of the yen from the firsr to the third month.

        In    the    six-month horizon, all of the groups                 have a        negative risk

premium       for the dollar denominated asset.             This contrasts to            the    positive

risk premium in the one-month horizon.

        The distribution of individuals              is almost uniform ranging from a             three


percent depreciation to a one percent appreciation.                     highlighting a diversity

of the individual            forecasts.    It is clear from the figure that the degree of


diversity increases as the forecast horizon is longer.                         Again looking at the

average would not give this observation.

        Findings of this section can be aummarized and related to the                           contents

of    the      rest of this paper.         First, the findings are highly               suggestive of

heterogeneous market participants.                 A rigorous analysis and interpretation of

                                                                                                forecast
the     heterogeneity will be provided in Section                 3.     Second,    large

errors were recorded during the intermittent waves of yen appreciation after

September 1985.             However,   when the exchange rate was relatively stable for a

while,       the    one-month market           expectation overpredicted the               amount    of

appreciation.           Therefore,        it   is not immediately clear from              the    figures

whether        expectations were unbiased.            In Table 1, a comparison of group              (or

individual)          time     means    with the actual change          (ACT)    shows     the    average

forecast errors for each horizon.                   These observations are         only suggestive

without test statistics.               Econometric tests on varioua forms of the rational

expectation hypothesis will be conducted in Section 4.

        Third, the short-horizon expectations seem to predict yen appreciation,

while the long-horizon expectations seem to predict a reverse in direction.

             the    total average and most of the group averages have a                    "twist'   in
Thus,

their        forecasts,           Section      5   investigates    whether       such      twists     in

expectations are internally consistent.

3.A.     Econometric             Issue     --   a   special case of                   data

        Recall            that       our   micro survey data               set        consists of         forty-four

individuals             and fifty-one observations.                Suppose       that an individual forecast

formation at               time t consists of the common structural part                           based        on   the

public     information,               f(I(tY and the individual effect. ej.                         For     a     given

individual j, j                  1              J (where in this paper J=44) is



        si(t)           f(I(t)) + ej ÷ uj(t)                                                            (3.1)


where si(t) is a k-step ahead forecast of the                              spot exchange rate at time t.

example,        a       measurement error.                The cross-section average               of      individual

forecasts,          5XVE(t) is defined as


        5AVE(t)           f(I(t)) + cAVE + uAVE(t)                                                      (32)

where     5XVE(t)            (E s(t))/J, cAVE — (E ej)/.J and uAVE                           (E   u1)/J.
                                                                                                                Assume

f(I(t))     contains a                constant term so that normalization, CAVE —                               0.    is

possible.       Then subtracting each side of (3.2) from the corresponding side of

(3.1), we obtain



       s(t)
                    -
                        5XVE(t) —        ej +    (uj(t)
                                                           -
                                                               uAvE(t))                                (3.3)


The    estimator of individual effect. ej can be obtained by                                      regressing the

lefthand side of (3.3) on a constant over the sample period (across                                             time).

This      procedure is                simple and           robust.        It     is    unnecessary         for       the

econometrician to know the exact structure f(I(t)) as long as it is                                             common

        If   the difference in the individual                       effects of two tndividuals.is to be

estimated,       a similar method can be employed.

                     s(t)           ej-ek

                                                (u1(t
                                                          -
                                                              uk(t)).       k,'j.                        (3.4)



Then the difference in the individual effect between the individual                                                j and     k

is     estimated by regressing the lefthand side of (3.4) on a                                         constant term

over the sample period (across time).

        If     the     difference in individual                   beliefs    extends           to     'idiosyncratic"

coefficients on                  publicly available information in                       the        structural           part.

f(I(t)),       the above procedure needs to be modified,                            but is still             applicable.

Suppose,       for example,          that the forecast is in an extrapolative form:



s(t)-sAVE(t)
                       —    a + bli(s(t-l)-s(t))              +   b2i(s(t-2)-s(t-l))            +    uj(t)          (3,5)


where ej is integrated in the difference in aj. Then the idiosyncratic                                               indi-

vidual coefficients can be estimated by regressing the following equations:


                       —
s(t)-sVE(t)                 aj-aAvE+       (blj-b1AVE)(s(t-l)-s(t))
                       +
                            (b2j-b2AVE)(s(t-2)-s(t-l)) + uj(t)-uAVE                                  (3.6)


        The above procedure parallels                   the technique in the panel data analysis,

although,        in        the     usual examples of the panel data                      analysis,           the     common

structure        has        the     different input amount (such as                        labor        and        capital)

observable to               econometricians.            Instead,      it is reasonable here                   to     assume

that     the     structural part and values of regressors                            (i.e.,         past values             of

the     exchange rates)               in    exchange rate forecasts                 are        identical           for    all


individuals,           but        with possibly different coefficients.                        This, on            the    one

hand,    simplifies the estimation of individual effects, but on the other hand


                                            -9-
 makes       a time effect impossible to detect.               Since the value         of    regressors.

 that is past exchange rates, are common for all individuals, a cross-section

 regression or other techniques                  to detect s time effect cannot be applied                in

our panel data.


3..B     Heterogeneous       Participants in the           I2i Market
         In search of hard evidence for (or against) heterogeneity among                            market

participants,         I   estimate forty-four individual effects,                     and also
                                                                                ej                  "group
effects."        In       detecting the                                 a
                                                  "group effect,"            group   average forecast
calculated by the           .JCIF is treated         as an individual j. then the total average

(or another group average) is subtracted.5

       The     individual      (or group) effect ej is estimated using equation                       (3.3)

and    reported in Table 2.              Panels 2.A. and 2.8 show the group              effects,       and

panel 2.C. shows the distribution of individual                     effects.


                                      Insert     Table 2    about here


       From panel          2.A.   ,   we learn       that for any horizon,       group      effects     are

significant for the export industry, with an depreciation bias, and for                                 the

trading companies, with a appreciation bias.                        A       significant appreciation
bias was detected also for the import industry for the                           one-month horizon,

for the insurance industry,                 and for the banking sector.

       The     distictive effect               of exporters in contrast to           importers or        to

trading companies            can be         highlighted by      measuring the          difference        in

individual effects directly,                 as in equation (3.4).           This is done     in      panel
2.8.      Again, this confirms that exporters have depreciation bias                          in      their

expectation formation in relation to importers and trading companies for any

horizon.


                                        -   10   -
        Panel     2.C     shows that, for any horizon,             about half of     the    forty-four

individuals have            a significanr bias in their              forecasts.      Deviations are

sometimes       very large.       One individual           in the one-month horizon forecasted on

average       three percent depreciated than the average of the group.                      Similarly.

one     individual forecasted with a 5 percent depreciation bias in the                            three-

and six-month horizons.

        One might object to a formulation of individual effects in the form                              of

biases in the constant term.               They could have different models.               Since    it is

not     likely     that     the   JCIF     or       the     econometrician could      persuade each

forecaster to           justify the forecast with the model every week, we                       have    to


guess     the     form,    assuming that each market                  participant has        a     common

autoregressive forecasting model, but with different coefficients on the lag

terms     (possibly because           of the difference in            their prior       belief),        As

discussed above, idiosyncratic                  coefficients can be estimated from               equation

(3.6).        The results are shown in Table                3.



                            Insert Table 3 about here


Table     3     once again        shows    that exporters and             trading    companies          are

significantly heterogeneous for any of the three horizons.                              However,        the

difference comes from the bias in individual (constant term)                            effects,        not

from idiosyncratic coefficients of the lagged variables. Importers for                                  the

one-month horizon and the banks for the six-month horizon also show                                     the

individual (constant) effect,                      as     in table 2.A,   but   fail to      show the

idiosyncratic           coefficients on             the     lagged variables.       Therefore,          the

heterogeneity is more like a constant bias rather than the difference in how

to    react to the recent changes in the exchange rate.                      Table 2,      panels A-C



                                      -   11   -
and Table     3, all combined,   show solid evidence for heterogeneous expectation

formations among market participants.


3.C    Discussion:     Heterogeneity and Rational Expectations

      Most    of     the modern theory of finance or            macroeconomics assumes        the

existence     of     the representative agent whose decision is            an   aggregate     of

market participants.        In fact,      the hypothesis of rational      expectations would

require     that market participants be homogeneous             in their formation of expec-

tations,     since    the true stochastic process is unique.            Therefore,    findings

of    heterogeneity in this section cast some doubts to the framework using                    a


homogeneous agent         model commonly used in finance and            macroeconomics.

       If   agents have     private        information        which econometricians do       not

observe,     the existence of individual            effects may not be    inconsistent with

rational expectations.        However,         important   news and variables in the foreign

exchange market are         mostly        common knowledge.       A   likely explanation of

heterogeneity, consistent with rational expectations,                 would be slow learning

process due to a strong biased prior.                Then, we need to consider how         biases

may be related to individual priors.


3.D Discussion:       Wishful Expectations

      Having established heterogeneity,               a discussion of why    certain market

participants have depreciation or appreciation biases is in                     order.      From

Table 2.A and 2.B, we notice some regularity in the group effects.                         Market

participants apparently form "wishful expectations." Exporters                     wish that

the   yen will depreciate in the future, enabling their                  profit margins to

increase and their products to compete better in the foreign markets.                      Their

responses to survey questions seem biased toward yen depreciation relative

to    the average.     On the contrary,          importers'    responses reflect   their    wish


                                 -   12    -
for    stronger yen             so that import costs will decrease.°            The    tendency of

                                      evident in the one-month ahead             forecasts.          The
wishful expectations is
                                                                               from     the     mean,
exporters           forecasts        show a         continuing deviation

                                   toward yen depreciation.        as    the    forecast horizon
significantly biased

lengthens.          In    the    three-month and six-month ahead prediction,                   trading


companies,     instead of importers,            show a bias toward appreciation.

       This    "wishful expectation" may be a reflection of non-rational honest

mistakes in expectation formation.                   A straightforward interpretationwould be

for respondents to mix wishful thinking with objective forecasts.                         There are

a few deeper explanations of wishful expectations.

                                                                                 usually set          an

calculating in-house accounting.                     It is possible that these in-house          rates

                                      moreover are slightly biased         so    that    the     sales

influenced by the biased in-house exchange rate, although the respondent is

not from the sales department.

       If    the     announcement of the JCIF survey is very influential on                          the

                                                                  manipulating the        announced
market,       the    respondent may be induced to try

survey result by answering with biased forecasts.                    Exporters    respond to         the


JCIF by announcing the rate depreciated,                    though slightly to        avoid obvious

detection,          in the hope that the survey mean is biased toward                 depreciation.


Exporters hope that the mean expectation with an "unexpected"                          depreciating

bias cause          others to start selling yen, thus             creating a      self-fulfilling

prophecy;       if       importers   understand that exporters have incentives to                    lie.


then    importers        would counter by manipulating their announcements; and vice



                                       -   13   -
versa.        Thus, as a Nash equilibrium,                  the mean may not be biased after                   all.

although exporters and importers are biased.

        Despite       its       appeal to economists who are trained to                    seriously think
about expectation and manipulation,                       this story of a manipulative motive                      has

a      few    shortcomings.                First,   the     size    of   survey.         i.e.   .
                                                                                                      forty-four

insignificant             unless the bias is large enough to be detected easily by                                 the

JCIF.        If     all     exporters        tollude     in their responses.       it    may        escape    easy
detection.           But       the identity of respondents            included in the               survey    is    a

secret.           Second,       if       other participants understand that                     exporters and

importers         have incentives            to lie, then they would not take the JOIF                       survey

seriously,         thereby removing the incentive to lie.                    It may be the case               that

market participants are simply naive in forming wishful expectations.

4.   Rationality of Expectations

        In this section,             I    will apply standard tests of rational expectation to

this     survey data.7           First, if forecasts are rational,                 the    forecast errors

should       be    random.       In other words, survey forecasts should be                            unbiased.

Second,       given rational expectation,                 forecast errors should be                 uncorrelated

with any information available at the time the forecast is made.                                      Otherwise,

the variable correlated with the ex post error could have been exploited to

make better forecast.                    Put differently, forecast errors should be orthogonal

to any variable in the information set at the time of forecasting.

        Under the null hypothesis of rational expectation,                          the     realized spot

rate is the sum of a forecast and a forecast error:


        s(t+k) —      5e(k) e(t,k)   -
                                                                                                    (4.1)

where        e(t,k)       is    mean        zero forecast errors         and uncorrelated with                 any



                                                    14
variables      available at     t.     It is well known that forecast             errors.     e(t.k).

would    be    serially correlated if the forecast horizon is                     longer than      the

observational frequency,              i.e., k > 2.       Therefore,      rational expectations

imply a—O and b—I in the following regression:


s(t+k)   -    s(t)   — a + b(5e(,k)S)) + u(t)                                         (4.2),



The     test statistics are calculated using the General Method of                     Moments      to

take care of the serial correlations of u(t).                     Results of this unbiasedness

test are reported in Table 4.


                             INSERT TABLE     4    ABOUT HERE


      Unbiasedness is rejected for trading companies and insurance                          companies

of the one-month horizon, for securities and import companies of the                           three-

month    horizon,     and for all groups but banks and import industries                     for   the

six-month horizon. These rejections are evidence for rejecting a                             rational

expectation hypothesis,          in that market participants had unbiased forecasts.

We would miss some rejections if we were only to look at the average of                            the


forty-four participants,             since   for the one-month and three-month horizons,

rejections by         some    groups are          not detected in        the      average for      all

participants.

      The second implication of rational expectation is the orthogonality of

forecast errors and any information at time                  t.     Under the null hypothesis,

forecast errors,         e(t,k)         Se(k)      -
                                                       s(t+k),     are   uncorrelated from any

information at time t.           In the literature,        the past forecast errors

se(tkk)s(t);           the    forward premium, f(t,k)-s(t);              or   the   recent actual

change s(t-k)-s(t)           have     been popular candidates for             a   variable in      the

information set.         In this section, I will follow the standard procedure by


                                             15
regressing the cx post forecast errors on these candidate variables.


Se(k)      -   s(t+k)   — a +   b(E5e(k.k)5()) + e(t)                            (.3)

 e(k)      -
               s(t+k)     a +   b(f(t.k)-s(t)) + e(t)
5e(k)      -
               s(t+k)   = a +   b(s(t-k)-s(t))   +   e(t)                        4.3)
        Rational expectation (orthogonality)           is a null hypothesis of a               b         0

in    each case.        Results of estimation of these equations and tests                 of       the

null hypothesis are             reported in Tables 5.A         -    5G.   In    each piece           of

information,       there are only a few instances           of rejections of the         one-month

and     three-month horizons.         However,       for the       six-month horizon,          it    is

unanimous in rejection.          This is consistent with the results of unbiasedness

tests.    So far, there is little evidence rejecting the rational                    expectation

hypothesis for the shorter horizons.

      Variables in         the information set are not restricted to              those        tested

above.    When the second lagged term is added in the case of recent                      movement

of the exchange rate, the number of rejection cases increases                    dramatically.

Results of estimating the following equation are reported in Table                       SD:

                   — a +   b1(s(t-k)-s(t)) + b2(s(t-k-l)-s(t-l))            ÷ e(t)                 (4.6)


Table    S.D    shows rejections for most groups in any horizon.                 Even     if       the

authogonality test is            conducted at the individual           level,    about    three-

quarters of individuals are judged to be irrational (Table SD).

      In sum, this section shows that most of market participants violate a

necessary condition of the rational expectation hypothesis,                     in that their

forecasting methods could benefit from analyzing the relationship between


                                         16
their     own      forecast errors and information available at                     the       time of

forecasting.        Tables also show that the rational expectation hypothesis can

be     rejected in the individual level without being detected in                      the     cross-

section aggregated (average) data.


5.    Expectational Twist

5.1     Introduction to Twist and Consistency

        In   this      section,    the expectation formation of short-           vs.       long-term

expectations is            explored.    Recall    Table   1,    where     the   average market

participant expected 1.42 percent appreciation in one month, 1.43                             percent

appreciation in            three months,   and only 0.04 percent appreciation in                     six

months.         This   shows that the short-term expectation is of                the      bandwagon

type,        while       the      long-term     expectations       show      some         regressive

characteristics.            Similar characteristicshave also              been discovered in

other expectation data sets (Frankel and Froot                  (1987b)).8

        Casual      observations from Figure 1 (in the Introduction)                suggest          thar


during       the    wave    of appreciation,     the JCIF      participants also           show the

extrapolative (bandwagon)            expectation for the one-month ahead expectations,

while     the      regressive expectation may be more appropriate for                   the     longer

horizon.        (This creates      a "twist" in arrows of Figure 1.)            It seems that a

conclusion similar to Frankel and Froot may also be obtained for                              the    JCIF

data.     It is tempting to replicate their regressions.

        However, Frankel           and Froot (1987b) ignored the consistency issue                      of

short- and long-term expectation formation:                 If an expectation formation                 is


internally consistent,            a long-term forecast should be identical to a                     result

of     sequential substitutions of short-term forecasts, given a                        function of

expectation formation.             The consistency becomes a testable hypothesis in the


                                           17
form of cross-equation constraints on coefficients                          of short- and    long-term

forecast equations.                  Even in the presense of a twist, one might not                  reject

consistency,          if       the expectation formation is sufficiently complicated                     to

allow for non-linear forecasts,

        This consistency problem is parallel to the cross-equation constraints

implied in the context of the interest rate term structure (Sargent (1979))

and     in       the context of uncovered interest parity (Ito (1988) and                    Ito       and

Quah (1988)).         Froot and Ito (1988) have applied the test of consistency to

data     collected by Money Market Service (MMS) for one-week and                           one-month

ahead forecasts and Economist Financial Report for three-, six- and twelve-

month forecasts.               In this paper, the same test is applied to the JCIF data,

where one-, three- and six-month forecasts are available.


5,2     An Example of Extrapolative expectation with One

        First,      let        us    consider,   following Frankel and         Froot   (1987b),        the

extrapolative        expectation with one lag:


 e(k)        -
                 s(t) —    a +      b(s(t-l)-s(t)) + e(t)                               (Si).


In    (5.1), b < 0 implies              a (destabilizing)         bandwagon while b > 0 implies         a

stabilizing        expectation formation. Results are reported in Table                     6,       which

shows    that       the        one   percent yen appreciation would             make the     averagae

individual expect a further 0.01 appreciation in one month.                            However, the

Table also implies that the shock would make the same individual to form an

expectation of             a    0.13 percent depreciation in three months and                    a    0.22

percent depreciation in                   six    months.      Although different groups have

different biases, the pattern of coefficients,

        b(one month)       < b(three
                                   month)             <   b(six   month)


                                                 18
is   almost unanimously observed across the board.                     Hence, we    may       draw    a


conclusion,      similar      to    Frankel and Froot         (l9&7b).    that     the   long-term

expectation is more stabilizing than the short-term expectation.


                                   INSERT TABLE 6         about here


      Next,    in order to illustrate the consistency problem. let                       us    assume

that one-month and three-month forecasts are formed                      with the

following formulae (with one time period —4 weeks):


      5e(l)      -
                     s(t)   — a + b(s(t-l)-s(t))                                    (5.2)

      Se(3)      -
                     s(t)   — A + B(s(t-l)-s(t))                                    (5.3),



or after rearranging terms,


      5e(l)      — a + (l-b)s(t) + bs(t-l)                                          (5.4)

      s°(tS)     A+         (l-B)s(t) + Bs(t-l)                                     (5.5).



By   iterating        the   short-term expectation,          the   expectation of         a    longer

horizon can          be obtained.      With the information available at time                 t,     the


following substitution explains the iterated projection.


                     — a + (lb)5e(+2) + bSe(+l)                                     (5.6)



where 5e(+2) —         5e(+ll)         and


      5e(÷ll)         — a + (lb)5e(+l)        +   bs(t)                             (5.7)


where 5e(÷l) —         5e(l)        From (5.4), (5.6) and (5.7), we obtain


5e(+2l)       — 2a + a(l-b)2       +   (1-b+b2-b3)s(t)      + (b-b2+b3)s(t-1)       (5.8).




                                             19
However,       if one-month and three-month expectation formations are consistent

with each other,               (5.8) should be equivalent to               (55).        Therefore,      rhe

following           cross-equation constraints should be imposed on                       a    system of

equations,          (5.4) and (5.5):


               A    = 2a +    a(l-b)2
               B — b(l-b-4-b2)


This is the testable hypothesis                of consistency between one- and three-month

extrapolative expectation with one lag.

      It       is       easy to show that if b is negative, as estimated in                    Table     6.

equation (5.4),              then B has to be         a.lso negative.      Thus,   so    long as        the

extrapolative            expectation with one lag is assumed, a twist in                      expectation
is impossible.            An unstable bandwagon in the shrot-term (b<0) and a                     stable

weighted average (6>0) in the long-term expectation would be                              most likely

internally inconsistent in the extrapolative expectation with only one lag.

Put   differently,           the   assumed formulation is not rich enough to                     give    a

chance for the observed twist to be consistent.


5.3   Consistency Tests

      Next,         we    adopt a distributed lag expectation formulation with                         more

than two         lags, rich enough to produce a twist in                   expectation.         Consider

estimating the following one-month and three-month expectation formations

(with, again, one period —              4   weeks):


5e(l)      —   d    + (l+a)s(t) + bs(t-l)        ÷ cs(t-2) ÷ u(t)                               (5.9)

5e(3)      — D      + (l+A)s(t) + Bs(t-l)        +    Cs(t-2)   +   v(t)                        (5.10)

       Now, let us consier the consistency requirement for

the    three-month and                         six-month expectations.            Suppose.   again,     that the

expectation formation is of the distributed lag form with two lags:


5e(3)              d +      55(t) + bs(t-3)              +   cs(t-6)   +   u(t)                       (5.15)


 (6) —             D    +   As(t)      +   Bs(t-3)       +   Cs(t-6)   +   v(t)                       (5,16):



The consitency can be expressed as the following cross-equation constraint:


       0 — (2+a)d                                                                                             (5.16)


       A   —   (1+a)2 + b              -   1                                                             (5.18)

       B —      (l+a)b           + c                                                                          (5.19)

       C —      (l+a)c                                                                                        (5.20)

           of two sets of cross-equation restrictions (5.ll)-(5.l4)                               and     (5.17)-

 the    forward rate under covered interest parity)                    and    fiscal deficits.

Instead,     results could indicate that market participants,                who are buying and

selling every minute, are naive enough to give inconsistent forecasts                            of
months ahead.


6.     Concluding Remarks
        In this paper, the newly-available survey data on the expected exchange
rate    in   the Tokyo market were used to test several                 hypotheses regarding

expectation formations.               The JCIF data set is better than the            data     sets

previously used by Frankel and Froot (i987a,b),                  in that the survey      includes

expectations       of       different industries,          not   only banks    and      financial
institutions but            also    exporters and        importers.    Moreover,      individual

responses can be used to avoid aggregation problem altogether.

       Two   versions of           the rational expectations hypothesis were              tested.

Following are the major findings of this paper:                  First, market     participants
are heterogeneous. Different individuals                  seem to have constant-term biases

in    their expectation formations.                Among different groups,    unbiasedness of

expectation was         rejected in a few instances for                shorter horizons and



                                              22
unanimously rejected in             the six-month horizons,    The       orthogonality was

soundly     rejected.     We may conclude that we have a strong           evidence aginat

rational expectation formation in the Tokyo foreign exchange market.

     Then we turn to the issue of consistency between the short- and                 long-

horizon forecasts        by   the     same participants.      They are      overwhei.minglv

rejected,    given      that the      expectation formation is       a    distributed lag

structure with two lags.

        Dominguez (1986) used the Money Market Service          (11115)   data form 1583         to

1985     to    test a rational expectations hypothesis.           Unbiasedness and              the


independence of forecast errors from the forward premium were teated.                           $he

found that survey forecasts           were no better than the spot rate in          predictive

power and that the rationality was in general rejected.                   In addition to        the

MMS data. Frankel and Froot (1987a.b) exploited the survey data collected by

Amex Financial Service, Economists, which have a longer sample                      period and

different forecast horizons.              They found that expectations do           respond to

exchange        rate       changes.    Moreover,   short-term     foreoaats         are        more

"destabilizing"           than long-term forecasts;     that is, the       response       to    the


degree        of forecasted appreciation in response to appreciation is larger                   in

the short-term horizon than the long-term.             The risk premium implied by              the

data show a premiun for dollar-denominatedassets.

proprietary data for academic purposes only.


    About 60 experts in banks and other financial institutions,                 but       not    in

other    sectors, are on the list of the ?24S survey.           It is not      mandatory or

insisted by       tillS   that all people on the list respond every week.             Depending

on who was available for polis, the number of actual reponses varies between

30 and 40.       Therefore,     even if individual responses were made available for

econometric       analysis,      frequently missing observations would              make        the

analysis very difficult.


    The first few surveys were conducted not on Wednesdays but on the                       middle



                                  Footnotes   page 1
and last business days of the month.               However,    the survey date was fixed               on

wednesday after the fourth observation.                   A twice-a-month survey means               that


observations are usually bi-weeklv.               with a couple of exceptions in a               year.

That       is,    there are 24, in stead of 26, observations in the JCIF data in                       52

weeks.       It is unfortunate that the interval is not fixed,                     In the following.

I disregard the problem arising from a mix of two and three week                            intervals.

The    survey started with 42 companies and expanded to the current 44                           after

the fourth survey in July 1985.


      Since the micro panel data set was made available                 on the condition that

the anonymity of the source should be honored,                 it is impossible to aggregate

individuals        into groups.

      It     is    weil-lcnown       that it takes a long time to       have changes            in    the

exchange rate             "pass-through"    to domestic prices.        For    example,         Japanese

exporters absorb some of the exchange rate fluctuations by changing profit

margins and          the yeri-donominated export price, so that              the     U.S.      domestic

price of the Japanese products do not fluctuate much; and Japanese importers
                                                                                                      the
do    not        change the Japanese domestic price as much as the                   change     in

exchange rate,            while most imports are denominated in              the     dollar.     These

pricing behavior             is   possible when     the    exporters     and        importers        have

differentiated products and/or have substantial adjustment costs for gaining

a    market share.          See Krugman (1987) and Olmo (1988) and references thereof

for the theory and empirical evidence on (the lack of) "pass-through."

       The        group   effect      of trading companies behaves like             that of      import

industries.          One     might    think that the   change in the exchange rate may                be

neutral for trading companies, since they are just intermediaries of import
and    export.        However,       the leading Japanese trading companies handle                   more



                                      Footnotes page 2
import than export.           In 1983, revenues of the leading nine trading oompanies

are     derived from         export-orientedactivities for             20.01.    import-oriented

activities for           23.6%, domestic activities for 40.3%.            and    trades     between

foreign countries for 40.3%                (Shinohara (1986: p.        164)).    Therefore,       a

finding that           trading     companies behave       like   import companies is            not

inconsistent      with the wishful expectation hypothesis.


      For the aspects of econometrics,            see Mishkin (1983).      The same       procedure

has been applied to the            4S   data by Dominguez    (1986).


8
    Frankel and Froot (1986b) showed, using the .tS, Economist,                  and AMEX       data

set,     that     short-    and     long-term expectations seem           to    have      different

characteristics.           The data set with short-term horizon yields the                estimates

indicating a bandwagon type (extrapolative),                while the data set with a long-

term horizon yields the result with more regressive nature.                       However,       the

direct comparison of short-term and long-term horizon is limited                          in   their

study,     due    to    horizons spread across different data            sets and         different

sample periods.


       Suppose    that uncovered interest parity (no risk premium) holds.                         An

interest rate differential of six percents implies that the                      exchange rate

changes by approximately three percent in six months, which is                         significant
and easy to detenct.             However, it predicts only s 0.5 percent change in               one

month,     which     is small and may escape detection. However,                this      does not

explain an apparent twist observed in our data.                  During the sample period,
the    U.S.      interest rates         were    consistently higher      than the         Japanese

counterparts.          However,     the expectational twist predicted yen          depreciation

from the third month to the six month after the time of forecast.
