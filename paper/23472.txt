Who Is Screened Out? Application Costs and the Targeting of Disability Programs

JEL No. H2,I3

                                          ABSTRACT

The application process is critical to the targeting of disability programs because disability,
relative to other tags, is difficult to observe and costly to verify. We study the effect of
application costs on the targeting of disability programs using the closings of Social Security
Administration field offices, which provide assistance with filing disability applications. Using
administrative data from the Social Security Administration, we find that field office closings
lead to large and persistent reductions in the number of disability recipients and reduce targeting
efficiency based on current eligibility standards. The number of disability recipients declines by
13% in surrounding areas, with the largest effects for applicants with moderately severe
conditions, low education levels, and low pre-application earnings. Evidence on channels
suggests that most of the reduction in applications is attributable to increased congestion at
neighboring offices rather than increased travel times or costs of information gathering.

       Disability programs are large and expanding rapidly across the developed world. Social Security
Disability Insurance (SSDI or DI), the insurance program for disabled workers in the United States,
provided cash benefits and Medicare to nearly 9 million workers in 2015, up from 5 million in
2000. In 2015, Supplemental Security Income (SSI) provided cash welfare and Medicaid eligibility
to nearly 7 million low-income, disabled Americans, including 1.4 million children.1 These programs
are intended to provide disability benefits to those—and only those—individuals who have severe
disabilities and are in need of assistance. The primary system for targeting disability programs is the
disability determination process, in which adjudicators determine whether an individual meets the
medical eligibility criteria for these programs. However, even before potential applicants encounter
the disability determination system, the cost of applying for disability programs may affect whether
they decide to apply and, as a result, whether they receive disability benefits. To apply for disability,
individuals must consider whether they are eligible, submit extensive paperwork, and provide access
to medical records. The effect of these application costs on the targeting of disability programs is
ambiguous: hassles could screen out either those most in need or least in need, depending on how
potential applicants respond to these costs.
       The application process is especially important for the targeting of disability programs because
disability is difficult to observe and costly to verify. For programs based only on income or earn-
ings, the government can use earnings and income data from the tax system or other sources to
automatically enroll households or notify them of their eligibility. In contrast, the government does
not collect data on health or disability status outside of the disability determination process. If
individuals with severe disabilities do not apply because the application process is too costly, the
government has few other ways to identify them and provide benefits. Conversely, the government
may want to design an application process that discourages low-severity individuals from applying,
since recent evidence indicates that the application process leads to earnings decay for applicants
who are ultimately rejected (Autor, Maestas, Mullen and Strand (2015)).
       In this paper, we address how application costs affect the targeting of disability programs.
Nichols and Zeckhauser (1982) argue that application costs can improve targeting by screening out
high-ability individuals with a high opportunity cost of time. In their model, the loss in productive
efficiency from application hassles is more than offset by the gain in targeting efficiency. How-

Report, 2015. SSI provides categorical Medicaid eligibility in most states, except for ten states that use stricter
criteria to determine Medicaid eligibility for the disabled; seven other states require SSI recipients to submit a
separate Medicaid application to the state. SSI also provides benefits to low-income elderly individuals.

ever, evidence from behavioral economics suggests that hassles may discourage those most in need
(Bertrand, Mullainathan and Shafir (2004)). We provide the first empirical test of this debate in
the context of disability programs using variation in the timing of closings of Social Security Ad-
ministration (SSA) field offices, which provide assistance with filing disability applications. Using
detailed administrative data on disability applications and applicant characteristics, we estimate
the effect of an increase in application costs induced by field office closings on the number and
composition of disability applicants and recipients. We employ a difference-in-differences strategy
that compares the number and composition of disability applicants and recipients in areas that ex-
perience the closing of their nearest field office to areas that do not experience a closing until several
years later, before and after the closing. Using detailed SSA data on field office characteristics, we
also evaluate the relative importance of different types of application costs induced by the closings,
including travel time to assistance and congestion at neighboring field offices.
    We find that field office closings, in addition to reducing take-up substantially, reduce the tar-
geting efficiency of disability programs based on current eligibility standards. The closings reduce
the number of disability applications by 11 percent (12 applications per ZIP per quarter) and the
number of recipients by 13 percent (6 “allowances,” or final approvals, per ZIP per quarter) in
surrounding areas, meaning that they disproportionately discourage applications from individuals
who would have been allowed onto the program if they had applied. The closings have the largest
discouragement effects for those with moderately severe conditions, low education levels, and low
pre-application earnings. The discouragement effects persist for at least two years after the closing,
and they also occur in areas surrounding neighboring offices since those offices become more con-
gested after the closing. The magnitude of the effects is large, suggesting an implied value of time
of $100 per hour for disability applicants.
    To better understand these effects, we examine the channels through which closings could affect
application decisions, including congestion at neighboring field offices and travel time to neighboring
offices.2 We use walk-in wait time and application processing time as proxies for congestion; closings
result in an average increase of 32 percent (4.4 minutes) in walk-in wait time and 11 percent (3.0
days) in processing time. With respect to travel times, we use calculations from Google Maps to
estimate that driving time and public transit time to the nearest open field office increase by about
40 percent (10 minutes in driving time and 36 minutes in public transit time). Using an instrumental
   2
     Note that the closings do not change who reviews and decides the applicant’s case, since these decisions are made
at state-level Disability Determination Services offices, rather than at local field offices.

variables framework to decompose the decline in applications into various channels, we find that
72 percent of the reduction in applications is attributable to increased congestion at neighboring
offices, 3 percent to increased distance, and 24 percent to the fixed cost of switching field offices.
These results are consistent with more local field office contacts occurring by phone rather than in
person, since congestion costs affect both modes of communication but transportation costs affect
only in-person applicants. When we compare these estimates to the expected value of disability
benefits, the estimates imply that potential applicants are willing to pay $1100 to avoid increased
congestion, $50 to avoid greater distance, and $400 to avoid switching offices.
   In contrast to the Nichols and Zeckhauser (1982) hypothesis, we find that field office closings
reduce both productive efficiency and targeting efficiency based on current eligibility standards
for disability programs. Moreover, if disability programs are also intended to address economic
inequality, our results by socioeconomic status indicate that field office closings exacerbate the very
inequality that disability programs are intended to reduce. We use our estimates to conduct a
cost-benefit analysis of field office closings. On the cost side, we consider the loss in social welfare
from lower disability receipt for deserving applicants and the increased time and effort required to
apply for disability. On the benefit side, we consider administrative savings from processing fewer
applications and shuttering field offices as well as reductions in application costs and earnings decay
for individuals who are discouraged from applying. Using conservative assumptions, we estimate a
ratio of social costs to social benefits of field office closings of 5 to 1.
   In terms of policy implications, our results indicate that, even in a world of online information
and applications, in-person information and assistance still matter for applicants with low education
and earnings levels. We find evidence that high-socioeconomic-status applicants strategically rush to
submit their applications before the field office closes, and that some switch to the online application
after the field office closes. In contrast, low-socioeconomic-status applicants exhibit neither of these
behaviors and experience a much larger decline in applications.
   The paper proceeds as follows. Section 1 reviews the literature on application costs and pro-
vides a conceptual framework to evaluate the effects of closings on targeting efficiency. In Section
2, we describe the institutional context of Social Security field office closings and describe the ad-
ministrative and programmatic data from the Social Security Administration. Section 3 outlines
the empirical strategy and Section 4 presents estimates of the effect of closings on the take-up and
targeting of disability programs. In Section 5, we interpret our results on take-up and targeting
and analyze the channels through which closings reduce disability applications. Section 6 presents


                                                      4
welfare calculations and Section 7 concludes.


1     Literature and Framework

1.A    Literature and contribution

In the absence of perfect information about individuals’ abilities, the government can target social
safety programs using two mechanisms. The first is tagging, in which the government conditions
eligibility on observable characteristics like poor health or low income to target groups who are
deserving or most in need (Akerlof (1978)). In the context of disability programs, the government
uses disability screening to limit benefits to those with a disability tag.
    In this paper, we study the second type of targeting mechanism: self-screening, in which program
rules and application requirements affect what types of individuals decide to apply for benefits.
In particular, we study whether hassles associated with using benefits or services—often called
“ordeals” in the public finance literature—improve or worsen targeting. Several papers build the
theoretical foundation for the effect of hassles on selection, including arguments for queuing (Nichols,
Smolensky and Tideman (1971)), work requirements or activities with some disutility (Besley and
Coate (1992)), and asset tests (Golosov and Tsyvinski (2006)) as screening devices. Nichols and
Zeckhauser (1982) posit that hassles may improve targeting if they impose a higher relative cost
on high-ability individuals compared to low-ability individuals. Thus an optimal transfer program
that maximizes social welfare may need to sacrifice productive efficiency—time and effort wasted
by applicants on hassles—to improve targeting efficiency.
    Kleven and Kopczuk (2011) develop a theoretical framework that is particularly relevant for the
disability context. They consider a targeted program that uses a monitoring technology involving
substantial information collection and complexity (e.g., the disability determination process) to
determine whether an individual is deserving. A more complex monitoring technology reduces the
likelihood of allowing non-disabled individuals (Type II error) or rejecting disabled individuals who
apply (“Type Ib” error, in their terminology), but increases the likelihood of discouraging disabled
individuals from applying (“Type Ia” error). They conclude that optimal programs have a high
degree of complexity, incomplete take-up, and both Type I and Type II errors.
    The question of whether hassles improve or worsen targeting is ultimately an empirical one, and
likely depends on the type of hassle and the characteristics of the marginal population. Bertrand
et al. (2004) hypothesize that administrative hassles associated with program enrollment may in


                                                   5
fact deter the individuals that society would like to target to be on these programs. For example,
low-ability individuals may face information costs or mental barriers that magnify the effect of
application costs on the decision to apply for benefits.
   Previous papers have estimated the effect of hassles (or their reduction) on program take-up,
but with less attention to the question of targeting (see Currie (2004) for a review). Bettinger, Terry
Long, Oreopoulos and Sanbonmatsu (2012) estimate that Free Application for Federal Student Aid
(FAFSA) assistance combined with information on financial aid increases college completion by 8
percentage points, or 29 percent, while information alone has no effect. Automatic enrollment, which
changes the default to participation, has been shown to increase participation in retirement savings
programs dramatically (Madrian and Shea (2001)). Rossin-Slater (2013) finds that the opening of a
Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program office increases the likelihood that pregnant women
in surrounding areas use WIC benefits by 6 percent, with effects driven by urban areas. Kopczuk
and Pop-Eleches (2007) estimate moderate effects of the availability of electronic filing on take-up
of EITC benefits, while Ebenstein and Stange (2010) find no effect of electronic claiming on UI
take-up.
   Recent papers in the developing world address the targeting question more directly. Cohen,
Dupas and Schaner (2015) find in a field experiment in Kenya that increasing the subsidy for an-
timalarial drugs increases the receipt of drugs but worsens targeting, with one-half of pills going
to individuals without malaria. Alatas, Banerjee, Hanna, Olken, Purnamasari and Wai-Poi (2016),
which is the closest paper to ours, conduct a field experiment of requiring households in Indonesia
to apply for a welfare program in person, rather than the status quo policy of automatic enroll-
ment. Alatas et al. (2016) find that imposing the active enrollment requirement improves targeting
efficiency by disproportionately screening out higher-income households. In contrast, we find that
application costs reduce targeting efficiency in the US disability context, with the largest effects
on applicants with low socioeconomic status and moderately severe conditions. Of course, there
are important differences between our US disability context and the Alatas et al. (2016) Indonesia
welfare context. One is a difference in the nature of the variation in application costs: we study
an increase in application costs from high to even higher, while Alatas et al. (2016) study an in-
crease from zero application cost (automatic enrollment) to low costs. Another difference is that
US disability applicants have the option of applying online or by phone rather than showing up at
an office in person, while treatment households in Alatas et al. (2016) were required to show up in
person.

     This paper makes two contributions to the literature. First, this is the first paper of which
we are aware to estimate the effect of application costs on the targeting efficiency of disability
programs, a context in which the application process matters critically for targeting because the
disability tag is difficult to observe. Second, this paper brings together for the first time detailed
administrative data on applicants and specific features of field offices, allowing us to go beyond
take-up and study both targeting efficiency and the channels through which closings discourage
applicants. To examine targeting efficiency, we use applicant characteristics such as disability type
and severity, pre-application earnings, age, education, and language spoken. To study the channels
through which closings discourage applications, we collect from SSA program offices several sources
of data that have not previously been used for research. These include field office wait times,
processing times, and staff counts, which allow us to quantify congestion at neighboring offices; and
call volumes to the 800 information line, which shed light on the role of field offices in providing
program information. We also calculate driving and public transportation times to field offices using
Google Maps software.


1.B     Targeting efficiency framework

Our goal is to estimate the effect of an increase in application costs on the targeting efficiency
of disability programs and on social welfare. We define an improvement in targeting efficiency as
follows: when application costs increase from η to η 0 > η, targeting efficiency increases if and only
if
                                               P r(R|A, η 0 ) > P r(R|A, η)

where P r(R|A, η) is the probability of receiving benefits conditional on applying for benefits at
application cost η. The intuition behind this definition is that, assuming no change in adjudicator
standards, the probability of acceptance increases when the applicant pool becomes more deserving.
If P r(R|A, η) 6= 0, we can rewrite our definition of an improvement in targeting efficiency in terms
of the empirical parameters that we estimate:

                                                            P r(R|η 0 )       P r(R|η 0 )
                               P r(R|A, η 0 )               P r(A|η 0 )       P r(R|η)          ∆R + 1
                            1<                =             P r(R|η)
                                                                          =   P r(A|η 0 )
                                                                                            =
                               P r(R|A, η)                                                      ∆A + 1
                                                            P r(A|η)          P r(A|η)


              P r(R|η 0 )−P r(R|η)
where ∆R ≡         P r(R|η)          is the percent change in the number of disability recipients resulting
                                     P r(A|η 0 )−P r(A|η)
from the closing and ∆A ≡                 P r(A|η)          is the percent change in the number of disability ap-


                                                                  7
plicants resulting from the closing. When a field office closes, targeting efficiency improves if the
percent decline in disability receipt is less than the percent decline in disability applications. Note
that this definition assumes that the adjudicator’s preferences for who is deserving or undeserving
reflects societal preferences. Since societal preferences may differ from the preferences of the official
adjudication process, we also present changes in observable characteristics of applicants and recipi-
ents, including severity, disability type, education, pre-application earnings, and age. In Section 6,
we present a framework to calculate the change in social welfare from field office closings.


2        Institutional context and data

2.A         Institutional context

The Social Security Administration administers the Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and
Supplemental Security Income (SSI) programs. SSDI and SSI have the same medical requirements
but different non-medical requirements: SSDI requires a work history, while SSI requires low income
and assets. Individuals can apply for and receive benefits from both programs concurrently if they
meet the requirements of both, with the SSI benefit reduced by the amount of the SSDI benefit.
        Potential applicants can apply for SSDI and SSI by filing a claim in person at a Social Security
field office, filing a claim over the phone with a claimants’ representative at a Social Security field
office, or—for SSDI applicants only—by filing the claim online.3 Regardless of how the application
is filed, the application is generally processed by the field office that serves the ZIP code in which the
applicant resides. The applications in our data are identified by the claimant’s ZIP code of residence.
In processing the claim, the field office verifies that applicants meet the non-medical requirements
(work history for SSDI and income and assets for SSI) and often collects information that the
disability examiner needs to make a medical decision, such as medical records and (for children)
school records. The field office then transfers the application to the state disability determination
services (DDS) office, where a disability examiner decides whether the applicant meets medical
requirements. Note that field offices do not make decisions about an applicant’s case. Applicants
can appeal the initial examiner’s decision, first to the DDS office itself (in all but 10 states), then
to an administrative law judge (ALJ), then to the Appeals Council, and finally, for a very small
fraction of cases, to federal court.
        The first Social Security field office opened in Austin, Texas, in October 1936. Today there are
    3
        The SSI application became available only in April 2017, after our study period ends.

approximately 1,230 Social Security field offices in the United States. Field offices serve many func-
tions, including taking applications for new or replacement Social Security cards, providing benefit
verifications, assisting with disability and retirement claims, and processing disability claims before
transferring them to the state DDS office. However, disability claims take up a disproportion-
ately large amount of staff time, with two-thirds of SSA’s administrative budget going to disability
claims.4 According to SSA testimony, “disability claims...are particularly time intensive as employ-
ees help claimants complete detailed forms about medications, treatment, medical testing, work
history, and daily activities.” 5
       Since Social Security field offices provide assistance with applications, the closing of field offices
is expected to increase (weakly) the cost of applying. Potential applicants must travel farther
for in-person assistance, may experience congestion at neighboring offices, and may find it more
costly to gather program information. We use recent Social Security field office closings to study
the effect of application costs on selection into disability programs. Although there were very few
closings prior to 2000, there have been 118 closings since that year, with approximately half of those
closings occurring since 2009 (see Figure 1). The obvious concern with this empirical strategy is
that SSA may be closing offices in areas where disability applications are already falling or where
the composition of disability applicants is already changing.6 To address this issue, we use areas
that experience a closing in the future as controls for areas that experience a closing today. The
identifying assumption is that the exact timing of the closing is uncorrelated with changes in the
number and type of disability applicants. We demonstrate that there are no pre-trends in the
outcome variables, that macroeconomic variables such as population and unemployment rate do
not exhibit a break at the time of the closing, and that no observable characteristics of the office or
location predict the timing of closings.

      Testimony of Jo Anne B. Barnhart, Commissioner of the Social Security Administration, to the U.S. House of
Representatives, March 4, 2003. SSA’s administrative budget reflects both field office and state DDS costs. Social
Security field office functions include issuing new or replacement Social Security cards, assisting with retirement and
disability claims, providing verification of benefits, processing claims, assisting state offices with continuing disability
reviews, and conducting SSI non-medical redeterminations.

United States Senate, June 18, 2014.
    6
      According to a Congressional report, the 64 closings that have occurred since 2009 have been in response to
“technological, demographic, and budgetary” changes at the federal level. We show in Appendix Table A.12 that
smaller local populations, fewer applications and more offices in close proximity predict a higher likelihood of an
office closing, which suggests that the closings themselves are not as good as random. In Section 4.D, we find that
our estimates are robust to using unaffected ZIPs as the control group and to using an event study design.

2.B    Data

We use confidential administrative and program data from the Social Security Administration. We
collect data on Social Security field offices from several SSA program offices. From the Office of
Analysis, Development, and Support (OADS) and the Office of Earnings, Enumeration, and Ad-
ministrative Systems (OEEAS), we have data identifying all field offices ever in operation, including
field office number, street address, and closing date if it closed (no opening date). From the Office
of Public Service and Operations Support (OPSOS), we have data on walk-in wait times at Social
Security field offices going back to Fiscal Year (FY) 2005. These wait times are not specific to
disability applicants; they reflect the average time that any individual entering a field office waits
until being served by a field office worker, and we use them as a measure of field office congestion.
We also have data on the number of staff members at each field office going back to FY 1997 from
OPSOS, and on Social Security card issuances by field office going back to FY 2005 from OEEAS.
Finally, from SSA’s Office of Customer Service, we have the volume of calls to SSA’s 800 phone
number by area code by month from January 2014 to April 2016.
   We use data on disability applicants and recipients from a number of sources. We start with
831 application data for all cases with a disability examiner decision between 1990 and 2015. The
831 files report applicant characteristics, including age, body system code (i.e., general disability
category), medical diary reason (a measure of severity), and education (for adults only). The 831 files
also provide the date on which the application was filed, the date on which the field office transferred
the file to a state DDS office, whether the case was allowed at the disability examiner level, and
applicant ZIP code up to 2010. For additional applicant characteristics and applicant ZIP codes after
2010, we use data from the Structured Data Repository (SDR), which starts in 2005. Applicant
characteristics in the SDR include whether the applicant files online, whether the applicant has
legal representation, whether the applicant has a representative payee, whether the applicant has
an email address, and whether the applicant speaks English. We use the Disability Research File
(DRF) and the Master Earnings File for pre-application earnings of applicants. Finally, we use the
Master Beneficiary Record and Supplemental Security Record to observe the final determination
for each case at the end of the adjudication process.
   We collapse the Social Security data by the ZIP of the applicant’s address and link it to publicly
available ZIP Code Tabulation Area data from the Census Bureau. We have a total of 33,649 ZIPs;
Figure 2 shows their boundaries. For each ZIP code, we use the GIS software to find its centroid and



                                                  10
apply the Haversine formula to calculate the great-circle distance—the shortest distance over the
earth’s surface—between ZIP code centroid and each field office in the United States. In addition
to this “as-the-crow-flies” distance, we also compute driving distance, driving time, and public
transportation time using Google Maps APIs. Combining the distance and time measures with the
information on field office closings provided by the SSA, we assign each ZIP to its nearest, second
nearest, and third nearest field offices for each quarter from 1990 to 2015. We classify ZIPs into
three categories: ZIPs whose nearest office was closed (“closing” ZIPs), ZIPs whose nearest office is
the second or the third nearest field office of a closing ZIP prior to the closing event (“neighboring”
ZIPs), and all remaining ZIPs (“unaffected” ZIPs). Figure 2 shows the locations of all Social Security
field offices since 2000 and demonstrates the classification of closing, neighboring, and unaffected
ZIPs. Appendix Figure A.9 shows a zoomed-in version of this map for the state of New York.
    We collect ZIP code level demographic information from the 2000 Census and the American
Community Survey. Since information at the ZIP level is limited and is not available between
Census years, we also collect county level information and link ZIP codes to counties with the
largest shared areas. At the county level, we have quarterly data on employment, unemployment,
labor force and payrolls from the Bureau of Labor Statistics; semiannual data on broadband access
from the Federal Communications Commissions; annual data on personal income from the Bureau
of Economic Analysis; annual data on population estimates and business patterns from the Census;
and annual data on SSDI/SSI recipients from publicly available SSA publications. Finally, to analyze
call volumes to SSA’s 800 number, we also link ZIP codes to their respective area codes as of May
2016 using ZIP Express software.


3    Empirical strategy

We estimate the effects of field office closings by comparing the number and characteristics of
disability applicants and recipients in areas that experience a closing at a given time relative to areas
that experience a closing in the future. The motivation for this empirical strategy is that areas that
experience closings at some time are likely more similar to each other than they are to areas that
never experience a closing. Table 1 presents the characteristics of ZIP codes that have an average
of at least three disability applications per quarter in the year 2000, across closing, neighboring
and unaffected ZIPs, as defined in Section 2.B. The ZIP means across the three groups are similar;
the most apparent differences are that closing and neighboring ZIPs have larger populations and



                                                   11
more disability applications in the year 2000 than unaffected ZIPs. Given the large number of ZIPs,
however, the differences across them are precisely estimated and t-tests find significant differences
across the groups for many characteristics.7
      Given potential differences in observable and unobservable characteristics between closing and
unaffected ZIPs, we restrict our sample only to closing ZIPs. For any given closing, we take ZIPs
that experience the current closing as treated ZIPs, and ZIPs that experience a closing in the future
as control ZIPs. Specifically, we construct our sample as follows. First, we create separate datasets
for each of the 118 closings. In each dataset, ZIPs that experience the current closing are labelled as
treated ZIPs, while ZIPs that experience a closing more than two years in the future are labelled as
control ZIPs. Event quarters are specified relative to the quarter of the closing. Second, to eliminate
ZIPs with tiny populations, we drop ZIPs (both treatment and control) with an average of fewer
than three disability applications per quarter in the year before the closing. Third, we append all
118 datasets into one dataset.
      Figure 3 shows raw plots of the number of disability applications in control and treatment ZIP
codes relative to the quarter of the closing. The drop in applications in treatment ZIPs after the
closing is apparent, while control ZIPs follow a smooth upward trend in applications. Appendix
Table A.8 compares pre-closing characteristics of treatment and control ZIPs and shows that they
are similar on demographics, but treatment ZIPs have higher walk-in wait times and more disability
applications in the year before closing.
      To estimate the effects of the closings in regression form, we estimate the following equation on
the sample:


                                                 τ                         τ
                          Yisct = αi + γst + Στ Dct + Στ δτ (T reatedic × Dct ) + isct             (1)

where Yisct is an outcome (e.g., number of disability applicants) for ZIP i in state s for closing c
in quarter t. The αi are ZIP fixed effects, and γst are calendar quarter by state fixed effects. The
variable T reatedic is an indicator equal to 1 if ZIP i is a treated (closing) ZIP for closing c and
     τ are indicators equal to 1 if quarter t is τ quarters after (or before, if negative) the quarter
the Dct
of the closing and 0 otherwise. We weight ZIPs by the number of pre-closing applications, and we
cluster standard errors at the closing level. The coefficients of interest are the δτ ; they represent
the difference between treated and control ZIPs in outcome Y , τ quarters after the closing. The
  7
      Appendix Table A.7 presents the same summary statistics for all ZIPs in the United States.




                                                         12
graphs presented in the following sections plot the δτ estimates in event time.
    For table estimates, we estimate a pre-post version of equation (1):


                                  τ
           Yisct = αi + γst + Στ Dct + β(T reatedic × P ostct ) + κ(T reatedic × Zeroct ) + isct     (2)

where P ostct is an indicator equal to 1 if quarter t is after the closing and Zeroct is an indicator
equal to 1 if quarter t is the quarter of the closing. We dummy out the quarter of the closing because
the closing could occur at the beginning or the end of the quarter, and therefore it is unclear whether
to group the quarter of the closing with the “pre” or “post” period. We report estimates of β in our
tables.
    This form of difference-in-differences uses variation in the timing of closings, rather than vari-
ation in the occurrence of closings (Guryan (2004); Fadlon and Nielsen (2015)). We use ZIPs that
experience a field office closing more than two years in the future as controls for field offices that
experience a closing today. The identifying assumption of the difference-in-differences model is that,
in the absence of the closing, the number and characteristics of disability applicants and recipients
would have evolved similarly in areas that experience a closing today relative to areas that experi-
ence a closing in the future. Rather than the closings themselves being random events, the empirical
strategy of using future closing ZIPs as controls requires only that the timing of the closings be
as good as random. Indeed, in Section 4.D, we find that observable characteristics of field offices
predict the likelihood of closing, but not the timing of closings conditional on closing. In the figures
presented below, we demonstrate that the treated and control ZIPs exhibit parallel trends in the
quarters before the closing in both number of applications and characteristics of disability appli-
cants. In robustness checks, we find similar estimates of the treatment effect using an event study
design, but the event study design has pre-trends.


4     Estimates of the effect of closings on applicants and recipients

4.A       Effect of closings on take-up in closing ZIPs

Figure 4 shows the effect of field office closings on the log number of disability applications in closing
ZIPs, based on estimates from equation (1), where applications are assigned to quarter based on the
date the application was filed. Notice that the treated and control ZIPs exhibit parallel trends in
disability applications prior to event quarter 0. Disability applications fall by 11 percent as a result



                                                    13
of a field office closing in closing ZIPs (Table 2), and the fall in levels is 12 applications per ZIP per
quarter (Appendix Table A.10). It takes two quarters after the closing for disability applications to
reach a stable 11 percent decline, likely because some applicants who visited the field office before
the closing submit their applications after the closing. The effect is persistent even two years after
the closing. Although we cannot test for intertemporal substitution because we cannot identify
individuals who do not apply, the persistence of the effects suggests that applicants discouraged by
the closing do not apply for at least another two years.
   The decline in applications has different implications depending on whether it leads to a decline
in the number of recipients. Figure 4 shows that the number of disability recipients declines by
13 percent in closing ZIPs (Table 3), with allowances still assigned to quarter based on application
date. This estimate is statistically different from the 11 percent decline in applications (Appendix
Table A.9). The decline in levels is 6 allowances per quarter per ZIP (Appendix Table A.10). The
results imply that closings disproportionately discourage applications by those who would have been
allowed by SSA adjudicators if they had applied.


4.B    Effect of closings on targeting in closing ZIPs

Who is screened out by higher application costs? We measure effects on targeting in two ways. First,
we estimate the effect of the closings on applicants and recipients separately for each subgroup (first
set of columns in Tables 2 and 3) and test for statistical differences across subgroups (see Appendix
Table A.9). Second, we estimate the effect of the closings on the proportion of applicants and
recipients with a given characteristic (e.g., proportion with mental condition) or on the average
value of the characteristic (e.g., average age), similar to the approach taken by Gruber, Levine
and Staiger (1999) and Einav, Finkelstein and Cullen (2010) (second set of columns in Tables
2 and 3). While the proportion/average estimates summarize overall effects of the closings on
a characteristic, the estimates by subgroup provide a more detailed picture of the effects of the
closings. This analysis rests on the assumption, discussed in detail in Section 4.D, that the closings
do not affect how applicants are classified.
   We find that composition changes are similar at the applicant and recipient levels, so we focus
mainly on the applicant level in the exposition, since it provides a direct measure of applicant be-
havior. We start with measures of health. We categorize applicants into four severity categories:
those who are never allowed (“low” severity); those who are denied at the initial level but allowed
on appeal (“medium” severity); those allowed at the initial level and labelled “medical improvement


                                                   14
expected” or “medical improvement possible” (“high” severity); and those allowed at the initial level
and labelled “medical improvement not expected” (“very high” severity).8 Whether field office clos-
ings disproportionately discourage higher severity or lower severity applicants is ex ante ambiguous:
higher severity applicants may face higher costs of reaching a neighboring office or applying through
other means because of their health, while less severely disabled applicants may no longer find it
worth applying given the increase in application costs. As shown in Figure 5, we find that the
decline in applications is non-monotonic in severity, with smaller effects for low severity (8 percent)
and very-high severity (5 percent) applicants, and larger effects for medium severity (27 percent)
and high severity (16 percent) applicants. The differences across severity subgroups are statistically
significant.
       Another observable measure of health is disability type. We categorize applicants into three
disability types based on the body system code on their record: mental conditions, which have
accounted for a substantial increase in disability enrollment for both adults and children; muscu-
loskeletal conditions (such as back pain), which have also risen substantially for adults in recent
decades; and other physical conditions.9 The decline in applications is nearly twice as large for
mental conditions (12 percent) and physical conditions (12 percent) compared to musculoskeletal
(7 percent) conditions, and this difference is statistically significant.
       Turning to socioeconomic status, we estimate the effects of the closings by education, pre-
application earnings, and whether the applicant speaks English. We observe these characteristics
for adults only and therefore estimate effects on these characteristics excluding SSI children. The
effects of the closing are monotonically decreasing in education level: from Figure 5 and Table 2,
applications decline by 13 percent for high school dropouts, by 9 percent for high school graduates,
and by 4 percent for college graduates, though these differences are not significant. The effects of the
closings are also monotonically decreasing in pre-application earnings, which we measure as annual
earnings in the five years prior to the year of application. Applications decline by 13 percent in the
lowest earnings category ($0-$5,000) but do not change for the highest earnings category (above
$25,000). The result of these differential effects is that average annual pre-application earnings
   8
     SSA’s standard for “medical improvement not expected” is as follows: “Medical impairment is extremely severe,
as determined on the basis of existing medical technology and/or our experience in administering disability programs.
These impairments do not improve over time, and more likely are progressive either by themselves or by reason of
related complications. The likelihood of medical improvement so as to permit the individual to engage in substantial
gainful activity is extremely remote” (SSA Program Operations Manual System DI 13005.022).
   9
     The “other physical” category includes the following body system codes: special senses and speech, respiratory,
cardiovascular, digestive, genitourinary, hematological, skin, endocrine, congenital, neurological, cancer, immune
system, growth impairment, and special/other.



                                                         15
increase by a statistically significant $650, or 4.3 percent, after a closing. Interestingly, Figure 5
shows a spike in applications by the highest-earning applicants in the quarters around the closing.
We interpret this spike as anticipatory behavior: higher-earning applicants, who may be more
informed, rush to get help from the field office before the office closes. The subsequent decline in
applications for this group could reflect intertemporal substitution rather than a true decrease in the
number of applications. In contrast, applications from lower-earning applicants remain depressed
at the end of the two-year period. Finally, we find that field office closings disproportionately
discourage English speakers from applying (8 percent decline) relative to non-English speakers (0.2
percent increase). We find little heterogeneity by age for adults.
       We can also present these estimates in absolute numbers, as we do in Appendix Table A.10.
Taking the point estimates at face value, we find that for every 10 low-severity potential applicants
who are discouraged from applying due to a closing, the closing also discourages 6 medium-severity
applicants, 5 high-severity applicants, and 1 very-high-severity applicant. Similarly, for every 10
college graduates discouraged from applying, 631 high school dropouts and 707 high school graduates
are discouraged.10
       All disability programs experience substantial declines in the number of applicants, but the
point estimates for the adult SSI (15 percent) and child SSI (15 percent) programs are twice as
large as those for the adult SSDI (7 percent) program (Appendix Table A.18). The smaller decline
in SSDI applications is consistent with the availability of an online application for SSDI and the
higher socioeconomic status of the SSDI population, which might afford easier access to alternatives
to the closed field office.11
       Appendix Figure A.11 depicts effects by subgroup at the recipient level. Changes in age, edu-
cation, and earnings after the closing are similar in percentage terms for disability recipients and
disability applicants. Because severity is defined according to the allowance decision, the severity
results are mechanically the same at the applicant and recipient margins.
  10
     Of course, characteristics of applicants are not necessarily independent; for example, a highly educated potential
applicant (considered less deserving on the basis of socioeconomic status) may be more likely to be severely disabled.
Indeed, the correlation between college education and very high severity is a positive 0.05. For this reason, we also
estimate in Appendix Table A.11 the effect of field office closings on characteristics jointly. We find results that are
consistent with the separate education and severity estimates: the effects are largest for potential applicants with
lower education levels and medium- and high-severity conditions. College graduates do not experience large declines
in any severity category, and similarly, very high severity potential applicants experience small declines regardless of
education category. Effects by education-by-disability type cells are also consistent with the separate education and
disability type estimates.
  11
     We also estimate the effects of field office closings on Social Security card issuances and find null effects, as shown
in Appendix Figure A.10.




                                                            16
4.C    Effect of closings in neighboring ZIPs

We also examine the effects of the closing on neighboring ZIPs, which are ZIPs whose nearest office
is the second or third closest office of a closing ZIP prior to the closing event. Neighboring field
offices may experience an increase in congestion due to an expanded service area after the closing,
which could discourage applications in neighboring ZIPs; indeed, we find evidence for congestion
at neighboring offices in Section 5.C. To estimate effects on neighboring ZIPs, we construct the
sample in a similar way as the main analysis, except that for each closing the treatment group is
neighboring ZIPs for that closing and the control group is neighboring ZIPs in future closings. We
estimate equations analogous to (1) and (2), replacing the T reatedic indicator with a T reatedN bric
indicator that is equal to 1 if ZIP i is a neighboring ZIP for closing c and 0 otherwise. We find large
and persistent decreases in the number of applications and recipients for neighboring ZIPs. The
number of applications falls by 5.4 percent and the number of recipients falls by 9.0 percent (Table
4). As shown in Appendix Figure A.12, the control and treatment groups exhibit parallel trends
prior to the closing, but applications and allowances fall for the treatment group after the closing
and remain depressed two years after the closing.


4.D    Robustness

The identifying assumption of the difference-in-differences design is that control and treatment ZIPs
would experience parallel trends in outcomes in the absence of the field office closing. As seen in
Figures 4 and 5, control and treatment ZIPs exhibit parallel trends in the number and composition
of applicants prior to the closing. However, it is still possible that the closing itself is prompted
by a change in macroeconomic conditions in the treatment ZIPs, and those changes in economic
conditions could lead to changes in the number and composition of residents in those ZIP codes. For
example, the Social Security Administration may decide to close offices in areas that experience an
adverse economic shock or a declining population. In this case, we would mistakenly attribute the
change in the number and composition of disability applicants and recipients to the closing, when
the closing is merely a symptom of (or coincidental with) changes in macroeconomic conditions.
   To probe this threat to validity, we estimate differential trends in macroeconomic conditions
between control and treatment ZIPs. Specifically, we put macroeconomic variables on the left-
hand side of equation (1) and plot estimates of the δτ coefficients in Appendix Figure A.13. We find
smooth trends through the closing date in population, labor force, unemployment rate, and personal



                                                  17
income. Graphs show a positive trend in population, which suggests that the decline in applications
is not explained by outmigration from the areas surrounding the closed office. The other graphs show
positive trends in economic conditions: increasing labor force and personal income, and declining
unemployment rates. However, there is no trend break in any of the macroeconomic variables;
the trends are gradual and are not consistent with the abrupt drop in disability applications and
receipt in treated ZIPs. These figures suggest that the changes in the number and composition of
applicants and recipients are not caused by macroeconomic shocks. We also augment equations (1)
and (2) to include controls for the local unemployment rate and population and find no change in
the estimates (Appendix Figure A.14).12
    To probe whether offices were closed strategically based on local conditions, we investigate what
observable factors predict 1) the likelihood of closing and 2) the timing of a closing conditional
on closing, with results presented in Appendix Table A.12.13 Although some factors consistently
predict the likelihood of a closing (columns 1-3), no observable characteristic consistently predicts
the timing of a closing conditional on closing (columns 4-6).
    We also probe the robustness of our results to different measures of distance, since distance
determines whether ZIPs are classified as closing, neighboring, or unaffected. Our main results use
straight-line distance and define closings ZIPs as ZIPs whose nearest office closes. We estimate the
effects of the closing using two other strategies: 1) using driving time as the measure of distance to
classify ZIPs, and 2) defining closing ZIPs as ZIPs within a certain radius (as measured by straight-
  12
     Another potential threat is that control ZIPs (those that experience their own closing at least two years later)
could be neighboring ZIPs of the closing for which they serve as a control. Since, as we show, neighboring ZIPs also
experience effects from the closing, using neighboring ZIPs as controls would lead us to underestimate the effect of
the closing on surrounding areas. Empirically, we find that just 0.3 percent of control ZIPs are neighbors and the
estimates do not change when we exclude neighbors from the sample.
  13
     According to Congressional testimony, SSA has not considered local economic or other conditions in deciding
what offices to close (“Reduction in Face-to-Face Services at the Social Security Administration,” United States
Senate Special Committee on Aging, Summary of Committee Staff Investigation, No Date). To examine whether
local characteristics predict the likelihood of a closing, for each year between 2000 and 2012, we use all open offices
in a given year and estimate the following equation:


    Closingi = α + β1 P op2000i + β2 Densityi + β3 Appsi + β4 F OP rocessi + β5 N umOf f icei + β6 W aiti + i        (3)

   where P op2000i is the population of the service area of office i in the year 2000; Densityi is the population density
of the service area of office i in the year 2000; Appsi is the number of disability applications submitted in office i’s
service area in the year before the closing; F OP rocessi is the application processing time for office i in the year
before the closing; N umOf f icei is the number of offices within 20 kilometers of office i before the closing; and W aiti
is walk-in wait time for office i in the year before the closing (available only for 2006 and later). To examine whether
local characteristics predict the timing of closing conditional on closing, for each year between 2000 and 2012, we
limit the sample to offices that are open in that year but will close in the future and estimate the following equation:

    CloseY ri = α + β1 P op2000i + β2 Densityi + β3 Appsi + β4 F OP rocessi + β5 N umOf f icei + β6 W aiti + i       (4)

where CloseY ri is the year in which office i closed. The results of both are shown in Appendix Table A.12.


                                                           18
line distance) of the field office. The estimates using the alternative measures are given in Appendix
Table A.13 and are within 15 percent of the main estimates for applications and within 6 percent
of the main estimates for recipients.
      As another robustness check, we estimate the effects of the closings using event study specifica-
tions instead of the difference-in-differences approach. We use the following estimating equation:


                                                                  τ
                                        Yisct = αi + γst + Στ δτ Dct + isct                        (5)

where we estimate one version that includes unaffected ZIPs as controls and another version that
                                                                τ are set to zero. For treatment
includes only closing ZIPs. For control (unaffected) ZIPs, all Dct
                     τ are equal to one when the quarter is τ quarters after (or before, if negative)
(closing) ZIPs, the Dct
the closing. Figure 6 shows both versions of the event study. The version using unaffected ZIPs
as controls (left side) shows an upward pre-trend in the number of applications, but the fall in
applications in treatment ZIPs after the closing is still apparent, and the estimates are approximately
the same magnitude (around 10 percent) as in our preferred empirical strategy. The version using
only closing ZIPs (right side) has a less pronounced pre-trend and a drop of similar magnitude in
applications. In addition, we estimate the effects of the closing using the difference-in-differences
specification with different minimum lengths of time between treatment closings and control closings;
the estimates using windows of 4, 6, 10, and 12 quarters are nearly indistinguishable from our original
estimates using an 8-quarter window (see Appendix Figure A.15).
      Finally, the interpretation of our estimates of the effect of closings on the composition of ap-
plicants and recipients depends on whether the closings affect the classification of applicants. If,
for example, the closings affect the likelihood that an applicant is classified as high severity, then
the change in severity composition reflects not only differential responsiveness of severity types to
the closing, but also a change in the likelihood of being classified as a given severity type. For
severity, the severity classification decision is made at the state DDS office, which does not change
after the local field office closes. Within DDS offices, cases are assigned to disability examiners in
an effectively random way and not based on geography.14 Examiners are responsible for verifying
that the medical records in the case are complete, and if incomplete request full medical records.
Our back-of-the-envelope calculations indicate that the decline in applications from a field office
closing is on average less than 2 percent of the DDS caseload, which makes it unlikely that the

field office closing has an effect on disability examiner decision-making. For disability type, the
examiner also decides this classification (e.g., mental or musculoskeletal) based on what is stated
in the application and on the applicant’s medical records. It is possible that field office assistance
affects the number or type of medical conditions listed and thereby affects severity or disability type
classifications, and we cannot test this possibility directly. For socioeconomic status, we measure
pre-application earnings using administrative data, so there can be no change in the pre-application
earnings classification after the closing. Education level and age are self-reported on the application,
but we have no reason to believe that field offices affect how applicants report them.15


5         Interpreting the effects of field office closings

5.A         Interpreting effects on take-up

We find in the previous section that field office closings reduce disability applications by 7 percent
for SSDI and 15 percent for SSI, and reduce disability receipt by 12 percent for SSDI and 15 percent
for SSI. These are large effects, with our back-of-the-envelope calculations implying a value of time
of approximately $100 per hour for both SSI and DI applicants. This implied value of time is
consistent with Alatas et al. (2016), whose estimates suggest an implied value of time of about $20
per hour in the Indonesian context, where wages are several times lower than in the US.16
         How do the effects of field office closings compare to the effects of hassles in other contexts?
Bettinger et al. (2012) estimate a 29 percent increase in college completion from providing assis-
tance with the FAFSA, while Madrian and Shea (2001) estimate a 130 percent increase in 401(k)
enrollment from automatically enrolling individuals. Quasi-experimental estimates of hassle reduc-
tions are smaller: Rossin-Slater (2013) finds that openings of WIC offices increase take-up by 6
percent in surrounding areas, Kopczuk and Pop-Eleches (2007) estimate a 12 percent increase in
EITC claiming from electronic filing, and Ebenstein and Stange (2010) find no effect of Internet-
based UI claiming on take-up. We also compare the effects of the closings to other determinants of
    15
     This observation is based on our visits to field offices and discussions with current and former field office staff.
    16
     To calculate implied value of time in our setting, we assume, conservatively, that those who do not apply because
of the closing lose two years of DI benefits, which average $1,300 per month. With an overall 2/3 probability
of allowance, the expected benefit of applying is $20,800. From our estimates, closings reduce the probability of
applying by 7 percent for the DI program. If the field office closing increases the amount of time required to apply
by 15 hours, then the value of time that rationalizes the decision not to apply is (0.07*$20,800)/15=$97. By similar
logic, and using the 15 percent decline and $700/month in benefits, the value of time for SSI recipients is $112. We
calculate an implied value of time in Alatas et al. (2016) as follows. They find a 15 percent decline in the take-up of
benefits with an estimated $700 NPV, in response to an estimated half-day increase in travel and wait time. If we
assume a 5 hour increase in time to apply, the implied value of time is (0.15*$700)/5=$21.



                                                           20
disability application and receipt, such as economic conditions, program rules, and health shocks.
These comparisons suggest that the closing of a field office has effects at least as large as a 10
percent change in earnings or a 10 percent change in replacement rates, but much smaller than a
severe health shock. Of course, the normative implications of application reductions from closings
versus earnings gains or health shocks are likely different.17
       The $100 per hour implied value of time is much larger than the monetary opportunity cost of
time for low- and medium-wage individuals, especially SSI applicants, who by definition have low
income and assets. Why are the effects on take-up so large? There are several potential explanations.
First, potential applicants may have difficulty finding alternative sources of assistance after a closing
because of credit constraints and legal restrictions. In principle, potential applicants could promise a
third party some fraction of their disability benefits if their application is approved, but government
regulations restrict compensation to third-party representatives of disability applicants.18 Second,
potential applicants may exhibit present bias, in which they underweight the large benefits of
applying and overweight the additional costs of applying resulting from the closing. Third, the
closings may cause potential applicants to update their beliefs about the disability system. After
experiencing a closing and resulting inconveniences, potential applicants may adjust their beliefs
about the probability of rejection or about the difficulty of interacting with the system in the future.


5.B       Interpreting effects on targeting

Field office closings present a tradeoff between Type I and Type II error: they discourage applications
among the less deserving, but also discourage applications among the more deserving (increasing
“Type Ia” error, in the language of Kleven and Kopczuk (2011)). We apply the definition of targeting
efficiency based on adjudicator preferences from Section 1.B to our results. Based on the 11 percent
decline in applications and 13 percent decline in allowances (statistically different), we find that
  17
     Black, Daniel and Sanders (2002) study the effects of the coal boom and bust on disability payments. They
estimate that a 10 percent increase in earnings reduces DI payments by 3 to 4 percent and SSI payments by 4 to 7
percent. Duggan and Imberman (2009) decompose DI program growth from 1984 to 2003 into various determinants,
including program changes and economic conditions. Their estimates suggest that a 10 percent increase in replacement
rates would increase DI enrollment by 7 percent. With respect to the effect of health shocks, the Meyer and Mok
(2013) estimates suggest that having a chronic severe condition increases the likelihood of disability receipt by 88
percent relative to a chronic non-severe condition.
  18
     Federal regulations require that fees are the smaller of 25 percent of past due benefits or the amount of the fee set
by SSA (COFR §404.1730). Third-party representation is much less common at the initial level than at the appeals
level, when applicants receive more “past due benefits” if their case is approved.




                                                           21
field office closings reduce targeting efficiency:

                                       ∆R + 1   −0.13 + 1
                                              =           < 1.
                                       ∆A + 1   −0.11 + 1

   If societal preferences differ from adjudicator preferences, then changes in observable charac-
teristics of applicants and recipients are also relevant for assessing targeting efficiency. The effects
of the closing on disability applications are decreasing in socioeconomic status, but they are non-
monotonic in severity, with smaller effects for low and very-high severity applicants and larger effects
for medium and high severity applicants. Excluding the low severity group, we could explain the
results by severity with the hypothesis that the value of the benefits is increasing in severity and the
opportunity cost of applying is decreasing in severity. But why do low severity applicants continue
to apply? We find evidence that low severity applicants are a highly selected group, being much
more likely than the other severity groups to have experienced zero or low earnings in the two
years before they apply (see Appendix Table A.14). Therefore we present a model that explains the
results by severity considering both a health effect and a selection effect.
   Let potential disability applicants differ on two dimensions: health h ∈ [0, 1] where h = 1 is the
best health, and skills s ∈ [0, 1] where s = 1 is the highest skills. Skills are negatively correlated with
health in the potential applicant pool as a result of selection, which we model by making s a function
of h, with s0 (h) < 0. Wages are determined by the function w(s, h) = min{h, s(h)}, meaning that
poor health will be the binding constraint on wages for the highest severity individuals and skills
will be the binding constraint on wages for the lowest severity individuals. Potential disability
applicants apply if and only if


                                p(h)b + (1 − p(h))w(s, h) − η > w(s, h)

                                        ⇐⇒ p(h)[b − w(s, h)] > η


where b is the amount of disability benefits, p(h) is the likelihood of being approved for benefits,
with p0 (h) < 0, and η is the cost of applying. We assume b > w(s, h).
   Let g(h) ≡ p(h)[b − w(s, h)]. Consider an individual at the bottom of the health distribution,
so that h << s. Then g(h) = p(h)[b − h] and

                                    ∂g(h)
                                          = p0 (h)[b − h] − p(h) < 0
                                     ∂h



                                                     22
since p0 (h) < 0. The first term reflects that the likelihood of allowance is decreasing in health, and
the second term reflects that the opportunity cost of applying is decreasing in health. Thus, when
h is small (i.e., going from very high severity to high severity), g(h) is unambiguously decreasing
in h and so very high severity types are more likely to continue applying when application costs
increase.
   Now consider an individual at the top of the health distribution, so that h >> s. Then g(h) =
p(h)[b − s(h)] and
                               ∂g(h)
                                     = p0 (h)[b − s(h)] − p(h)s0 (h) ≷ 0
                                ∂h

since p0 (h) < 0 and s0 (h) < 0. The first term reflects that the likelihood of allowance is decreasing
in health, but the second term reflects the selection effect that low severity types are more likely to
be low-skilled. Thus, when h is large (i.e., going from medium severity to low severity), g(h) could
be increasing in h, in which case low severity types will be more likely to continue applying when
application costs increase.
   Figure 7 provides a visual depiction of the model in which health h in the potential applicant
pool has density f (h). The benefit function g(h) is non-monotonic in h because individuals in
relatively good health (low h) are low-skilled and therefore also have a high value of disability
benefits. The function p(h) starts at p(h) = 1 at the very bottom of the health distribution (i.e.,
very high severity) and is decreasing in h. The line P r(R|A, η) indicates the average probability
of allowance in the potential applicant pool at baseline, which depends on both p(h) and f (h).
In the baseline case, the function g(h) is everywhere above the application cost η, so all potential
applicants apply for benefits. When application costs increase from η to η 0 > η, g(h) is now below η 0
for some potential applicants in the middle of the health distribution, and so these medium-severity
applicants no longer apply. Intuitively, targeting efficiency improves if the group that was screened
out has a lower probability of allowance than the previous applicant pool, and it worsens if the
group that was screened out has a higher probability of allowance than the previous applicant pool.


5.C    Channels for closing effects

Our estimates give the effect of field office closings on the number and composition of disability
applicants and recipients. A key question in interpreting these results is through what channels the
closings affect disability applications. We use detailed Social Security data on field office features
and GIS data to measure the effects of the closing on various channels: congestion at neighboring



                                                  23
field offices, which could reduce the quantity or quality of assistance received; travel time to the next
field office; and other channels, including the costs of acquiring program information and network
effects.
       Congestion at neighboring offices: Congestion at the neighboring office can take many
forms, including longer waiting times to get assistance or a decline in the amount or quality of
assistance received. Based on estimating equation (1), Figure 8 shows that the closing causes an
increase of 32 percent (4.4 minutes) in walk-in wait time and an increase of 10 percent (3.0 days) in
application processing time for closing ZIPs.19 Neighboring ZIPs experience similarly large increases
in congestion measures (see Table 4 and Appendix Figure A.16). Note that these measures are
merely proxies for overall congestion, which can take many forms, including less time for assistance
and lower quality of assistance. We expect congestion to affect not only in-person interactions with
the field office, but also the larger number of interactions that occur by phone since applicants are
generally directed to their local field office phone line for assistance.
       Travel times: We use calculations from Google Maps to estimate increases in driving distance,
driving time, and public transportation time, using estimating equation (2). We find that the
closings result in an increase of about 40 percent in all types of travel cost measures (10 minutes in
driving time, 12 kilometers in driving distance, and 36 minutes in public transit time). Unlike the
congestion measures, which include behavioral responses, our estimates for changes in travel time
and distance are purely mechanical; we do not use actual trips of potential applicants to estimate
them. However, the mechanical estimates provide a proxy for the increase in travel costs and we use
them in the interpretation of our results. We expect travel times to affect only potential applicants
who visit an office in person. We find that the effects of closings are decreasing in distance to the
closest (closed) office; the effects are non-monotonic in distance to the neighboring office, but effects
are largest when the neighboring office is very far (Appendix Table A.15).
       Other channels: Another potential mechanism for the effect of closings on applications is
the cost of acquiring program information. According to SSA officials, field offices stopped doing
  19
     We also estimate effects on the number of field office staff per capita in the service area of the ZIP’s nearest
field office. We find that the number of staff per capita actually increases (by 30 percent) after a closing, which is
consistent with SSA’s policy of reassigning staff from the closed office to nearby offices. However, staff count is only
one input into field office congestion; closings may affect staff productivity as reassigned staff learn new procedures
or develop new relationships with schools and health care providers. In addition, depending on their location, offices
often face much higher demand for DI services than SSI services, or vice versa, and may therefore employ field office
staff who specialize in one of the programs. When staff who specialize in one program transfer to an office with high
demand for the other program, it may take time for the transferred staff to learn the details of the other program.
We use walk-in wait time and field office processing time to measure congestion because they are direct measures
rather than inputs.



                                                          24
community outreach about SSA programs in the early 2000s due to budget cuts, so the role of field
offices in providing program information is limited to individuals who visit the field office. Although
we do not have direct measures of information acquisition costs, we find evidence, shown in Appendix
Figure A.17, that the closings stem a downward trend in call volumes to SSA’s 800 number, which
handles inquiries regarding disability applications and other Social Security matters.20 This suggests
that field offices, when open, provide information about SSA programs.21 Closings may also affect
applications through network effects; for example, closings may discourage one person from applying
and that person may affect the application decisions of others through network effects (Bertrand,
Luttmer and Mullainathan (2000); Dahl, Kostol and Mogstad (2014)). If this mechanism were
important in the field office context, we might expect to see the effect of field office closings increasing
over time. Instead, from Figure 4, we see that the number of applications declines in the first few
quarters and then remains at a lower level for the rest of the two-year window.
       Decomposition of channels: We use an instrumental variables framework to decompose the
decline in applications into three channels: congestion at the neighboring office, travel time, and the
fixed cost of switching offices. The fixed cost of switching offices could include several components:
the effect of physical proximity to an SSA office (e.g., potential applicants inquire about benefits
because they see the SSA sign); effort to figure out where the next office is and how to get there; the
destruction of relationships between the field office and local health care providers or schools; match
quality between the field office staff and local population (e.g., on race or other demographics); and
updating by potential applicants about the likelihood of rejection or the difficulty of interacting
with the system in the future. The structural equation of interest is the following:


               Yisct = αi + γst + βCongestionict + κDistanceict + δN ewOf f iceict + isct                           (7)


where Congestionict is a measure of congestion (e.g., walk-in wait time) at the office that is closest
  20
    We have call volumes by area code by month from January 2014 to April 2016 from SSA’s Office of Telephone
Services. We estimate an event-study-style regression using the 15 field office closings that occur in 2014:
                                                              τ
                                            Yit = αi + Στ βτ Dit + µt + it                                          (6)

where Yit is call volume from area code i in month t; αi are area code fixed effects; and µt are calendar month fixed
                       τ
effects. The vector Dit   includes indicator variables for each of the months before and after a closing. The sample
                                                        τ
includes all area codes in the United States, but the Dit are set equal to zero for unaffected area codes; the unaffected
area codes help to identify the µt . Unfortunately, the pre-period is limited because all but one of the 15 closings
occurs in March of 2014, just two months after the data begin. Although the pre-period is limited, we find evidence
that closings stem a downward trend in call volumes to the 800 number.
   21
      In Appendix Table A.16, we estimate effects with respect to measures of information, such as the proportion of
the area receiving or applying for disability, the Chetty, Friedman and Saez (2013) EITC information measure, and
broadband access.


                                                           25
to ZIP i in quarter t, Distanceict is the driving distance between ZIP i and its closest office in
quarter t, and N ewOf f iceict is an indicator for whether ZIP i has a different closest office than
it did earlier in the sample period (equivalent to T reatedic × P ostt ). The N ewOf f iceict variable,
which captures the fixed cost of switching offices, reflects effects of the closing not captured by
congestion and distance.
       These variables could be endogenous to the number of disability applications; for example, a
rural ZIP may have longer distances than an urban ZIP and also more disability applications because
of a less healthy population. For this reason, we use instruments that limit the variation in each
endogenous variable to that induced by 1) the closing itself and 2) differences in wait time (or
distance) between the closed office and now-closest (neighboring) office for closing ZIPs. The first
stage equations are as follows:

 Congestionisct = αi +γst +β1 (T reatedic ×P ostt ×W Dif fic )+β2 (T reatedN bric ×P ostt )+νisct (8)

                   Distanceisct = αi + γst + κ1 (T reatedic × P ostt × DDif fic ) + ξisct                            (9)

where W Dif fisc is the difference between the walk-in wait time at the now-closest office and the
walk-in wait time at the previously-closest office in the four quarters before the closing; T reatedN bric ×
P ostt is an indicator equal to 1 if ZIP i is a neighboring ZIP of closing c after the closing; and
DDif fic is the difference between the driving distance from ZIP i to the now-closest office and the
driving distance from ZIP i to the previously-closest office.22 By construction, N ewOf f iceict ≡
T reatedic × P ostt , so we assume that N ewOf f iceict is exogenous (i.e., its own instrument).
       The first stage, reduced form, OLS, and IV estimates are given in Table 5, with all estimated
on the sample of closing and neighboring ZIPs. As expected, the first stage effects are strong and
highly significant: a one-minute difference in pre-closing wait times between the closest and second-
closest office predicts a 0.5-minute higher wait-time after the closing; wait times for neighboring
ZIPs increase by 4.6 minutes as a result of closings; and a one-kilometer difference in driving
distance predicts a one-kilometer increase in driving distance after the closing. The IV estimates
in Table 5 indicate that every additional minute of wait time (which proxies for other types of
congestion) reduces disability applications by 1.6 percentage points, every additional kilometer of
  22
    We use the difference in wait times as the instrument instead of just pre-closing wait time at the now-closest office
because walk-in wait times are spatially correlated: a high wait time at the now-closest office predicts a high wait
time at the previously-closest office, and therefore does a poor job predicting the increase in wait time that the ZIP
experiences after the closing. Similarly, we use the difference in distances because distances are spatially correlated:
they are longer in rural areas than urban areas.




                                                           26
distance from a field office reduces applications by 0.03 percentage points, and switching to a new
office reduces applications by 2.3 percentage points. Scaling these estimates up by the actual changes
after the closing, we find that increased congestion accounts for 6.8 percentage points of the decline
in applications (72 percent), driving distance for 0.3 percentage points of the decline (3 percent),
and the fixed cost of switching offices for 2.3 percentage points of the decline (24 percent). When
we compare these estimates to the expected value of benefits, the estimates imply that potential
applicants are willing to pay around $1100 to avoid increased congestion, $50 to avoid greater
distance, and $400 to avoid switching offices.23 Notice that the OLS estimates underestimate the
effect of congestion by an order of magnitude and overestimate the effect of office switching, likely
because offices that experience higher congestion are in areas with higher demand for disability
benefits.


5.D     Substitution to online application and third-party representation

Resources that provide information and assistance with disability applications may mitigate the
effects of field office closings. We study the effects of the closings on the use of two potential field
office substitutes: the online application and third-party representation. As shown in Table 2, the
number of applicants who file in person or by phone declines by 15 percent, while the number of
applicants who file online increases by 7 percent, which could reflect either less discouragement
among those who submit online or substitution to the online application. Nearly all of the shift
to the online application is driven by college graduates, rather than high school graduates or high
school dropouts (see Appendix Table A.17). If we interpret the estimates in terms of applicant
behavior, they suggest that more-educated applicants substitute to the online application, while
less-educated applicants do not. The closing increases the likelihood of having representation, but
the change is not significant, likely because only 5 percent of applicants are represented at the initial
level at baseline.
  23
     We calculate dollar values of each cost in a similar manner to the implied value of time calculations above. We
assume that those who do not apply because of the closing lose an average monthly benefit of $1000 for two years.
With an overall 2/3 probability of allowance, the expected benefit of applying is $16,000. From the estimates in Table
5, congestion reduces the probability of applying by 6.8 percent, driving distance by 0.3 percent, and office switching
by 2.3 percent. Multiplying these percentage declines by $16,000 yields $1100, $50, and $400, respectively.




                                                          27
6        Welfare implications of field office closings

We calculate the change in social welfare resulting from the field office closings using the following
framework. Let br (n) ≡ b1 − c1 − c2 (n) be the net social benefit from an approved disability
application given the number of field offices n. This term br includes the value of providing disability
benefits to a disabled individual relative to the average taxpayer net of the cost of public funds (b1 ),
minus the cost of reviewing the application (c1 ) and the cost to the applicant of applying (c2 ).
Let bn (n) ≡ c1 + c2 (n) be the net social cost from rejecting an application, which includes the
cost of reviewing the application (c1 ) and the cost to the applicant of applying (c2 ). Let F be the
administrative cost (i.e., rent) of operating a field office. For a number of recipients r(n) and a
number of applicants a(n), the net social benefit of having n field offices is


                      W (n) ≡ br (n)r(n) − bn (n)[a(n) − r(n)] − F n

                              = [b1 − c1 − c2 (n)]r(n) − [c1 + c2 (n)][a(n) − r(n)] − F n

                              = b1 r(n) − [c1 + c2 (n)]a(n) − F n


The change in social welfare from reducing the number of offices from n to n − 1 is


W (n − 1) − W (n) =[b1 r(n − 1) − (c1 + c2 (n − 1))a(n − 1) − F (n − 1)] − [b1 r(n) − (c1 + c2 (n))a(n) − F n]

                      = b1 [r(n − 1) − r(n)] − [c2 (n − 1) − c2 (n)]a(n − 1)
                        |                        {z                        }
                                               costs of closing

                         −c [a(n − 1) − a(n)] − c2 (n)[a(n − 1) − a(n)] + F
                         | 1                     {z                        }
                                               benefits of closing


The costs of the closing include the value of disability benefits to discouraged recipients (b1 [r(n −
1) − r(n)]) and the additional application time and effort for applicants who continue to apply
([c2 (n − 1) − c2 (n)]a(n − 1)). The benefits of the closing include administrative savings from not
paying rent on the office (F ) and administrative savings from processing fewer applications (c1 [a(n−
1) − a(n)]), including the cost of public funds for both, as well as savings to discouraged applicants
from applying (c2 (n)[a(n − 1) − a(n)]).24
    24
     We assume in this analysis that all disability recipients are deserving of benefits and all rejected applicants are
undeserving—in other words, no Type I or Type II errors in the disability determination process. To reconcile this
assumption with the model presented in Section 5.B in which the probability of allowance is greater than zero for
all applicants, we can adjust that model such that applicants observe a subjective measure of health while disability
adjudicators use an objective measure of health.



                                                           28
    Table 6 presents our cost-benefit analysis estimates, with detailed calculations presented in the
Appendix. We start with the costs of the closing. To calculate the value of benefits to recipients,
we assume that disability recipients value cash benefits and health insurance 50 percent more than
the average taxpayer, reflecting a higher marginal utility of income for a disabled individual, net of
the deadweight loss of taxation. We also assume, conservatively, that discouraged applicants lose
only two years of disability benefits as a result of the closing. To estimate the cost of increasing
applicant time and effort, we calculate the value of lost time from increased travel and wait times
and the lost earnings from the increase in processing times based on estimates from Autor et al.
(2015). Total costs are around $19.3 million per year, with the vast majority of this loss coming
from the value of benefits to recipients. Considering losses to non-disability applicant visitors to
the field office would increase the cost of the closing further.
    Turning to benefits of the closing, we estimate the administrative savings from processing fewer
applications by dividing the total annual administrative budget spent on disability programs by
the number of applications processed by field offices in a year, and then multiplying this ratio by
the reduction in applications. We estimate savings for discouraged applicants who no longer incur
application costs. Finally, we take administrative savings from the closing itself from SSA testimony.
Total benefits are around $4.1 million per year.
    Putting these figures together, we find that the social costs of the average field office closing
outweigh the social benefits by a ratio of 5 to 1, mostly because of the large loss in social welfare
from discouraging applicants who would have been allowed had they applied. As an alternative
analysis, we calculate how much more the average accepted applicant must value disability benefits
relative to the average taxpayer for the closings to have no net effect on welfare. We find that if the
average discouraged recipient values disability benefits at least 2.6 percent more than the average
taxpayer, then the closings are welfare-reducing.


7    Conclusion

The effect of application costs on the targeting of social safety net programs is theoretically am-
biguous: application costs could improve targeting if they discourage high-ability people with a
high opportunity cost of time from applying, or they could worsen targeting if they disproportion-
ately discourage low-ability people from applying. In this paper, we provide the first evidence on
this question in the context of disability programs, which are some of the largest social programs



                                                   29
in the developed world. We find that the closings of Social Security field offices, which provide
assistance with disability applications, reduce the number of disability applications by 11 percent
and the number of recipients by 13 percent in neighborhoods whose nearest office closes, and have
smaller but sizable effects in neighborhoods around neighboring offices. The effects are persistent,
with applications showing no sign of recovering even eight quarters after the closings. We also
use detailed administrative data on applicant characteristics to determine who is screened out by
higher application costs. Closings disproportionately discourage applicants with lower education
and pre-application earnings levels and applicants with moderately severe conditions.
   What are the policy implications of these results? First, the services provided by field offices are
valuable to disability applicants and are instrumental for 11 percent of applicants in the decision to
apply. This raises the question of why private industry does not attempt to meet the demand for
assistance with disability applications. Possible reasons include credit constraints faced by disabil-
ity applicants or government regulations that limit the compensation of disability representatives.
Second, we find that field office closings affect certain populations more than others. Field office
closings appear particularly consequential for potential applicants with low levels of education and
earnings, who are less likely to substitute to the online application or strategically submit their
application before the office closes. Future decisions about field office placement could consider the
distributional consequences of closings. Third, application costs have particular significance in the
context of disability programs, since health status is available to the disability agency only if the
individual applies. If application costs discourage truly disabled individuals from applying, as we
find in this paper, the disability agency has few other ways to identify these individuals and provide
them with benefits.
   In terms of normative implications, Nichols and Zeckhauser (1982) hypothesize that hassles
may increase overall social welfare by sacrificing a small amount of productive efficiency (i.e., more
applicant time and effort required to apply) for a large increase in targeting efficiency. We find
instead that the increase in hassles induced by Social Security field office closings reduces both
productive efficiency and targeting efficiency, as measured by current standards for disability receipt.
Moreover, if disability programs are also intended to address economic inequality, then the results by
socioeconomic status indicate that field office closings exacerbate the very inequality that disability
programs are intended to mitigate.

                                          Notes: Figure presents a model that explains non-monotonic effects by severity. The left-hand graph shows
                                          baseline conditions, with health h on the x-axis, where h = 1 is the best health. Measured on the right
                                          axis are the individual probability of allowance p(h) and the average probability of allowance for those who
                                          apply P r(R|A, η). Measured on the left axis are the benefits of application g(h) and the line η is the cost
                                          of application. As explained in Section 5.B, the function g(h) is non-monotonic because poor-health (high-
                                          severity) applicants value benefits because of poor health, while good-health (low-severity) applicants value
                                          benefits because they are negatively selected on skills. At baseline, everyone applies since g(h) is everywhere
                                          above η. The right-hand graph shows what happens when application costs increase from η to η 0 . Individuals
                                          in the middle of the health distribution are screened out, while those at either end continue applying.

      Notes: Table presents summary statistics for ZIP codes with an average of at least three disability applications per quarter in the year 2000. Closing ZIPs
      are ZIPs whose closest office closes. Neighboring ZIPs are ZIPs whose closest office is the second or third closest office to a closing ZIP. Unaffected ZIPs are
      ZIPs that are neither closing nor neighboring ZIPs. "ZIP characteristics" are calculated from the 2000 Census, "walk-in wait time" from Social Security
      Administration data (where 2005 is the earliest available year), and "quarterly disability applications" from Social Security Administration data.

Notes: *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1. The first set of columns presents estimates of the effect of field office closings on
log applications by subgroup, specifically estimates of β from equation (2). The second set of columns presents estimates
of β where the dependent variable is the proportion of applicants with that characteristic (for indicator variables like
severity, disability type, applicant behavior, and language) or the average of the characteristic across applicants (for
continuous variables like education, earnings, and age). If some subgroups are small, the change in proportion may be
small even when there is substantial heterogeneity in the effects across subgroups. Earnings and education estimates
include only adult applicants. The "Control Count" is the number of individuals in the control ZIP in a category, and
"Control Mean" is the mean characteristic in the control group. Sample is ZIP codes whose nearest office closes after 2000
and that have an average of at least three disability applications per quarter in the year before the closing. Regressions
are weighted by application volume in the year before the closing. Standard errors in parentheses.

Notes: *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1. The first set of columns presents estimates of the effect of field office
closings on log allowances by subgroup, specifically estimates of β from equation (2). The second set of columns

(for indicator variables like severity, disability type, applicant behavior, and language) or the average of the
characteristic across recipients (for continuous variables like education, earnings, and age). Earnings and education
estimates include only adult allowances. The "Control Count" is the number of individuals in the control ZIP in
a category, and "Control Mean" is the mean characteristic in the control group. "Low" severity not applicable
at the allowance level because low severity is defined as being denied. Sample is ZIP codes whose nearest office
closes after 2000 and that have an average of at least three disability applications per quarter in the year before
the closing. Regressions are weighted by recipient volume in the year before the closing. Standard errors in

Notes: *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1. Table presents estimates of the effect of field office closings on log applications,
log allowances, and measures of application costs for closing and neighboring ZIPs, specifically estimates of β from
equation (2), where T reatedic is replaced with T reatedN bric for the neighboring ZIP regressions. A closing ZIP is
a ZIP whose nearest office closes. A neighboring ZIP is a ZIP whose nearest office is the second or third closest
office of a closing ZIP. Walk-in wait time is the average time (in minutes) that a visitor to a field office waits to
be seen. Processing time is the number of days it takes a field office to send an application to a state disability
determination services office. Driving time, driving distance, and public transit time to the nearest field office are
calculated using Google maps with the trip originating from the ZIP centriod. Sample is ZIP codes whose nearest
office closes after 2000 and that have an average of at least three disability applications per quarter in the year before
the closing. Regressions are weighted by application or recipient volume in the year before the closing. Standard
errors in parentheses.

     Notes: *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1. Table presents first stage estimates from equations (8) and (9), reduced form estimates, and OLS and IV estimates
     from equation (7). The first stage for wait time gives the effect of the difference in pre-closing wait time of the now-closest office and previously-closest office
     on wait time (in minutes), and analogously for the first stage for distance (in kilometers). The reduced form estimates give the effect of the instruments on
     log disability applications. The IV estimates give the effect of wait time, distance, and office switching on log disability applications. Sample is ZIP codes
     whose nearest office closes after 2000 and that have an average of at least three disability applications per quarter in the year before the closing. Wait
     time data are not available for all offices in all quarters, so the sample size falls when wait time is included in the regression. Regressions are weighted by
     application volume in the year before the closing. Standard errors in parentheses.
