                                        ABSTRACT

This paper provides a simple conceptual framework that captures how different perceptions,
attitudes, and biases about immigrants or minorities can shape preferences for redistribution.
Through the lens of this framework, we review the empirical literature on the effects of racial
diversity and immigration on support for redistribution in the US and Europe.
