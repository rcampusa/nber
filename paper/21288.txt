This paper reports the results of an experiment evaluating the effects of incentives on individuals' willingness
to participate in a survey. By pairing the assessment with a natural field experiment, the analysis considers
private versus public goods as incentives, and estimates respondents' willingness to support the oldest
food bank in the U.S.

I. Introduction

         This paper reports a unique assessment of the effects of incentives on individuals’

willingness to participate in a social survey.1 We consider monetary incentives, contributions to a

charity, and the option to choose either the cash or a contribution of the same amount. Both the

monetary offer and the treatment offering the ability to select cash or a contribution were

significantly more likely to increase participation when compared with the treatment offering to

donate the same amount to charity. Respondents who received the option allowing a choice of

cash or a contribution, and who participated, were less likely to donate as the size of the

monetary incentive increased.

         Our findings are relevant to three different sets of research: (1) we are the first, to our

knowledge, to evaluate the effectiveness of a private good (cash) versus a public good (charity)

in obtaining survey responses; (2) our findings are also relevant to the literature on charitable

giving. By using a strategy relatively free of social pressure, respondents can give to a charity

without being influenced by peer effects.2 Neutralizing such peer effects is important because

about 75 percent of giving has been estimated to be due to social pressure (DellaVigna, List and

 See Mercer et al. [2015] for a recent meta analysis of the evidence on the role of incentives for survey responses.

 Respondents are given the option to take the survey online, by phone, or in person. The majority (64%) who
completed the survey during this experiment took it online.

Malmendier [2012]). As a result, past research does not offer the ability to estimate the private

demand for charity in a way that is free of this social pressure.3 And (3) our choice based

treatment—cash versus a contribution—extends the logic of field experiments, combining them

with surveys, and provides a new strategy for measuring the value of public goods.

         Our choice option is a natural field experiment where subjects decide to give to the

charity.4 The charity is fixed. They must complete the survey to be able to “pay for” the services

of the charity. They make their contribution by surrendering the monetary incentive. The

subjects are a subset of the random sample of residents of the Phoenix metropolitan area. The

potential respondents were randomly assigned to the different treatments associated with the

experiment. The final sample was determined by the respondents’ participation decisions within

the fixed time interval at the outset of the field time of a survey associated with the Central

Arizona Project Long Term Ecological Research Site (LTER).5

         Section II outlines the design of our experiment, conducted during the first phase of the

2011 Phoenix Area Social Survey. Section III summarizes our results. Section IV we consider

their implications for each of the research areas we highlighted. The last section summarizes the

findings.


II. Experimental Design




3
 More specifically, this literature focuses on mechanisms to increase monetary gifts (Landry et al. [2006], List and
Lucking-Reiley [2002]), the reasons for giving to charity (Croson and Shang [2009], DellaVigna, List, and
Malmendier [2012], List [2011]) and the effects of changes in the price of charitable giving (Clotfelter [1990] and
Karlan and List [2007]).
4
  Harrison and List [2004] identified six factors to be considered in determining whether an experiment can be
considered as taking place “in the field”. Their factors include: the nature of the subject pool; the information
subjects bring to the task; the nature of the community; the nature of the task or trading rules applied; the nature of
the financial stakes; and the nature of the environment. (P. 1012)
5
  The primary objective of the survey required that adjustments be made in efforts to recruit respondents. As a result,
the experiment had to stop when these changes were made.

        The Phoenix Area Social Survey (PASS) is one of the activities of the NSF sponsored

Central Arizona Project (CAP) LTER at Arizona State University (ASU). A pilot study for the

first implementation of this survey was conducted in 2001-2002 and full administration of the

social survey was completed in 2006. Our analysis was undertaken as part of the replication of

the survey in 2011. It used the neighborhood definitions established in 2006 and added five new

neighborhoods. The 2006 definition for the neighborhoods was based on two criteria: the

network of monitoring sites for local ecosystems in the Phoenix metropolitan area and the

identification of local communities based on demographic criteria including income, ethnicity,

and retirement status. The 204 ecological monitoring sites maintained as part of the CAP LTER

are used to study vegetation, soil, and other ecological variables on 30 x 30 meter sample plots

distributed over all types of land uses in the study area (see Grimm and Redman [2004]). The

sampling frame for neighborhoods was determined by examining aerial photographs of the areas

surrounding 101 monitoring sites within residential neighborhoods (other sites were located in

undeveloped desert or farmland). 94 sites (101 in residential areas less the 7 eliminated sites)6

were aligned with Census Block groups to identify the socio-economic characteristics of the

sampling units. Eight categories were specified in defining these groups of neighborhoods: low

income urban core;7 low income suburban; middle to high income urban core; middle income

suburban; low to middle income fringe areas;8 high income suburban; high income fringe; and

retirement communities. Five neighborhoods were selected from each category to reflect

variability in the demographic composition and the mix of home owners and renters. This

  Seven sites of the sixteen visited were eliminated because the residents were not close to the plot used for
monitoring.

  Urban core neighborhoods are within 5 miles of downtown Phoenix or within 1.5 miles of the other 7 large city
downtowns. The exact distances somewhat based on historical development patterns.

  Urban fringe areas are defined as having a moderate amount of undeveloped land within a mile of the
neighborhood as of 2005.

process yielded a total of 40 neighborhoods in 2006. In 2011, five new neighborhoods from a set

that were important sites for CAP LTER research (one monitoring and four others) were added

to the sample following the same basic structure for identifying neighborhood characteristics.

        The survey used a multi modal format and was administered by the ASU Institute for

Social Science Research from May 26, 2011 to January 6, 2012. 2,127 potential respondents

were selected as part of the sample design. Household selection had two dimensions in the 2011

survey. All addresses for the 2006 survey respondents were included in the sample. These were

supplemented with other residential addresses in the sampled neighborhoods. These addresses

were randomly sampled from an enumerated list of tax assessor parcels. The survey was

announced to the sample with several initial mailers.9 First, a postcard in English and Spanish

was sent to the selected addresses notifying the potential respondents of the project and the

specific, randomly assigned incentive for them to participate. Second, a letter in English and

Spanish was sent explaining how to complete the survey along with the same assigned incentive.

The letter included a brochure describing the project in both languages, a one dollar bill, and a

magnet with a graphic design for the project. When the data collection was ended, 806

completed surveys were obtained with a response rate of 43.4% computed using the standard

definition of the American Association for Public Opinion Research [2011].

        The incentives varied in two dimensions based on: the amount of incentive and the way it

was offered. Three different monetary values ($10, $20, and $30) were used in each of three

different structures: (a) as a monetary incentive to be mailed to respondents after they completed

the survey; (b) as a donation of one of the three amounts to the First Food Bank Alliance (also

 The Appendix A provides a brief summary of the details as well as copies of the materials sent to announce the
survey.

known locally as St. Mary’s Food Bank)10 when the survey was completed; and (c) as either a

check for one of the three monetary values or a donation of that amount to the food bank upon

completion. The respondents in this treatment could select their preferred option. They could not

modify the amount to be donated, it was all or nothing.

         The objective of the survey was to collect information about the knowledge and

environmental attitudes of the Phoenix area population with as high a response rate as possible.

As a result, the experimental period was limited to May through the end of August of 2011. After

that, the focus was changed to increased monetary incentives to encourage a high level of

participation. Our analysis is limited to the respondents who agreed and completed the survey or

who declined or terminated interviews during the experimental period. 557 interviews were

completed and 187 were refused or terminated during the experimental period. Table 1

summarizes the distribution by experimental treatment and final interview status. The original

assignment of treatments by neighborhood was intended to be random. The random assignment

of treatments was made to the 2,127 identified as potential respondents. As indicated in the next

to last row of Table 1, the final disposition does not appear consistent with a random assignment.

Disproportionate assignments were made to the $20 or $30 cash offers and to the $30 choice

treatment. The distribution relevant for the experimental period is the next row up where the $20

and $30 cash treatments are larger than any of the others. These distributions were assigned

randomly for each of the 45 neighborhoods, rather than to the composite sample without regard

to neighborhood. The cash treatment with the $30 incentive continues to be the largest group

with the $20 cash also large. The remainder appear balanced considering the overall sample.



10
  There is no religious affiliation associated with the food bank and in order to prevent attitudes toward Catholicism
from influencing responses, we did not refer to the food bank as “St. Mary’s” in our communication with
respondents.

                                                          5
        The specific treatment each respondent received is random. This unequal distribution

influences the precision of our estimates and the ability to recover measures of responses for all

treatments in all 45 neighborhoods but not the randomization at the individual respondent level.

Thus it should not bias our comparisons evaluating the effects of the treatments.

        We evaluated the decisions to take the survey in several different ways. First, relying on

the random assignment to each housing unit (and respondent) we estimate ordinary least squares

(OLS) models with participation decision as a binary dependent variable and the features

defining each treatment as independent variables.11 These include the amount of the monetary

offer and dummy variables for cash, charity, or the choice formats. The second model includes

fixed effects for the neighborhoods along with the design related variables as determinants of

each person’s decision about whether to participate. The last approach is non-parametric. In this

case, each of the nine possible treatments is interacted with dummy variables identifying each of

the 45 neighborhoods. We use OLS, with the dummy variable for the participation decision, as

the dependent variable and these interaction terms to measure the response rates for each

combination where there is sufficient sample to recover an estimate. These estimated coefficients

are then used as dependent variables in second stage models. In this case the framework relies on

what can be detected using these estimates for average response rates across the

treatment/neighborhood combinations for analyzing the experimental data cells. The second and

third approaches provide different strategies to assess whether our conclusions would be affected

by the disproportionate assignment of treatments to some neighborhoods.

        Finally, for those respondents who received the treatment allowing a choice of cash or the

charity, we also evaluate what they decided as the monetary incentive changed. This analysis

11
  While early research considering binary response, dependent variable models favored probit or logit, Angrist and
Pischke [2009] and Wooldridge [2010, Chapter 15] conclude that the linear probability (OLS) model generally
provides reliable estimates of the directions and magnitudes of the average effects of independent variables.

offers the ability to estimate their willingness to support the food bank. These estimates are free

of the social pressure often associated with other efforts to evaluate the motives for charitable

giving.12


III. Results

        Table 2 provides the estimates for our linear probability models evaluating the factors

that influenced the decision to participate in the survey. The first column is a model that includes

the amount of the monetary incentive and dummy variables for each of the ways it was offered.

We exclude the intercept to allow estimation of the separate effects for the cash, donation, and

choice treatments. The size of the incentive is not a significant determinant of participation and

this result holds regardless of the model specification considered, including non parametric

estimates.

        Our finding contrasts with the overall conclusion of the Mercer et al. [2015] meta-

analysis. These authors found the best overall summary of their evaluation of financial incentives

was that the past analyses were consistent with the size of the offer having a significant,

nonlinear effect on response rates. Their analysis does have some important differences with our

research. It involves survey-wide response rates so the meta-regression captures differences

across different surveys. By contrast, our analysis involves the same survey instrument and

evaluates differences across potential respondents at the individual level. The modes considered

in Mercer et al.’s summary were mail, telephone, and in person interviews but were constant for

each survey. The modes in our survey were the outcome of the respondents’ decisions as part of



12
  As noted at the outset, the survey could be taken online, by telephone, or with a scheduled personal interview. A
multinomial-logit model considers the demographic factors influencing the choice of online, telephone, or in person
response rates indicated that whites were significantly more likely to use online or telephone, and education was a
significant positive factor in the selection of the online mode.

                                                         7
the decision to take the survey. Finally, our analysis did not have a treatment with no incentive.

As a result, it was not possible to consider the response patterns compared to this situation.

         All of the coefficients for the dummy variables for the mode effects are statistically

significant. Model 1’s results confirm that providing cash yields significantly higher participation

than when the same amount is offered as a donation. The same is true for the treatment offering a

choice of cash or the contribution when compared to a donation. These test results are reported in

the two rows below the number of observations for each model. Finally, a test for differences in

the coefficients for the cash treatment and a choice to donate or keep the cash fails to reject the

null hypothesis of equality.

         The second column includes fixed effects for each neighborhood serving as a sampling

unit in the model along with the dummy variables for the form used in offering incentives. None

of the conclusions summarized based on model (1) are altered. The last two columns in the table

ask a related question, namely, does the comparison of cash versus the choice treatment change

if we account for each respondent’s decision to donate or keep the incentive? To address this

question, it is important to acknowledge the decision of whether or not to keep the cash is likely

correlated with the decision to participate. As a result, the models in columns 3 and 4 are based

on instrumental variable (IV) estimates using the randomly assigned monetary incentive as the

instrument for the choice to donate. As the models in the first two columns indicate, the

monetary incentive was not a significant determinant in potential respondent’s decision to

participate. However, it was a significant determinant (as we discuss in more detail below) in

their decisions to donate the money they received for completing the survey. 13




13
  A simple regression indicates a significant negative relationship with a F =10.89 (p-value = 0.001) for the joint
null hypothesis of no association.

                                                          8
       Using the IV estimator based on the predicted donation choice from a model with the size

of the monetary incentive offered, we find the test results for the effects of cash incentives versus

donation do not change. Cash and choice are not significantly different in their incentive effects.

Moreover, these conclusions are also not affected if fixed effects for the neighborhoods are

included in the models. One contrasting finding with these estimates arises with the difference

between coefficients associated with choice and donation. These coefficients would not be

judged as significantly different. However, the magnitudes of the estimated parameters are

comparable to what we found in OLS models omitting the endogenous decision to donate effect.

Thus, this change seems likely to be due to the larger standard errors for the IV estimates.

       Our last comparison of the effects of different types of incentives is given in Table 3.

Here we report the results for the two step non-parametric test of the effects of the types of

incentives. The analysis is now more comparable to Mercer et al. in that we are comparing the

estimated average response rates for cells defined by the neighborhood and treatment received.

With our small sample and disproportionate assignments, this strategy is a more demanding

approach for testing these hypotheses. As the sample size at the bottom of Table 3 suggests, we

are not able to estimate response rates for all of the possible combinations of neighborhood and

treatment alternatives. The sample includes 271 versus 405 (9 x 45) of the possible alternatives.

All of the estimates use the estimated standard errors from the OLS first stage estimates of the

coefficients for the dummy variables for each neighborhood/treatment alternative to construct

feasible generalized least squares (FGLS) estimates for assessing the incentive effects. Model 1

considers the monetary incentive alone. Model 2 includes the dummy variables for the format in

which the incentive was offered. The findings are consistent with the analysis at the individual

level. We report the estimated difference between the response rates and the p-value for tests of



                                                 9
equality. Cash incentives and a choice of cash or donation lead to significantly greater

participation than offering to donate, regardless of whether the model takes account of the

monetary incentives.

         Table 4 reports the influence of the size of the monetary incentive on the decision to

donate. The sample is restricted to the individuals who agreed to participate and received the

choice treatment. Several aspects of these results are notable. First, the likelihood of donating

declines as the size of the monetary incentive increases. Model 1 is based on the choices of these

respondents receiving the choice treatment.14 Model 2 restricts the sample to those who received

the choice treatment and completed the survey online. It reflects the choice of individuals who

experienced the most limited social pressure to donate. The results are comparable.

         It is possible to use these models to estimate the average respondents’ economic value for

the public good services provided by the food bank. This last element stems from the ability to

adapt the participation incentive so it provides a natural field experiment. To develop this

estimate, consider a simple model for each survey participant’s decision to donate to the food

bank. Equation (1) specifies a linear, indirect utility function for the utility realized if a

respondent donates his financial incentive to the food bank                    and (2) if he does not

                                       (1)

                                 (2)

This formulation is similar to the logic Hanemann [1984] originally outlined to derive the

welfare properties of discrete choice models. We assume the marginal utility of income                          ,

14
  We also considered a sub-sample of the respondents receiving this treatment who agreed to provide their
household income. The choice to donate model was:
                              Donate = +.398 - .012 Dollar Incentive + .0018 income
                                         (2.99) (-2.26)                 (2.28)
Income = household income in thousands of dollars, Number of observations = 99, R 2 = .11
As other literature has suggested, the likelihood of donating the monetary incentive to charity increases with the
income level of the respondent.

                                                          10
designated by     , remains constant across the two decisions.        represents the monetary

incentive. Since the model describes the choice for an individual who has agreed to participate, it

recognizes that taking the survey implies the time commitment, represented here by . With this

treatment, a decision to donate the incentive implies the respondent’s “out of pocket” cost is the

time for the survey. By contrast, a decision to keep the incentive offsets the time cost of doing

the survey. The     and           terms capture the difference in well-being a person experiences with

the decision to donate versus not donate to the food bank.

       It is not possible to unpack whether different respondents interpret the “amount” of

public good services provided by the food bank in relation to the warm glow they might

experience from giving to any cause. More specifically, if we re-formulate the two state-specific

preference functions to include the total amount given to charity by others, say , and allow for

the possibility of a warm glow effect, then it is possible to illustrate why testing this hypothesis is

unfeasible. When the individual contributes ,            would then be given as equation (3):

                            (3)

                      where                              and

Using these expressions for        and      we see more information on respondents’ beliefs about

and assumptions about the form of           would be needed to test warm glow.

       In principle, such analyses could be undertaken in future research. This pairing of field

experiments and response incentive offers a strategy for addressing some of the limitations that

List [2011] identified as being associated with the existing research on the demand for charitable

services. For example, a revised incentive structure could distinguish these effects using the


                                                    11
results from Eckel et al.’s [2005] laboratory experiments with undergraduates. More specifically,

these authors found that explaining exogenous contributions to a charity as the result of a tax on

subjects’ endowment resulted in a crowding out of their subsequent contributions and thus

reduced or eliminated warm glow effects. Using this logic it would be possible to explain to a

subset of the potential survey respondents that a portion of the incentive they would have earned

was already earmarked as a “tax” for the food bank and ask if they wished to contribute the

balance of their proposed financial incentive. Finally, to derive our measure for the economic

value of donating, assume          and       represent unobserved heterogeneity associated with the

two states. A person donates if                       , and we can use the estimated parameters for our

choice model to recover a measure for the maximum donation,                   , participants in the survey

would make on this “giving occasion”. Equation (5) solves for                  consistent with

         given

                     .

                                                (5)

The time commitment is the same regardless of whether the individual donates or not and thus

drops from the relationship.

        Our estimates for the maximum contribution can be interpreted using Kotchen’s [2015]

analysis.15 He demonstrates that the maximum take it or leave it donation can exceed the amount

a person would contribute if he had discretion in selecting the amount. Our experiment recovers

a partial measure for the concept he envisioned as the take it or leave it value of donating. In our

case, the value is for contributions to the food bank on a given occasion. These estimates are

computed for two samples, one with all respondents receiving the choice treatment and for the

  While Kotchen’s analysis focuses on the donation vehicle as part of a contingent valuation survey, his model is
directly relevant to the choice implied by our field experiment.

subset who answered using the online survey model and might be expected to experience the

lowest amount of social pressure. Both estimates are significantly different from zero. They are

$38 and $39 respectively. As we discuss in the next section, there are other elements to include

in the full monetary measure of the take it or leave it donation value. These additional

components would include the opportunity cost of the time to take the survey. Our design

precluded recovering a measure for this added value because the sample used to estimate            had

to agree to take the survey in order for our analysis to observe their donation decisions.


IV. Discussion

       Perhaps the most interesting component of this analysis arises from embedding a natural

field experiment within our assessment of response incentives. By allowing respondents to

decide whether to keep or donate the financial incentive, it is possible to estimate a part of the

economic value of the public good services provided by First Food Bank Alliance. A take it or

leave it opportunity to contribute a fixed amount implements a variant of the logic envisioned in

Kotchen’s [2015] analysis of the donation vehicle for contingent valuation surveys. In our case,

the choice is a “real one” that fits the structure of his model. Using the model to evaluate the

economic value of the food bank’s services would require an expansion in his framework that

addresses how people consider opportunities to donate within a setting that links what might be

described as planned overall giving in a well-defined time horizon with the choices made in each

specific opportunity to donate. To our knowledge this issue has not been addressed in the

literature on charitable giving. List [2011] discusses annual giving, he describes who makes

these donations, and how they are distributed among different charitable groups. The time

horizons discussed are annual and the potential distribution over a lifetime, not in terms of each

specific opportunity to give.


                                                 13
        There are several ways of conceptualizing this task. We consider two possibilities.

Unfortunately both require more information than we collected in this initial experiment. It is

nonetheless worth sketching the logic of each because it would be possible to use the basic

framework treating survey incentives as a source for natural field experiments to investigate the

interrelationship between the mix, timing, and total amount given to charity over a household’s

budgeting cycle. The first possible interpretation of the timing of charitable contributions would

be to treat them as akin to repeated “use” or consumption, where the frequency of purchases is

endogenous. Liu, Rettenmaier and Saving [2011] consider a simple static model that

distinguishes a fixed cost of consumption from the unit price of the commodity or service

experiencing repeated consumption. In their analysis this fixed component or “setup cost” could

be a travel cost for a recreation trip and the price could be the unit cost of the activity such as ski

lift costs or lodging.16

        The analogy to the setup cost with charitable contributions would be the time and costs

associated with investigating the reliability of a charitable organization. This assessment could

involve evaluating the share of contributions used for administration and management,

performance in meeting stated objectives, and so forth. Costs arise in obtaining reliable

information to address these issues. The Liu et al framework suggests that as the setup costs

increase, the frequency of giving to otherwise completely equivalent charities is likely to decline

and the intensity of giving to just one of them increases. The implications for total giving in the

time period used to characterize overall consumption expenditures (across all of the equivalent

charities in their analysis) would be an empirical issue. Food banks are widely recognized as

having among the lowest administrative costs and having reliable and predictable outcomes. This

[2005] for a review.

                                                     14
is certainly true of the First Food Bank Alliance. As a result, this logic does not provide

predictions for the frequency of giving or the total amount in a given budgeting period. As a

result their model provides a framework for specifying hypotheses for testing and a clear

motivation for further empirical research

       Using a parallel to second literature associated with consumer responses to sales and

holding inventories of storable goods (see Hendel and Nevo [2004]) leads to a similar general

conclusion. This literature would require more assumptions about how people conceptualize the

time distribution of giving. Resources available for meals and warm clothing, for example, may

be more important in the winter than in the fall and spring. Needs in the summer would likely be

different and depend on the location of the food bank. To use this literature to gauge inter-

temporal substitution of giving would require more assumptions about how people envision what

different distributions for a given amount of contributions to charity over time will accomplish.

       We might be able to learn about inter-temporal substitution by using events that motivate

individuals to alter a planned pattern of giving such as natural disasters. These events may well

trigger the substitution of an immediate opportunity for other longer term or more permanent

needs. Field experiments require advance planning, navigating internal review board

requirements and often significant resources. As a result, it is difficult to take advantage of

strategic opportunities caused by natural events. By using field experiments as part of survey

incentives it should be possible to design a research question associated with disasters to both

consider an important question—inter-temporal displacements of donations and “do good” by

helping those in need as a result of the disaster providing the immediate need for help.

       As we noted with our specific application, additional information would be needed to

pursue the hypotheses implied by either of these models. It is also not impossible to implement



                                                 15
fully a variant of Kotchen’s model. We do not know what the respondents were already giving to

the food bank. Moreover, the range of incentives offered to them limit what we can say about

donations when people were provided a wider range of incentive values. Nonetheless, our results

do demonstrate that this strategy offers a viable basis for estimating people’s willingness to pay

for increases in the amounts of these types of public goods. We can go a bit further in

considering the maximum contribution on a gift occasion by including an estimate of the

opportunity cost of time and use the two sets of results to gauge the implied value of the food

bank’s services. Smith and Mansfield’s [1998] estimates of the value of time, based on the

compensation offered to North Carolina households in 1995-96 for their time spent in a

telephone interview, provide the closest parallel to the current situation. Based on these results,

we estimate that the average respondent gave up 30 minutes that would be worth between $12

and $24 (in 2011 dollars).17 This decision was made regardless of whether they kept or donated

the money. By keeping the incentive, they would cover the opportunity costs of time on average.

One might argue that those who donated the incentive would also have been willing to contribute

an additional $12 to $24 if they did not have to take the survey.18

         A further question one might ask when evaluating the economic value of charity to a food

bank concerns the public services that respondents believe they are receiving when they donate.

While the analytical models for charitable contributions assume perfect substitution between

individual gifts in defining the amount of the public good and generally represent them as the


17
   The Smith-Mansfield estimates were based on an offer to complete a second telephone survey. Depending on the
specific statistical model selected from this study, the estimate for the per hour opportunity cost of time ranged from
$19.65 to $32.74 in 1995 dollars. Using the consumer price index to convert from 1995 to 2011 dollars implies these
should be scaled by 1.476. The PASS survey took ½ hour, adjusting for the time and rounding the resulting
estimates yields these results.
18
   Of course, this logic accepts the fungibility of time and money implicit by the use of the Smith-Mansfield
estimates to value these respondents’ time. Other research has suggested that the opportunity cost of time in
different uses will be different and the people would not necessarily make this type of exchange in all contexts. See
Palmquist, Phaneuf, and Smith [2010] for related discussion.

                                                          16
sum of the cash contributions (see Andreoni [1989], List [2011]), the charities tend to describe

the effects of contributions by translating into outcomes.19 The First Food Bank Alliance, for

example, routinely translates dollar contributions into meals (at a fixed ratio) such as “$30 to

provide 210 meals”. This logic is consistent with the strategy used for framing contingent

valuation surveys since the Exxon Valdez survey (Carson et al. [1992]). That is, these surveys

described the object of choice offered to survey respondents as a plan to avoid specific injuries,

rather than a specific improvement in the environment. Survey respondents in these cases make

choices about the plan. In principle, the natural field experiment could be designed to include

details of how survey incentives would be used to “produce” different types of public or impure

public goods.


V. Summary and Implications

        To our knowledge this study is the first effort to compare public goods with private goods

(cash) as response incentives for a household survey. We found that our public good—a

contribution to a food bank—was not as effective as either a cash incentive or a format that

allows each respondent to decide to keep or donate the cash20. Our findings on the effects of the

amount of the incentive contrast with the existing literature, that found “. . . a strong, nonlinear

effect of incentives across all three models of data collection included in the analysis.” (Mercer

et al. [2005], p. 124). While the results reported here focused on models specified to be linear in

the incentive, we also considered non-parametric, nonlinear (log transformed), and interaction

variables for the amount of the incentive with the form of the incentive (i.e. cash, donation or

choice). None of these alternatives changed our overall conclusions.

           Our approach does contrast with past assessments of response rates that tend to involve

comparisons across surveys which used a single mode for their responses. Our respondents could

choose the mode for their response – from online, telephone, or in person interviews. Incentives,

whether cash or donation, were paid after the survey was completed.21 While past research on

survey incentives found that prepaid incentives were more effective than promises with delayed

payment, Mercer et al. note the effects are not uniform for all models. Our research argues that

the use of incentives to enhance participation in surveys provides an opportunity for conducting

field experiments. It is possible to reduce the front-end negotiation for access to different groups

for experiments and broaden the types of subject pools studied. Of course, for this linkage to be

cost effective the front-end field experiments cannot compromise the objectives of the surveys

that offer the mechanisms for undertaking the experiments.
