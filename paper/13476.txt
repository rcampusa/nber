                                                ABSTRACT

The current practice of measuring age as years-since-birth, both in common practice and in the law,
rather than alternative measures reflecting a person's stage in the lifecycle distorts important behavior
such as retirement, saving, and the discussion of dependency ratios. Two alternative measures of age
are explored: mortality risk and remaining life expectancy. With these alternative measures, the huge
wave of elderly forecast for the first half of this century doesn't look like a huge wave at all. By conventional
65+ standards, the fraction of the population that is elderly will grow by about 66 percent. However,
the fraction of the population that is above a mortality rate that corresponds to 65+ today will grow
by only 20 percent. Needless to say, the aging of the society is a lot less dramatic with the alternative
mortality-based age measures. In a separate application of age measurement, I examine the consequences
of stabilizing labor force participation by age with alternative age definitions. If labor force participation
were to remain as it is today with respect to remaining life expectancy (i.e. if the length of retirement
stayed where it is today) rather than labor force participation remaining fixed by conventionally-defined
age, then there would be 9.6 percent more total labor supply by 2050 in the U.S. This additional labor
supply could help finance entitlement programs amongst other things. GDP would be between seven
and ten percent higher by 2050 if retirement lengths stabilize. Several policies are examined that would
encourage longer work careers.

       This paper is not about what you think it is. It is about how to measure age. I

argue that there are better alternatives to the standard measure of years-since-birth. In

fact, I claim that public policy would be better if age were more appropriately specified in

the law. A particularly simple alternative to years since birth would be a measure of age

based on mortality risk. Groups whose mortality risk is high would be considered old,

those with low mortality risk would be classified as young and those with the same

mortality risk would be considered to be the same age. Another closely related approach

would be to measure age from the other end of life, at least in expected terms. That is,

remaining life expectancy (RLE) would be the measure of age and those with a short

RLE would be considered elderly and those with a long RLE would be considered young.

One advantage of the RLE approach is that it is measured in years, units that are widely

understood unlike mortality risk which is measured in the percentage chance of dying

within a year.

       Even at a point in time, there are differences between the various ways of

measuring age. For instance, RLE and mortality risk would reflect that a man at

conventionally defined age of 65 is the roughly the same age as a woman of age 70. The

real differences, between the proposed mortality based measures and the conventional

years since birth measure comes when comparing populations at different points in time,

such as comparing the 1965 population with the 2007 population or the projected 2050

population. The different measures will, for instance, give a very different answer to how

many elderly people there will be in 2050. Later in the paper we will look at how these
various ways of measuring age would apply to labor force participation and also how

different old-age dependency ratios might look under the alternative approaches.

       To the best of my knowledge, there isn’t a large existing literature on alternative

ways of measuring age. The paper that contains ideas most similar to mine was written

by my Stanford colleague Victor Fuchs (1984). In his paper, Victor discusses using

remaining life expectancy as a better measure of age and noted that when Social Security

was designed in 1935, the gender-blended remaining life expectancy at age 65 was 12.5

years. By 1984, those who had 12.5 years of remaining life expectancy were 72 years of

age. Victor went on to say that if 65 was the appropriate entry age for being categorized

as elderly in 1935, then the entry age for that status should have been 72 in 1984. Victor,

thus, already had the idea of an alternative measure of age and suggested that “nominal

ages” could or perhaps should be adjusted to “real ages” based on mortality or remaining

life expectancy.

       Another paper that is closely related is Cutler and Sheiner (2001). The authors

are concerned with the impact of demographic changes on medical spending both in the

past and in future projections. They note that for acute care and nursing home care,

demand is more a function of remaining life expectancy than it is of age. They also note

the high medical costs associated with the last year of life and that, on average, the last

year of life has been occurring at older and older ages. They don’t quite reach the

conclusion that I have – namely that age itself could be defined as something other than

years-since-birth – but their analysis suggests the need for a new measure of age.

       In order to get started, Figures 1 and 2 introduce the concept of mortality

milestones, the first age at which men and women reach one, two, and four percent

mortality risk. Figure 1 shows that in the year 2000, men first reached a mortality risk of


                                                                                              1
one percent at age 58, they first reached a two percent mortality risk at age 65 and they

reached the four percent milestone at age 73. The corresponding ages in 1970 were 51,

59, and 68. The figure says that 51 year-olds in 1970 and 58 year-olds in 2000 had the

same mortality risk (1%), 59 year-olds in 1970 and 65 year-olds in 2000 similarly had the

same mortality (2%), and 68 year-olds in 1970 had the same mortality risk as 73 year-

olds in 2000. In just the thirty years between 1970 and 2000, the age at which one

percent mortality is reached advanced seven years, the age at which two percent mortality

risk is reached advanced six years and the age at which four percent is reached advanced

five years. Any way you look at it, there was remarkable progress in age-specific

mortality. A mortality-based age system would suggest that 59 year-old men in 1970 and

65 year-old men in 2000 were the same age.

       Figure 2 has the corresponding information for women. Two things are

immediately apparent. First, women at the same number of years since birth are

effectively younger than men of the same conventionally defined age. In 2000, women

first reach a one percent mortality risk at age 63 (compared with 58 for men), a two

percent mortality risk at 70 (compared with 65 for men) and a four percent mortality risk

at age 78 (compared with 73 for men). The mortality risk approach to measuring age

would have 70 year old women in 2000, 65 year old men in 2000, and 59 year old men in

1970 as all being the same age.

       The measurement of age with different measures is not like choosing between

measuring temperature on a Fahrenheit or Centigrade scale. The connection between the

two temperature measures is linear and constant through time. In a very real sense, it

doesn’t matter which scale you use. However, the relationships between the different

ways of measuring human age change over time and some apparently important

phenomenon are primarily due to a particular method of age measurement. For instance,

it is reasonably well known that Medicare spends more on men than it does on women of

the same age. The difference (being of the order of thirty percent) isn’t small. But, this

result is a function of how age is measured. Medicare spends roughly the same amount

on men and women with the same mortality risk or with the same remaining life

expectancy (Shoven, 2004). Of course, the fact that reconciles these observations is that

75-year old women are younger than 75-year old men, at least according to an age system

based mortality risk or remaining life expectancy.

       Figures 1 and 2 also show that the rate of mortality progress was somewhat

slower for women than for men, at least for the last thirty years of the twentieth century.

The age at which women first reach a one percent mortality risk went up four years

between 1970 and 2000 (vs. seven yeas for men), the age at which mortality risk reaches

two percent advanced two years for women (vs. six for men) and the age where four

percent mortality is “achieved” advanced three years for women (vs. five years for men).

       Figures 3 and 4 illustrate the same phenomenon slightly differently. They show

mortality risk by years-since-birth for men and women in 1965 and 2005. Once again,

we see that there was more mortality progress for men than women over this period. One

way to look at it is the amount you would have to shift the 1965 curve to the right in

order for it to overlap the 2005 curve. If you do it so that the curves match at roughly 3.5


                                                                                              4
percent for men (about at age 65 in 1965), then the required shift is about 7 years. This is

similar to the fact we saw in Figure 1, but here we learn that 72 year-old men in 2005 had

about the same mortality risk as 65 year-olds in 1965. The mortality curve for women

would need to shift to the right far less to coincide between 1965 and 2005. The

mortality risk of 65 year old women in 1965 was about 1.75 percent, roughly the same as

69 year old women in 2005. So, at these ages we see that men in 2005 are effectively

seven years younger than someone of the same age in 1965, whereas women are

effectively about four years younger.

       There are plenty of other demographic statistics we could look at regarding the

measurement of age, but I will simply present one more relationship, the relationship

between remaining life expectancy and mortality risk for men and women. The data are

plotted in Figures 5 and 6. You might have thought that the relationship between

mortality risk and remaining life expectancy would be pretty stable across time (I did),

since they are alternative mortality-related measures of age. However, the figures show

that the relationship has changed considerably in the forty years between 1965 and 2005.

The basic pattern has a positive interpretation. The charts are drawn for people between

age 55 and 79, just like for Figures 3 and 4. At least for this age range, for any given

remaining life expectancy, people had a lower mortality risk in 2005 than they did in

1965. For instance, men with a 15-year remaining life expectancy in 1965 had about a

3.00 mortality risk, whereas such a man in 2005 had about a 2.45 percent mortality risk.

For women with 15 years of expected remaining life, the corresponding mortality risks

were 2.45 percent in 1965 and 2.15 percent in 2005. At least to me, this suggests that

even with the same remaining life expectancy people are healthier in 2005 than they were

in 1965. This is consistent with a mild squaring of the survival curves and a

concentration of high mortality in the last years of life.

How Much Aging Will Occur in the U.S. Population Between Now and 2050?

       There probably is as much attention paid to the anticipated aging of the U.S.

population and how the economy will adjust to it as any demographic fact. Some of the

predictions of the aging of the population are simply due to the use of the conventional

years-since-birth measure of age. Consider two alternative definitions of who is elderly

in the population, those who are currently 65 or older and those who have a mortality risk

of 1.5 percent or worse. Today, at least on a gender blended basis, the two definitions of

elderly are equivalent, since the average mortality risk faced by 65 year-olds is 1.5

percent. However, going forward being 65+ and having a mortality risk of 1.5%+ will

not be equivalent. Figure 7 tells the story. The Census Department predicts that the 65+

population will increase from about 12.5 percent of the population today to about 20.5

percent between 2035 to 2050. In 2050, Census predicts that the percent of the

population that is elderly will continue to gradually increase. On the other hand, the

percent of the population with mortality risks higher than 1.5 percent (currently also 12.5

percent of the population) never gets above 16.5 percent and is projected to be just

slightly below 15 percent and declining by 2050. With the 65+ criterion, the fraction of

the population that is classified as elderly is projected to grow by approximately 66

percent by 2050; whereas with the 1.5 percent and above mortality criterion, the fraction

of the population classified as elderly is projected to grow by only 20 percent. The point

is the great aging of our society is partly a straightforward consequence of how we

measure age. Another interpretation of Figure 7 is that by 2050 there will be

approximately six percent of the population that are over 65 years of age but who are

young enough to have a mortality risk of less than 1.5 percent. By the standard criterion

used today they would be classified as elderly but by any mortality based definition of


                                                                                            8
who is elderly they would not. This naturally leads to the topic of labor force

participation by age.

Labor Force Participation

                                  There have been significant changes in labor force participation by age over the

past 40 years. I am going to concentrate on male labor force participation because the

dramatic increase of women in the workforce masks to some degree what is going on in

the retirement behavior of women. The conventional graph of male labor force

participation by age is shown in Figure 8. There was a dramatic decrease in labor force

participation by age between 1965 and 1985 with the labor force participation at age 62

falling from 79 percent to 51 percent and at age 65 falling from 56 percent to 30 percent.

The change between 1985 and 2005 was less dramatic with labor force falling slightly




                                                                                                                      9
from ages 55 to 61, but rising somewhat from 62 thru 70. On average, men were retiring

almost three years earlier in 2005 than they were in 1965.

                                If we look at male labor force participation by age with one of the two mortality

based definitions of age, we get a somewhat different picture. Figures 9 and 10 plot male

labor force participation by mortality risk and by remaining life expectancy, respectively.

First, the figures show that with either mortality-based age measure, the fact that men are

working more at older ages essentially disappears. In Figure 9, we see that men of a

given mortality risk have dramatically lower labor force participation in 2005 than in

1965, and that the shift from 1985 to 2005 was generally towards lower labor force

participation. Figure 10 perhaps is the most revealing. While the conventional chart

(Figure 8) shows that men are retiring 2.5 to 3 years earlier than they did in 1965,

Figure10 displays the more interesting fact that men are living roughly six years longer in

retirement than they did in 1965, The six year figure comes from noting that labor force

participation was 50 percent in 1965 for men with a RLE of 13 years, but in 2005 it was

50 percent for men with a RLE of 19 years. Those that exit the labor force relatively

early are leaving with even more than six extra years of remaining life relative to their

counterparts in 1965, whereas those that exit relatively late are leaving with an extra five

years of life expectancy. The overall average is that the RLE of male retirees increased

six years over the forty years between 1965 and 2005 for an overall increase in the

expected length of male retirement of nearly fifty percent. This percentage increase in

the length of male retirement is right in the data, but it is not a well known fact. Such a

dramatic increase in the length of the average retirement has quite a bit to do with the

financial strains faced by Social Security and defined benefit pension plans. Providing

for a 19 or 20-year retirement with a 35 or 40-year career is much more difficult than

providing for a 13-year retirement. Unless retirement ages begin to adjust with RLE,

today’s young people could spend forty percent of their adult life out of the workforce.

       All of the increase in life expectancy of adult men in the twentieth century was

taken as retirement and not work. The expected length of retirement of men increased

from approximately two years in 1900 to about 19 years in 2000. It appears to be

financially impossible that the same allocation of increased life expectancy to continue in

the 21st century. However, pension laws and programs feature lots of conventionally

defined ages that have not been adjusted for improvements in mortality and life

expectancy. For instance, the 59.5 age after which money can be withdrawn from tax

deferred retirement accounts hasn’t changed since it was introduced decades ago.

Similarly, the age of early eligibility for Social Security (62), the age of Medicare

entitlement (65), and the age that one must begin withdrawing from tax deferred saving


                                                                                              12
accounts (70.5) haven’t changed in at least the past forty years, if ever. These critical

ages will likely need to be adjusted if we expect much of the increase in life expectancy

in the 21st century to be devoted to work instead of retirement.

       In a book I am writing with George Shultz, we calculate the difference in the total

labor supply in the U.S. in 2050 between two scenarios: (1) people retire in the same

pattern as they do today by conventionally defined ages, and (2) people retire with the

same lengths of retirement as they do today, that is with the same remaining life

expectancy at the time of retirement. Obviously, the difference between retiring at the

same ages and retiring with the same retirement lengths depends on the amount of

mortality progress between now and 2050. If we use the official Census forecast for

mortality improvement, then the total labor supply (in aggregate hours of work) would be

about 9.6 percent higher if labor force participation stayed constant relative to remaining

life expectancy (that is, the 2050 graph in Figure 10 looks like the 2005 one) than it

would be if labor force participation stays constant in terms of age (if the 2050 curve in

Figure 8 were to look like the 2005 one). We don’t think of this 9.6 percent number as

precisely estimated by any means – it might be eight percent or it might be ten percent.

On the other hand, 9.6 percent is our best estimate and we think that an increase in the

size of the labor force by such a magnitude is rather enormous. The estimate takes

account not only the change in the labor force participation by age under the two

scenarios, but also takes account of the number of hours worked per week at different

stages of the lifecycle. One way to think about it is that in one scenario, all labor force

behavior (both work week and retirement) remains constant as a function of years since

birth between now and 2050 and in the other scenario, all labor force behavior remains

constant as a function of age, but in the second scenario, age is defined as remaining life


                                                                                              13
expectancy. A simple Cobb-Douglas aggregate production function would suggest that

9.6 percent more labor would result in about seven percent more GDP, even if the extra

labor was not accompanied with a larger capital stock. If investment were

correspondingly higher so that the capital stock was also 9.6 percent higher in 2050 under

the second scenario, then GDP could also be 9.6 percent higher. These figures of an

extra seven to ten percent of GDP are worth pursuing, particularly given the forecasts of

how much more we will be spending as a society on health care by 2050. The question is

how to encourage people to balance work and retirement relative to their age and guide

them on how to think of age.

       There are lots of policies within Social Security, Medicare and the tax law that

actually discourage long careers. In a paper co-authored with Gopi Shah Goda and Sita

Nataraj (2006), I analyzed three changes in Social Security that would level the playing

field with respect to career length. Currently, Social Security counts only the highest 35

years of indexed earnings in computing the initial monthly benefit for someone

commencing benefits. With each year of work for the first 35 years, the year’s earnings

replace a zero in the benefit calculation. Once an individual has worked for 35 years,

additional years either replace earlier non-zero indexed earnings or they don’t count at

all, because they are lower than the previous best 35. In all cases, the 36th, 37th, and 38th

years (etc.) count far less than the 33rd, 34th and 35th years of work. The modal age at

which men reach 35 years of covered service in Social Security is 52. That is an

incredibly young age to reduce or eliminate the connection between additional work and

contributions and higher benefits. So, one possible reform would be to raise the 35 years

that go into the benefit formula to 40 years and then index the number of years for

improvements in life expectancy. A second reform would be to create a new category of


                                                                                            14
workers, those that are “paid up” in terms of Social Security and Medicare contributions.

After completing the years that count (40 under reform one plus whatever increase comes

from further increases in life expectancy), workers would achieve this new paid up status.

They would be exempt from all payroll taxes if they choose to work further. Today, most

of these workers face a pure tax with no increase in benefits to offset the additional

payroll taxes that they face for working. Under this reform, they would neither pay taxes

nor improve their benefits from further work. The third reform we examined was to have

all of the years that count (40), count the same. Currently, short careers are favored

relative to long careers. For instance, someone who works for 17.5 years instead of 35

years at the same real indexed wage rate will get significantly more than half the benefits

of the full career. Social Security uses the same formula to achieve progressivity that it

uses to treat people with different career lengths. Effectively, those with less than full

careers are treated as if they are lower income and benefit from the progressivity of the

system. There is a relatively simple fix for confounding these two effects. Progressivity

can be set in terms of the average salary earned over the years worked. If one works a

full career (35 years under current law, 40 under the first reform we examine), then the

progressive formula would be used to calculate monthly benefits. However, if one works

less than a full career, benefits would be reduced proportionately. A twenty year career

would generate half of the benefits of a forty year career under the proposed reform. All

of these proposals could be implemented in such a way as to preserve average benefits at

today’s levels.

       The impact of the three proposals would be a rather dramatic change in the net

payroll tax from continued work. The current law has long-career people facing a 10.4

percent payroll tax, whereas short career people actually face a Social Security wage


                                                                                             15
subsidy. What is going on is that Social Security is a net subsidy (the extra benefits are

worth more than the extra payroll taxes) as long as you remain on the first segment (the

90 percent segment) of the PIA-AIME formula. When you work enough to “graduate”

onto the second segment of the PIA formula (the 32 percent section), you face an

immediate 10 percentage point jump in marginal tax rates. Those relatively high income

people who work long careers and “graduate” to the third segment of the PIA formula

(the 15 percent segment) face yet another 3 percent jump in marginal tax rates. Finally,

once the additional work stops qualifying in the “high 35” aspect of the PIA formula, the

payroll tax becomes simply a tax with no offsetting benefit increases. All of these facts

are shown on the left hand graph in Figure 11. Our concern is that those with long

careers face high marginal tax rates while those with short careers are subsidized. The

three relatively simple reforms that we examine change everything in terms of work

incentives, as shown on the right hand side of the graph. All of the jumps are eliminated

as is the predominate fact of increasing marginal tax rates for those with longer careers.

To us, it makes sense to try to level the playing field for those with long careers.

                    Figure 12 is another way to look at the three reforms. It shows the benefit levels

for a person with average earnings for different career lengths under current law and

under the three alternative benefit rules. What should be clear is that under the revised

rules, each of the first 40 years has the same marginal improvement of benefits. The

current system has lower and declining marginal benefits (the flat region corresponds to

the 32 percent bracket in the PIA formula) from lengthening a career. The net impact of

the three rule changes would be to offer lower benefits for those with careers shorter

than30 years and higher benefits for those who work longer than 30 years. Given the

improvements in life expectancy, these changes in incentives seem appropriate.

Conclusion

       The current practice of measuring age as years-since-birth, both in common

practice and in the law, rather than alternative measures reflecting a person’s stage in the

lifecycle distorts important behavior such as retirement, saving, and the discussion of

dependency ratios. Two alternative measures of age have been explored, mortality risk

and remaining life expectancy. With these alternative measures, the huge wave of elderly

forecast for the first half of this century doesn’t look like a huge wave at all. By

conventional 65+ standards, the fraction of the population that is elderly will grow by

about 66 percent. However, the fraction of the population that is above a mortality rate

that corresponds to 65+ today will grow by only 20 percent. Needless to say, the aging of

the society is a lot less dramatic with the alternative mortality-based age measures.

       In a separate application of age measurement, I examined the consequences of

stabilizing labor force participation by age with alternative age definitions. If labor force

participation were to remain as it is today with respect to remaining life expectancy (i.e.

if the length of retirement stayed where it is today) rather than labor force participation

remaining fixed by conventionally-defined age, then there would be 9.6 percent more

total labor supply by 2050 in the United States. This additional labor supply would be

very helpful in terms of meeting the challenges of financing entitlement programs among

other things. GDP might be almost ten percent higher by 2050 if retirement lengths

stabilize. Several policies were examined that would encourage longer work careers.

       It is my opinion that the allocation of the extra lifetime in the 21st century cannot

and will not continue the pattern of the 20th century – namely all extra adult lifetime is

taken as retirement. Even average retirement ages today look like early retirement when

age is measured by remaining life expectancy or mortality risk. In order to allow people


                                                                                              18
to choose when to retire without encouraging an early departure from the workforce,

many ages in the laws should be indexed for demographic changes. It is time to consider

a new way to measure age.
