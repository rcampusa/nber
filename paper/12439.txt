                                           ABSTRACT


We discuss biases in preferences and their trade effects in terms of impacts on non-neutral trade
flows motivated by recent literature on both home bias and the border effect. These terms take on
multiple definitions in the literature and are often used interchangeably even though they differ. The
border effect refers to a higher proclivity to trade behind rather than across national borders and is
usually defined by the coefficients of regional dummies from an estimated gravity model. It can be
present both in data and in counterfactual model solutions. Sometimes the reduced form of the
gravity model used is asserted to reflect an Armington type model. For the border effect to occur as
a model outcome, a structural model with at least 2 home regions and 1 country abroad is needed.
In contrast to current literature, we offer a characterization of various forms of preference bias in
trade models and measures of their associated trade effects based on a concept we term trade
neutrality. These effects go beyond conventional border effects, and can be both across and within
borders. Home bias is typically specified as an Armington preference for domestic over comparable
foreign products in a trade model where goods are heterogeneous across countries. It is reflected in
both model structure and parameterization, but defined in several different ways in the literature. We
assess the contribution of each form of bias to the set of possible trade effects using a calibrated
model with 3 Canadian regions, the U.S., and the rest of the world using 2001 data. We also evaluate
how much of the conventional border effect is accounted for when model biases are modified in
various ways.

1. Introduction


The last 10 years have yielded a large body of research on two seemingly closely related issues: the

border effect and home bias. The border effect is a feature that can be present either in observed data or

a counterfactual model solution and is usually associated with McCallum’s (1995) paper in which he

used the gravity model applied to both the international and interprovincial trade of Canadian provinces

to show that even correcting for distance there is still a large effect of the Canadian border on

Canada-US trade patterns. This is true even if there are low tariffs in both countries. McCallum’s

objective was to counter earlier claims in the literature that due to postwar economic integration in the

OECD borders had effectively disappeared in terms of their impacts on behavior.



     Home bias has a longer history and can refer to features of both model specification and

parameterization. It is implicit in the numerical general equilibrium models of the 1980s (see Whalley

(1985)) which in turn used Armington’s (1969) formulation of product differentiation by country. In

older literature this model structure was used to capture less than full flow through of changes in world

prices onto domestic prices, and hence smaller impacts of trade liberalization and other counterfactuals

on trade volumes than would occur in a comparable homogeneous goods trade model. In its more recent

guise, home bias is a term often associated with Trefler’s (1995) paper on missing trade; the difference

between actual trade and that predicted by a Hecksher-Ohlin-Vanek (HOV) model using homogeneous

goods. This he attributes to consumer preference in favor of domestically produced goods in the same

sense as Armington, but unlike Armington his characterization implies more not less trade than in a

heterogeneous goods trade model due to home bias.



     Neither of these two terms, home bias or border effect, is clearly or uniformly defined in the

literature. Multiple constructs are used to represent home bias by various authors (Treffler, 1995;

Bloningen and Wilson, 1999; Head and Ries, 2001; Brulhart and Trionfetti, 2001; Hillberry and




                                                    2
Hummels, 2002). Sometimes it is assumed to be reflected in share parameters that weights the import

good relative to the domestic good in Armington type trade model (Blonigen and Wilson, 1999);

sometimes in relative share parameters across country Armington functions in a 2 country models (Head

and Ries, 2001); sometimes through an added term in preferences which gives utility from consumption

of a domestic good over total consumption (Brulhart and Trionfetti, 2001); sometimes in an additional

term in linear demands (Treffler, 1995); sometimes as a feature of data (Hillberry and Hummels, 2002).

The border effect has less ambiguity of definition but can refer instead to either data or model outcomes.

To generate it as a model outcome seemingly implies some form of regional bias among regionally

differentiated products which is different from conventional home bias as a preference for domestic over

foreign goods. At a minimum, for the border effect to occur it seems to call for a structural model with 2

domestic regions and 1 foreign country. If conventional home bias implies preferences that operate in

favor of domestic goods then one does not need a model with regional structure. If both home and

regional biases are present they seemingly operate separately.



      The border effect is usually measured by a multiplier derived from a gravity model regression. The

estimated coefficient for a regional dummy can be used to calculate the higher probability of trade

occurring between regions in a country rather than across national borders. Other authors measure the

border effect in different ways. Head and Ries (2001), for instance, measure the border effect

as     x     x * , where x and x* are the shares of home and foreign produced goods in expenditure.
          ⋅
     1 − x 1 − x*



      These two terms border effect and home bias also do not refer to the same thing, despite several

places in the literature where the terms are used interchangeably. Obstfeld and Rogoff (2000), for

instance, refer to the “McCallum Home Bias in Trade” puzzle as one of the 6 leading puzzles in modern

international macroeconomics1, and to recent other literature (Wei, 1996; Evans, 2003 ) as testing for


1
  Obstfeld and Rogoff (2000) also state that “Samuelson (1954) argues that the existence of an international transfer
problem depends critically on whether there is a home bias in consumption; and he showed explicitly how a home bias
could be derived from transport costs”, when in fact Samuelson seemingly never used or discussed the term home bias.

home bias in other countries using McCallum’s procedures (which relate to the border effect rather than

home bias). Anderson and Van Wincoop (2003) claim to show how McCallum’s estimates of the border

effect exaggerate home bias. Other authors claim that home bias occurs because of the border effect.



     This paper tries to clarify this confusing use of terminology. We argue that multiple biases can

operate in Armington trade models with multiple domestic regions and 2 or more countries and

associated trade effects can occur either across or within borders. These biases can be separated out one

from another (such as a conventional home bias or a regional bias) in generating any trade (or border)

effect the model yields as a solution. All Armington models inevitably imply bias (or difference) in

behavior relative to a comparable homogeneous goods model since changes in world prices (or a tariff)

are not fully transmitted to domestic prices and trade impacts are smaller than in the homogeneous

goods case. In the form of Armington trade model at issue in the border effect discussion there are

multiple levels of nesting, and hence more than one type of model bias can be present.



     We show how one can use numerical simulation methods to assess the contribution of each model

bias (or subset of them) to the observed trade effect. Unlike earlier literature which removes or adds

home bias by directly changing preferences or other parameters, our procedure for assessing trade biases

first involves model calibration both to an observed equilibrium in which trade (or border) effects are

present, and to a constructed synthetic equilibrium in which trade or border effects are absent. This we

term a trade neutral equilibrium. The influences of model biases are then assessed by introducing

portions of the calibrated model parameterization generated using observed data into the model

parameterization supporting the data with no trade effects. These procedures, we argue, are more

appealing than those used far in the literature.



     The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a discussion of home bias


He did discuss how differential income elasticities in a homogeneous goods trade model could cause international
transfers to generate terms of trade effects, which is different.

and border effect and presents our measures of trade (or border) effects and biases. We also discuss how

to represent and remove biases in Armington trade models using the trade neutrality concept. Section 3

describes the setup of a numerical model that we use to assessing the contributions of varying biases to

the trade (or border) effects. Data issues and parameterizations are also discussed in this section. Results

from the use of numerical simulation methods to assess the contribution of each (or subset of) model

bias to the observed trade effects are presented in section 4. Section 5 concludes.



2. The Border Effect, Home Bias and Trade Neutrality in Armington Trade Models


In McCallum (1995) and subsequent gravity model literature the border effect is calculated using the

regression coefficient of a border dummy in the gravity equation. McCallum (1995) specifies an

estimating equation for x ij as the log of shipments of goods from region i to region j of the form


                  xij = a + by i + cy j + d dist ij + eDUMMY ij + u ij                                                (1)


where y j is the log of gross domestic product in j, dist ij is the log of distance between region i and

region j, DUMMY ij is a dummy variable which is 1 if i and region j are regions within the country and

0 otherwise, and u ij is an error term2.




     McCallum uses data for incomes for 10 Canadian provinces, and their shipments with the largest 30

U.S. states for 1988, along with data on the bilateral trade flows between Canadian provinces to estimate

(1). He then compares actual trade to predicted borderless trade with the dummy removed. The gravity

model predicts that, on average combined, Canadian internal and international trade should be

overwhelmingly North-South. The presence of the Canada-U.S. border results in trade between two

2
  Although exports are usually the dependent variable in gravity models, the gravity model can also be applied to imports
and combined bilateral trade. A key assumption using the gravity model to estimate border effects in this way is symmetry;
that exports by region i to region j equal exports by region j to i. If the symmetry assumption is not met, the border effect
from a gravity model on exports will differ from the border effect in terms of imports.


                                                             5
Canadian provinces which, on average, is 20 times larger than trade between an average province and an

average state. This multiplier is referred to as the border effect in McCallum’s paper and in subsequent

studies. By way of example, his results imply that British Columbia’s exports to Texas should be 50%

larger in a borderless world than their exports to Ontario, while in the data they are 1/11th of these.

McCallum provides no structural behavioral model to underpin his regression, and the term border effect

is defined only in terms of the regression coefficient on the regional dummy.



     Later studies using the gravity model, such as Helliwell (1998), suggest that the Canada-U.S.

border effect has been decreasing following the implementation of the U.S.-Canada FTA. However,

almost all studies support the position that the Canada-U.S. border effect is still strong (Helliwell, 1996

and 1998; Anderson and Smith, 1999; Anderson and van Wincoop, 2003; Hillberry, 2002; Balistreri and

Hillberry, 2005; Wall, 2000). Engel and Rogers (1996) find similar border effects by examining the

variation of the prices of similar goods in different U.S. and Canadian cities. A number of studies also

suggest that there is a similar border effect within the EU (Head and Mayer, 2002), within the OECD

(Wei, 1996; Evans, 2003) and even within the U.S. comparing across and within state shipment data

(Wolf, 2000; Hillberry and Hummels, 2003).



     The theoretical foundations of the gravity models used in this literature are based on simple

Armington trade models using CES functions and are discussed in Anderson (1979), Bergstrand (1985,

1989) and Deardorff (1995). Anderson and van Wincoop (2003) relate their discussion of Armington and

gravity models to the border effect, showing that McCallum’s regression misses relative price effects

involving third countries as bilateral border effects are reduced. With these included, the estimated

border effect calculated using McCallum’s regressions is considerably smaller3.

  Other studies indicate that resource endowments, product characteristics, and substitution elasticities between home and
foreign goods can also affect the size of the border effect (Obstfeld and Rogoff, 2000; Wolf, 2000; Fairfield, 2001;
Hillberry, 2002). Hillberry (2002) shows that the Canada-U.S. border effect varies across commodities and after



                                                            6
      Home bias in trade literature is usually taken to refer to model features and parameterizations

reflected in bias in preferences in favor of home produced over foreign produced goods. Home bias is

generally not seen as something present in data or a model solution, but instead reflected in model

characteristics. The literature contains a variety of characterizations of home bias. Trelfler (1995)

appeals to the term to econometrically account for missing trade relative to that which would be

predicted by an econometrically estimated HOV homogeneous goods trade model. He assumes linear

demands for goods which are not based on utility maximizing behavior and uses the term home bias to

justify additional linear demand based on the difference between world and domestic production.

Blonigen and Wilson (1999), instead, discuss home bias solely in terms of preferences in the home

country and provide a measure of home bias that links the elasticity of substitution and the estimated

intercept from Armington elasticity regressions. They claim home bias in their sense is removed by

setting equal share parameters on domestic and foreign goods. Head and Ries (2001), in contrast, define

home bias only in terms of the share parameters of lower level CES preference functions in a nesting

structure in a 2 country trade model, and this involves the share parameters in both countries. Their

approach to removing home bias is to fix the relative share parameters for consumption over domestic

and foreign goods across the 2 countries in the model. Brulhart and Trionfetti (2001) go further and

modify conventional Armington preferences to capture home bias by including not only consumption of

each good but also the amount of home products consumed as an additional argument in the home

country utility function. They use Cobb-Douglas preferences and weights on total and home

consumption which sum to one for one good for which there is assumed to be home bias. Home bias in

this characterization is removed when the weight on home consumption is zero. Finally, in Hillberry and

Hummels (2002) home bias is defined in terms of trade flows rather than model characteristics. Home



controlling for the industry location effects the border effect is reduced to 5.9 from 20.9. In his study of the border effect
within OECD, Evans (2003) also finds the size of border effect varies across different industries. Efforts have also been
made to improve the distance measurement used in gravity models, such as Wei (1996) in his study of the OECD border
effect. Some studies also suggest that the large border effect may not cause substantial welfare distortion, since the border
effect be caused by non-distortionary factors, such as resource endowments, transaction costs and product characteristics
(Evans, 2003; Fairfield, 2001).



                                                              7
bias is present in trade flow data when trade deviates from that which would solely reflect relative

country size. Home bias under this approach can be measured directly from data with no appeal to a

model.



     These alternative definitions of home bias unfortunately confuse the relationship between home

bias and the border effect. With so many characterizations, it is not clear either how to measure or even

interpret home bias from the literature. How it links to the border effect is also not clear although much

of the literature either proceeds as if the two terms are either synonymous or, if not, are closely linked.



     In terms of a direct characterization of the term in terms of preferences, if we consider a commodity

X which in reality has no physical differences across countries of source, but assume that consumers in

some way perceive there to be differences and these appear in consumer preferences, one approach is

first to characterize the absence of home bias as no discrimination in preferences based on domestic and

foreign sources of supply. In two-good space, if we subscript X by domestic (D) and foreign (F) sources,

an absence of home bias is associated with consumers equally valuing alternative but equivalent

combinations of XD and XF in utility terms. XD and XF are thus perfect substitutes in this case. In Figure

1, this corresponds to preferences over XD and XF which yield linear indifference surfaces with slope -1

as in Panel A. This is drawn as the indifference curve with utility U .



     If instead home bias is present, consumers will give different utility evaluations to alternative

combinations of domestic and foreign consumption along this surface even though in reality the two

sources of supply yield identical goods. As drawn in Figure 1 Panel B, we consider a line with slope of

-1which now yields a tangency at A to an indifference surface yielding utility U . If we move to equal

consumption of home and foreign goods on this line at point B, a utility loss is involved. As such, the

home bias of consumption at point A measured in utility terms is the difference between utility level U

and Û . To remove home bias from these preferences in the CES case suggests allowing CES share




                                                      8
parameters to become uniform (0.5 for each of XD and XF in this case) and the elasticity of substitution

to approach infinity so that XD and XF are perfect substitutes in preferences.



     Unfortunately, such a modification to preferences will not eliminate the border effects as a model

outcome in an Armington model. As this incorporates heterogeneity of products by country of origin

when such a model is solved with uniform share parameters, unless the two countries are of equal size

trade will still be biased in a way which is reflected in a border effect. Setting share parameters to reflect

relative country size is also not sufficient to eliminate border effects in model outcomes unless

allowance is made for the effects of the elasticity of substitution on share parameters.



     Instead of directly setting share parameters to values which researchers assert will remove any

element of trade or border effect in model generated results, we adopt an approach of first constructing a

model parameterization consistent with the absence of such effects. We then assess the departures in

model preferences implied by the model parameterization generated by calibration to observed data.



     We do this by not only calibrating a trade model to observed data in which trade (or border) effects

are present, but also by calibrating to a synthetic (generated) computable equilibrium in which trade (or

border) effects are absent. This we term a trade neutral equilibrium and we characterize this in the next

section. This procedure yields two model parameterizations, one consistent with observed data, and the

other consistent with an absence of trade (or border) effects. We can then introduce portions of the

parameterization consistent with the observed equilibrium into the parameterization consistent with the

trade effect absent and assess the effect on measures of trade or border effects. The details of these

procedures are set out in the next section.

     Figure 2 schematically sets out the structure of nesting of Armington type functions which we

employ in the modeling approach used in the next section. In this particular model structure,

conventional home bias relates to top level heterogeneity and regional bias to lower level heterogeneity.

The border effect is reflected in a model outcome in which there are larger volumes of interregional

compared to international trade than differences in the size of countries and regions alone would imply.

Model biases can be weakened or removed either separately or in total, and as they change the border

effect present in data relative to the outcomes of the model will change.



     Assessing the contribution of various model biases to model outcomes (in terms of interregional

and international trade volumes) involves comparing results across similar models where varying forms

of bias (by level and by country) are replaced by elements of a model parameterization generated by

calibration to a model in which there is an absence of trade effects. Experiments can be conducted for

portion of the biases in a model (say between products across regions but not across countries), or for all

the biases in the model. Conventional home bias seemingly refers to product heterogeneity across

countries. The border effect as discussed in existing literature is a model outcome relating to regional

trade flows and involves product heterogeneity across regions as well as across countries.



     We explore the contribution of various model biases (conventional home bias, regional biases) to

model generated trade effects by measuring trade effects relative to a reference point. This, we suggest,

is best done by using a model parameterization consistent with a trade neutral equilibrium rather than

using particular settings of model parameters as current literature attempts. Unlike McCallum, we use an

explicit structural model rather than a gravity equation model, and so we calculate the trade effect to

biases using a different method from that followed in gravity model regressions, even though the

economic logic behind our measurement and the gravity regression coefficient method are the same. We

measure trade effects either in a model generated equilibrium or in data as the proportional departure in




                                                    11
the pattern of trade from that which would be implied by demands for countries and regions within

countries which only reflect relative country or region size (controlling for distances). This is similar to

the discussion in Anderson (1979), Bergstrand (1985, 1989), Deardorf (1995), Anderson and van

Wincoop (2003) in which they relate the theoretical roots of the gravity equation to CES utility functions,

as also in Yi (2005).

        Thus the trade effect between any regional (or country) pair i, j in their trade with region or country

k is,

                                                          x ki y j
                                       TE ( i , j ) k =        ×    .                                    (2)
                                                          x kj   yi

where xki represents imports by k from i, xkj represents imports by k from j, y j and yi are incomes of

i and j. If there is no trade effect this ratio will be 1; if there is a trade effect it will exceed 1. We can

modify (2) to yield a measure of trade effects using export data or trade flows (export and import). (2)

and its modifications thus produce measures of trade effects bilaterally between all regions or countries

in their trade with all other region or countries.



        The reference point for measuring trade effects we take to be a model parameterization consistent

with an equilibrium in which trade effects are absent. Thus, if we construct a synthetic equilibrium data

set, related to observed data in the sense that incomes are unchanged for regions (and countries), but

with consumption modified to yield demands which are proportional to region (and country) size, then

in this equilibrium trade effects will be absent. We can generate such a parameterization using the

calibration procedures set out in Dawkins, Srinivasan, and Whalley (2001), and then replace all or part

of the parameterization of the model generated in this way by the parameterization generated by

calibration to actual data. This procedure departs from the current literature methods discussed above of

directly setting parameter values in preferences in ways which to the authors believe to remove model

biases, rather than any explicit comparison to a trade neutral equilibrium.



                                                              12
       Using data for 2001 on trade and income involving a grouping of Canadian provinces into 3 regions

(Atlantic, Central, and Western Canada) and the U.S.4 and a residual rest of the world, and taking region

size weighted averages of the trade effects using (2) for the three Canadian regions yields an estimated

Canada-U.S. border effect of 12.32. This figure compares with Canada-U.S. border effect reported by

Anderson and van Wincoop (2003) of 10.5, and more recently by Balistreri and Hillberry (2005) of 12.8.




3. Numerical Model, Data, and Parameterization for Measuring Trade Effects


We have developed a simple numerical global general equilibrium model of 3 Canadian regions

(Atlantic, Central and Western Canada) and two foreign countries (the U.S. and ROW, the rest of the

world) to implement the procedures we propose for assessing the contribution of model biases to trade

effects. This allows us to capture both conventional home bias and border effects. We keep the model

simple and use a pure exchange type economy in which each region is endowed only with one good. The

use of a pure exchange model allows us to focus only on biases in preferences and is adopted as a

simplifying assumption of convenience even though it is unrealistic. Production structures and their

biases can also be incorporated into this approach, but at a cost in complexity and with more difficulties

in interpreting results. We incorporate 3 level nested CES preferences in all regions (and hence also in

all countries). In the model prices and trade flows are endogenously determined and regional

endowments are exogenously given.



       Before moving to model details, we briefly describe the nesting preferences structure used for these

five regions (see Figure 3). In a conventional Armington (1969) type trade model, the preference

structure directly relates to different country source goods and the nesting structure is common to all

countries or regions. In our model, the nesting structure varies by region and country since different

    The distances between each pair of the four regions (three Canadian regions and the U.S.) are assumed to be the same.


                                                             13
country source goods involve a further nesting structure in which different country source goods may

also be a composite of sub-region or sub-country goods. The composite good price may differ for

different regions or countries.

     Each region is thus assumed to maximize utility by first choosing among home and foreign goods.

Each region then chooses using among two foreign country goods at the 2nd level. At the second level,

the three Canadian regions also choose between their own region goods and a composite of other

Canadian region goods. At the bottom level, the three Canadian regions choose between the other two

Canadian region goods, and the U.S and ROW choose among the three Canadian region goods.

     For this pure exchange economy model the equilibrium conditions are that

where x s is the endowment of goods in region s.




     The income of each region is,

                                           I s = ps xs                                                              (13)


where p s is producer price for each region’s endowment and is endogenously determined to clear

markets; In a world where trade is costless and there are no transportation costs or tariffs,


                                           p ss ' = p s '                                                           (14)




     In this structure only relative prices are of any consequence and we can set the price of the U.S.

good to one as the numerare, ie.

                                             pu = 1                                                                 (15)




     If transportation costs and tariff revenue are involved in the pure exchange economy model, the

commodity prices are linked across regions as


                                           p ss ' = p s ' (1 + t ss ' )(1 + τ ss ' )                                (16)


where t ss ' is the transportation costs per unit from s’ to s,         τ ss ' is the tariff rate in region s on imports

from s’.



     Assume the importing region bears the transportation costs the income of each region is,




                                                            18
                              I s = ∑ p s x s 's − ∑ x ss ' p s 't ss ' + ∑ p s ' x ss ' (1 + t ss ' )τ ss '   (17)

     Equilibrium in this model differs from the simple statement in (12) in that real resource costs of

transportation (denominated in terms of the commodity being shipped) needed to be factored in, and also

there are government budget constraints involving tariff revenues collected and disbursed which needed

to balance.



     We have calibrated this model using the latest Canada data (for 2001) on interregional and

international trade flows and 2001 Canada Input-Output tables from Statistic Canada (CANSIM Tables

386-0002 and 381-0009), supplemented by data from Industry Canada (Trade Data Online, available

on-line at http://strategis.gc.ca), Canada Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (Third

we use are reported in Table 1 as our benchmark data used in calibration. See Appendix A for more

details.



     Data on transportation costs, tariffs and non-tariffs equivalent are highly controversial in the trade

literature and their size varies considerably. Anderson and van Wincoop (2004) provide a comprehensive




                                                              19
review of this issue and transportation costs for global trade are roughly estimated by them to be around

20% of import values. Here we use this figure to represent transportation costs between the ROW and

the U.S., and between the ROW and three Canadian regions. We assume 5% for internal transportation

costs within the ROW. The transportation cost between each pair of the U.S. and the three Canadian

regions we assume to be 2.5%. This assumption simplifies the calculation of the Canada-U.S. border

effect. We use 15% as the sum of tariff and non-tariff equivalent for the U.S. and Canada trade with

ROW, within the ROW 5%, and 2% between the U.S. and three Canadian regions5.



     In executing our calibration, we introduce an additional endowment of goods besides the physical

endowments in the simple no transportation cost no tariff pure exchange model into the model with

these elements (see Appendix B for more details). This is because if transportation costs are required for

the trade flows between s’ and s, each region has to spend a certain amount of its endowment to ship

goods from other regions (including itself if the region is not treated as spot anymore). The data set for

both the U.S. and Canada as reported in Appendix A does not provide information on transportation

costs. We assume importing regions bear transportation costs and the resulting price markup of imported

goods. If tariffs are also involved in trade flows, the importing region can also collect duties on imported

goods. When both transportation costs and tariffs are involved in shipping goods between regions, there

is a discrepancy between region incomes and expenditures on goods. To create a modified benchmark

data set for calibration, we introduce a additional endowment of region s besides its physical endowment.

This additional endowment is owned by the region and used to cover shipping costs from exporting

regions and hence the price markup of imported goods. For this benchmarking, the ratios of additional to

physical endowments for the five regions are as follows. For Atlantic Canada it is 18.3%, Central

  In Anderson and van Wincoop (2004) the simple tariff rates for the U.S. and Canada are 2.9% and 4.5%; the broad NTB
ratios for the U.S. and Canada are 27.2% and 30.7%; narrow NTB ratios for the U.S. and Canada are 0.015 and 0.015. We
use an 15%, which is roughly the sum of tariffs and the average of broad and narrow NTB ratios, as the sum of tariff and
non-tariff equivalent for the U.S. and Canada trade with ROW.


                                                           20
Canada 2.6%, Western Canada 4.9%, the U.S. 10.4%, and the ROW 9.4%. These additional endowments

remain fixed as we conduct counterfactual equilibrium analyses removing model biases from the model.

The values of these additional endowments are reported in the last row of Table 1.

      Using the benchmark data, we also construct a trade neutral data with absence of trade effects

(Table 2, see Appendix C for more details). In this, each region consumes goods from all regions

proportional to their income share in the combined global economy.



      Since elasticities of substitution play an important role in model results, when addressing the



                                                                   21
relationship between home bias and the border effect using the calibrated version of this model, we

appeal to literature sources for the values we use. The estimated magnitudes of key elasticities differ

across various studies (Bergstrand, 1985; Shiells, Stern and Deardorff ,1986; Feenstra, 1994; Hummels,

1999; Bloningen and Wilson, 1999; Baier and Bergstrand, 2001; Head and Ries, 2001; and Saito, 2004;

Yi, 2003)6. We use an elasticity of substitution of 2.0 for the top level sub-utility function in each region

and 2.5 for the second level sub-utility functions of two foreign country goods, 3.0 in three Canadian

regions for the own region goods and other Canadian region goods, and 3.0 for the bottom level in each

region.



        The parameterizations consistent with benchmark data and synthetic trade neutral data are reported

in Table 3. The substantial difference in the top level share parameters in preferences between the trade

neutral and observed cases suggest that in all 5 regions there is a strong country bias in favor of own

country goods (home bias). Home bias is thus present in all three Canadian regions, in the U.S., and in

the ROW. The differences in the second level share parameters between neutrality case and observed

case suggest that both Atlantic and Western Canada favors the ROW goods rather than the U.S. goods,

while Central Canada favors the U.S. goods instead of the ROW goods. The U.S. has slight bias toward

Canada goods rather than the ROW goods, while the ROW slight bias toward the U.S. instead of Canada

goods. All three Canadian regions have a strong bias toward own region goods. The bottom level

regional share parameters suggest that Atlantic (Western) Canada favor Central Canada goods rather

than Western (Atlantic) goods. Central Canada has a slightly bias toward Atlantic goods instead of

Western Canada goods. Both the U.S. and the ROW reveal no significant bias among three Canadian

region goods.

4. Assessing the Contribution of Model Biases to Trade Effects


We have used this calibrated model to assess the contribution of home and regional bias to border effects

both in the simple pure exchange economy case and in the presence of tariffs and transportation costs.

To do this, we use counterfactual analyses in which we jointly or separately change share parameters in

preferences at different levels in different regions in each model form. Table 4 reports model results for

the impacts on the Canada-U.S. border effect in the presence of biases in the calibrated trade model. In

these experiments we have replaced the share parameters generated by calibration in the trade neutral

model case with the share parameters generated by calibration to the observed 2001 data. These

experiments are performed jointly or separately in the various regions and at different levels.



       Overlying the parameterization generated by calibration to the observed data suggests bias in all




                                                                           23
regions at all levels and yields a border effect of 11.30 which is close to size to the border effect of 12.32

generated by actual data in 2001. This suggests that the bias structure in preferences in the model can

generate a similar size of border effect compared to data even without transportation costs and trade

barriers. Biases in Canada regions only generate a border effect of 5.87 and in the U.S. of 2.18, while the

presence of biases in the ROW reduces the Canada-U.S. border effect.



     Country biases (top level bias) in all regions generate a border effect of 130.00. The presence of

Canada country bias generates a border effect of 43.50 which is over 3.5 times the size of the data

generated border effect for 2001, and as such shows how Canadian home bias can be separated out in

terms of its separate influences on the Canada-U.S. border effect. The presence of country bias in the

U.S. generates a border effect of 4.21 and in the ROW 0.60. This suggests that the U.S. country bias

intensifies the Canada-U.S. border effect while the ROW bias reduces the Canada-U.S. border effect.

The presence of country biases in both the U.S. and the ROW together generate a border effect of 4.41,

which is around one third of the border effect in 2001.



     These results also suggest that the presence of the biases for different foreign country goods in all

regions collectively reduces the border effect, among which biases in Canadian regions and the ROW

have almost no impacts while biases in the U.S. reduces the border effect. The presence of biases in

preferences for country level goods generates a border effect of 69.59, biases in Canadian regions only

36.29, the U.S. 2.23, and the ROW 0.63.



     Regional biases toward own region goods rather than the other Canadian region goods in the three

Canadian regions reduce the Canada-U.S. border effect. This suggests that regional biases also play a

central role in the determination of border effects, since the border effect is transformed into a reverse

border effect. The presence of biases in preferences over two other Canadian region goods has only a



                                                     24
small effect on the border effect, as does biases in preferences in both the U.S. and ROW.



       We have also examined the impacts of removing biases from the parameterization generated by

calibration to the observed data on the Canada-U.S. border effect and the reverse of the experiments

reported in Table 4. Results for these cases are broadly consistent with those reported in Table 47.



       We have also conducted experiments similar to those reported in Table 4, but in which

transportation costs are present in the model, and vary across each pair of the three Canadian regions and

the U.S. Transportation costs between the U.S. and the Canadian is assumed to be 5% as in Yi (2005).

Internal transportation costs within the U.S. are assumed to be 2.5% and within the three Canadian

regions 1%, and 1% for shipping between the three Canadian regions. The impacts of the biases in these

cases on the Canada-U.S. border effect are reported in Table 5. These results are similar to those

reported in Table 4 and suggest that the impacts of biases on the estimated Canada-U.S. border effects

are not sensitive to the treatment of transportation costs involving shipments between Canadian regions

and the U.S.

      As noted in the literature, the Canada-U.S. border effects vary across Canadian regions. We also

find that the border effect varies across trade directions as well. Table 6 reports more detailed

calculations of the impacts of biases in preferences on the Canada-U.S. border effect depending on the

trade direction. These results show that the effects of bias are similar on the Canada-U.S. border effects

in different Canadian regions as well by trade directions in some cases, however, different in other cases.

5. Concluding Remarks


     Despite substantial literature over the last 10 years on both home bias and the border effect, these

two terms remain somewhat mysterious (especially home bias) and are used in the literature in a number

of different ways. Here we provide both clarification of terminology and numerical simulation

procedures for separating out the separate influences of home and other model biases on a measured

border effect.



     Using a calibrated model of 3 region Canadian and country U.S. and ROW trade model to 2001

data we report decomposition results using general equilibrium computations which the separate

influences of various model biases on measured border effects are assessed in terms of impacts on trade

flows relative to synthetic trade neutral equilibrium data set constructed using observed data. The

presence of biases in preferences in all regions at all levels generates a model calculated border effect

almost equal to the border effect as measured by data for 2001. The biases in Canada’s regions generate

a border effect of 5.68 and the U.S. 2.27, while the biases in the ROW reduce the Canada-U.S. border

effect. The home bias in Canada regions generates a border effect of 41.39, the U.S. 4.62 and the ROW

0.59. Regional biases in preferences of Canadian regions strongly reduce the Canada-U.S. border effect.

Our results also suggest that biases in preferences across different regions and trade directions can have

different impacts on the Canada-U.S. border effect.

Appendix:
Data on Canadian Regional and International Trade Flows

A: Sources for Observed trade flows in 2001 in Table 1.


     Canadian provinces are grouped into three Canadian regions. Atlantic Canada constitutes
Newfoundland and Labrador, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick. Atlantic
Canada constitutes Quebec, Ontario and Manitoba. West Canada constitutes the rest of Canada
(Saskatchewan, Alberta, British Columbia, Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut).


     All trade flows data refers to 2001 and valued at Canadian dollars. Exchange rate of the
Canadian dollar in 2001 is 0.6458 of the U.S. dollar. This exchange rate, obtained from the Bank of
Canada, is used by both Statistics Canada and Industry Canada in 2001 trade data.


     Inter-provincial trade (goods and services) flows between the three Canadian regions are from
Statistic Canada (CANSIM Table 386-0002), in which the trade flows are measured at 2001 producer
price.


     Data on the three Canadian region goods exports to and imports from the U.S. are from Industry
Canada (Trade Data Online, available on-line at http://strategis.gc.ca). In this data set, both
international exports and imports are valued at F.O.B. (free on board) prices. This data set only offers
data on international trade flows in goods. Third Annual Report on Canada’s State of Trade 2002 (The
Department     of    Foreign    Affairs    and    International    Trade;     Available    on-line    at
www.dfait-maeci.gc.ca/eet/state-of-trade-e.asp) offers an estimate of 8.3% for services export share in
Canada’s total exports to the U.S. and 12.9% for services import share in Canada’s total imports from
the U.S. in 2001. Using these two shares we obtain international trade flows in goods and services
between U.S. and the three Canadian regions.


     Statistic Canada (CANSIM Table 386-0002) also offers data on Canadian region total
international exports and imports of goods and services at producer prices. We can thus use this data
set and international trade flows between U.S. and three Canadian regions to obtain international trade
flows between the ROW and the three Canadian regions.


     U.S. total international exports and imports in goods and services are obtained from U.S. Bureau



                                                  31
of Economic Analysis and U.S. Census Bureau (FT900: U.S. International Trade in goods and Service;
Available on-line at www.bea.gov/bea/newsrelarchive/2006/trade1306.xls) and converted to Canadian
dollars using the exchange rate as above. Both international exports and imports are valued F.O.B. in
this data set. International trade flows between the U.S. and the ROW are obtained by subtracting U.S.
international trade flows with Canada from total U.S. international trade flows.


     Domestic use of U.S. goods and services are obtained by subtracting U.S. international exports
from U.S. total industry outputs. U.S. total industry outputs are obtained from U.S. Bureau of
Economic          Analysis   (2001    U.S.    input-output     account;     Available    on-line    at
www.bea.gov/bea/pn/Annual-IOMakeUse.XLS) and converted to Canadian dollars using the
exchange rate as above.


     Intra-ROW use of ROW goods and services are also obtained by subtracting ROW international
exports from ROW total industry outputs. ROW total international exports are the sum of U.S. and
Canada imports from ROW obtained as above (at F.O.B. prices). ROW total industry output is
obtained by using ROW GDP divided by its value-added ratio. ROW GDP is obtained from UNCTAD
(Table     7.1,      Handbook    of    Statistics    2005,    UNCTAD;        available   on-line    at
http://stats.unctad.org/Handbook/ReportFolders/ReportFolders.aspx). ROW GDP share in world GDP
was 65.62% in 2001. The ROW economy comprises of two parts, the developed economies and
developing economies. The developed economies in the ROW produced 43.03% of world GDP and
the developing economies produced 22.60% of world GDP in 2001. We use China’s value-added
share (35.86%, from China Statistical Year Book 2005, National Bureau of Statistics China (2005)) in
2001 as of the developing economies, and the simple average (51.73%) of the U.S. and Canada
value-added share (55.03% for the U.S. obtained from U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (2001 U.S.
input-output account; Available on-line at www.bea.gov/bea/pn/Annual-IOMakeUse.XLS); and
48.42% for Canada obtained from Statistic Canada (Canada Input-Output tables, CANSIM Table
381-0009)). Using the GDP weighed sum of developing economy value-added share and developed
economy value-added share yields an estimate of value-added share of 46.26% for the ROW and thus
ROW total industry outputs can be obtained and then converted into Canadian dollars.


     The trade flows between five regions at valued at producer prices as above. Data on
transportation costs and tariffs and non-tariffs equivalent are highly controversial in the trade
literature and the magnitudes vary drastically. Anderson and Van Wincoop (2004) provide a
comprehensive review over this issue and transportation costs are roughly estimated around 20% of



                                                    32
national income. Here we use this figure to represent transportation costs between the ROW and the
U.S., between the ROW and three Canadian regions, 5% for internal transportation costs within the
ROW. The transportation cost between each pair of the U.S. and the three Canadian regions is
assumed to be 2.5%. This assumption could simplify the calculation of the Canada-U.S. border effect.
We use 15% as the sum of tariff and non-tariff equivalent for the U.S. and Canada trade with ROW,
within the ROW 5%, and 2% between the U.S. and three Canadian regions.


B: The Benchmarking of Observed Trade Flows in 2001 in the Presence of Tariffs and
      Transportation Costs


      If transportation costs are involved in the trade flows from s’ to s, each region has to spend a
certain amount of its endowment on shipping goods from other regions (including itself if the region
is not treated as concentrated single point). The data set for both the U.S. and Canada detailed in
Appendix A does not provide information on transportation costs. We assume importing region bears
the transportation costs and also suffers the price markup of imported goods, and tariffs are also
involved with trade flows and the importing region collects duties on imported goods. When both
transportation costs and tariffs are involved in shipping goods between regions, there is a discrepancy
between regional income and expenditure on goods unless adjustment is made to the endowments of
each region. The expenditure on goods in region s is,


                                          Es =        ∑p
                                                       s'
                                                                  s'   x ss ' (1 + t ss ' )(1 + τ ss ' )               (A1)


where ps ' is the price of endowment in region s’; t ss ' is the transportation costs per unit value from

s’ to s,   τ ss ' is the tariff rate levied by region s on goods from region s’.

      The income of region s in the absence of any adjustment for resources use in transportation costs
is,

                              Is =   ∑p
                                     s'
                                          s 's   x s 's − ∑ x ss ' p s 't ss ' + ∑ p s ' x ss ' (1 + t ss ' )τ ss '
                                                             s'                           s'
                                                                                                                      (A2)


      The difference Ds between E s and I s is,


                                          D s = ∑ p s ' x ss ' (1 + 2t ss ' ) − ∑ p s x s 's                          (A3)
                                                        s'                                        s'



      To create a benchmark data set for the general equilibrium model in the presence of



                                                                           33
transportation costs, we introduce Ds as an additional endowment of region s besides its physical

endowment of   ∑x
                s'
                     s 's   in the pure exchange case. This additional endowment is assumed owned by the

region and used to cover shipping costs from exporting regions and price markups for imported goods.
For benchmarking, the ratios of additional endowments to physical endowments for the five regions
are: Atlantic Canada 18.3%, Central Canada 2.6%, Western Canada 4.9%, the U.S. 10.4%, and the
ROW 9.4%, respectively.


C: Neutrality Data


     In a trade costless world, the neutrality data set with absence of trade effects is created as follows.
Each region consumes goods from all regions proportional to its income share in world economy, i.e.,

where x ss ' is trade flows from s’ to s;          ω , θ ∈ (a, e, w, u, r)= (Atlantic Canada, Central Canada,
Western Canada, the U.S., and the ROW). The nominator of the first part on the right hand side of (A4)
is the endowment of region s and the denominator is world endowment. The second part on the right
hand side of (A4) is the endowment of region s’.


     To create the neutrality trade flows absent of trade effects with benchmarking data obtained in
Appendix B, we sum up the additional endowment and the value of physical endowment to yield a
total endowment for each region. Applying (A4) yields the neutrality trade flows as in Table 2.
