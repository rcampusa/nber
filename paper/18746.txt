                                              ABSTRACT

This paper examines an important gap in the monetary explanation of the Great Depression: the lack
of a well-articulated and documented transmission mechanism of monetary shocks to the real economy.
It begins by reviewing the challenge to Friedman and Schwartz’s monetary explanation provided by
the decline in nominal interest rates in the early 1930s. We show that the monetary explanation requires
not just that there were expectations of deflation, but that those expectations were the result of monetary
contraction. Using a detailed analysis of Business Week magazine, we find evidence that monetary
contraction and Federal Reserve policy contributed to expectations of deflation during the central years
of the downturn. This suggests that monetary shocks may have depressed spending and output in part
by raising real interest rates.

       For many, Friedman and Schwartz’s Monetary History of the United States

(1963) is synonymous with the notion that monetary contraction and errors by the

Federal Reserve caused the Great Depression. Though that is one of the book’s

conclusions, this quick summary both sells the book short in important ways and

oversells its findings about the 1930s.

       It sells the book short because the contributions of the Monetary History extend

far beyond the Depression. Friedman and Schwartz use an extensive reading of the

historical record over nearly a century to identify times when the money supply moved

for reasons unrelated to current or prospective macroeconomic conditions. That output

moved in the same direction as money following these “crucial experiments” remains

some of the strongest evidence we have that monetary shocks have real effects.

       But saying that the book proves that monetary shocks caused the Great

Depression is a stretch. Of the monetary shocks Friedman and Schwartz identify, those

early in the Depression are arguably the most tenuous. And crucially, the book provides

scant discussion about the mechanism by which monetary shocks affect the economy.

This weakness is most pressing in the discussion of the Depression. Because nominal

interest rates fell precipitously early in the Depression and remained low throughout, it

is hard to appeal to the standard transmission mechanism operating through the

nominal cost of credit.

       This paper seeks to fill in the missing transmission mechanism in Friedman and

Schwartz’s explanation of the Depression. In Section I, we discuss the challenge to

Friedman and Schwartz’s explanation provided by the anomalous behavior of nominal
                                                                                         2


interest rates. The previous literature has shown that falling nominal interest rates could

be consistent with monetary contraction if there were expectations of deflation. But we

argue that the monetary explanation requires not just that there were such expectations,

but that they were the result of monetary contraction. Because previous work has been

largely silent on this issue, we are left without evidence about a necessary link from

monetary shocks to the fall in output in the early 1930s.

       In Section II, we analyze one component of the business press in detail to see if

there was a link between monetary shocks and expectations of deflation in the central

years of the downturn—1930 and 1931. We find evidence that professional observers did

indeed expect deflation in substantial part because of Federal Reserve behavior and

monetary contraction. This suggests that monetary shocks in the Depression may have

affected output and employment by raising real interest rates.


                  I. CHALLENGES TO THE MONETARY EXPLANATION

       It is useful to begin with a review of Friedman and Schwartz’s monetary

explanation of the Depression, and the literature that has developed around the missing

transmission mechanism.


A. Friedman and Schwartz’s Explanation

       The core of the Monetary History’s treatment of the Depression (Chapter 7) is a

careful historical analysis of the underlying reasons for the decline in the money stock in

the early 1930s. This is where Friedman and Schwartz make their case that the

monetary decline was relatively exogenous to the decline in output.

       Friedman and Schwartz’s implicit definition of a monetary shock is very broad:
                                                                                         3


any movement in money that is unusual given the economic circumstances. One shock

they identify in this period that is easy to defend on these grounds is the Federal Reserve

Bank of New York’s decision to raise the discount rate by 200 basis points in October

1931, following Britain’s departure from the gold standard. The resulting fall in the

money stock was clearly not an endogenous reaction to the fall in output. It was the

result of the conscious decision to defend the gold standard.

       Friedman and Schwartz suggest that there were other monetary shocks in 1929-

31, though they are vague about the number and their timing. Their argument is that the

Federal Reserve stood by as banking panics caused large declines in the money

multiplier, and hence in the supply of money, and that under either the previous

clearinghouse system or a better functioning central bank, such drops in the money

supply would not have occurred.

       In Chapter 7, the role of the monetary contraction in causing the real decline is

largely implicit. Only after Friedman and Schwartz bring in other episodes—1920, 1936–

37, and perhaps the panics under the National Banking System—do they have a clear

case that exogenous monetary contractions cause output contraction. Armed with that

relationship, one can then go back to the 1930s and say that since there were large

exogenous monetary contractions in this period, they likely caused much of the real

decline.


B. The Anomalous Behavior of Nominal Interest Rates

       A striking feature of the Monetary History is that the approach is almost entirely

reduced form. Friedman and Schwartz focus on the evidence that output and prices fell

after monetary shocks. They provide little discussion and virtually no evidence on the
                                                                                                4


possible transmission mechanism of monetary shocks to spending and output.

       Most scholars have assumed that Friedman and Schwartz had in mind a

conventional interest-rate channel. In the textbook IS-LM model, a reduction in the

money supply shifts the LM curve back and raises real and nominal interest rates. Such

an account fits what happened following many of Friedman and Schwartz’s

contractionary monetary shocks—such as 1920 and the panics under the National

Banking System. But it provides a terrible description of what happened during most of

1929–33.

       Figure 1 shows the monthly prime commercial paper rate for 1925 to 1933. 1 There

was a sharp rise in nominal interest rates following the October 1931 increase in the

discount rate. Interest rates also rose noticeably beginning in early 1928. As described

by both Friedman and Schwartz and Hamilton (1987), the Federal Reserve tightened

policy moderately in this period to try to rein in speculation in the stock market. Since

policy was not responding to current or prospective economic growth, but rather to

asset prices, this episode appears to fit Friedman and Schwartz’s definition of a

monetary shock.

       However, other than these two times, the course of nominal interest rates during

the Depression was strongly downward. Rates plummeted following the Great Crash of

the stock market in October 1929. They fell further during the first two waves of panics

(October 1930 and March 1931). After the brief rise in late 1931, they fell continuously

until February 1933.

C. Challenges to Friedman and Schwartz’s Emphasis on Monetary Shocks

      The literature has responded to this anomalous behavior of nominal rates in two

ways. One is to suggest that Friedman and Schwartz are simply wrong about the

importance of monetary shocks, at least in some time periods.

      Temin (1976) argues that the behavior of nominal rates in 1930 implies that the

IS curve must have shifted back more than the LM curve. He posits an unusual drop in

consumer spending as the culprit, but cannot identify a cause. Romer (1990) suggests

that a rise in income uncertainty associated with the stock market crash may have been

the source. Olney (1999) argues that the particulars of consumer credit contracts led

households to cut spending to ensure their ability to pay credit charges.

      We suspect that even Friedman and Schwartz would agree that nonmonetary

forces were important in the first year of the Depression. The contractionary monetary

shock in early 1928 can likely explain why the U.S. economy was cooling off in the

summer of 1929. But this modest monetary tightening is not a plausible explanation for
                                                                                              6


the catastrophic decline in output immediately following the stock market crash in

October 1929. Industrial production, which had declined just 1.7 percent between July

and September of 1929, fell 10.7 percent from September to December. It fell another

17.0 percent before the first wave of banking panics in October 1930. 2

       To explain why nominal rates continued to fall, one could argue that there were

further IS shocks after late 1930. One candidate is the nonmonetary transmission

channel for the panics proposed by Bernanke (1983): the banking panics had effects on

spending not just through a decline in the money supply, but also by causing a reduction

in credit supply at a given level of the safe interest rate. There is certainly some evidence

that such effects were present, but evidence that they were large enough to account for

the enormous output decline is lacking.

       Our assessment is that nonmonetary (IS) shocks were clearly present in the

Depression, and possibly predominant in the first year. But scholars have not

persuasively identified sufficiently large nonmonetary shocks for the critical period from

roughly late 1930 to early 1933.


D. An Alternative Transmission Mechanism

       The other way researchers have sought to reconcile Friedman and Schwartz’s

monetary hypothesis with the behavior of nominal rates is to bring in the rapid deflation

that began in late 1929. Wholesale prices fell 17.5 percent between July 1929 and

December 1930. They fell another 13.9 percent over 1931. 3 If the deflation was expected,

real rates could have risen even as nominal rates declined. Indeed, in the IS-LM

framework presented in terms of real output and the nominal interest rate, an increase

in expected deflation enters as a shift back of the IS curve.

       This insight led to a cottage industry of papers studying whether the deflation of

the early 1930s was expected. Hamilton (1992), using data on commodities futures

prices, argues that it was not, at least before 1931. Cecchetti (1992), using simple

statistical forecasts as a proxy for expectations formation, argues that it was. Nelson

(1991), in perhaps the most convincing study of the three, examines the business press

from June 1929 to December 1930, and finds that professional observers were expecting

deflation at least as early as the summer of 1930.

       If we accept that much of the deflation was expected, that strengthens the

Friedman and Schwartz monetary explanation. It suggests that real borrowing costs

were high, and so could have depressed spending and output.

       However, there is still an important gap. For the monetary story to be right, it is

not enough that the deflation was expected. If the expectations resulted from the initial

fall in output or supply shocks, those factors would be the ultimate source of the

continued downturn. Thus, the monetary explanation of the Great Depression requires

that the expectations of deflation were driven by the monetary contraction. For that

reason, the rest of this paper seeks to provide evidence on the source of the expectations

of deflation.


          II. EXPECTATIONS OF DEFLATION AND MONETARY DEVELOPMENTS

       There are many ways to try to obtain evidence about a possible link between

monetary shocks and expected deflation during the Depression. The approach that we

use is to examine one component of the business press closely for the first two years of
                                                                                         8


the Depression. That is, we try to obtain direct evidence about whether the expectations

of deflation of well-informed contemporary observers were driven by monetary

developments.


A. Narrative Source

      The particular source that we consider is The Business Week magazine. During

the downturn, Business Week sometimes discussed what market participants were

expecting to happen to prices. But for the most part, it simply gave its own views. So this

source can show whether the expectations of deflation of a well-informed contemporary

observer were driven by monetary developments.

      Most of Business Week’s discussion of price movements involved commodity

prices: the prices of key minerals and agricultural goods. However, the magazine was

very clear that it believed overall prices, as well as wages, would eventually follow

commodity prices down. For example, in May 1930 it stated, “Retailers are beginning to

pass on to the consumer some of the sharp drop in raw commodity prices” (5/28/30, p.

5).

      Based on Nelson’s (1991) narrative work and our own survey of other

publications, Business Week in the early years of the Depression appears more moderate

and more open to the monetary hypothesis than some other publications. Thus, even if

we do find a link between monetary contraction and expectations of deflation in

Business Week, it is possible that other contemporary observers did not see one.


B. Business Week’s Model of Deflation

      One important piece of evidence that Business Week’s expectations of deflation

were affected by monetary changes comes from its discussions of the causes of
                                                                                                       9


deflation. 4 If price declines were attributed to monetary contraction, expectations of

monetary contraction would likely create expectations of deflation.

          Throughout 1930 and 1931, many of the weekly ups and downs of commodity

prices were attributed to news about the available stocks of particular commodities and

other supply-side factors. But for most of the period, credit contraction was viewed as

the central cause of overall deflation. For example, in March 1930, Business Week had

an article on the historical precedents for commodity price deflation. It stated (3/12/30,

p. 20):

            Two factors have been present in all of these periods of falling
          commodity prices—a marked rise in production and stocks of commodities
          on hand, and contraction in bank credit. …
            Relative contraction of bank credit during periods of increasing
          production and stocks has probably been the most important factor.

Likewise, in October 1931, it referred to “[t]he decline of prices and the rise in the value

of money during the past two years, due to drastic contraction of credit” (10/21/31, p.

48; see also 4/8/31, p. 48, and 4/15/31, cover).

          Though Business Week referred mainly to credit, other discussions made it clear

that it viewed this term as roughly synonymous, or at least closely related, to “money.”

In an editorial discussing the causes of deflation, it said (9/9/31, p. 44):

             They are symptoms of … a sudden, mysterious, universal shrinkage and
          shortage of the money and credit medium by which everything is
          exchanged and the supply of which rests solely in the hands of the world’s
          banking institutions. 5

          Perhaps the clearest statement of Business Week’s model of the causes of


4 One needs to be careful in interpreting the word “deflation.” in documents from this period. In some
cases, the term clearly means price declines; but in others, it means policies or actions that will bring
about price declines and general economic contraction. In the quotations given below, we try to make
clear any time the context suggests the latter interpretation was meant.
5 That Business Week titled the editorial “No Wampum” is perhaps evidence itself that it equated credit

and money.
                                                                                      10


deflation came in September 1931. After stating that recent commodity price declines

could not be explained by supply or idiosyncratic factors, it said: “This collapse is the

consequence of a world-wide deflation of credit which has contracted purchasing power

and curtailed consumption” (9/2/31, p. 48).

      Business Week’s discussion of the causes of some particular episodes of deflation

shows that it believed Federal Reserve policy was an important determinant of the

supply of money and credit. For example, in March 1930, it stated (3/12/30, p. 20; see

also 2/26/30, p. 4):

      The recent period of falling commodity prices, beginning in September,
      1928, coincides with a period in which the rate of expansion of bank credit
      in the Federal Reserve System in this country began to decline relative to
      the increase in production, largely because of the efforts of the Federal
      Reserve authorities to control security speculation.

      An analysis of wage deflation in mid-1931 again reveals a link between credit

contraction and Federal Reserve policy. An editorial stated (8/5/31, p. 40):

          The two fundamental factors affecting wages and employment during
      this depression have been credit policy of our banking system as affected
      by Federal Reserve operations, and trade organizing activity ….
      [A]ppropriate, prompt and aggressive action by the Reserve authorities
      could have … checked the deflation of prices and wages.

      Business Week’s belief that credit contraction led to deflation, and that Federal

Reserve policy affected credit supply, makes it plausible that expectations of deflation

were also affected by credit supplies and Federal Reserve actions. The next two sections

look for a more direct link between Business Week’s expectations and its perceptions of

Federal Reserve policy.


C. Expectations of Deflation and Federal Reserve Policy in 1930

      Business Week began 1930 fairly optimistic about the end of deflation. Its
                                                                                         11


January 1 issue said, “Prices, wages and employment will be somewhat, but not much,

lower in 1930 than in 1929” (p. 22). A week later, it even described a scenario for how

“there may be a buyer’s scramble and a sharp rise in commodity prices next spring”

(1/8/30, p. 4). The magazine did not give a clear reason for this expectation, however.

Some of it appears to have been due to a general sense that the economy was bouncing

back from the stock market crash (1/22/30, p. 4). But expectations about monetary

policy also seem to have played a role. At the end of January, it said: “Business revival

would probably be facilitated and not much endangered by a further lowering of

rediscount rates. We should expect this any week now” (1/29/30, p. 4).

       As deflation continued through February and March, the magazine became less

sanguine. It wrote at the end of February (2/26/30, p. 4):

           The unexpected commodity price deflation since the market crash has
       apparently given a second and more serious shock to business itself. This
       is a deferred result of credit restriction a year ago, which still persists.

The magazine argued forcefully for more Federal Reserve action in consecutive

editorials titled “More Juice, Please” (2/26/30, p. 48) and “Do It Now” (3/5/30, p. 48).

It appeared to fear continued commodity price deflation because of Federal Reserve in-

action, saying, “Continued weakness in commodity prices indicates plainly enough that

markets are dull and doubtful. … All these things show clearly the effect of delay in

credit expansion” (3/12/30, p. 4).

       Over the next few months, Business Week did not express clear expectations

about future price movements. Various weeks showed a range of optimistic and

pessimistic price forecasts.

       In late June, when the New York Federal Reserve lowered its discount rate

further, Business Week was enthusiastic. In July it listed “Eight Solid Facts That Point to
                                                                                       12


Business Upturn,” of which expanding bank credit was number one. It said: “This means

that, so long as this expansion continues, either price levels or the volume of business

activity is bound to rise—or both” (7/9/30, p. 5).

       Two things are apparent from this discussion of the first half of 1930. One is that

Business Week was not consistently expecting much deflation. If the magazine was

representative of market participants, this suggests that some other force, such as

Temin’s autonomous drop in consumption, was driving down nominal interest rates in

this period.

       The other is that Business Week believed that adequate monetary expansion

would stop the price declines. When the Federal Reserve showed signs of acting, the

magazine expected it to be helpful. This is strong evidence that the magazine used credit

and monetary policy developments in formulating its expectations of price movements.

It also suggests that they supported Friedman and Schwartz’s notion that alternative

policies were possible and known at the time, which would have prevented the decline in

credit and prices.

       By the middle of July, Business Week was nervous that the Federal Reserve

would not carry through with monetary expansion. It wrote (7/16/30, p. 41):

           The Federal Reserve system did not follow up that aggressiveness of
       last week which had caused a short flurry of excitement. The large increase
       in Reserve credit at that time had encouraged hopes that the system was
       setting out actively to combat declining prices.

In early August, it reported: “[T]he Federal Reserve system, instead of continuing a

helpful release of credit to counteract the creeping paralysis of deflation, has done

nothing” (8/6/30, p. 10).

       Despite this concern about a lack of Federal Reserve action, Business Week did
                                                                                         13


not appear to consistently expect deflation in August and September. For example, in

September it said that a turning point for commodity prices might be at hand (9/24/30,

p. 7). This suggests that other factors, such as its sense that prices simply could not fall

below prewar levels, were also affecting its expectations (for example, 7/2/30, p. 6, and

9/17/30, p. 44).

       It was only in October that Business Week became clearly gloomy about the

prospect for more deflation. And, it connected the expectations of deflation in part to

Federal Reserve inaction, speaking of “the wave of uncontrolled deflation which

financial fatalism and lack of business statesmanship in this country let loose upon the

world” (10/22/30, cover). Its editorial said (p. 40):

          The deflationists are in the saddle. …
          With the three largest banks lined up on their side … and with the
       Federal Reserve authorities standing idly by, it has become clear since the
       middle of September that what was a comparatively mild business
       recession during the first half of 1930 has now become a case of world-
       wide reckless deflation.

       The first wave of banking panics, which Friedman and Schwartz identify as

starting in October 1930, did not show up in Business Week until December. The failure

of the Bank of the United States was reported without fanfare in a short article in the

middle of the magazine (12/17/30, p. 17). The outlook summary on the cover said:

       [T]he tidal wave of deflation … has not altogether subsided. … The bond
       market has been seriously weakened by receding investment confidence
       and lack of Federal Reserve support. … [T]he deadly contraction of credit
       continues.

Clearly, Business Week was expecting continued deflation in part because of credit

contraction caused by the interaction of the panics and Federal Reserve inaction.

However, unlike Friedman and Schwartz, Business Week viewed the Federal Reserve’s

inaction during the panic largely as a continuation of a general pattern of inadequate
                                                                                     14


response to declining credit availability, rather than a distinct policy failure.


D. Expectations of Deflation and Federal Reserve Policy in 1931

       Business Week began 1931 fairly optimistic about the end of deflation and the

revival of business, in part because of a discount rate cut at the end of December. On

January 7, 1931, Business Week stated (cover; dots of ellipsis in original):

       Basic commodity prices seem to have exhausted the possibilities of further
       decline. … Though the tangible effects of lowered Federal Reserve
       rediscount rates on the bond market are still to be tested, increasing
       support may be expected.

       But this optimism gave way to predictions of continued deflation as additional

Federal Reserve actions failed to materialize. In February, Business Week stated: “The

deflationists are now dominant in every aspect of public and private policy. Federal

Reserve credit is being steadily contracted; … commodity prices still drift downward”

(2/4/31, cover). In an editorial in April, it said: “aggressive, persistent open-market

operations by the Federal Reserve Banks could have compelled [banks] to cut short the

chronic contraction of credit which has prolonged depression … [and] this drifting,

demoralizing deflation” (4/15/31, p. 48).

       In late April, the magazine gave one of its clearest statements that it was

expecting continued deflation because of low levels of credit and anticipated Federal

Reserve inaction. It said, “Our idle gold hoard piles up without increasing the means of

payment by credit expansion because of paralysis of banking policy, thus prolonging

price deflation” (4/29/31, cover).

       In May, the Federal Reserve cut its discount rate again, and Business Week

expressed more optimism about price movements. In June, it said of commodity prices,

“A drastic and sudden reversal of the downward trend is not impossible or unlikely.”
                                                                                      15


One reason it gave for this view was, “Low money rates for short term commercial loans

now enforced by Federal Reserve and European central bank policy will stimulate

speculation for the rise and encourage consumers to accumulate supplies somewhat in

excess of future requirements” (6/10/31, p. 9).

       By early July, Business Week was almost euphoric at what it saw as signs of credit

expansion. It stated (7/8/31, cover; dots of ellipsis in original):

       Still it is increasingly evident that the explosive materials for a major
       upswing of surprising speed and proportions are accumulating in the
       unprecedented credit position of the Reserve system, the curious currency
       situation, the continued imports of gold, the abnormally unbalanced
       condition of commodity stocks …. These factors alone are automatically
       forcing a reversal of deflation, and are being strengthened by decisive
       considerations of domestic and international political and financial policy,
       all pointing imperatively toward credit expansion and price restoration.

       However, when the anticipated aggressive action failed to materialize and further

banking troubles emerged, Business Week became more concerned about the economy

and the prospects for continued deflation. On September 9, it talked about “the

seemingly unappeasable demand for cash,” and said, “Federal Reserve policy continued

to make their assistance available only in such a way as to increase the strain on the

banks” (p. 41). The cover summary said that “[t]he drastic decline in commodity prices,

resumed in August,” suggesting that the magazine may have started expecting more

deflation. It drew a link between policy inaction and this expectation when it said, “The

‘wait and see’ school is still in the ascendancy, and signs of the large-scale effort

necessary to check the process are still lacking” (9/9/31, cover). In a similar vein, two

weeks later it again linked its expectations of deflation to its expectations about

monetary policy (9/23/31, cover):

       The comparative steadiness of commodity averages is encouraging but
       conceals a still unstable price situation. … Persistent inaction in official
                                                                                                        16


        and financial circles in face of continued uncontrolled deflation becomes
        increasingly alarming.

        When Britain went off the gold standard, Business Week became more worried

that monetary developments would speed deflation. On October 7, it reported (p. 8):

            In the United States the Reserve system is being subjected not only to
        the strain of these foreign withdrawals, but to a persistently increasing
        internal hoarding demand for currency ….
            All this, taken in connection with the tidal wave of wage cuts, means
        further deflation in this country, as commodity prices decline, foreign
        trade is further hampered and credit becomes more costly and scarce. 6

        The magazine was enthusiastic when President Hoover proposed various actions

to try to improve the situation. One of the proposed measures was a private pool of

rescue funds. Private bankers would pledge to buy eligible paper from banks that were

not members of the Federal Reserve system, and so could not use the discount window.

It stated: “The pool, if entirely successful, may make financing easier and cheaper for

business, make banks better able and more willing to lend. … The pool offers a method

whereby inflation would be possible” (10/21/31, p. 5). Though Business Week was likely

using “inflation” in this instance to refer to a range of expansionary developments, it

clearly conveyed the sense that its expectations of deflation had lessened because of the

possible monetary expansion. This change in their expectations was confirmed when a

few weeks later it proclaimed (11/11/31, cover):

        The devastating process of commodity price deflation appears definitely to
        have ended as credit expansion sets in in speculative channels and sharp
        reduction of supplies in some lines looms up for next year.

        This episode, like the others we have discussed, shows a link between

expectations of deflation and monetary policy actions in one informed observer in the


6In this case, “deflation” clearly refers to something broader than price declines—likely the whole process
of credit contraction, declining output, and falling prices.
                                                                                         17


early 1930s. A large fraction of the changes in Business Week’s price expectations,

especially the longer-lasting ones, were due to changes in anticipated monetary and

credit conditions. The other fact that these episodes drive home is the volatility of the

magazine’s expectations of deflation. Business Week clearly changed its views about

future price movements frequently. As a result, increases in both the volatility and the

average level of the real interest rate may have affected spending in the early 1930s.


                                    III. CONCLUSION

       This paper has sought to address an important weakness in Friedman and

Schwartz’s monetary explanation of the Great Depression: the lack of a well-articulated

and documented transmission mechanism for the monetary shocks. Building on

previous work, we emphasize the role of expected deflation in raising real interest rates.

Our contribution is to show that the monetary explanation requires not just that there

were expectations of deflation in the early 1930s; they must have been the result of the

monetary contraction.

       Our narrative analysis of the discussion of deflation in Business Week shows that

such a link between monetary contraction and expected deflation existed strongly in this

source. Perceived Federal Reserve action (or, often, inaction) was frequently given as the

reason for the monetary contraction and the magazine’s price expectations. If this result

holds up in other narrative sources, it would provide important confirmation of the

monetary explanation of the Depression.

       This finding may also have implications for monetary policy and the transmission

mechanism in other periods, such as later in the 1930s and in recent years. When

nominal interest rates are at the zero lower bound, expansionary monetary policy can
                                                                                    18


increase output in part by raising expectations of inflation and lowering real interest

rates. Based on Business Week’s expectation formation process in the early 1930s, it

appears that expansionary policy may indeed create such expectations.
