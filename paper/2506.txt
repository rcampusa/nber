                                       ABSTRACT


           Tests of weak-form efficiency of the market for single family homes are

      performed using data on repeat sales prices of 39,210 individual homes, each

      for two sales dates. Tests were done for Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, and San

      Francisco/Oakland for 1970-86.

           While evidence for seasonality in real housing prices is weak we do

      find some evidence of inertia in housing prices A city-wide real log price

      index change in a given year tends to be followed by a city-wide real log

      price index change in the same direction (and between a quarter to a half as

       large in magnitude) in the subsequent year. However, the inertia cannot

       account for much of the variation in individual housing real price changes.

       There is so much noise in individual housing prices relative to city-wide

       price index changes that the R2 in forecasting regressions for annual real

       price change in individual homes is never more than .04.

                     The Efficiency of the Market for

                            Single Family Homes

    There is good reason to think that the market for single family homes

ought to be less efficient than are financial markets. The market is

dominated by individuals trading in the homes they live in. Because of

transactions costs, carrying costs, and tax considerations, professionals

find it relatively difficult to take advantage of profit opportunities in

this market. For these reasons, it is commonly casually asserted that the

market for single family homes is inefficient, and "bull markets" in housing

(1. e., temporary upwards inertia in housing prices) are frequently alleged.

But it is hard to find scholarly work confirming whether this is so.

     We have found surprisingly little in the literature on the testing of

the efficiency of real estate markets. A computer search turned up only

three recent papers: by George Gau, [1984], [1985] and Peter Linneman

 [1986]. Gau describes his work as the "first rigorous testing" of real

estate market efficiency."1 His data, however, were confined to commercial

real estate and to the Vancouver area for the years 1971-1980. He concluded

 that prices in the Vancouver market were well described as a random walk.

Linnernan, who asserts that "there are no empirical studies of the efficiency

 of the housing market,"2 did a study using observations on individual owners

 assessments of house value (rather than actual sales prices) in Philadelphia

 for two points of time: 1975 and 1978. He found that houses that were

 undervalued relative to a 1975 hedonic regression (i. a., that had negative
                                                                  tended to
 residuals in a regression of price on housing characteristics)

increase in value subsequently, but that because of transactions costs only

an insignificant number of units appear to present profitable arbitrage

candidates. Engle, Lilien and Watson [1985] estimated a model of the resale

housing market using data on retail house sales in San Diego 1973-80. They

concluded that much of the overall movement in housing prices in this period

could be explained in terms of such factors as demographically-driven

changes in the cost of housing services, proposition 13 and the inflation-

driven change in marginal tax rates. But they did not investigate directly

whether the market was efficient.

     This paper performs tests of the weak-form efficiency of this market

using data from the Society of Real Estate Appraisers tapes for the years

1970 to 1986 for Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco/Oakland. The

tapes contain actual sale prices and other information about the homes. We

extracted from the tapes for each city a file of data on houses sold twice

for which there was no apparent quality change and for which conventional

mortgages applied. For each house the data we used consisted of the two

sales prices and the two quarters in which the sales occurred. The total

number of observations on such double sales of relatively unchanged homes

was 39,210 (8,945 Atlanta, 15,530 Chicago, 6,669 Dallas and 8,066 Sn

Francisco). None of the other studies had actual repeat sales price data on

individual homes at all, let alone such a large number, and none of the

studies spanned the time interval and geographical area of our study.

Moreover, the present study presents some statistical-methodological

improvements over the Cau study [1986] in its effort to test the random walk

theory for housing prices.

The WRS Index

       In a companion paper (Case and Shiller (1987]) we discuss our method of

price index construction, which we call the Weighted Repeat Sales (WRS)

method. The method is a modification of the regression method proposed by

Bailey, Muth and Nourse [19631 (hereafter, BMN). The BMN method produces

estimates and standard errors for an index of housing prices by regressing,

                            squares;,, the change   in log price of each house on a set
using    ordinary   least

of dummy variables,,    one     dummy fer each time   period in   the   sample except for
the    first. Each value of the log price index WRS(t) is represented by a

regression coefficient, except for the first value of the log price index,

which is set to zero as a normalization. The dummy variables are zero except

 that the dummy is +1 corresponding to the second time period when the house

 was sold and that the dummy is -l corresponding to the first time period

 when the house was sold (unless this is the. first time period). Bailey, Muth

 and   Notixse argued that. if the. log priced chang,es of. individual houses differ
 from the city-wide log price cange by an inependnt., identically
 distributed noise term, then by the Gauss Markov theorem their e-stimated
 index is the best linear unbiased estimate of the city wide log price.
     Our procedure differs from the BMN procedure because we feel that the
 house-specific component of the change in log price is probably not
 hojaocedatic but that the variance of this noise            increases with the

 interval between     sales. The motivation for our WRS        method    was the

 assumption that t log price               of the   ith house at time t    is   given by:

                            =        +   H.    +

difference of the index is fairly well measured. One way of describing how

well these variables are measured is to compute the ratio of the standard
                                         standard error for that variable. For
deviation of a variable to the average

the log index in levels, this ratio is 13.87 for Atlanta, 24.52 for Chicago,
                                     Francisco-Oakland. Thus, we can make very

accurate statements about the level of house prices in the cities. For the

quarterly difference of the log indexes, the ratio is 1.64, 1.61, 1.35, and

1.54 respectively. We thus cannot accurately describe the quarterly changes
                                       will give a rough indication. For the
 in the log prices, though the index

 annual difference of the log index, the ratio is 2.73, 3.99, 2.90, and 3.62

 respectively; we can make fairly accurate statements about the annual change

 in log housing prices.

      Other existing housing price indexes are widely interpreted as showing

 even monthly changes in housing prices. We argue in our companion paper

 [1987] that these indexes (for which no standard errors are provided) are

 likely to be less accurate than ours.

 Statistics on WRS Index
                                                    WRS(t) -              W(t) is

 the real WRS index in each city, deflated by the city-specific consumer

 price index. The growth in real price was less than 1% per quarter for all

  cities, even San Francisco where a real estate "boom" took place. The

  standard 1eviation in quarterly real price changes is less than 3% per

  quarter, or on the order of a third of the standard deviation of quarterly

  changes in comprehensive real stock price indexes.

       Individual housing prices are like many individual corporate stock

  prices in the large standard deviation of annual percentage change, close to


                                          5
15% a year for individual housing prices. But housing prices in our sample

differ from stock prices in that the individual prices are not so heavily

influenced by the aggregate market price. When one-year changes in real in

individual house prices are regressed on contemporaneous one-year changes in

the real WRS index, the R squared is only .066 for Atlanta, 0.158 for

Chicago, 0.121 for Dallas, and 0.270 for San Francisco.

     While   second   quarter price changes tend to be high and third quarter

changes low, the difference is small and only in Chicago is seasonality

statistically significant at the 5% level. The National Association of

Realtors series on the median price of existing single family homes appears

to show more pronounced seasonality; we argued elsewhere that much of this

may be due to seasonality in the composition of houses     sold over the year

(Case and Shiller [19871). Still, the NAR and WAR indexes do agree that

prices are highest midyear (the NAR index tends to peak in July).

     The beta (estimated for each of the cities by regressing the quarterly

change in the log nominal WRS index on the corresponding change in the log

Standard and Poor Composite Index) is always virtually zero (Table lB.)

This confirms results of Cau [1985].

Testing for Market Efficiency

      One might think that we could test the random walk property of prices

by regressing the change in the index on lagged changes in the index.      But

 there is a problem, the noise in the estimated index. To see this point,

 consider the very simple case where we have two observations only on log

 housing prices. House A was sold in period 0 and period 1, while house B was

 sold in period 0 and period 2. The estimated changes in the log price index

 (using either the original BMN or WRS procedure, since in this example the


                                           6
number of observations equals the number of coefficients) are, for period 1,

index change between 0 and 1 is negatively correlated with the change

between 1 and 2 because of common terms appearing with opposite signs.

     There may also be positive serial correlation of estimated changes in

the log price index. Suppose we have three houses in our sample, house A was

sold in periods 1 and 3, house B was sold in periods 0 and 2, and house C

was sold in periods 0 and 3. The estimated changes in the log price index

 (again, using either the original BMN procedure or the WRS procedure with

 the full sample) are, for period (p -                        'o       -
                                                                           A3 A1  -          and for


 period .        (G        -        - (12   -           These two estimated changes will be

 positively correlated in our model because house C appears with the same

 sign in both expressions, while the specific shocks to the other two houses

 are independent. The three-house example also makes clear that there may be

 serial correlation between non-contiguous price changes.

      Cau's [1984] procedure for testing the efficiency of the Vancouver

 commercial real estate market involved building three price indices (not

 repeat-sales indexes): sales price divided by square footage, sales price

 divided by gross income, and sales price divided by number of suites. For

 each month he chose a single transaction for his index. His method of

  construction of a price series is likely to induce the same sort of negative

  serial correlation in price changes. His conclusion that his price index was

  approximately a random walk might be spurious.4


       4it should be noted that a strength of Gau's approach relative to ours
  is that he could research the properties more thoroughly. He used detailed
  description of debt liens from provincial land title records, to adjust for

                                                        7
A Simple Expedient for Dealing with Estimation Error

    We have seen that we cannot test efficiency of the housing market by

regressing real changes in the WRS index onto lagged changes, and testing

for significance of the coefficients, because the same noise in individual

house sales contaminates both dependent and independent variables. A simple

expedient for dealing with this problem is to split the sample of individual

house sales data and estimate two WRS indexes. For each city, houses were

randomly allocated between samples A and B, and log price indexes WRSA and

WRSB were estimated using the respective samples. Then efficiency is tested

by regressing changes in the real log index WA(t)       WRSA(t) -     ln(CPI(t))   on

lagged changes in the real index WB(t) = WRSB(t)    -
                                                        ln(CPI(t)),   where CPI(t)

is the consumer price index for the city for quarter t (quarterly average).5

Both sides of the equation are contaminated by noise, but since the same

houses do not enter into the indexes on the two sides of the equation, these

noise terms will not be correlated. If the slope coefficients are statisti-

cally significant, we can reject weak form efficiency.

     Table 2 presents such regressions. For each city, we report first the

regression of annual change with real log index A on the contemporaneous

annual change in real index B, as a diagnostic on our methods. The

coefficient should be 1.00 if the indexes were measured perfectly, but

should tend to be less than one for estimated indexes, due to the errors in


financing with below-market interest rates. We did not have such information
on the SREA tapes. He also controlled for other quality differences by his
choice of properties to include.

     5Since quarterly data were used and price index changes were measured
over four quarters, error terms in the regression are not independent under
the random walk assumption, but follow an MA-3 process. A method of Hansen
and Hodrick (1980) was used to correct the standard errors of the ordinary
least squares estimates.

 inertia in housing prices, increases in prices

 followed by increases in the subsequent year.

      The Table 2 regressions show that real price changes are forecastable,
                                                           excess returns to be had in
 but do not show that there are any predictable

 investing in real estate. It is in principle possible that the forecast-

 ability of price changes is due to nothing more than the forecastability of

 real interest rates or of the dividend on housing. Table 3 reports analogous

  regressions, where the dependent variable is the after-tax excess nominal

from the U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, r is the marginal personal income

tax rate (assumed to be 0.30) and r(t) is the one-year treasury bill rate,

secondary market.6 The constant C was chosen to make the average "dividend-

price ratio" CR(t)+R(t+1)+R(t+2)+R(t+3)}/exP(WRS(t)) equal to .05. We are

using the residential rent index to indicate the implicit 'dividend' (in the

form of housing services) on houses, and must guess as the factor of

proportionality between the index and the actual dividend. The assumptions

about taxes are that neither the capital gain nor the implicit rent are

subject to income taxes, but that interest is deducted from taxable income.7

     As seen in Table 3, excess returns are even more forecastable than real

price changes. The greater forecastability holds up even when we adjust the

constant C to make the average dividend-price ratio either 0.0 or 0.1,

adjust the tax rate r up to 0.50, and whether we substitute the   residential

mortgage rate for the interest rate r(t). Apparently, the greater

forecastability of excess returns comes about largely because of the

forecastability of real interest rates over this period. That real interest

rates are quite forecastable may surprise some readers, who remember Fama's

 [1975] assertion that real interest rates are almost unforecastable. Fama's

sample period in that paper was 1953 to 1971, which hardly overlaps with our


     6The residential   rent index is computed for every other month only. For
quarters in which two   months are available, R(t) is the average of the two
figures. For quarters   in which only one month is available, R(t) is the
figure for the middle   month. The interest rate r(t) is the quarterly average
of the monthly series   Treasury bills, secondary market, one-year, from the
Board of Governors of   the Federal Reserve System.

      7We should properly also account for changes through time in the
 property tax rate. However, existing data series do not appear to allow us
 to measure well changes in this rate for the cities and sample period studied.

sample period. Since 1971 real interest rates have shown major persistent

movements and have been much more forecastable. Real interest rates shifted

from positive to negative in the early 1970's, and sharply shifted up to

large positive values following the October 1979 change in the operating

procedures of the Federal Reserve System (see Huizinga and Mishkin [1986]).

The forecastability of real interest rates is likely to have more impact on

the forecastability of excess returns in city-wide housing returns over the

risk free rate than on the excess returns between corporate stock indexes

over the risk free rate, just because the variability of corporate stock

price indexes is so much higher than the variability of city-wide housing

price indexes.

Forecasting Individual House Sales Data

     A second procedure for testing the efficiency of the market for single

 family homes is to regress changes in individual housing prices between time

 t and a subsequent period on information available at time t-l. The log

 price index we construct appears only as an explanatory variable in these

 regressions, and so any spurious serial correlation in it will have no

 effect on our results. Under the efficient markets hypothesis, anything in

 the information set at time t should have no explanatory power for

 individual house price changes subsequent to that date. It is natural to set

 up the testing of the efficient markets hypothesis in this way: we are

 concerned with forecasting individual housing prices and if people were to

 use past price data to forecast these prices, the forecasting variable would

 be an index like ours.

      To assure that the individual price changes are predicted only using

 lagged information, we reestimated the WRS index anew for each quarter,


                                       11
using only data available up to that quarter. That is, we reestimated the

entire WRS index for all N quarters in each sample, thus providing N

different estimated price indexes, with from 1 to N time periods. In our

forecasting regressions where past price indexes were used as explanatory

variables, only those past values in the price index were used that were

estimated using data up to and including the quarter before the quarter of

the first sale of the house.8

     Doing regression tests of the efficient markets hypothesis by

regressing individual house log price changes does have a potential problem

in that many of the observations of price changes are for time intervals

that overlap with each other. Thus, we cannot assume that residuals are

uncorrelated with each other, even if they are uncorrelated with the

independent, variables.

     To deal with this overlap problem, we use the model (1) again where the

null hypothesis of market efficiency is taken to be that C is a random walk

that is independent of anything in the information set at time t-l. Consider

two different houses in a city, house A sold at time t and t' and house B

sold at time T and T'. The variance of the residual in the regression of the

log real price change on lagged information (under the null hypothesis of

market efficiency this residual is just the change in price) for house A is

     + Uh)(t -    t)   + 2cN2, and the covariance between the residual for

house A and for house B. is na2 where n is the length of overlap of the two


     8Note that all three steps of the WRS estimation procedure were run
separately for each quarter, using only data available in that quarter, so
that no future information would creep into the constructed price index. In
some instances (especially for the earlier quarters, that is, using small
amounts of data) the step 2 estimated coefficient of the interval between
sales had the wrong sign. When this happened, it was set to zero, so that
the procedure then reduces to ordinary least squares in step three.

                                        12
time intervals. The testing procedure was as follows. A preliminary ordinary

least squares regression (where t' -   t was fixed at a constant for all
observations in the regression) was performed to get a vector of estimated

residuals. The parameter (cc + ah)(t -       t)   + 2aN2 was estimated as the

average square value of the residuals. The parameter c2 was estimated by

forming all possible products of residuals for different houses where the

time intervals overlap, dividing each by the length of the overlap, and

forming the average of these. The variance matrix was constructed using

these estimates, and the variance matrix of the ordinary least squares

estimates was taken as (X'X)X'f2X(X'X) L This variance matrix was used to

construct t tests and chi-square tests of market efficiency.

Results with Individual House Data

     The regression results generally do not find statistical significance

(Tables 4 and 5). The magnitudes of coefficients estimated in Table 4 are

however roughly consistent with those found in Table 2, and the distributed

lag pattern in Table 5 shows a crude indication of an exponential decay

pattern that gives most weight to the most recent quarterly index change.

There appears to be a substantial response in individual house prices to

lagged index changes, but there is so much noise in individual houses (the

standard deviation of annual price changes is comparable to that on the

aggregate stock market) that we do not generally find statistical

significance.

     One reason that the regressions did not disclose stronger or more

consistent evidence of inertia in housing prices is inadequate data. While

we had hundreds of observations of individual house sales for each forecast

horizon, We have only 16 years of data. The serial correlation correction in


                                        13
effect does not assume a great number of 'degrees of freedom' despite the

large number of observations.

     Errors in the WRS index as a measure of city-wide prices are a problem

tending to bias our coefficients, probably towards zero. The index is

reestimated anew every quarter, and there is always substantial measurement

error in the most recent observations of the index.9

     To attempt to-deal with this problem, a time-varying errors in variable

model was estimated. It is well known in the errors-in-variables literature

that if there is an independent measurement error in a single independent

variable, the estimated coefficient tends to be biassed toward zero by a

factor of proportionality called the reliability ratio (see for example

Fuller [1987]). The reliability ratio is the ratio of the variance of the

correctly measured independent variable to the sum of the variance of the

correctly measured independent variable and the variance of the measurement

error. We have information (in the form of estimated standard errors) on the

size of the measurement error; this size varies through time, and we can

assess movements in the reliability ratio through time. Reestimating Table 4

where the independent variable was a time-varying estimated reliability

ratio (thereby downweighting inaccurately measured observations) did not

substantially improve the significance of the results.

Conclusion

     There is substantial persistence through time in rates of change in

indexes of real housing prices in the cities. A change in real city-wide


     9For example, with the San Francisco-Oakland data, there is, when the
index is estimated with data through 1980-2, an estimated decline in real
housing prices of 6.20% between 1980-1 and 1980-2 (the actual decline, not
an annualized rate). When data through 1986-3 are used to estimate, the
index between those two quarters is estimated to increase 2.53%.

                                      14
housing prices in a given year tends to predict a change in the same direc-

tion, and one quarter to one half as large in magnitude, the following year.

     Whether housing markets are actually efficient has not been defini-

tively answered. We cannot measure the dividend on housing accurately. Our

measure of the dividend on housing, the BLS residential rent index, is esti-

mated from data on rental properties which may differ in quality from owner-

occupied housing, and we do not know the constant of proportionality for the

index. We have given only rudimentary attention to the effects of tax laws.

     Our experiments with a variety of assumptions about rental rates and

taxes suggest that city-wide excess returns may well be quite forecastable.

There is, however, little hope of taking account of such factors in a way

that will definitively resolve whether the market for single family homes is

efficient. We see no way of obtaining an accurate historical time series on

implicit rents of owner-occupied houses. Available property tax series

appear to have major deficiencies. There is not just a single income tax

bracket, so any effort to model tax effects runs into definitional problems.

That is why we concentrated most of our attention here on the relatively

 concrete question whether prices can be forecasted.

      From the standpoint of forecasting excess returns of individual houses,

 such factors may be of only secondary importance anyway. The noise in

 individual housing prices is so great relative to the standard deviation of

 changes in city-wide indexes that any forecastabilityof individual housing

 prices due to forecastability of city-wide indexes will tend to be swamped

 out by the noise. Of course, this conclusion may not apply to periods of

 extraordinary price movements, such as have been observed over the last few

 years in Boston, New York and other cities in the North East.

sample A only, WR(t) is the real t4RS index estimated using sample B only.
Both series are eflated using the real city-specific consumer price index.

 Notes: Houses were randomly allocated into samples A and B. ExcessA(t) is
 the city excess return estimated using sample A only, ExcessB(t) is the city
 excess return estimated using sample B only. Rental index (used to compute
 returns) was scaled so that average dividend-price ratio was .05. Assumed
 income tax rate was 0.30. T = 1971-I to 1985-lI (1985-Ill San Francisco)

                         Notes to Tables 4 and 5



In the regressions, each observation i corresponds to a house that was sold

twice A quarters apart, and t. denotes the quarter of the first sale for

house i. Prices are in real terms: P(i,t) is the natural log price of the

ith home at time t minus the natural log of the city consumer price index

for time t. W(t,t') t' < t is the WRS log price index for time t' estimated

with data up to time t and minus the natural log of the city consumer price

index for time t'. Figures in parentheses are t statistics computed taking

into account the serial correlation of error terms induced by overlapping

intervals between sales. The chi-square tests in Table 2 also take into

account the serial correlation.
