                 CAUSATION AMONG SOCIOECONOMIC TIME SERIES

                                ABSTRACT



         Using annual U. S. time series data from 1950—1974, formal

tests of causation are performed among three socioeconomic phenomena:

women's labor force participation rates, fertility rates, and divorce

rates. Box—Jenkins and other techniques are employed with Granger—Sims

type definition of causation based on leads and lags.


        Women's labor force participation appears to be causally prior

to both fertility and divorce; the direction of effect on fertility is

negative and on divorce, positive. Additional tests with alternative

definitions of variables and a longer (1924—1974) time span also exhibit

causal influence from fertility to divorce (with no feedback). When per

capita income is also tested for causal influence, it, too, appears

causally prior to fertility and divorce.

     This paper addresses the question of causation among three socio-

economic phenomena, fertility, divorce and women's labor force participa-

tion, in the U.S. during the post—World War II era. Section I discusses

the hypothesized relationships among the three; Section II discusses the

notion of causation and recently developed macro—economic time series

techniques for identifying causation using rather sophisticated methods

of studying leads and lags. Section III reports findings using these

techniques, and Section IV extends the investigation to include the causal

relationships between these three socioeconomic variables and income.

Section V is a brief summary.


I.   Behavioral Patterns

     Over the past thirty years in the U.S. profound changes have occurred

in several dimensions of family life including fertility, divorce, and

women's labor force behavior. These interrelated changes are discussed

in several disciplines that offer broadly similar explanations, and these
                                                     .1
explanations accord with the layman s armchair analysis.   Thus from an

analytical point of view the decline In fertility since the late 1950's,

the rise In women's LFPR, and the rise in divorce rates in recent years

seem to fit together rather well. If one of these series was justifiably

viewed as causally prior, it would be relatively easy to understand why

the others behaved as they did. But which might be the prime mover?

     The existing literature suggests considerable simultaneous causation

among these three aspects of socioeconomic behavior. Relying on a single

recent volume of papers (Schultz (1974)). plus one article on divorce

behavior (Becker, Landes, Michael (1977)), we are told that:
                                    2




                         LF<


That is, fertility (F) and women's labor force participation rates (LF)

are expected to be mutually causal and negatively related, F and divorce

rates (D) are expected to be mutually causal and negatively related,

while LF and D are also expected to be mutually causal and positively

related. In empirical studies, however, one finds few attempts to investi-

gate interdependence among these three dimensions of behavior. Some

researchers select one as a dependent variable using others as "exogenous"

influences, while other researchers employ the same basic variables with

causal links assumed to be reversed. Indeed, the list of those who have

themselves "run the regression" both ways is not unimpressive.

    The best strategy for studying these interrelated phenomena is

debatable. One strategy would be to estimate a system of simultaneous

equations representing quasi—structural relationships. There are many

fundamental causes of the change in fertility, women's labor force and

divorce behavior suggested in the literature, including improved labor

market opportunities for women due in part to a shift toward services in

the cumposition of output; rise in real income; growth of social (i.e.

governmental) provision of various services including old age insurance,

medical care, child care, et cetera; growing acceptance of personal

freedoms including sexual freedom (prompted in part by medical technology

in fertility control); et cetera. These and other social and technical

forces have surely affected socioeconomic behavior, but research on
                                       3




several of these separate structural equations has not progressed very

far as yet, so this strategy does not appear most fruitful at this time.

Development of rigorous life cycle models of these interdependent socio-

economic decisions represent another research strategy, but these models

of so many decisions become practically intractable.

     Consequently, the strategy adopted here is a less demanding one.

Using techniques developed recently for use in judging causation among

macro—economic series (e.g., see Sims (1972)), pairwise tests of causa-

tion are performed among several post—war annual time series. Regarding

these tests, recent literature suggests that there has developed general

agreement about an appropriate definition of causality which can be

implemented empirically, but that there is less consensus about the

appropriate procedure for making it operational (see the Pierce—Granger—

Sims JASA Exchange, 1977, and see Hsiao (1977)). This is the first

attempt of which I am aware to apply these time series techniques to the

area of economics of human behavior.


II. The Notion of Causation

     The concept of causation used here is that proposed by Granger (1969)

and Sims (1972) and essentially involves predictability: given two time

series    and Y, Y is said to cause X if the prediction of X conditional

on X1 is improved by using information about

     Sims (1972) has shown that causation can be inferred, using a linear

prediction equation, by regressing a suitably transformed (stationary)

series of X on the past and future values of a stationary series of Y.

If future values of Y,        are as a group statistically related to X

(as judged by a partial F—test on the set of       i=l."n) then X is said
                                     4




to cause Y. This evidence of feedback causation from X to Y is based on

the logic that future values of Y could not have caused a change in current

values of X. (Of course, it is possible that expectations of       based on

information available at time t but not yet incorporated in    itself have


affected Xe.)

      This procedure for establishing causation is essentially definitional.

If lead—values of Y are statistically related to X in a regression on a

detrended, covariance stationary series with no serial correlation in the

regression's residuals, then X causes Y. The causation test from X

to Y using feedback from     to     involves the logic of inferritig causation

from the sequence of leads and lags. Concluding from these tests that X

causes Y does not imply X is the sole cause of Y or even that it has a

quantitatively large influence on Y; it implies only that evidence is

observed of a statistically significant causal link from X to Y.

      Procedurally the issue becomes how best to produce stationary series

in X and Y that yield linear regressions with no serial correlation in the

residual. One relatively extreme procedure employs the time series

techniques of Box—Jenkins (1976) applied to each series separately. That

is, assume the series X is generated by a discrete linear stochastic

process which, when estimated, can be removed from the series X yielding

a series X which is a white noise series (i.e. a series of identically

and independently distributed random variables with mean zero and variance

a2)    The series X is




                         X =k     +EX. + X.                                  (1)
                                        5



So in principle, by estimating k and 1,         the   series of random——unanticipated

or unpredicted——shocks X can be calculated. Box—Jenkins procedures employ

maximum likelihood estimators of .      The same type of relationships can

be estimated, independently, for the series Y, yielding YS. Using the
                   S    S
filtered series X and Y , one can perform tests of causation by regressing

the test of feedback causation from X to Y. This is one of the tests used

below. This Box—Jenkins method of filtering the initial series X and Y

has been employed in test of causation among a number of monetary variables

(see Pierce (1977)). However, it has been criticized, by e.g. Sims (1977),

as containing a bias in favor of the null hypothesis of no causation (this is

further discussed below).

     A second filtering procedure applies a single, predetermined filter to

both the X and Y series to whiten them. The filter (l—O.75L)2 for lag

operator L is used here as elsewhere. That filter is intended also to

produce whitened series X and yS which can be used to estimate equation

(2) yielding another test of the feedback causation from X to Y.           By
running equation (2) reversing the X and Y series, an analogous test of

causation from Y to X can be made using either the Box—Jenkins—filtered

series or the single—filtered series.

     A third method of performing this test involves a somewhat different

procedure, appealing in terms of its intuitive nature. One regresses the

original series X on lagged values of itself and lagged values of Y and

uses the F—test on the lagged Y as the direct test of causation from Y to X.

That is, regress

and use the partial F—test on the set of coefficients iX as the test of

causation from Y to X.2 A comparable regression interchanging X and Y

can be used to test for causation from X to Y, using the set 1:


                                    n              In
                      Y =
                      t
                            & + E it—i
                                   X+E         .          ic—i + E t
                                                         y'Y                   (4)
                                1=1            i=l


The pair of equations (3) and (4) constitutes a simultaneous system in X

and Y which can be estimated as "seemingly unrelated" equations. The

important issue for the F—test is that each of the error terms be serially

uncorrelated.


III. Findings

     LF, F and D: 1950—1974. The following three annual time series for

the post—war period are studied:

     F:   fertility: the annual number of births per 1000 women aged
          14—44; p = 108.0, a = 12.0

     LF: labor force participation rate of women, defined for women with
          spouse present and with children under the age of six; p = 20.1,
          a =   6.2
    D:    divorce rate: the annual number of divorces and annulments per
          1000 married couples; p = 11.5, a = 3.1

Using these three series, all six possible directions of causation are

tested using each of the three filtering procedures just described: the

Box—Jenkins or ARIMA      filter,                                          2
                                    the single filter (1—0.75L) , and the simul-

taneous system approach. For the first two procedures a first—stage fil-

tering is performed on each series and then equation (2) is estimated for

all six permutations of the pairs of three variables and the partial F—test
                                    7




on the lead values of        '+2 and Y3 is used as the test of causation

on X and Y. In the third filtering procedure equation (3) is estimated on

the original X and Y series and the partial F—test
                                                      —1' —v            from
the. regression on X is used as the test of causation from Y to X.

     The Box—Jenkins first—stage estimation of each series' ARIMA structure

is shown in Table 1. Panel A shows the autocorrelatjons while Panel B

indicates the estimated structures and related diagnostics.3 Table 2

col. (1) reports the relevant tests of causation among these ARIMA—filtered

series. Only two of the six pair—wise relationships exhibit causation

(at 90% level of confidence). Four of the tests do not reject the null

hypothesis of no causation; we can say that the labor force series "causes"

the divorce series, and that the fertility series "causes" the labor force

series. Finding relatively few causal relationships is quantitatively

not unlike Pierce's (1977) results for various monetary series. It is

also not inconsistent with Granger's contention that, "The empirical fact

[is] that weak relationships will often be found in economics when a

sound method of analysis is applied" (Granger, 1977, p. 23). However,

Sims' point about downward bias in these tests suggests that other filter-

ing schemes besides the Box—Jenkins procedure should be investigated.

The single—filter approach yielded even weaker results as shown in Table 2

col. (3) —— none of the pairs of variables exhibited a statistically

significant relationship.4

    The tests of causation from the simultaneous system of equations,

shown in col. (5) of Table 2, yield a different picture: three of these

estimated causal links are significant at conventional levels of confi-

dence.5 LF appears to cause both the divorce and fertility series (at
                                       8




     = .05) and there is less statistically significant evidence (ct = .10)

of causation from fertility to labor force participation rates of women.

       Using the estimated two—equation relationship between LF and D, a

one—unit increase in LFt raises divorce by, say, year t+3 by 0.24; a one—

unit increase in LF lowers fertility by year t+3 by —1.41 while the

causation from F to LF implies that a one—unit increase in Ft lowers LF by

t+3 by only —0.09. If we convert these three—year duration effects into

quasi—elasticities as (LX+3/LY)(Y/X) for             =   1.0,   those elasticities

are D,LF =    0.42;        = —0.26, and LF,F = —0.50.           (Alternatively, the

unitless measure (AX+3IY) o(Y)/a(X) =         is D,LF = 0.48,               = —0.73

and LF,F = —0.18.)     In summary, the directions of causation are found

to




                          LF/                  > D



       Extensions: Age specific F and LF series, and a longer time period.

Two additional relationships have been investigated to provide some further

check on these results. One uses age—specific series for LF and F over

the same twenty—five year time period (1950—1974), the other extends the

estitration where possible to a fifty year period (1924—1974). The LFPR

of married women aged 25—34, LF3O, is available in the post—war period

(note that this variable does not control for age of or presence of

children). Also available (for a longer time—span) is age—specific fer-

tility, F25, the number of children ever born to women age 25 (from Heuser
                                       9




(1976)). The variable F25 is an age—specific stock—fertility measure

while the variable used above, F, is a flow measure defined over all ages

of women.6 Given that F25 is a stock measure at age 25 while LF3O is a

flow measure of labor force attachment of women 25—34 it seems reasonable

to expect F25 - LF3O but rather unlikely that LF3O - F25 (of course, a

scenario with anticipations of future labor force attachment affecting

current fertility is possible). Regarding the divorce series, no age—

specific series is available for the whole post—war period; a series has

been constructed for 1960—1970 for women 25—29 and for that decade the age—

specific series is highly correlated with the total divorce rate series D

(correlation =   0.95).   So the series D will be assumed to be an adequate

proxy for a divorce rate for women in their late 20's, and thus D is

investigated together with LF3O and F25.

     Table 3, Panel A shows the results of the F—tests for pairs of these

three series, LF3O, F25, and D estimated from the two equation system.

Again the labor force series appears to "cause" changes in the D series:

the coefficients on this statistically significant relationship imply that

a one—unit increase in LF30 raises Dt+3 by +0.13. However, LF3O does not

appear to cause changes in the P25 series; that is what we should expect,

as indicated in the preceding paragraph. There is evidence of causation

from the stock of fertility, F25, to the divorce rate, while no such

causation was found using the flow measure of fertility, F.     (Here a 0.1

increase in F25 lowers Dt÷3 by —0.14.) The most puzzling result in this

set of tests is the lack of causation from F25 to LF3O. It seems reason-

able that changes in the stock of fertility to 25—year—old women might be

causally linked to the subsequent changes in LFPR of women 25—34. The test

does not provide support for that hypothesis. In surmnary:
                                    10




                                     F25




                             LF3O



     The variables D, F and F25 are available as annual time series over

the fifty year period 1924—1974. Panel B of Table 3 shows the comparable

results for the two—equation systems estimated over this time span. (As

the degrees of freedom are larger in these regressions I experimented with

six—year lags on F and F25 as well as the usual three—year lags.) Flow

fertility, F, and D appear to be causally linked with the statistically

stronger relationship running from F to D (a one—unit increase in Ft lowers

D+3 by —0.11; while a one—unit increase in Dt is estimated to raise F+3

by the tiny amount +0.35 (on a mean of 108.0)). Whereas the stock

fertility measure F25 did show causality in the short time period (see

Panel A), it did not do so in the fifty—year period with the three—year

lag; only when the six—year lags were included did evidence of causation

from F25 to D emerge.

     To recap, regarding the six hypothesized directions of causation

suggested on page 2, at a 95 percent level of confidence we find evidence

that'LF —G-) D, both using LF and LF3O; LF          F but not so using

the age—specific variables; and we find F —2-9 D when we use F25 and

when we consider a fifty—year time span. Diagrammatically,

                                     F




                        LF
                                           11




Only   at   a lower level of confidence (ci =    .10) do we observe any feedback
effect of F —?j4 LF (and an anomalous weak positive effect of D on F in

the fifty—year period).


IV. The Effect of Income

       As an extension of the procedures employed above, income is added to

the set of variables and causal links between income and each of the three

socioeconomic variables D, LF, and F are investigated. At the risk of

considerable over—simplification of the existing literature, the following

diagram suggests the directions of effects typically hypothesized in the

literature regarding men's income, I, holding women's income (or wage

rates) fixed (I           )   and the hypothesized effects of women's income,
                  In If
holding men's income fixed (If)




               E—i —> LF                            If           LF

                       F                                          F


That is, men's income is expected to be negatively related to divorce
rates as cross—sectional evidence suggests. The positive income elasti-
city of leisure accounts for the negative relationship between I and

LFPR of women, and for various reasons (see either Willis (page 40) or

Becker—Lewis (p. 83) in Schultz (1974)), the observed effect of I on F

may be negative even though the "true" income elasticity for children is

expected to be positive. The effects for I simply reflect the hypothe-

sized effects for LF which were discussed above.
                                       12




     Two measures of annual income are used here: I is defined as median
                                                        m
real income of men age 14 and over and I is defined as real per capita
          7
income.
                .
              While I is a reasonably adequate measure of men s income, I

is not a measure of I• Instead changes in I reflect both changes in

men's income and changes in I and additionally, I is inversely affected

by changes in fertility. Moreover, while the relationships diagrammed in

the previous paragraph are partial effects, the results to which we now

turn do not "hold constant" the other source of income. Table 4 shows

the tests of causation between each pair of variables using both I and I

as a measure of income.8 The findings are summarized as follows:




                                                     I-LF

The results for I do in fact generally mirror the results reported above

for LF in terms of the effects on D and F, although the reverse effect

of F on I may be reflecting the definitional relationship between a decline

in fertility and consequent rise in per capita income rather than any

behavioral relationship from fewer children to increased labor market

activity by women (the effect is small in any case). The comparison of

results for I and 1 are interesting: although I exhibits a positive

and significant effect on D, the effect is far smaller than that of I. If

  were tested holding I or LF constant, one might expect that signifi-

cant positive effect to disappear. In fact that is what is found:
                                                ?              ?
extending these tests of causation to test I -              LF -          and

                                    13



similarly for I in place of I, none of the four F—tests is statistically

significant. While LF an I have strong positive effects on D, and I has

a much smaller, positive effect on D, none of the partial effects is sig-

nificant.9


Summary

     The causation tests performed here are neutral with respect to which

series might have exhibited causally prior influence on the other series.

The results suggest that income——measured as either real per capita dispos-

able income, I, or real median income of adult men, I,——is an important

causally prior force affecting the divorce rate and fertility behavior.

Likewise the LFPR of married women (with spouse and young children present)

is causally prior to the divorce rate and fertility, at a 95 percent level

of confidence. There is not a discernible degree of feedback causation

from divorce to either income or LFPR (of married women) nor from fertility

to men's income. There is evidence at a 90 percent level of confidence

of causation from fertility to married women's LFPR and to I, a measure of

per capita income which includes the income of women. The relationship from

fertility to LFPR was, surprisingly, not confirmed when a measure of

stock fertility was used but stock fertility (total number of children

born per woman aged 25) did appear to have a causal effect on divorce.

     Regarding the relationship between LFPR and fertility, the results

suggest that when aggregate flow measures are used, the causation from

women's LFPR to fertility is strong and negative while the reverse causa-

tion is present, negative but quite weak. A similar conclusion was reached

in a recent sociological study using young women's stated intentions about

their completed—fertility and their planned labor force participation at a
                                      14



                      10
later age (age 35).        Regarding divorce and fertility no causal influence

is seen in the post—war period when flow measures are used, but when a

stock measure of fertility (to young women, age 25) is used instead,

causation from fertility to divorce is found.

     Although income and labor force participation rates of married women

appear to be causally prior to fertility and divorce, neither has a statis-

tically significant partial effect when the other is controlled for. It

appears that the behavior of phenomena which are the more traditional areas

of concern to economists——income and labor market changes——influence socio-

economic phenomena such as fertility and divorce more than vice versa,

based on tests using a short—run lag in the post—World War II era. The

investigation reported here does not, obviously, address the issue of much

longer run feedback (as for example the effect of cohort size on wages).

    Many limitations in the analysis performed here seem quite apparent.

(1) The results appear to be sensitive to the filtering process employed,

but the weak results using Box—Jenkins are not quantitatively different

among this set of socioeconomic variables than is found in the mini—growth

industry of estimating causal relationships among macro—economic time

series. The results are also sensitive to the particular measure used of,

say, income or fertility, but that is neither surprising nor intellectually

troublesome. The results using the third estimation scheme seem to be

Consistent with what might be expected when one measure or another of, say,

fertility is used.     (2) Another issue is that the relationships estimated

here are not structural in any sense. From the few checks which have been

made the estimated equations do not exhibit a dampening effect over time of

an initial shock from one series. However, the directions of effects are
                                   15




as expected: an increase in LFPR, for example, raises the divorce rate

and lowers fertility; a rise in fertility lowers LFPR; a rise in income

per capita (dominated by the rise in women's income) raises divorce while

a rise in men's income (which is correlated with the rise in women's

income) raises divorce but by much less.

     (3) The tests of causation performed here involve essentially leads

and lags. But there are differences among these time series phenomena

In the inherent lags between a behavioral decision and its evidence in the

measured variable. For example, if at the same moment in time an individual

decided to enter the labor force, bear a child, and divorce (an unlikely

event, but useful for illustration here), those events would not show up as

contemporaneous events in the measured statistics: the decision at t = 0

would likely be observed in LF0, F1, and, depending upon the complications

of the relevant divorce laws, in D1 or D2. So the natural leads and lags

in the measured series confound the interpretations of causation.

     Finally, the set of four variables chosen for analysis here is surely

no more than a very partial set of the variables one might want to

include——marriage, remarriage, schooling and migration behavior and unem—

ploytnent rates seem likely candidates to incorporate. The analysis to

date may, however, serve to illustrate that the time series techniques

used with increasing frequency in another area can be as fruitfully

applied to time series in sociological economics as in traditional macro-

economics.

1. For example, see Bane (1976), Bronfenbrenner (1974), Easterlin,
    Wachter and Wachter (1977), Kobrin (1976), Ross, Sawhill (1975),
    Ryder (1974), et. al. The generally positive relationship between
    women's labor force participation rate and the divorce rate is ex-
    plained in terms of the greater independence provided women by
    improved labor market opportunities, an independence which lowers
    the attractiveness of marriage and thus encourages divorce. Alterna-
    tively, the growing acceptance of divorce increases its likelihood
    which induces women to secure for themselves market careers that lower
    their dependence on their spouses.

   Likewise, the negative relationship between fertility and labor force
   participation rates of women is explained in terms of the higher value
   of women's time caused by improved labor market opportunities for
   women. This higher value of time in the labor market has induced
   women to substitute more of their time toward market activities and
   away from child rearing.

   bias imposed by the Box—Jenkins filtering is clear——that filtering
   estimates the 's first and then in a second stage, estimates the b's,
   yielding generally biased estimates of the b's (see Sims (1977), p. 24).

3. For convenience Table 1 includes the Box—Jenkins analysis of the income
    series described and used in the following section.

   Regarding the interpretation of Table 1, the fertility series for
   example is characterized as a first—difference, first—order moving
   average process, (F_Ft_1) = —0.459 + O.63lut_l + Ut with the residual
   series as white noise when judged by the Box and Pierce x2 test. Each
   of the residual series from Table 1 can be considered serially uncor—
   related through at least a lag of 12 years.

   As the implementation of this empirical technique is seemingly as much
   art as science, I am not certain that the ARIMA structure used here is
                                  F—2




   preciselY that which another practitioner would adopt. However, some
   comparisons of the resulting residual series have convinced me that
   the use of another, similar ARIMA structure would not have appreciably
   affected the results——for example, for the divorce rate series, the
   simple correlations of the whitened series from an ARIMA (111) or
   ARIMA (212) with the series used here are 0.93 and 0.99 respectively
   and they are intercorrelated at the level of 0.96.

4. After filtering the series, serial correlation coefficients r for
    lags of 1, 2 and 3 were computed and the Box—Pierce Chi—squared test
    of significance,


                        3
                      N r =
                       t=l

   with N = number of observations, e.g. years, and degree of freedom
   k—p (3 lags minus 2 parameters = 1) was calculated. The x2 value
   for divorce, fertility, and labor force respectively were 2.87, 0.73,
   and 9.58 with x(c. = 0.05) = 3.84; so the labor force series showed
   significant serial correlation remaining in the first three lags.

5. In order to estimate equation (3), one must remove the correlation
    between X_1 and et which exists if there is autocorrelation in the
    residuals. This is done by the use of instrumental variables. A
    four—equation scheme is employed. First, instruments for each of the
    three variables D, LF, and F were obtained by regression of each
    separately on a set of auxiliary variables: marriage duration, unem-
    ployment, a measure of women's education level and a proxy for the
    available contraceptive technology._ These regressions, run on annual
    data from 1947 or 1948 to 1974hadR2's of around .90 and yielded
    instruments for each year for D, LF, and F.

    Second, the regression of interest is estimated employing the instru-
                                                                     =
    ments in place of the stochastic LHS—lagged regressors, e.g., Dt
    f(Dt_l, Dt_2, Dt_3, Ft_l, Ft_2, Ft—3) + et. Third, the residuals   et
    were used to estimate the first—order autocorrelation by regressing
    et = a + b et_l + ut where b= p. Then a modified first difference
                                                — pDt_2),
    equation was estimated, (Dt—pD_1) = f(Dt_l
    (Ft_l—pFt_2), ... +

6. The simple correlation between F and F25 for the period 1924—1974
    is .615. The age—specific annual time series for 1950—1974 are:
         F25:   children ever born to women age 25;
                p = 1.44, a = 0.20.
         LF3O: LFPR of women age 25—34; p = 39.8, a = 5.9.
    The annual time series for 1924—1974 include:
         D: p = 10.3, a    3.1
         1: p = 96.5,  a = 16.0
       F25: p = 1.21, a = 0.26
                                      F— 3




 7. The simple correlation in the post—war period between I and
     is 0.98. The mean and standard deviation of I and 'm are respectively:
       = 2.57, a = 0.43; and ii = 4.89, a = 0.77.

 8. The Box—Jenkins and single—filter procedures were also applied to I,
     although these results are not shown in Table 4. Neither procedure
     showed causation from I to any of the three socioeconomic variables.
     The only significant F—test was the test on feedback from fertility
     to income: the Box—Jenkins filter yielded an F—statistic of 3.30,
     significant at a. = .10. This same weak effect is exhibited in Table 4
     using the other procedure.

 9. In these tests equation (3) is estimated in an expanded form where
     D is regressed on D, LF and I (or on D, LF and 1m)' all lagged three
     years; the partial F—tests for LF and I are then computed. The
     results were as follows:


                        Test                     F—test


                      LF +
                              DIDI                1.75

                        I -                       0.68

                      LF DIDIm                    1.38
                         +
                              DIDLF               0.22

    The critical value of F at a. =.10 is 2.52 so none of these partial
    effects is statistically significant. Thus while we can say that I,
        or LF "causes" D, the interpretation of that finding is in doubt.
    It appears that the causally prior variable represents some causally
    prior force but either I or LF reflects that force as well as the
    other. So we have not identified in the laymen's sense what "causes"
    divorce, we have only identified three separate series which are
    independently causally prior.

10. Waite and Stolzenberg (1976) use the young women's National Longi-
     tudinal Survey data to estimate a simultaneous equations model and
     found planned LFPR a relatively strong influence on planned fertility
     (plans to be in the labor force lowered planned fertility by 0.8
     children (on a mean of 2.4 children)) while the reverse relationship
     was statistically significant but quite small (plans for one more
     child lowered the implicit probability of planned LFPR by only 3.2
     percentage points (on a mean of 48. percent).
