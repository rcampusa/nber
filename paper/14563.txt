The Supply-Shock Explanation of the Great Stagflation Revisited

                                             ABSTRACT

U.S. inflation data exhibit two notable spikes into the double-digit range in 1973-1974 and again in
1978-1980. The well-known "supply-shock" explanation attributes both spikes to large food and energy
shocks plus, in the case of 1973-1974, the removal of price controls. Yet critics of this explanation
have (a) attributed the surges in inflation to monetary policy and (b) pointed to the far smaller impacts
of more recent oil shocks as evidence against the supply-shock explanation. This paper reexamines
the impacts of the supply shocks of the 1970s in the light of the new data, new events, new theories,
and new econometric studies that have accumulated over the past quarter century. We find that the
classic supply-shock explanation holds up very well; in particular, neither data revisions nor updated
econometric estimates substantially change the evaluations of the 1972-1983 period that were made
25 years (or more) ago. We also rebut several variants of the claim that monetary policy, rather than
supply shocks, was really to blame for the inflation spikes. Finally, we examine several changes in
the economy that may explain why the impacts of oil shocks are so much smaller now than they were
in the 1970s.

1. Preamble
In a paper published in a 1982 NBER volume, one of the present authors drew the

following six conclusions about the two bursts of inflation—one of which was then still

in progress—that constituted the Great Inflation (Blinder, 1982, pp. 262-263):

   “1. The dramatic acceleration of inflation between 1972 and 1974 can be traced
mainly to three ‘shocks’: rising food prices, rising energy prices, and the end of the
Nixon wage-price controls program. Each of these can be conceptualized as requiring
rapid adjustments of some relative prices.

   2. The equally dramatic deceleration of inflation between 1974 and 1976 can be
traced to the simple fact that the three factors just named were not repeated. In other
words, double-digit inflation went away ‘by itself.’

   3. The state of demand thus had precious little to do with either the acceleration or the
deceleration of inflation between 1972 and 1976. This is not to say that aggregate
demand management was irrelevant to inflation, but only that its effects were minor
compared to the supply shocks.

   4. While the rate of inflation as measured in the CPI rose about eight percentage
points between 1977 and early 1980, the ‘baseline,’ or ‘underlying,’ rate may have risen
by as little as three percentage points. The rest of the inflationary acceleration came from
‘special factors.’

   5. The initial impetus for accelerating inflation in 1978 came mainly from the food
sector, with some help from mortgage interest rates.1 The further acceleration into the
double-digit range in 1979 mainly reflected soaring energy prices and, once again, rising
mortgage rates. Finally, mortgage interest carried the ball almost by itself in early 1980.

   6. The 1970s really were different. Energy shocks are quite clearly a product of the
brave, new post-OPEC world.2 Food shocks are not new. We experienced them in the
1940s, but somehow managed to get away without them in the 1950s and 1960s.”

         Blinder (1982) based his historical analysis on the following conceptual framework

(pp. 263-264), which we have edited here only slightly for brevity, to re-order the points,

and to make the terminology more modern:
1
    At the time, the mortgage interest rate was a direct component of the CPI. More on this in Section 3.1.4.
2
    Hamilton’s (1983) subsequent work showed that this was not quite so.


                                                                                                                1
   “7. At any given moment, there is a core inflation rate toward which the actual
inflation rate tends to gravitate. This rate is determined by fundamental economic forces,
basically as the difference between the growth rates of aggregate demand and aggregate
supply.

    8. On the demand side, many factors, including monetary and fiscal policy, influence
the growth rate of aggregate demand. On the supply side, the fundamental long-run force
is the trend rate of change of productivity, though occasional abrupt restrictions in
aggregate supply (so-called supply shocks) can dominate the supply picture over short
periods.

   9. For empirical purposes, the core rate of inflation can be measured by the rate of
change of prices exclusive of food and energy prices.

   10. The headline inflation rate can deviate markedly from the core rate over short
periods. Rapid increases in food or energy prices, which are largely exogenous, can push
inflation above the core rate for a while. Conversely, unusual moderation or declines in
food or energy prices can pull inflation below the core rate. There are other special one-
shot factors as well. For example, the Nixon price controls played a major role in the
1973-75 episode.”

These ten numbered points can be said to constitute the supply-shock explanation—or,

more correctly, the special-factors explanation—of the Great Inflation.

         Before proceeding to analyze the supply-shock explanation, two important

preliminary points must be made.

         First, what this conference calls “the Great Inflation” was in fact two distinct

episodes, as Figure 1—which plots headline and core inflation as measured by both the

CPI (using current methodology) and the PCE deflator—clearly shows.3 There were

sharp increases in inflation in 1973-1975 and then again in 1978-1980, but each was

followed by a sharp disinflation. (And for later reference, it is worth noting that, in both

episodes and by both measures, core inflation rose and fell later and by smaller amounts

than headline inflation.) Any coherent explanation of the inflation of the 1970s must

explain both the ups and the downs. If we were to ignore the two pronounced “hills” in

Figure 1, we would see a clear upward drift in inflation from under 2 percent in 1964, to

around 4 percent by 1970, about 6 percent by 1976, and then back to 4 percent or so after

1983. Had this been all that happened, there would indeed have been a rise and fall of

inflation. But no one would have dreamed of calling it “the Great Inflation.” Hence we

focus on the two hills.

          Second, the Great Inflation was really the Great Stagflation. Any coherent

explanation must also explain the contemporaneous deep recessions. In particular, the

economy did not merely experience real output declines over these two periods.

Unemployment also rose sharply, implying that what was going on in each case was more

than just a neoclassical drop in output in response, say, to the rise in the relative price of

energy.

      Why revisit this ancient explanation now? There are several reasons. First, all the

data have been revised, and we have experienced 28 additional years of macroeconomic

history, including several more oil shocks. Some of this history looks quite different

from the 1970s, which already provides sufficient reason to question the supply-shock

story. Second, both macroeconomic theory and the theory of stabilization policy have

gone through several upheavals since 1980, during which (among other things) the

canonical macro model has changed multiple times. Third, an extensive empirical and

theoretical literature on supply shocks, partly spurred by Hamilton’s (1983) important

paper, has developed. Some of this literature disputes the supply-shock explanation. The

purpose of this paper is to reexamine the supply-shock explanation of the Great

Stagflation in the light of these new facts, new models, and new econometric findings.




                                                                                                 4
Our central questions are: Do we need to rewrite the economic history of this period—

and if so, how?

     The analysis proceeds in four main steps. Section 2 outlines and slightly

modernizes the basic conceptual framework (points 7 to 10 above) and reexamines it in

the light of much new theory and many new empirical findings. Section 3 takes a fresh

look at the evidence on the Great Inflation in the United States (points 1 to 6 above)—

once again making use of new data, new theory, and new econometric findings.

Section 4 then deals with a series of objections to the supply-shock explanation, some of

which were raised before 1982, but most of which surfaced later. Finally, Section 5 looks

beyond the narrow historical confines of the 1972-1982 period, considering (albeit

briefly) supply shocks both prior to and after the Great Stagflation. The main focus here

is on why recent oil shocks seem to have had so little impact on either inflation or output.

     Section 6 draws some conclusions. But we can end the suspense right now by

stating that, at least in our judgment, the “old fashioned” supply-shock explanation holds

up quite well.


2. What is the supply-shock explanation of the Great Stagflation?
First we must define what we mean by a “supply shock.” We begin, as is now

conventional (but was not in 1973), by dividing the various influences on output and

prices into two categories: factors that influence aggregate supply (“supply shocks”) and

factors that influence aggregate demand (“demand shocks”). Their respective hallmarks

can be described in either of two ways.

   1. Supply shocks affect the ability of firms to produce the gross domestic product,

       which means that they directly affect either the prices or quantities of factor


                                                                                            5
       inputs or the production technology. The resulting changes in output can be

       thought of as basically neoclassical in nature. On the other hand, demand shocks

       affect spending by the households, businesses, and governments that purchase the

       GDP. Naturally, any demand shock will have short-run Keynesian effects

       (e.g., result in changes in real output) if the economy has Keynesian properties—

       which it does.

   2. Supply shocks are events that, on impact, move the price level and real output in

       opposite directions (e.g., an adverse shock causes prices to go up and output to go

       down). Demand shocks are events that, on impact, move the price level and real

       output in the same direction (e.g., an expansionary demand shock pushes up both

       prices and output).

     The second definition is exemplified by the standard aggregate supply and demand

diagram (shown in Figure 2) in which an upward-sloping aggregate supply curve shifts

inward along a fixed aggregate demand curve, thereby simultaneously raising the price

level and reducing output—a stagflationary outcome. The non-vertical aggregate supply

curves AS0 and AS1, of course, embody some sort of nominal wage-price stickiness.

     Either of the two definitions will suffice for our purposes. But it is important to

note that some shocks have both supply-side and demand-side elements. A shock to the

price of imported oil is, of course, the most prominent example. We will show later that

neoclassical supply-side considerations alone cannot come close to explaining the

magnitudes of the two recessions that occurred during the Great Stagflation. Rather, to

explain these episodes, the two big oil shocks must be viewed as having affected both

aggregate supply and aggregate demand—with the aggregate demand effects notably

larger.4

2.1 Three types of supply shocks

To interpret the history of the 1970s and 1980s through the lens of the supply-shock

model, it is important to distinguish among three different types of supply shocks, with

the typology determined by the shocks’ nature and timing. These three stylized types are

not just theoretical constructs. Each has a clear historical counterpart in Figure 3, which

depicts the history of the real price of oil (in panel A) and the closely-related real

consumer price of energy (in panel B) since 1965.

      The first type of shock is a transitory price spike that gets reversed, leaving no

permanent level effect—as exemplified in Figure 3 by the behavior of real oil and energy

prices following the second OPEC shock in 1979. Conceptually, we expect such a spike

4
 As detailed later in Section 2.3, some demand-side influences amount to shifts of the AD curve, while
others pertain to its slope (that is, to why demand is lower at a higher price level).

to cause a corresponding (but greatly muted) jump in headline inflation, which then

reverses as the inflationary shock turns into a deflationary shock. If there is some pass-

through from oil prices into core inflation, as there should be, then the latter should

display a lagged, and even more muted, hump-shaped pattern.5

      Figure 4 gives these qualitative points a quantitative dimension. To study pass-

through empirically, we estimated a simple price-price Phillips curve model of U.S.

inflation on monthly data from January 1961 to December 1984.6 For this exercise, we

treated the relative price of energy as exogenous, with panel A of Figure 4 plotting the

precise path of energy we assumed: Relative energy prices rise by 35 percent (30 log

points) over a period of 12 months and then return to where they started over the next

12 months.7 Panel B of the figure shows the simulated inflation results, which are just as

expected. Headline inflation rises quickly and sharply by about 3½ percentage points

within a year, but then falls abruptly to below its pre-shock level (and below core

inflation) as energy prices decline, before returning to normal. Core inflation moves less,

more gradually, and with a lag, with a negligible impact on the core beyond 18 months.




5
  The proportionate effect of an oil shock on consumer energy prices is much smaller than the percentage
rise in oil prices, as can be seen from the two panels of Figure 3. (For example, crude oil accounts for only
a portion of the production and distribution costs of gasoline and heating oil.) The impact on headline
inflation is further damped because energy accounts for a relatively small share of total consumption.
6
  A detailed description of this and all empirical specifications that we employ is given in Appendix 2. The
calculations that underpin Figures 4 through 6 are described more fully in Appendix 3.
7
  The actual OPEC II peak was spread out over a longer period: Oil and (especially) energy prices did not
return to their pre-shock levels until the collapse in oil prices in 1986. Note that this and the other two
simulations assume a 30 log-point increase in relative energy (not oil) prices. Following OPEC I, real
energy prices rose about 20 log points; the corresponding increase after OPEC II was 35 points, and the
five-year net increase since the end of 2002 was around 45 points—so a 30 point increase is (in round
terms) close to the average increase in log real energy prices over these three episodes.

               In terms of our supply-shock story, then, OPEC II should have first pushed headline

inflation above core inflation, and then below it. For core inflation, the shock should

have created a smaller rise in inflation that then “naturally” petered out, as in panel B of

Figure 4. The long-run effects on both headline and core should have been negligible.

Thus, in this example, headline inflation first diverges from but then converges back to

core inflation—a pattern that is evident in the real-world data shown in Figure 1.

Furthermore, core inflation itself should converge back to its pre-shock level, other things

equal.8

               The second type of supply shock, exemplified in Figure 3 by OPEC I (1973-1974),

is an increase to a permanently higher relative price level. Panel A of Figure 5 shows

how we entered this type of energy-price shock into our econometric model: The energy

price is assumed to jump by 30 log points (35 percent) over two quarters and then to

remain there forever. The speed of this simulated shock is not too different from what

actually happened in 1973-74: While the rise in oil prices took place over a period of

8
 Some of the “other things” that were not equal over this period include the back-to-back recessions of
1980-82, which pushed core inflation down, and the large swing in food price inflation.


                                                                                                                                             10
about four months, the bulk of the pass-through to retail energy prices occurred over an

eight-month period.

               Panel B of Figure 5 shows the simulated impact of the shock on headline and core

inflation. Headline inflation leaps quickly and dramatically (by about 6 percentage

points), but then recedes just as quickly. After six months, the direct contribution of

energy prices to headline inflation is zero. Core inflation moves up much more slowly

and by much less. But the effects on core and headline inflation are essentially identical

as soon as energy prices have finished moving up to their new higher level—and they

both die out very slowly. So, in terms of the basic supply-shock story, a permanent

increase in the level of energy prices should cause a quick burst of inflation which

mostly, but not quite (because of pass-through to the core), disappears of its own accord.

Once again, headline inflation quickly converges to core, but now core inflation remains

persistently higher than it was before the shock. As is evident in Figure 1, a similar

pattern can be seen in actual U.S. inflation during and after OPEC I.9

  It would be even more evident were it not for the effects that price controls had on the core. We discuss
these in Section 3.1.3.

        Writing in the 1980s or 1990s, our typology might have stopped there. But this

decade has taught us that we should perhaps consider a third type of supply shock;

namely, a long-lasting rise in the rate of energy price inflation, as exemplified by the

stunning run-up in the real prices of oil and energy from 2002 until mid-2008 (see

Figure 3). We entered this third type of shock into our model as a permanent rise from a

zero rate of relative energy price increase to a rate of 6 percent per year, which cumulates

to a 35 percent increase in the level of real energy prices over five years. (Panel A of

Figure 6 shows the first three years of the assumed real energy price path.) This

hypothetical history is qualitatively similar to what actually occurred between 2002 and

mid-2008, although the actual increase in real oil prices was, of course, followed by a

spectacular decline.

        Panel B of Figure 6 shows the model simulation results. Headline inflation starts

rising right away and continues to rise very gradually. Core inflation does the same,

though with a short lag and to a smaller degree. But notice that inflation keeps on rising

as long as the higher energy inflation persists. Headline inflation now does not converge



                                                                                                                                         12
to core until real energy prices stop rising. Nor does the impact on core inflation fade

away until that happens.10

2.2 Why do we need the demand-shock piece?

The strictly neoclassical (that is, non-Keynesian) analysis of supply shocks is easy to

explain—and even to calibrate. Consider a three-factor, constant-returns-to-scale

production function for gross output, Q = Q(K,L,E). Here, E denotes energy input,

whose nominal price is PE and whose relative price is ρ = PE/P. Assume for the moment

that energy is entirely imported, and that we are interested in real gross domestic product

Y = Q – ρE. As Bruno and Sachs (1985, pp. 42-43) showed decades ago, optimal use of

E implies a value-added production function of the form Y = F(K,L;ρ), which is linearly

homogeneous in K and L, in which the marginal products of K and L are the same as in

Q(.), and in which Fρ = −E. Thus, a rise in the relative price of energy acts as a shift term

akin to an adverse technology shock, and whose magnitude can be measured by the

volume of energy use.

     What does this framework imply about the size of the supply-side effects of the

OPEC I and OPEC II shocks? Bruno and Sachs show that the elasticity of Y with respect

to the real energy price, ρ, is −s/(1−s), where s is the energy share in gross output Q.

Using national accounts data to compute the effects of higher prices of imported

petroleum and products on real GDP, we find that the 1973-74 oil shock implies a

cumulative reduction in real GDP of 1.1 percent through the first quarter of 1975.




10
  The estimated effect on core inflation from this third simulation is almost certainly higher than current
reality. As we discuss in Section 5, the pass-through of energy price shocks to core inflation appears to be
much smaller now than in the 1970s and early 1980s, but the model used to generate these simulations is
estimated through 1984.


                                                                                                          13
Similarly, the OPEC II shock implies a real GDP reduction of 1.7 percent through the

second quarter of 1980. (Details of these calculations are provided in Appendix 3.)

     But the actual decline in real GDP in the United States (relative to trend) was much

larger in each case. For example, real GDP fell a little more than 3 percent between its

1973:4 peak and its 1975:1 trough, a five-quarter period during which normal (pre-1973)

trend growth would have called for an increase of around 4.5 percent. Thus, in round

numbers, we lost nearly 8 percent of GDP relative to trend.11

     The period of the two oil shocks also saw large increases in the prices of other

imported materials (in addition to oil). It is straightforward to extend the Bruno-Sachs

framework to incorporate multiple imported inputs and to compute the real GDP effects

of their price increases. Even with this extension, however, the impacts of the supply

shocks are far smaller than the observed GDP declines. For 1973-75, the supply-side

reduction in real output from both higher oil and nonoil material prices cumulates to

1.6 percent, while the corresponding estimate for the OPEC II period is 1.9 percent. (See

Appendix 3 for details.)

     In addition, the pure neoclassical view does not provide any particular reason to

think that unemployment should rise following an oil shock. In that framework, real

wages and the rate of profit fall by enough to keep labor and capital fully employed. Put

differently, a purely neoclassical oil shock reduces both actual and potential output

equally, leading to no GDP gap (if the gap is measured correctly). In fact, however, the

U.S. unemployment rate soared from 4.8 percent in the second half of 1973 to almost

9 percent in the second quarter of 1975.


11
  We obtain almost identical estimates of the cumulative GDP shortfall by using CBO’s (ex post) measure
of potential output.


                                                                                                     14
     Both of these calculations suggest that something else was going on—probably

something Keynesian on the demand side.

2.3 The “oil tax”

That “something” is often called “the oil tax.” The idea is simple: If imported energy—

which mainly means imported oil—becomes more expensive, the real incomes of

Americans decline, just as if they were being taxed by a foreign entity. The “tax” hits

harder the less elastic is the demand for energy, and we know that the short-run price

elasticity is low. Using OPEC I as an example, the nominal import bill for petroleum

rose by $21.4 billion through the end of 1974, which represented about 1.5 percent of

1973’s GDP. If the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) was 0.9, this “tax” would

have reduced non-oil consumption by almost 1.4 percent of GDP. If standard multiplier-

accelerator effects created a peak multiplier of 1.5, the maximal hit to GDP would have

been about 2 percent, or almost twice as large as the neoclassical supply-side effect.12

Adding the two together would bring the total reduction in GDP to a touch above

3 percent, which is still far less than actually occurred.

     These calculations encompass only imported oil. But there was also an internal

redistribution within the United States, as purchasing power was transferred from energy

users to energy producers. To the extent that the latter group—e.g., oil companies and

their shareholders—had lower MPCs than the average consumer, aggregate demand

would be reduced further. And there are yet more demand-side effects from an oil shock.

For example:



12
  By comparison, Blinder (1979, pp. 84-85) cited two econometric studies—by Perry (1975) and Pierce
and Enzler (1974)—that used an early version of the MPS model to attribute approximately a 3 percent
decline in real GDP to OPEC I.


                                                                                                       15
     i. In an unindexed tax system, which we had in 1973-1974, an upward shock to the

        price level leads to bracket creep, which amounts to a fiscal tightening. Inflation

        also raises the tax rates on capital since nominal interest rates and capital gains are

        taxed, and depreciation allowances are imputed on an historic-cost (nominal) basis.

 ii. To the extent that the Federal Reserve targets the nominal money supply, an upward

        shock to the price level reduces real balances, thereby inducing a monetary

        tightening. This channel was more relevant in 1973 than it is today, since the Fed

        now targets the federal funds rate.

iii. A higher price level induces a negative wealth effect on consumer spending as both

        equity values and the real values of other financial assets decline.

iv. The large change in relative input prices renders part of the capital stock obsolete,

        resulting in accelerated scrappage (see Baily, 1981).13

 v. The huge uncertainty induced by the oil shock (and subsequent recession) may lead

        investors and purchasers of consumer durables to “pause” while the uncertainty gets

        resolved (Bernanke, 1983). In addition, until new, energy-efficient capital becomes

        available, firms may postpone their investment spending (Sims, 1981).

vi. Increased uncertainty may also induce consumers to increase precautionary saving

        (Kilian, 2007a).

        Point (ii) above raises an important issue that we will return to several times in this

paper: The impact of a supply shock on real output and inflation depends critically on

how the monetary authorities react. Monetary accommodation to mitigate the incipient

recession will produce larger effects on inflation and smaller effects on output and

employment. Monetary tightening to mitigate the increase in inflation will produce just
13
     This is, strictly speaking, a supply-side effect. But it can also reduce demand by lowering equity values.


                                                                                                             16
the opposite. This is one, though not the only, reason why responses to oil shocks vary

both across countries and across time.

2.4 “Second-round” effects

Another important issue, related of course to monetary policy, is how much “second-

round” inflation is induced by the “first-round” price-level effects of supply shocks—as,

for example, higher energy costs creep into the prices of other goods and services and

into wages.

       Regarding the price channel, Nordhaus (2007, p. 223) recently used an input-output

model to estimate that the long-run pass-through of energy costs into other consumer

prices (which include airfares, apartment rents, and so on) is 80 percent as large as the

direct effect of energy prices on the index. However, this estimate overstates the short- to

medium-run effects of an energy-price shock. For example, airfares will react quickly to

higher fuel costs, but the higher cost of the energy used to manufacture airplanes will

probably not show up in airfares for years.14 That said, there is still significant scope for

sizable second-round price effects. Indeed, as might be expected, energy-intensive

consumption goods and services posted relatively larger price increases following the

first two oil shocks.15 As evidence, the first two columns of numbers in Table 1 report

rank-correlations between energy intensity and three-year price changes for various



14
   Moreover, it matters whether an estimate of this sort is based on crude or finished energy. Using the
1992 input-output accounts, we estimate that finished energy costs accounted for 3.4 percent of non-energy
PCE, while crude energy costs only accounted for 1.5 percent (these estimates include an imputation for
the energy costs incurred in transporting and distributing consumption goods). For core PCE, the estimates
are a little smaller (3 percent and 1.3 percent, respectively). That said, this still appears to be a reasonably
large indirect effect given that the direct effect of finished energy on PCE prices (measured as the nominal
share of energy goods and services in total consumption) was 5½ percent in that year, and also given that
crude energy price changes tend to be much larger than changes in finished energy prices.
15
   In a more specialized context, Weinhagen (2006) finds evidence of significant pass-through of crude
petroleum prices into the PPIs for plastics and organic chemicals over the period 1974-2003.


                                                                                                             17
groupings of individual PCE components following OPEC I and OPEC II.16 These

correlations are similar whether one looks at total, core, non-energy, or non-

transportation components of PCE. (As is evident from the rightmost column of the

table, however, similar correlations cannot be found during the most recent runup in oil

prices—a point to which we will return in Section 5.)

       One simple way to study the pass-through question is to examine the impacts of

supply shocks on measures of core inflation, which by definition remove the mechanical

impacts of energy and food prices on headline inflation. We did this earlier in Figures 4

through 6, which showed the results of passing three different types of stylized supply

shocks through a reduced-form price-price Phillips curve.17 In this model, the effect of a

sustained increase in relative energy prices yields, after one year, an indirect effect on


16
   The rank correlation measure that we use is Kendall’s “tau-b,” which is more robust to the presence of
ties across rankings. Energy intensities are estimated using data on total crude energy requirements from
the 1972 and 1977 input-output tables. Price changes are December-over-December increases computed
over the relevant periods.
17
   No doubt, some of the effect of a supply shock in our price-price Phillips curves reflects the wage-price
spiral—indeed, the textbook way to derive a price-price equation is by substituting a wage-price Phillips
curve into a markup equation. In the case of food price pass-through, this channel is probably the main one
at work. But, as suggested by the input-output analysis above, energy is also an important intermediate
input into consumer goods production. Hence, both channels are likely being captured by the coefficients
on relative energy prices in our price-price models.


                                                                                                         18
core inflation roughly half as large as the direct effect on headline inflation. It is

important to note that, in generating Figures 4 through 6, the path of the unemployment

rate was held constant. Hence, each simulation tacitly gives the second-round effects on

core inflation with an accommodating monetary policy that prevents the supply shock

from causing a slump. (More on this shortly.)

    Figure 4 showed that the second-round effects of a temporary energy-price spike on

core inflation, while notable, are entirely transitory—disappearing after about 18 months.

Thus core inflation displays a “blip” that vanishes by itself, without any need for the

central bank to tighten—which can be thought of as justifying the policy decision to

accommodate.

    Figure 5, in which energy prices rise to a permanently higher plateau, shows another

such blip, but one that does not disappear entirely of its own accord because of the

presence of second-round effects. In this case, a central bank that does not want to see a

persistent rise in core inflation would have to tighten.

    Finally, Figure 6 shows that persistently higher energy-price inflation will lead to

persistently higher core inflation as well—although the magnitudes are small. (In the

example, a 6 percentage point increase in energy-price inflation induces less than a

1 percentage point increase in core inflation after five years.) In this case, a monetary

response may be appropriate.

    A second pass-through mechanism comes via expected inflation and wages. To

illustrate the likely magnitudes and timing, we again consider a stylized supply shock—

the 35 percent one-time jump in real energy prices shown in Figure 5—in the context of

an estimated two-equation wage-price model. The model consists of a wage-price




                                                                                            19
Phillips curve that relates wage inflation to lagged headline CPI inflation, and a markup

equation that relates core CPI inflation to trend unit labor costs. (For a detailed

description of the equations, see Appendix 2.)

         The response of this system to a jump in energy prices is shown in Figure 7.18

Qualitatively, the paths of headline and core inflation following the shock are similar to

those from the earlier exercise: Headline inflation spikes immediately but then quickly

recedes toward a core inflation rate that is persistently higher. Neither the magnitudes

nor the exact dynamics are exactly the same, of course, because the mechanisms at work

are different. In the wage-price system, higher energy prices raise headline inflation,

which feeds into wage inflation. Rising wages, in turn, raise firms’ costs, thus putting

upward pressure on core inflation. By the end of the simulation period, real wages are

rising at the same rate as before the energy price shock because the model constrains real

wages to move in line with productivity. But nominal wage growth and consumer price

inflation are persistently higher.

     Note that the time scale here is in quarters, in contrast to the monthly scale used in Figures 4 through 6.


                                                                                                                       20
     Finally, there is a countervailing force that offsets some of the “second-round”

effects we have just estimated: Each of the two oil shocks of the 1970s was associated

with a deep recession. For example, the unemployment rate rose more than

four percentage points in the recession that followed OPEC I. Such an increase in labor-

and product-market slack puts significant downward pressure on core inflation. How

much? In the simple pass-through model used for Figure 5, each point-year of higher

unemployment reduces core inflation by about ½ percentage point (on average) over the

first year and by about ¼ percentage point (on average) over the second year. Using this

estimate, the four-point run-up in unemployment would have been more than sufficient to

offset the impact of OPEC I on core inflation.19

     Of course, not all of the rise in unemployment that resulted from the 1973-75

recession can be attributed to higher oil prices. Other supply shocks also hit the economy

during this period, and there were significant swings in fiscal and monetary policy as

well. Using a VAR model, Blanchard and Gali (2007) estimate that exogenous oil-price

shocks were responsible for only about a third of the swing in real GDP.20 If we impute

one-third of the observed rise in unemployment to the oil shock, and feed this estimate

into our model, we find very little offset from slack in the year following the shock, about

a 50 percent offset in the second year, and a virtually complete offset by the end of the

third year.



19
   However, virtually all of the first-year effect on core inflation would have remained because the
unemployment rate rose relatively slowly at first.
20
   Blanchard and Gali find that the shock accounts for roughly half of the reduction in employment.
However, this overstates the effect of the shock on the unemployment rate, because Blanchard and Gali
define employment as hours worked. In addition, our calculation is actually based on historical movements
in an estimate of the unemployment gap, not the unemployment rate, to capture the fact that the rate of
unemployment consistent with stable inflation (the NAIRU) was likely rising over this period. (See
Section 2.5.)


                                                                                                      21
2.5 Lagging perceptions of productivity growth

Almost everything we have discussed up to now was already on economists’ radar

screens by the late 1970s. But there is an additional inflationary channel that virtually no

one was talking about back then: the impact of lagging perceptions of productivity

growth on inflation.

       In principle, there is no reason why inflation and productivity growth should be

systematically linked. According to simple economic theory, the trend growth rate of

real wages should equal the trend growth rate of productivity (g), making the trend

growth rate of nominal wages (w) equal to g plus the rate of inflation, π. If w = g + π,

workers receive a constant share of national income regardless of the inflation rate. And

in this frictionless and rational world, any decline in g would show up immediately as a

decline in the growth rate of real wages, with no particular implications for inflation.

         In practice, however, there are at least two perceptual channels through which a

decline in productivity growth might boost inflation. The first stems from the possibility

that a drop in the productivity growth rate is not promptly and fully reflected in real wage

gains. If workers and firms are slow to recognize that productivity growth has slowed,

they may agree on real wage increases that are too high relative to actual increases in

productivity. That would put upward pressure on unit labor costs, and hence on inflation.

High real wages would also reduce employment demand and, therefore, tend to raise the

level of unemployment consistent with stable inflation—the NAIRU.21



21
  In our empirical work, we control for changes in the NAIRU by detrending the unemployment rate with a
band-pass filter. Staiger, Stock, and Watson (2001) argue that such a measure yields an unemployment gap
that captures essentially all of the variation in labor-market slack that is relevant for inflation dynamics in a
Phillips curve. In addition, they show that the resulting trend is suggestively (and negatively) correlated
with low-frequency movements in U.S. productivity growth.


                                                                                                             22
       The second channel through which a productivity slowdown can raise inflation

arises if policymakers fail to recognize it in time. If the central bank overestimates the

growth rate of potential output—that is, if it fails to recognize that g has fallen—it will

target a rate of aggregate demand growth that is too high, leading to increasing inflation.

Relatedly, since the abovementioned mistakes by workers and firms will raise the

NAIRU, policymakers may aim for a level of labor market slack that results in

accelerating prices.

       Arguably, both of these channels were at work during the Great Stagflation,

especially the first episode. Productivity growth actually began to slow in the late 1960s

as the expansion of the preceding decade came to an end. By the time of OPEC I, trend

productivity growth had moved about a percentage point below the rate that had

prevailed over the preceding twenty years. The failure of real wage growth to adjust

downward can be seen in the behavior of labor’s share of income over this period

(Figure 8). Labor’s share started to move higher in the late 1960s and spiked during the

1969-70 recession—a pattern typically seen during an economic downturn. But rather

than moving back down, labor’s share remained high over the 1970s and even appears to

have trended upward slightly, since each successive cyclical peak was higher than the

preceding one.

Note: Total compensation, nonfinancial corporate sector, divided by nominal nonfinancial corporate output.



         Regarding policy errors over the period, Orphanides (2003) has argued

persuasively that contemporaneous estimates of the output gap (and, by extension, of the

NAIRU) were far too optimistic. In addition, the natural rate of unemployment was itself

drifting upward over the period, partly as a result of the increased entry of young baby

boomers and women into the labor force. These demographic developments also appear

to have eluded policymakers at the time. Besides resulting in an inflationary monetary

policy, these mis-estimates of the output gap may have raised the perceived cost of

bringing inflation under control. If policymakers see little reduction in inflation despite

what they perceive to be a large margin of slack, they may erroneously conclude that the

sacrifice ratio is higher than it really is.




                                                                                                                      24
        In brief, when actual productivity decelerated in the early 1970s, sluggish

adjustment of beliefs about productivity growth probably became a source of stagflation

in its own right.

        Blinder and Yellen (2001) and Ball and Moffitt (2001) turned this argument on its

head to suggest that the opposite happened after the speedup in productivity growth in the

mid-1990s—and that a surprising disinflation ensued. In support of this notion, Figure 8

shows that labor’s share fell to a 30-year low over this period as real wage gains lagged

far behind productivity growth.22 In contrast to the experience of the 1970s, however,

policymakers (specifically, Alan Greenspan) recognized the productivity acceleration

early enough to prevent the Fed from running an inappropriately tight monetary policy.23




3. Reexamining the evidence on the Great Inflation

The supply-shock “story” of the Great Inflation, which was summarized in

points 1 through 6 of Section 1, emphasizes four salient empirical observations:

     1. The Great Inflation was actually two episodes of sharply higher inflation, each of

        which was followed quickly by a disinflation—a fact we emphasized in discussing

        Figure 1. That inflation receded notably and quickly in the 1975-1977 period, and

        then again after 1980, is an important part of the story—one that is too often

        ignored.24




22
   Unfortunately, labor’s share becomes harder to read after the late 1990s because of the surge in stock
option exercises that occurred around that time.
23
   See Blinder and Yellen (2001) and Meyer (2004).
24
   For example, models generating “inflation bias” became popular in the 1980s. But they can explain only
why inflation is too high, not the ups, and certainly not the downs. For an attempt, see Ireland (1999).


                                                                                                       25
     2. Blinder (1979, 1982) emphasized the strong symmetry apparent in the two

        inflation “hills” of Figure 1. In each case, the graph provides circumstantial

        evidence that something—to wit, the supply shocks—“came and went.”

     3. Core inflation rose and fell, but by less than headline inflation in each direction.

        That observation is also consistent with the notion that each episode was

        dominated by food and/or energy shocks that then disappeared.25

     4. Ignoring the two inflation “hills,” core inflation rises from about four percent in

        the late 1960s and early 1970s to around six percent in the mid-to-late 1970s, but

        then ends up back at four percent in the mid-to-late 1980s.26

Let us now examine this story in more detail.

3.1 The initial shocks

The near-symmetry point (number 2 above) is an important part of the supply-shock

story. Table 2 displays three measures of consumer price inflation over the years

1972-1982: the current-methods CPI, the published PCE deflator, and the deflator for

market-based PCE.27 For each price measure, the table gives both headline and core

inflation rates. The near symmetry of the rise and fall of inflation in the two episodes is

apparent. In fact, these numbers correspond very closely to a similar table constructed by

Blinder (1982, Table 12.2, p. 265) from the data available then to make the same point.28


25
   This is not meant to deny that the deep recessions that followed OPEC I and OPEC II brought both core
and headline inflation down further. They did.
26
   From 1985 through 1990, core PCE inflation averaged 3.9 percent per year.
27
   Market-based PCE is intended to capture market transactions for which actual prices are paid—with the
exception of owner-occupied housing, which is included in market-based PCE. It is therefore more
comparable to, though by no means identical to, the CPI than the standard PCE deflator. (As discussed in
Appendix 1, we construct the market-based PCE deflator ourselves prior to 1997.) In the 1960s and 1970s,
market-based goods and services represented about 90 percent of total nominal PCE and about 87 percent
of the core; currently, the corresponding shares are 85 and 81 percent.
28
   The only notable difference between these data and Blinder’s is that the latter included the effects of
mortgage interest rates (we discuss this influence later).


                                                                                                       26
Thus, our first conclusion is that historical data revisions have not changed the basic

story of two nearly symmetrical episodes of rising and then falling inflation.29

Note: Inflation rates computed as percent changes. The CPI data are expressed on a methodologically
consistent basis, December over December. MPCE is a measure of market-based PCE prices (see
Appendix 1 for details). PCE and MPCE inflation rates are Q4-over-Q4 changes.



     Simply eyeballing these data suggests that one or more shocks pushed inflation up

and then disappeared. In the first episode, the headline inflation rate jumped from about

3 percent in 1972 up to around 11 percent in 1974, and then fell back to about 5 percent

by 1976. In the second, it rose from about 6½ percent in 1977 to around 10-11 percent in

1979 and 1980, and then dropped back to 5 percent or so by 1982. But this is not an

unobserved-components exercise in which the econometrician must use statistical

techniques to identify unseen shocks. The shocks were plainly visible, and we know

precisely what they were: oil, food, and price controls. We take them up in turn.




29
  Blinder (1979, 1982) had to construct PCE minus food and energy on his own. Core PCE is now an
official BEA series, and it matches Blinder’s original construction very closely.


                                                                                                      27
3.1.1 The oil price shocks of 1973-1974 and 1979-1981

Since the two OPEC shocks are well-known and have been studied extensively, we can

be brief. Figure 9 displays the behavior of PCE energy inflation from 1968 to 1985.

       OPEC I, which resembled the jump to a higher plateau shown in Figure 5(a), was

kicked off by the so-called Arab oil embargo in October 1973, which roughly quadrupled

the OPEC price of crude.30 But given transportation costs and the blending of lower-

price domestic crude (which then predominated) with imported oil, the composite U.S.

refiners’ acquisition cost (RAC) “only” doubled. As one example of the retail price

impact, the CPI for motor fuel rose 42 percent between September 1973 and May 1974,

which is a 68 percent annual rate. At the macro level, energy directly added

30
  See Yergin (1993, chapters 29-30) for an historical account, and Adelman (1995, chapter 5) for a detailed
analysis.


                                                                                                        28
2½ percentage points to the annualized PCE inflation rate during the last quarter of 1973

and the first two quarters of 1974. Then energy ceased being an engine of inflation as the

real price of crude oil remained roughly flat from 1974 until late 1978 (see Figure 3).

        OPEC II came when the 1978-1979 revolution in Iran, followed by the 1980

invasion of Iran by Iraq, sent crude prices skyrocketing again.31 From 1978 to 1981, the

composite RAC nearly tripled. But unlike OPEC I, OPEC II proved to be short-lived,

looking much more like the price spike in Figure 4(a) than the jump to a higher plateau in

Figure 5(a). The composite RAC fell from its 1981 peak ($35.24 per barrel) to a trough

in 1986 ($14.55 per barrel) that was not much above its 1978 average ($12.46 per barrel).

It did not persistently rise above $30 per barrel (in nominal terms) until 2004, and it only

re-attained its 1981 real price peak in late 2007.

        Two points are worth emphasizing for later reference, especially in Section 4, where

we will examine the claims that inflationary monetary policy caused the oil shocks, rather

than the other way around. First, it should be obvious that both OPEC shocks were set in

motion by geopolitical events that cannot possibly be attributed to, say, money growth in

the U.S. or even to world economic growth.32

        Second, notice how sharply price increases are damped as we move up the stage-of-

processing chain from crude oil prices to overall inflation. In the case of OPEC I, a

300 percent increase in crude prices led to a 100 percent increase in refiners’ acquisition

costs, and thence to a 45 percent (annualized) increase in total retail energy prices, and

finally to a 2½ percentage point increase in overall inflation. If OPEC had,

hypothetically, reacted by restoring the real value of its crude oil, it would have raised


31
     See Yergin (1993, chapters 33-34) and Adelman (1995, chapter 6).
32
     This is not meant to deny that strong world growth helped OPEC make the price increases stick.


                                                                                                      29
prices by another 2½ percent. The subsequent reactions of overall US inflation would

have amounted to rounding error. Thus, observers in 2006-2008 who fretted about the

feedback loop from U.S. inflation back to OPEC pricing (via the exchange rate, say)

should have been thinking harder about magnitudes.

3.1.2 The food price shocks of 1973-1974 and 1978-1980

We all remember the big oil shocks, but many economists seem to have forgotten that

each of the two inflationary episodes also featured a sizable food-price shock. The two

food shocks are apparent in Figure 10. Since food has a much higher weight in the price

indexes than energy, ignoring them constitutes a major omission.33

                                                                                                        30
     At the retail level, the 1973-1974 food-price shock corresponded pretty closely to the

24 calendar months of those two years. The CPI for food rose 20.1 percent from

December 1972 to December 1973 and another 12.1 percent from December 1973 to

December 1974. Compared to the 4.6 percent rate in the year preceding the shock or the

6.7 percent rate in the year following it, that represents a sharp though temporary burst of

food inflation. In terms of their contribution to overall inflation, food prices added

4½ percentage points to headline inflation in 1973, and a touch less than 3 percentage

points in 1974 (and nothing directly to core inflation).34

     What happened to cause this stunning turn of events? Seemingly everything—

including corn blight, crop failures and depleted inventories in many parts of the world

(especially for grains), and the then-famous disappearance of the Peruvian anchovies.35

     The 1978-1980 food shock was less dramatic, but it lasted longer and was far too

large to ignore—even though most economists have managed to do so. The

aforementioned food component of the CPI rose 11.4 percent in 1978, and 10.3 percent in

both 1979 and 1980, before falling back to 4.4 percent in 1981. Food price inflation

contributed 2 percentage points to overall inflation in 1978, and 1¾ percentage points in

both 1979 and 1980.36 Weather and disease, of course, explained most of the food

problems. Again, we are deeply skeptical that agricultural diseases, bad weather, and the

hog cycle were lagged effects of monetary policy.


34
   The corresponding contribution of food prices to headline PCE price inflation was 3.1 percentage points
in 1973 and 2.7 percentage points in 1974. Note that the core PCE deflator removes food and alcoholic
beverages from the headline index; this is also the definition we use in discussing the contribution of
“food” to headline PCE inflation.
35
   See Bosworth and Lawrence (1982, pp. 88-107) for a detailed discussion.
36
   Food’s relative importance in the CPI dropped in 1977 (to 17.7 percent of the overall index) with the
introduction of the all-urban CPI-U. (Prior to this time, the published CPI only covered urban wage
earners.) Food continued to represent about 20 percent of PCE; the corresponding contributions of food to
PCE price inflation over the three years 1978-80 were 2.1, 1.9, and 2.0 percentage points, respectively.


                                                                                                        31
3.1.3 The end of price controls, 1973-1974

A third shock—the removal of wage and price controls in stages starting in 1973—also

made an important contribution to the 1973-1974 burst of inflation, but was often ignored

in the subsequent economic literature.37 Unlike OPEC and the weather, the 1971-1974

price controls might conceivably be viewed as a lagged effect of earlier inflation. But

other episodes of inflation in peacetime, both before and since, were not followed by

controls. So we prefer to view the price controls more as a part of Richard Nixon’s

re-election campaign than as an endogenous response to past inflation.

     Price controls were first put in place on August 15, 1971, starting with a short-term

freeze. As measured by the fraction of the CPI that was subject to controls, they had their

maximum effect in the period from September 1971 to April 1973. After that, they began

to be dismantled in stages, and were completely removed by May 1974.38 The two

biggest doses of decontrol came in July-September 1973 and February-May 1974. Notice

how well the timing of decontrol aligns with the first of the two inflation hills.

     It is obvious that removing price controls—thereby letting prices that were held

artificially low bounce back to equilibrium levels—should result in a sudden burst of

inflation that naturally peters out. In Figure 11, which illustrates the effect of controls in

a single market, the controlled price, Pc, is held below the equilibrium price, P*, which

forces the market to equilibrate at point A (with excess demand) rather than at point E.

When controls are lifted, the market quickly moves from point A to point E. If the

   Their removal was briefly interrupted by “Freeze II” in the summer of 1973.

     Blinder and Newton (1981) used this simple idea—together with a monthly time

series that they constructed for the fraction of the CPI under price controls—to assess the

impact of controls on U.S. inflation in the 1970s. They fit wage-price systems with two

different measures of aggregate demand, and then ran simulations that allowed them to

estimate both the reduction in core inflation that resulted from the controls and the

increase in inflation that occurred when the controls were lifted. They found that the

maximum negative effect of price controls on the core price level came in February 1974;

its estimated magnitude was 3.1 or 4.2 percent, depending on the model used. In their


39
   For example, if Δ = 0.07 and the gap is closed in three months, the item-specific annualized inflation rate
is 31 percent. Blinder and Newton (1981) estimated the typical value of Δ to range from 0.062 to 0.088,
depending on the specification of their wage-price system. In our own replication of Blinder and Newton’s
work (discussed below), we obtain estimates for this parameter that range from 0.062 to 0.075, remarkably
similar to their estimates.


                                                                                                           33
first specification, the estimated contribution that controls made to reducing the price

level dropped to zero by October 1974—implying that decontrol raised the annual rate of

core CPI inflation during the February-October 1974 period by a stunning 4.6 percentage

points. In their second specification, the estimated price level impact declined only to

−2.2 percent by October, which implies a 3 percentage point contribution to annualized

core inflation. In both cases, the estimated inflation impacts were negligible after

October 1974.40

     Panel A of Table 3 reproduces results from Blinder and Newton (1981, Table 4,

p. 20). They observed that core CPI inflation reached a double-digit “peak” rate over the

eight months from February to October 1974, with much lower inflation rates over the

eight-month periods either immediately before or immediately after. Specifically, in the

CPI data that were available to Blinder and Newton at the time, the run-up in core

inflation from the pre-peak period to the peak was 6.8 percentage points, and the

subsequent decline from peak to post-peak was 4.9 percentage points (line 2 in the table).

According to their first model, lifting price controls accounted for virtually the entire

swing in core inflation (see line 4 of the table); in their second model, controls accounted

for about half (line 6).

     To take a fresh look at this old finding, we used the Blinder-Newton time series for

the fraction of the CPI under controls in a monthly price-price Phillips curve model fit to

the current-methods core CPI. (Appendix 2 provides details on the model’s

specification.) The current-methods CPI suggests a slightly different dating for the

  However, the first model found roughly a zero long-run effect on the price level, while the second found
that price controls permanently reduced the price level by about 2.4 percent.

November of 1974, with nine-month pre- and post-peak periods defined symmetrically.

rates; rates using current data are annualized log differences. All contributions and changes are given in
percentage points.



     Panel B of Table 3 summarizes our updated results. First, as can be seen from line 8

of the table, our revised definition of the peak inflation period implies a pre- and post-

peak swing that is not too different from what Blinder and Newton obtained with their




                                                                                                        35
dating.41 Second, the estimated contribution of controls to the swing in core inflation that

we find (line 10) implies that controls account for more than two-thirds of the increase in

core CPI inflation and nearly half of its subsequent decline—magnitudes that are roughly

comparable to what Blinder and Newton found with their second specification. These

updated results verify that price controls made significant contributions to both sides of

the first inflation “hill.” And they show that anyone who tries to explain the rise and fall

of core inflation over the 1972-1975 period without paying careful attention to price

controls is missing something very important.

3.1.4 The mis-measurement of homeownership costs, 1979-1980

Our last important special factor during the Great Inflation was not a shock at all, but

rather a measurement problem. We mention it briefly here only for completeness.

     Prior to January 1983, the nominal mortgage interest rate was among the prices

included in the CPI, and it had a large weight. Since the nominal mortgage rate, R,

depends inter alia on expected inflation, R = r + πe, and since πe surely reacts to π, this

odd treatment created a dynamic feedback loop within the measurement system: Any

increase (decrease) in π would raise (lower) R, which would in turn feed back into yet-

higher (lower) measured π. When mortgage rates fluctuated a lot, as they did in the late

1970s and early 1980s, this quirk induced a great deal of volatility in measured

inflation—which is why the Bureau of Labor Statistics changed its procedure for

measuring the price of owner-occupied housing services in 1983. Specifically, Blinder

(1982, p. 273) showed that mortgage interest costs added about 2½ percentage points to

CPI inflation in both 1979 and 1980.

41
  The levels and changes in inflation given in lines 7 and 8 of the table differ from Blinder and Newton’s
for three reasons: We use a current-methods CPI, we use a slightly longer peak period, and we compute the
inflation rate as an annualized log change.


                                                                                                       36
     Since we use the current-methods CPI here, this measurement problem disappears.

Indeed, that is the main reason why the data shown in Figure 1 display a smaller inflation

“hill” in 1978-1980 than the data showed in real time.42

3.2 The pass-through of food and energy shocks into core inflation

One key question about supply shocks is how they filter into other prices (including

wages), thereby inducing “second-round” effects. In Section 2, we used an estimated

price-price Phillips curve (described in Appendix 2) to show how some highly stylized

energy shocks would pass through into core inflation. We now perform that same

exercise using the time series on actual food and energy shocks during 1973-1980 period.

The counterfactual question to which we seek an answer is this: How different would the

Great Inflation (1972-1982) have been if the food and energy shocks had never occurred?

     To do so, we compare a baseline path for core inflation, obtained by inputting the

actual behavior of food and energy prices, with a counterfactual path in which food and

energy prices grow steadily at 4 percent and 3 percent per annum respectively. We

perform the simulations separately for current-methods core CPI inflation (Figure 12) and

market-based core PCE inflation (Figure 13). In each figure, the upper panel plots actual

inflation together with the baseline and counterfactual paths, while the lower panel shows

the difference between the two paths (that is, the estimated contribution of food and

energy price pass-through to core inflation).




42
  Consistent with Blinder’s (1982) calculation, the difference in annualized inflation rates between the
officially published CPI-U and an experimental CPI that uses a rental-equivalence approach to recalculate
the owner-occupied housing component of the index (the CPI-U-X1) is 2¼ percentage points over the two-
year period from May 1978 to May 1980. (On a twelve-month-change basis, the differential reaches a peak
of 3¼ percentage points in June 1980.)


                                                                                                      37

     In the 1973-1974 episode, the simulations indicate that pass-through of food and

energy prices added about 2½ percentage points to core CPI inflation and about

1½ percentage points to core market-based PCE inflation.43 And in both cases, core

inflation remained above its pre-shock level after the supply shocks dissipated, precisely

as suggested by Figure 5. In the 1978-1980 episode, the simulations imply that pass-

through of the supply shocks contributed about 3 percentage points to core inflation by

either measure. In this period, the energy shock was larger, and the food price shock

persisted longer.

     A second way to estimate pass-through is to simulate a two-equation wage-price

system. As the first step, we estimate a wage-price Phillips curve in which wage inflation

depends on headline price inflation, generate fitted values using actual food and energy

inflation, and compare this to the fitted values that obtain under the counterfactual path

for food and energy inflation. The results are shown in the upper panel of Figure 14; as

can be seen, wage inflation would have been roughly flat over much of this period had

headline inflation not been boosted by the food and energy price shocks.




43
   The difference between the two estimates mainly reflects the fact that the CPI for food rose faster than
the PCE-based measure of food price inflation. Food prices also receive a slightly smaller coefficient in the
PCE model.

     As was shown in the stylized example in Section 2.4, the lower unit labor costs that

result from less wage inflation lead to lower core price inflation as well. This in turn puts

additional downward pressure on wage inflation, leading to further reductions in core

inflation, and so on. These familiar wage-price interactions are captured by a two-

equation system consisting of the aforementioned wage-price Phillips curve and a

markup equation relating core CPI inflation to unit labor cost growth.44 The results are

shown in the lower panel of Figure 14, which plots actual core CPI inflation against two

simulated paths from the full wage-price system. The two simulations differ in their

assumptions about food and energy prices. As can be seen in the figure, the model

implies a comparably large pass-through of food and energy prices into core inflation,

despite the fact that these shocks now affect the core only to the extent that they feed into

wages.

3.3 The effect of the business cycle

As we have mentioned repeatedly, oil and food shocks are expected to be contractionary

as well as inflationary. But by how much? And by how much would we expect the

resulting recessions to mitigate the inflationary consequences of the shocks? To obtain

quantitative answers, we use a small structural VAR model to estimate how much of the

increase in unemployment that followed the energy and food shocks can be attributed to

them. Our baseline VAR includes core PCE inflation, the unemployment rate, the

weighted sum of relative (to core) food and energy price inflation, and the federal funds

rate, with the variables ordered so that inflation is at the top of the ordering and the




44
  We also considered a version of the model that used the market-based PCE price index; the results were
essentially similar. (Details of both models’ specifications are in Appendix 2.)


                                                                                                      42
federal funds rate is at the bottom.45 We also consider an augmented system in which

commodity price inflation (measured by the log change in the crude PPI) is included after

the food and energy price term and before the funds rate.

         To assess the contribution of the supply shocks to the 1973-75 and 1980-82

recessions, we utilize a standard variance decomposition technique to apportion actual

movements in the unemployment rate into a baseline path (the forecast implied by the

VAR with all shocks set to zero) and the contributions of each stochastic shock. The

contributions of the shocks, of course, reflect the full dynamic structure of the VAR. For

example, one key way in which a positive shock to food and energy price inflation raises

unemployment is through its effect on the federal funds rate (higher inflation results in a

higher funds rate, which reduces activity).46

         The results from the two VAR models for the 1973-75 and 1980-82 recessions are

shown in Figures 15 and 16, respectively. For each specification, the figure shows the

baseline forecast for the unemployment rate along with the estimated effects of the food

and energy shocks in the left-hand panels and the combined effects of the commodity,

food, and energy shocks in the right-hand panels. Taken together, the four figures show

that the models attribute a significant share of the increases in unemployment to the

supply shocks that occurred in both recessions. But they also remind us that the effects

are long delayed. In the 1973-75 episode, the supply shocks only start to have

appreciable effects on the unemployment rate after the end of 1974. Similarly, the supply



45
   Specifically, the food and energy term is defined as the difference between headline and core PCE
inflation. It is straightforward to demonstrate that this equals the weighted sum of relative food and energy
inflation, where the relatives are expressed in terms of core inflation and the weights are the shares of food
and energy in the total index.

shocks make a relatively small contribution to unemployment in the first year of the

1980-82 downturns.

            One important implication of this familiar lag pattern is that the recessions that

followed each supply shock came after most of the inflation damage was already done.

While the two recessions no doubt played roles in the downsides of each inflation hill in




                                                                                                                                               44
Figure 1 (and thereafter), they played little role in limiting the upsides.47 Thus, since our

focus is on explaining the two hills, the offset from economic slack is small enough to be

ignored.

     On this point, our results are consistent with recent work of Blanchard and

Gali (2007), who use a VAR model in which oil prices are replaced by a broader measure

of crude materials prices to consider the contributions of materials price shocks to output

fluctuations. For the 1973-75 recession, they find that these shocks account for about

half of the swing in real GDP, with the biggest contribution coming at roughly the same

time as the trough in output—which is comparable to the effect that we find in our

baseline VAR (see panel A of Figure 15). For the back-to-back recessions of 1980-82,

the Blanchard-Gali model attributes a larger fraction (perhaps two-thirds) of the swing in

output to materials price shocks. But actual output falls faster in 1980 than their model

predicts, with the most rapid predicted declines in output occurring in 1981. Once again,

this seems consistent with our finding of only a small effect.

3.4 Putting the pieces together

Table 4 is a rough—and deliberately impressionistic—summary of the findings of this

long section. It puts together the estimated contributions to headline inflation of the two

energy shocks (Section 3.1.1), the two food shocks (Section 3.1.2), their pass-through

into core inflation (Section 3.2), and the end of price controls (Section 3.1.3). In coming

up with these numbers, we roughly average our findings both over the two different price

indexes (CPI and PCE) and over time—and we stick to round numbers. Thus we view


47
  For the 1973-75 recession, this conclusion is strengthened by the observation that the NAIRU was likely
increasing rapidly over much or all of this period. For example, our simple estimate of trend
unemployment rises nearly a percentage point from the end of 1973 to the end of 1975. (Note that the trend
continues to rise—albeit at a slower rate—until the start of the 1980s.)


                                                                                                       45

        The basic finding is dramatic, although it should come as no surprise at this point.

For each of the two inflation hills shown in Figure 1, the special factors account for much

more than 100 percent of the rise (and subsequent fall) of headline inflation.

        Since we have emphasized that the Great Inflation was really the Great Stagflation,

we also note that the numbers underlying Figure 15 imply that roughly 60 percent of the

run-up in unemployment in the 1973-75 recession, and roughly 45 percent of the run-up

in the back-to-back recessions of 1980-82, can be attributed to the supply shocks.



4. Arguments against the supply-shock explanation

Four related sets of arguments have been raised against the supply-shock explanation of

the Great Stagflation. Each evokes, in its own way, shadows of the classical dichotomy:

that real phenomena cannot affect inflation. But since they are subtly different, we take

each one up in turn.




                                                                                               46
4.1 Relative price shocks cannot affect absolute prices.

The simplest argument, which was raised immediately after OPEC I, holds that it is

logically fallacious to believe that a change in a relative price can be a source of

generalized inflation. Instead, a rise in the relative price of energy (PE/P) should be

effectuated by some combination of higher nominal prices for energy products (PE) and

lower nominal prices for a variety of other things (call these PO, for “other” prices).

There is no reason for the overall price level, P = ωPE + (1−ω)PO, to rise unless the

money supply does. As Milton Friedman (1975) asked at the time in a much-quoted

Newsweek column, “Why should the average level of all prices be affected significantly

by changes in the prices of some things relative to others?”48

     This attitude, of course, reflects pre-Keynesian thinking. Ever since the Keynesian

revolution, most (but not all) economists have believed in pervasive nominal price and

wage rigidities, so that relative price increases can and do lead to a higher price level—

as, for example, when PE rises and PO does not fall. Furthermore, if one of the sticky

nominal prices is the nominal wage, then real wages will get stuck too high for a while,

causing unemployment.

     We find it remarkable that the classical dichotomy still has such a hold on the minds

of economists. Indeed, as recently as 2006, Ball made much the same argument in a

different context; namely, that globalization cannot possibly affect inflation because it is

fundamentally a series of real events. A similar view underpins Barsky and

Kilian’s (2002) attempt to re-write the history of the Great Inflation. They argue that oil

48
  In the next sentence—which is never quoted—Friedman provided a partial answer: “Thanks to delays in
adjustment, the rapid rises in oil and food prices may have temporarily raised the rate of inflation
somewhat.” As with so many “strong monetarist” positions, the question boils down to one of degree, not
direction.


                                                                                                    47
price shocks can affect “gross output price measures such as the CPI, but not necessarily

the price of value added” (such as the GDP price index). We have already studied one

counterargument: The wage-price spiral provides an obvious channel through which

higher food and energy prices can affect domestic output prices, even if food and energy

are both imported.49

     One way to conceptualize this debate is to recognize that, with sticky wages and

prices, the causation between inflation and relative-price changes undoubtedly runs in

both directions. On the one hand, since some prices are stickier than others, an

inflationary demand shock will induce changes in relative prices. On the other hand, a

supply shock that requires a large change in some relative price(s) can be a source of

overall inflation because other prices do not fall easily. The empirical question then

becomes: Which channel is quantitatively more important in practice? We think the

answer is obvious, especially for the years of the Great Inflation.

     Taylor (1981) noticed years ago that inflation accelerated in the late 1960s with low

relative price variability, but then accelerated much more in the 1970s with high relative

price variability. He attributed the first acceleration to demand shocks and the second to

supply shocks—precisely as we do. Based on his econometric investigation, he

concluded that the data suggest “a causal ordering in which relative price variability (due

to exogenous supply shocks) is the main reason for variability in the overall inflation

rate” (p. 69, emphasis added).

     Fourteen years later, focusing on the importance of the skewness rather than the

variance (of relative price changes) in a menu-cost model of price stickiness, Ball and

49
  See Blanchard (2002). In addition, the proposition that intermediate price increases (such as a rise in the
price of oil) can have no effect on a value-added deflator only holds true under perfect competition, as
Rotemberg and Woodford (1996) discuss.


                                                                                                          48
Mankiw (1995) argued for causation running from higher skewness (e.g., very large

increases in a few prices) to higher average inflation.50 They pointed in particular to the

extreme skewness of relative price changes in the years 1973-1974, 1979-1980, and 1986

(their sample ended in 1989). To Ball and Mankiw (1995, p. 190), “the explanation for

these episodes is obvious: OPEC…The direction of causation is clear: exogenous events

in the Middle East induced skewness in the distribution of relative prices, which led to

changes in the U.S. inflation rate” (emphasis again added). This seems obvious to us,

too, and we fail to see why some economists are so intent on denying the obvious.

4.2 “Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.”

Friedman’s famous dictum holds that an economy does not produce rising inflation

without an increase in the growth rate of the money supply. And, indeed, he and his

disciples emphasized this point in arguing for a tightening of monetary policy at the time

of OPEC I. In this view, supply shocks could not have been the main culprit explaining

the surge in inflation. It must have been excessive money growth.

     This is neither the time nor the place to document and discuss the profound

disconnect between inflation and measured money growth since the 1970s. The literature

on this issue is vast, but not much of it is recent because the issue was resolved years ago.

However, one should not read too much into this dismissal of “the Ms”: After all,

“money growth” and “monetary policy” are not synonymous. We would certainly never

claim that a central bank’s reactions have nothing to do with the propagation of the

inflationary impact of a supply shock.


50
   Not everyone agreed with their interpretation. For example, Balke and Wynne (2000) suggested that an
alternative theoretical model with flexible prices and suitably distributed technology shocks could give rise
to a similar relation, while Bryan and Cecchetti (1999) argued that the statistical correlation between mean
inflation and skewness is biased upward in small samples.


                                                                                                          49
4.3 The Fed’s reactions make supply shocks contractionary.

Indeed, it has long been recognized that the central bank’s reaction function exerts a

strong—some might even say determinative—influence on the inflationary consequences

of any shock, whether it comes from the demand or the supply side.51 Refer back to the

aggregate supply and demand diagram in Figure 2—which, we now assume, depicts what

happens when the central bank holds the money supply constant. A more

accommodative monetary policy, designed to cushion the impact on output, would shift

the aggregate demand curve outward, causing more inflation. A tighter monetary policy,

designed to limit the inflationary consequences of the supply shock, would shift the

aggregate demand curve inward, causing a larger output decline. This is simple stuff that

every Economics 101 student learns—at least at Princeton.

     Bernanke, Gertler, and Watson (1997) accept the notion that oil shocks are

inflationary, but they dispute the idea that they are recessionary per se. Instead, they use

VAR-based evidence to argue that it is the central bank’s reactions—to wit, tightening

monetary policy to fight inflation—that causes the ensuing recessions. In their words,

“…the endogenous monetary policy response can account for a very substantial portion

(in some cases, nearly all) of the depressing effects of oil shocks on the real economy”

(p. 94).

     In some sense, we have no need to dispute their proposition. After all,

Bernanke et al. agree that exogenous adverse oil shocks lead to both higher inflation and

slower real growth; they just attribute the latter to the Fed’s monetary policy response

rather than to OPEC directly. And we noted earlier that the pure neoclassical effects of


51
  Some early papers on this subject, as it pertains to oil shocks, include Gordon (1975), Phelps (1978), and
Blinder (1981).


                                                                                                         50
oil shocks are far too small to explain actual events; large demand-side effects are

necessary to explain the ensuing recessions.

     However, the Bernanke et al. analysis of the two big oil shocks has been criticized

by Hamilton and Herrera (2004) on a couple of grounds. First, Hamilton and Herrera

argue that Bernanke et al.’s conclusions are based on unrealistic counterfactual

assumptions—e.g., very large changes in monetary policy—whose effects are unlikely to

be captured well by a VAR estimated on historical data. Second, they argue that

Bernanke et al.’s estimated real effects of oil shocks are too small; alternative estimates

imply that oil shocks continue to have contractionary effects of their own, even after

controlling for monetary policy.52

     And there are other entrants in this debate. Leduc and Sill (2004) use a calibrated

model to argue that roughly 40 percent of the observed drop in output after an oil shock is

attributable to the monetary policy response, while Carlstrom and Fuerst (2006) use an

alternative theoretical framework to conclude that a smaller amount (perhaps none) of the

drop in output is due to monetary policy. After reviewing the literature, Kilian (2007a,

p. 25) concludes that “how much the Fed’s endogenous response to higher oil prices

contributed to the subsequent economic declines still remains unresolved.”

     Stepping back from the detail, the central empirical question here is the degree to

which the contractionary effects of the supply shocks were exacerbated or mitigated by

tighter or looser monetary policy. To investigate this issue, we reprise the structural

VAR models that we used earlier in Section 3.3. In these models, a significant portion of

the increase in the federal funds rate that follows an inflationary supply shock is offset by

52
  In their reply to Hamilton and Herrera, Bernanke et al. (2004) consider an alternative model and find that
the response of monetary policy to an oil shock still accounts for roughly half of the shock’s real impact.
This is less than their original estimate, though still economically significant.


                                                                                                         51
the subsequent rise in unemployment, as increasing slack induces an easing of monetary

policy. We therefore consider a counterfactual specification in which the policy rate is

constrained not to respond to unemployment. We focus on our four-variable VAR, since

this model attributes relatively more of the increase in unemployment over the 1973-75

recession to the supply shocks.53

     Figure 17 depicts the responses of unemployment and core inflation under the two

specifications following a sequence of supply shocks like those seen in 1973-74. As is

evident from panel A, the Fed’s accommodation of the shock (defined here as the

reduction in the federal funds rate that the VAR attributes to the unemployment increase

that results from the shock) has a large effect on the path of unemployment. Importantly,

however, most of the impact on the unemployment rate comes some time after the

recession because of the long lags between changes in the funds rate and changes in

unemployment. Panel B shows the effects on core inflation under the two alternatives;

accommodating the shock results in a core inflation rate that is nearly ¾ percentage point

higher by the end of the simulation period.54




53
   The VAR system becomes very unstable when the response of the federal funds rate to unemployment is
shut off. We therefore detrend the unemployment rate before including it in the VAR. However, we add
the trend back in Figure 17 in order to make the simulated series comparable to the actual unemployment
rate.
54
   We would not want to push these results too hard. As our discussion of Bernanke, Gertler, and
Watson (1997) makes clear, there are important econometric issues associated with an experiment of this
sort. For example, our “no accommodation” scenario implies a federal funds rate that is on average more
than 200 basis points higher than the baseline over the entire simulation period. At best, then, this exercise
should be viewed as suggesting a likely order of magnitude for the effect of monetary accommodation
following the 1973-74 shocks.

4.4 Monetary policy, not supply shocks, caused the Great Inflation

Notice that the Bernanke, Gertler, and Watson (1997) critique does not dispute the idea

that exogenous increases in the price of oil set in motion reactions, including those of the

Fed, that resulted in both inflation and recession. Their quarrel is only with the notion

that higher oil prices per se, rather than tighter monetary policy, caused the recessions

that followed OPEC I and OPEC II.

       The final version of the monetary-policy criticism of the supply-shock explanation of

the Great Inflation goes a step further—a step too far, in our view. This criticism has

been expressed in at least three different ways. What they have in common is that each

lays the blame for the Great Inflation squarely at monetary policy’s door. In its strongest

form—which we consider first—the criticism argues that the jumps in oil prices in

1973-74 and again in 1979-80 were not really “exogenous,” but rather were largely

reactions to previous inflationary monetary policies.




                                                                                                                       53
4.4.1. Barsky and Kilian (2002)

In the Barsky-Kilian (2002) variant, expansionary monetary policies in the U.S. and other

countries led both to the aggregate inflation we observed in the 1970s and 1980s and to

increases in world commodity prices—including the price of oil. In words that evoke

what Friedman and other monetarists were saying at the time, they claim that “in the

1970s the rise in oil prices…was in significant measure a response to macroeconomic

forces, ultimately driven by monetary conditions” (p. 139).

       We would never claim that the state of world demand, of which a non-trivial share

emanates from the U.S., is irrelevant to OPEC’s ability to push through price increases

and make them stick. So there must be some causal link from prior U.S. monetary policy

to oil prices. The dispute is about magnitudes. Like Taylor (1981), Ball and

Mankiw (1995), Gordon (in various papers), and many other observers, we can’t help

thinking that geopolitical factors were far more important in October 1973 than the state

of world aggregate demand—which in any case fell sharply in 1974. In particular, should

we ignore the fact that OPEC I came right after the Yom Kippur War? (Just a

coincidence?) Or that OPEC’s oil output fell rather than rose after the shock—suggesting

that it was supply rather than demand driven?

       Indeed, a close reading of the history of the period suggests that the main effect of

the OPEC I production cuts, which were neither exceptionally large nor long-lasting, was

to create significant uncertainties about oil supply, which induced a surge in

precautionary demand for oil.55 Similarly, the rise in prices associated with the second

OPEC shock appears to have been driven more by fear of future shortages than by actual

                                                                                               54
reductions in supply.56 But from a macroeconomic perspective, these are nevertheless

“exogenous” shocks inasmuch as they were sparked by political or other events—and not

(mainly) by an overheated world economy.

        To obtain explicit quantitative evidence regarding the nature of the two oil shocks,

we adapt Kilian’s (2007b) recent model of the oil market. He uses a VAR with measures

of oil production, aggregate commodity demand, and the real oil price to identify three

types of shocks: shocks to general commodity demand (including for oil), shocks to oil

supply, and shocks to oil demand specifically. In line with our preceding discussion, he

identifies the last shock with exogenous shifts in precautionary oil demand or shifts in

expectations about future oil supply.

        We implemented a version of Kilian’s empirical framework and used it to consider

the contribution of oil-specific demand shocks to the OPEC I and OPEC II price

increases.57 We find that large shocks of this type did in fact hit the oil market around

these two periods. Moreover, we can use the same technique applied in Figures 15

and 16 to decompose the actual movement in oil prices into a baseline forecast and the

contribution of the oil-market-specific shocks. This is done in Figure 18 for the OPEC I

and OPEC II periods. As is evident from the figure—and as one would expect given the

historical evidence cited above—these shocks account for most of the run-up in real oil

prices seen around these episodes.

            What about the broader rise in commodity prices that Barsky and Kilian (2002) point

to as evidence of a money-fueled boom? It is true that a number of observers at the time

blamed higher commodity prices on rapid world economic growth in 1972-73.58 But the

effects of the increase in demand were exacerbated by supply-side factors, most notably

underinvestment in capacity by primary producers that resulted from price controls and

low rates of return in these industries. In addition, some have attributed the emergence of

a “shortage mentality” to the first oil shock, as uncertainty about supplies of other raw

materials led to precautionary stockbuilding. Finally, year-to-year movements in

commodity prices in the 1970s do not appear to correlate well with movements in world

money supply or reserves.59

4.4.2. DeLong (1997)

DeLong (1997) also blames the Great Inflation on faulty monetary policy, but in a

different way. He argues that trend inflation was rising well before the supply shocks hit


58
   See chapter 4 of the 1976 Report of the National Commission on Supplies and Shortages, from which
most of this discussion is taken.
59
   See Bosworth and Lawrence (1982, chapter 4), who also discuss the role of stockbuilding of
commodities in the face of perceived supply problems.


                                                                                                                                    56
because (a) the Fed was trying to exploit what it saw as a non-vertical Phillips curve and

(b) policymakers still remembered (and were terrified of) the Great Depression. The

latter factor, in particular, made them fearful of using higher unemployment to fight

inflation. In DeLong’s view, this situation made a burst of inflation inevitable. The food

and energy shocks played only subsidiary roles, creating transitory swings in inflation

around a trend that was rising for other reasons.60

     There is obviously a kernel of truth in DeLong’s argument. After all, Figure 1 shows

that inflation did rise in the 1965-1970 period, long before OPEC I and higher oil prices.

Indeed, following a rapid acceleration in prices from 1965 to 1968, there was a modest

upward trend in the core inflation rate from 1968 until about 1976 or 1977. It is also true

that, prior to 1972, most economists viewed the empirical Phillips curve as non-vertical

even though the theoretical long-run Phillips curve should be vertical à la Friedman and

Phelps.

     But a more balanced view of this early inflation would recognize a few other

pertinent factors. One was the strong influence of Vietnam War spending on chronic

excess demand in the late 1960s—an inflationary fiscal (not monetary) policy. Second,

we should remember that this loose fiscal policy was subsequently reversed by the 1968

income-tax surcharge and a tightening of monetary policy—both of which were explicitly

rationalized as anti-inflationary measures. These actions show that the authorities were

not paralyzed by fear of higher unemployment.61 Third, the pre-1973 inflation was

dwarfed by what came after. Had inflation remained below 5 percent, as it did prior to

60
   DeLong (1997, pp. 268-70) argues that the supply shocks had no effect on wages, and so did not enter
trend inflation. But the results in Section 3.2 from our wage-price models suggest that this claim is
incorrect.
61
   Nor were they sufficiently paralyzed by fears of an economic downturn to prevent the 1973-75 recession
from being exceptionally long and severe.


                                                                                                       57
1973, we would not be having a conference on The Great Inflation. As we have argued

at length in this paper, something very different happened after 1972. Fourth, the sharp

reflation of the U.S. economy in 1972, using both expansionary monetary and fiscal

policy, was almost certainly designed to assist Richard Nixon’s reelection campaign, as

were the wage-price controls that reduced inflation in 1971-1973 but then raised it in

1973-1974.62 Bad memories of Nixon’s defeat in the 1960 election were probably more

relevant to the macroeconomic policies of 1971-1972 than were bad memories of the

Great Depression.63

     In sum, to attribute the Great Inflation to unemployment-phobic central bankers

trying to exploit what they thought was a downward-sloping Phillips curve seems to be a

grotesque exaggeration.

4.4.3. Cecchetti et al. (2007)

Although they reject any mono-causal explanation, Cecchetti et al. (2007) also argue that

underlying inflation picked up before 1972 because of insufficient concern about

inflation by monetary policymakers combined with a reluctance to use unemployment as

a remedy. Their work uses cross-country evidence; and given the striking similarity in

timing of the Great Inflation in many countries, they are rightly skeptical of country-

specific explanations. One might think such an attitude would have led Cecchetti et al.

straight to the supply-shock explanation; after all, the oil and food shocks of 1972-1974

were worldwide phenomena.64 But they actually downplay the importance of supply

   For evidence from the horse’s mouth, see Nixon (1962, pp. 309-11). Also see Abrams (2006) for

monetary and fiscal policies in 1972.

shocks because their data-driven dating of the Great Inflation places the start date in the

late 1960s. We have already argued that the evidence for this dating is not very

persuasive.65



5. Energy and food shocks before and after the Great Stagflation
If food and energy shocks are so critical to understanding the Great Stagflation, why

didn’t the U.S. experience them either before or after the 1973-1982 period? And if so,

why didn’t they have similarly dramatic effects? Let’s start, briefly, with the period

before 1973, and then go on to the period after 1982.

     Regarding oil shocks, OPEC I seemed to be something new, if not indeed something

sui generis, at the time. As Nordhaus (2007) emphasized, it truly was a “shock” to

Americans in every sense of the word. But Hamilton (1983) subsequently showed that

OPEC I was not as unique as it seemed at the time. The U.S. economy had not only

experienced oil shocks before, it had reacted to them similarly.

     Regarding food shocks, Blinder (1982) showed that we had indeed experienced two

sharp inflationary food-price shocks in the 1940s. The unusual period was the placid

years from 1952 through 1972, when CPI food price inflation exceeded 5 percent only

once in 21 years.66 And, of course, the United States did experience a sharp surge of

inflation when World War II price controls were lifted in 1946.




65
   To be clear, we are not advancing a mono-causal explanation of U.S. inflation from 1965 to 1982.
Monetary and fiscal policy, for example, clearly mattered. Our point is that the two big hills in Figure 1 are
mainly attributable to special factors (supply shocks and price controls).
66
   See Blinder (1982), Tables 12.7 and 12.8, page 277. After the Great Stagflation ended, we once again
lived in a food-shock-free era until 2008. From December 2007 to September 2008, the food component of
the CPI rose at a 7.5 percent annual rate. But even that was only about 3 percentage points above overall
CPI inflation and about 5 percentage points above core.


                                                                                                           59
     The period after 1982 is more puzzling; and it is, of course, the subject of more

recent research. While the United States has experienced several oil-price shocks, both

positive and negative, since 1982, none of them seem to have had such dramatic effects

on either output or inflation as the supply shocks of the 1970s and early 1980s.

Hooker (1996, 2002), Blanchard and Gali (2007), and Nordhaus (2007), among others,

present econometric evidence that the more recent oil shocks had smaller macroeconomic

effects than the earlier ones. The basic stylized facts from this research seem to be that

the positive response of core inflation has diminished sharply over time and the negative

responses of real GDP and employment have nearly vanished.67 Why might that be?

     One reason is obvious: Thanks largely to an array of market reactions to higher

energy prices after OPEC I and II, the U.S. and other industrialized countries are now far

less energy intensive than they were in 1973. In the case of the United States, the energy

content of GDP has fallen dramatically since 1973, and is now about half of what it was

then. This dramatic change is depicted in Figure 19, which shows the number of BTUs

consumed (in thousands) per dollar of real GDP annually from 1950 to 2007. The rate of

decline of this measure of energy intensity picks up after OPEC I and slows in the

mid-1980s with the cartel’s collapse and attendant drop in oil prices—though the series

has continued to trend down since then. By itself, this halving of the U.S. economy’s

energy intensity would reduce the macroeconomic impacts of oil shocks by about

50 percent—with the reductions roughly equal for prices and quantities.




67
  For example, Nordhaus’s (2007, Table 2, p. 224) descriptive regression for output shows the coefficient
of the oil-shock variable falling from −0.50 in the 1960-1980 sample to −0.19 over 1970-1990 and to −0.06
over 1980-2000.


                                                                                                      60

       However, Hooker (2002) finds that pass-through from oil prices to other prices has

diminished to negligible proportions over time—which is about twice the change that can

be explained by energy’s shrinking share. Furthermore, he cannot link the smaller pass-

through to the reductions in energy’s share. In fact, this is a very general result, and can

be extended to Phillips curve models that use share-weighted relative energy prices in

lieu of oil prices. Moreover, as the rightmost column of Table 1 showed, repeating our

input-output exercise for the five-year period 2002-2007 reveals essentially no positive

relationship between the energy intensity of consumption goods and their price change

over this period. So there must be more to the story.

       A fascinating recent paper by Nordhaus (2007) explores three possibilities. The first

is that the more gradual nature of the 2002-2008 oil price increases weakened their




                                                                                                          61
effects. While huge in total, the rolling oil shock of 2002-2008 is far smaller than either

OPEC I or OPEC II when viewed on an annualized basis—just 0.7 percent of GDP per

annum (through the second quarter of 2006, when Nordhaus’s study ends) versus roughly

2 percent of GDP per annum for both OPEC I and II (see Table 3 on page 227 of his

paper). More gradual oil price increases are easier to cope with.

     Nordhaus also finds modest evidence that wages have absorbed more of the recent

oil shocks than was true in the 1970s. Greater wage flexibility makes the responses to an

oil shock more neoclassical and less Keynesian—and therefore smaller.

     Perhaps most important, Nordhaus uses econometric Taylor rules to estimate that the

Federal Reserve responded more to headline inflation until 1980 but more to core

inflation afterward. If so, the work of Bernanke, Gertler, and Watson (1997) would

predict substantially smaller contractionary effects following the more recent oil shocks

because of the limited effect that oil shocks now appear to have on core inflation. And

remember that the empirical puzzle is at least somewhat greater for the real effects of oil

shocks than for the effects on non-energy inflation, even though both have diminished a

great deal.68

     Blanchard and Gali (2007) also adduce some modest evidence in favor of greater

wage flexibility in recent years.69 But their more speculative hypothesis is that the anti-

inflation credibility of monetary policy has increased since the 1970s—which would

reduce both the inflationary impacts and the output losses from an oil shock, presumably


68
   Hooker (2002) also points out that it is difficult to use the Bernanke et al. idea to explain the empirically
observed instability in the U.S. Phillips curve. Bernanke et al. find—and Hooker confirms—that policy
appears to respond less aggressively to oil price shocks in recent years (this is, of course, consistent with
Nordhaus’s finding). But that makes it difficult to attribute the reduced pass-through of oil prices into the
core to less-accommodative monetary policy.
69
   They consider six countries but concentrate on the United States—a point that Blanchard emphasized in
his discussion.


                                                                                                              62
by limiting the reaction of inflationary expectations. Blanchard and Gali (2007) do find

smaller recent impacts on expected inflation; but they warn that, “The model we have

developed is too primitive in many dimensions, and its quantitative implications must be

taken with caution” (pp. 65-66).

     Kilian (2007a) adds two other empirically appealing ideas to the list, both connected

with international trade. First, the changed structure of the U.S. automobile industry since

1973—arguably itself a reaction to the OPEC shocks—means that Americans no longer

turn only to imports when they seek smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles.70 So domestic

aggregate demand falls by less after an oil shock than it formerly did. The domestic auto

industry, which is of course especially vulnerable to higher gasoline prices, is also a

much smaller share of the economy now than in the 1970s.

     Second, the rolling 2002-2008 oil shock seems to have been driven by strong global

demand for industrial output, not by supply or demand shocks specific to the oil market.

While rising oil prices still constitute an “oil shock” to importing nations like the United

States, the recent shock came accompanied by stronger export performance, which

cushioned the blow to aggregate demand.

     In sum, the search for an explanation of why oil shocks have smaller impacts now

than they did in the 1970s has not come up empty. Rather, it has turned up a long list of

factors, no one of which appears to be dominant. But each may play some role. Alas,

reality is sometimes complicated, as Einstein understood.




70
  The SUV craze clearly represented some back-sliding in this regard, and the auto industry is now paying
the price.


                                                                                                       63
6. A summing up

Blinder (1979, 1982) and others concluded decades ago that the two OPEC shocks, the

two roughly contemporaneous food price shocks, and the removal of wage-price controls

in 1973-1974 played starring roles in the macroeconomic events that constituted the

Great Stagflation. Money and aggregate demand were, by comparison, bit players. This

supply-shock explanation, which we summarized in the ten points in the Preamble, was

never intended to exclude influences from the demand side, whether monetary or fiscal.

But it did take the empirical view that, compared to the powerful special factors that were

at work, conventional demand-side influences were minor during the years from 1973

to 1982.71

     More than a quarter century has now passed since Blinder’s 1982 paper was

published. How well has the supply-shock explanation held up to the accumulation of

new data, new theories, and new econometric evidence since then? Our answer is: for the

most part, pretty well.

     New data: The passage of time has changed the historical data that Blinder and

others studied at the time. But we have shown in this paper that data revisions, while

altering the precise numbers, do not change the basic story of the period in any important

ways. Whether simply tabulating data or making more complicated econometric

estimates, the events of 1973-1982 look much the same with current data as they did with

earlier data vintages.72 A far bigger change to our interpretation of this period comes

from Hamilton (1983) and subsequent work, which has taught us that OPEC I was not the

first oil shock.
71
   We exclude from this statement the demand-side impacts of the supply shocks, which we have discussed
extensively.
72
   The main exception is that mortgage interest rates have been removed from the CPI.


                                                                                                    64
     But the experience since 1982 has been different, and far more benign, than what

OPEC I and II led us to expect. While there were no food shocks between the late 1970s

and 2007, the quarter century from 1982 to 2007 did witness several sizable oil shocks,

both positive and negative. And compared to the experience of the 1970s, these shocks

seem to have packed far less punch, on both inflation and output. Why?

     New developments in the economy: First, and most obviously, the U.S. economy

became far less energy-intensive after the big oil-price shocks of the 1970s and early

1980s. That adjustment alone should have reduced the impact of an oil shock by half.

Second, and related, the U.S. automobile industry has shrunk, both relative to GDP and in

the size of the cars it produces. Third, it is easier for the economy to adjust to more

gradual shocks, such as the one we experienced from 2002 until mid-2008. Fourth, while

the OPEC I and II shocks received plenty of help from food prices, other commodity

prices, and wage-price controls, the recent rolling oil shock took place during (and to

some extent because of) a worldwide boom. A fifth set of reasons stems from changes in

monetary policy: The Fed came to focus more on core inflation and, perhaps, gained

anti-inflation credibility that now helps keep expected inflation under control. Finally,

and also conjecturally, the United States and other industrial economies may now be

more flexible, and hence better able to handle oil shocks, than they were in the 1970s.

     New theoretical or empirical analyses: Notice that none of the factors on this list

calls for a revisionist history of the 1970s. In particular, not much on the list suggests

that new economic theories or new econometric findings have undermined the

conventional wisdom on the supply-shock explanation circa 1982.73 Rather, this list of


73
 One possible exception is the role of monetary-policy credibility in controlling inflationary expectations,
which did not receive much attention before 1980, and which may or may not be quantitatively important.


                                                                                                         65
candidate explanations—some of which are clear facts, and others of which are

conjectures—suggests that economies, like organisms, adapt to difficulties. The U.S.

economy changed in a variety of ways that made the impact of oil shocks smaller in the

1990s and 2000s than in the 1970s and early 1980s.

     If that is correct, the supply-shock explanation of stagflation remains qualitatively

relevant today, but is less important quantitatively than it used to be. Thus with luck and

sensible policy, the food and energy shocks that pummeled the U.S. economy in the first

two or three quarters of 2008 need not have the devastating effects that the supply shocks

of the 1970s and early 1980s did.74 Contrary to a popular misconception, we are not

condemned to repeat history.




74
  At the time of the conference (late September 2008), the energy shock was reversing and food price
inflation appeared to be cresting. But the financial panic that followed the failure of Lehman Brothers was
moving into high gear. Both real activity and inflation looked poised to post large declines.

Appendix
This appendix gives the definitions and sources for the data series that we employ,
describes the specification of our empirical models, and details the calculations that
underpin Figures 4 through 6, the Bruno-Sachs estimates from Section 2.2, and the
input/output-based calculations from Section 2.4.


1. Data definitions and sources

All standard data from the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPAs) were
downloaded from the Bureau of Economic Analysis website; all published CPI, PPI, and
employment data were downloaded from the Bureau of Labor Statistics website (both
accessed on December 6, 2007, with the data in Figure 3 updated through the third
quarter of 2008 with data accessed on November 25, 2008).

Market-based PCE prices: Official data for the market-based PCE price index (headline
and core) are published from 1997 to the present. To extend the market-based series back
prior to 1997, we use a Fisher aggregation routine that replicates the procedure followed
by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) in constructing the NIPAs. We then use
detailed personal consumption expenditures (PCE) data from the NIPAs to strip out the
prices of non-market PCE components from the published indexes, where our definition
of “non-market” mimics BEA’s. (As a check, we compared the monthly changes in our
constructed index to the corresponding changes in the official series; the correlation
between the two series was nearly perfect.)

Current-methods CPI: A research series that puts the CPI on a methodologically
consistent basis over the period 1978-present (the CPI-U-RS) is available from the
Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), while an experimental CPI that uses a rental-
equivalence approach to recalculate the owner-occupied housing component of the index
(the CPI-U-X1) extends from 1967-1983. Our current-methods CPI is constructed as
follows.

1957-1966: Published CPI-U less 0.2 percentage point per year
1967-1977: CPI-U-X1 less 0.2 percentage point per year
1978-present: CPI-U-RS (the published CPI-U is used in the most recent period)

        The 0.2 percentage point adjustment controls for the effect of lower-level
geometric means aggregation, which was introduced in 1999. In addition, we subtract
additional small amounts (0.1 percentage point per year for the headline CPI and
0.12 percentage point per year for the core) in 1987-1989 and 1996-1997 to control for
the effect of expenditure-weight updates, which the BLS do not consider to be
methodological changes. The various splices are done on a NSA basis; the resulting
index is seasonally adjusted with seasonal factors that are obtained from the published or
rental-equivalence series, depending on the period involved.




                                                                                         71
       In addition, research series for the food and energy components of the CPI are
available from 1978 to the present. We splice these to the published indexes prior to
1978, making an additional subtraction of 0.3 percentage point per year to the published
food index in order to capture the effect of methodological changes that are specific to
this component. (For the calculations in Sections 3.1.1 and 3.1.2, we use published detail
on energy and food because current-methods data are not available for the detailed
components of the CPI.)

CPI relative importance weights: Published values for the CPI relative importance
weights are available for December of most years. Where necessary, these are
interpolated using the same dynamic updating formula that is employed in constructing
the published index.

Oil prices: The nominal oil price that is shown in Figure 3 and used in the VARs and oil-
market models is a spliced series that combines the PPI for crude petroleum (domestic
production) and the refiners’ acquisition cost (RAC) for imported crude oil.

        The PPI for crude petroleum extends back to 1947. However, this series is
affected by price controls in the early 1970s, and is therefore an imperfect measure of the
world oil price. The refiners’ acquisition cost (RAC) for imported and domestic crude oil
extends back to 1968 on an annual basis, with published monthly data available starting
in 1974. (These data are available from the Department of Energy’s Energy Information
Administration website.) In addition, the 1975 Economic Report of the President
contains monthly data for the domestic and composite RAC for November and December
of 1973, and monthly data for the imported RAC starting in September of 1973.

       We therefore use the imported RAC when it is available, and extend it back
before September of 1973 by splicing it to the PPI. On an annual-average basis, the log
change in the resulting spliced series is 124 log points from 1970 to 1974, compared with
144 log points for the imported RAC; there is similar congruence with the domestic
RAC.

World oil production: World crude oil production (thousands of barrels per day) from
the Oil and Gas Journal, downloaded from the Haver Analytics database. These data are
available monthly from 1970 to the present.

Energy intensity: Energy consumption in thousands of BTUs per dollar of real GDP,
from Table 1.5 of the Energy Information Administration’s Annual Energy Review 2007.

G-7 industrial production: OECD industrial production for the G-7 economies,
downloaded from the Haver Analytics database. These data are available monthly from
1961 to the present.

Labor income share: Ratio of compensation of employees to gross value added,
nonfinancial business sector (from the National Income and Product Accounts).




                                                                                        72

2. Detailed descriptions of empirical specifications

Price-control models: The model used in Section 3 to estimate the effect of price
controls on core CPI inflation is a standard price-price Phillips curve with additional
terms to capture the impact of the controls. The basic specification takes the form

π t = α 0 + A( L)π t −1 + B( L) xt −1 + G ( L)ζ t −1 + εt,

where πt is the inflation rate (defined as an annualized log difference), x is a measure of
slack, ζ is a supply-shock term, and ε is a stochastic error. Slack is defined as the
detrended unemployment rate; the trend is defined as the low-frequency component
obtained from a bandpass filter with the filter width and cutoffs set equal to the values
used by Staiger, Stock, and Watson (2001) and with an ARIMA model used for endpoint
padding. The number of inflation lags was determined with the Akaike criterion, with
twelve lags used as the default; note, however, that we do not impose the
“accelerationist” restriction A(1) = 1. The models are estimated at the monthly frequency
from January 1961 to March 1979.

       Two additional terms are added to the model in order to capture the effect of price
controls. The first is the relative importance of controlled prices, λt , which is taken from
Blinder and Newton (1981). The second term is a set of variables that are intended to
capture the “catch-up” effect that occurs when the controls are lifted. In the original
Blinder-Newton paper, this term was defined as

             R
(1 − λt ) g ∑ v jδ t − j ,
            j =0



where δt is the fraction of the CPI that is decontrolled in month t. This is in turn defined
as

δ t = λt −1 − λt             λt −1 ≤ λt
                      if                .
δt = 0                       λt −1 > λt

(This condition is modified so as to ensure that δt is only positive or zero; in particular, δt
is set to zero from May 1973 to August 1973—when “Freeze II” resulted in a temporary
increase in the fraction of the CPI that was subject to controls—and δ1973:09 is set equal to
λ1973:05 − λ1973:09.) The vj terms are lag coefficients, while the g parameter is a measure of
the “disequilibrium gap”—the percent difference between the representative industry’s
actual and desired price—when the controls are lifted; it can be obtained implicitly under
the assumption that the sum of the vj coefficients equals one.



                                                                                            73
        In the original Blinder-Newton work, the vj were constrained to lie along a
(linear) polynomial—an assumption that is less satisfactory in the current data. We
therefore implement the model by defining an alternative set of terms

D0 = (1 − λt )δ t
D1 = (1 − λt )δ t −1
   #
Di = (1 − λt )δ t −i ,

with as many consecutive Di terms added (starting with D0) as are statistically significant.
The full model for estimation is therefore given by

                                                              R
π t = α 0 + α1λt + A( L)π t −1 + B( L) xt −1 + G ( L)ζ t −1 + ∑ θ i Di + ut.
                                                             i =0


Note that the sum of the θ coefficients (suitably scaled to reflect inflation’s being
expressed at an annual rate) yields an estimate of the disequilibrium gap g. The core CPI
model used to generate the results in the text has fifteen lags of the dependent variable,
three lags of the unemployment gap, and the contemporaneous value and five lags of the
Di terms.

       The supply-shock terms ζt in our baseline specification are defined with reference
to a weighted change in relative food and energy prices, ω~t (π ts − π t ) , where π ts is food
or energy inflation, π is core inflation, and ω~ is the twelve-month average share of
                         t                            t

nominal food or energy expenditures in total nominal PCE.75 We then take a six-month
moving average of the weighted relative price changes, and use their first lag in the
model (additional lags did not enter).

        As noted in the text, we examined the robustness of these results along a number
of dimensions. First, we tried using a different measure of aggregate demand pressure—
the rate of capacity utilization in manufacturing—in our Phillips curves; while this
alternative demand indicator was only borderline significant (with p-values around
15 percent), using it had only a small effect on our results. Second, we experimented
with alternative specifications for the model’s relative energy and food price terms; this
typically implied a slightly larger contribution of controls to the pre- and post-peak
swing in core inflation. We also fit similar price-price models for the market-based core
PCE price index (the specification of this model is described below), and fit a wage-price
system for the CPI (again described below); once again, the estimated relative impact of

75
  Ideally, a CPI-based model would use CPI relative importance weights rather than PCE shares.
Unfortunately, there are significant breaks in the relative importance weight series over time—notably in
1978, when the CPI moved from measuring prices faced by wage earners to prices faced by all urban
consumers, and again after owner-occupied housing costs moved to a rental equivalence basis. In any
event, whether weighting is used turns out to make little difference to the results.



                                                                                                            74
controls on inflation was similar. Finally, we note that the model used for this exercise is
estimated through the beginning of 1979, which maximizes its ability to track actual
inflation in the dynamic simulations. If we instead extend the sample period to
December 1984 (to include the second set of supply shocks and the Volcker disinflation
period), which requires a few minor changes to the model’s specification (see the next
section), the resulting dynamic simulations slightly overpredict inflation over a portion of
the post-peak period. As a result, the model attributes only a little more than a third of
the post-peak decline in inflation to price controls; however, the estimated contribution of
controls to the increase in inflation is found to be around 85 percent, which is somewhat
larger than our baseline estimate.


Price-price Phillips curves: The price-price Phillips curves used in Section 3.2 to
compute the pass-through of the food and energy price shocks into core inflation are
variants of the price control model. Specifically, for the core CPI model we extend the
estimation period of the price control model to the end of 1984; this requires a minor
adjustment to the specification (we drop all but the contemporaneous value and first lag
of the unemployment gap, as the remaining terms are not statistically significant).76

        For the core market-based PCE deflator, we construct a similar price-price model
in which inflation is related to fifteen lags of the dependent variable (lag length was again
determined by the Akaike criterion), six lags of the unemployment gap, one lag each of
the relative food and energy price terms (defined in a parallel fashion to the terms used in
the core CPI equation), the fraction of the CPI under price controls (we do not have a
corresponding estimate of the fraction of the PCE deflator subject to controls), and the
contemporaneous value and six lags of the price control catch-up term. Dynamic
simulations of the resulting specifications do a reasonably good job tracking actual core
CPI and core market-based PCE price inflation over the estimation period.

      The resulting core CPI model is also used to generate the stylized supply shocks
shown in Figures 4 through 6.


Wage-price systems: We estimate a wage equation in which nonfarm hourly
compensation growth (expressed as an annualized log-difference) is related to eight lags
of the headline (current-methods) CPI, the unemployment rate, and a 40-quarter moving
average of trend productivity growth. Trend productivity growth is obtained by
regressing productivity growth on a constant and a dummy variable set equal to one
starting in 1974:Q1 (the estimation period for this productivity equation is 1950-1994).77


76
   Index rounding is quite severe for the CPI prior to the mid-1960s (this is why month-to-month inflation
rates often manifest a sawtooth pattern with flat “peaks” in the early part of the sample). We therefore
checked that our models’ tracking performance was robust to this property of the data by considering an
estimation period that started in 1965 (it was).
77
   We also experimented with using the low-frequency component of productivity growth from a band-pass
filter. The results were similar, though a moving average of this latter measure was not always significant
in every estimation period we considered.


                                                                                                        75
All data are quarterly, and the wage and markup equations are estimated from 1960:Q1 to
1985:Q4.

        The markup equation relates core (current-methods) CPI inflation to four of its
lags, the contemporaneous value and one lag of trend unit labor costs, the unemployment
gap, the fraction of the CPI subject to controls, and the contemporaneous value and one
lag of the price control catch-up term (defined on a quarterly basis).78

        To obtain the estimates shown in Figure 14, we set food and energy price inflation
equal to the values indicated in the text. The CPI relative importance weight for food
were set to 0.225 through 1977 and then to 0.180 from 1978-forward; the corresponding
weights for energy were 0.06 and 0.085.79

        In contrast to the price-price Phillips curves that we employ, these models impose
an accelerationist restriction in which the coefficients of the wage equation are
constrained such that the real consumption wage rises with trend productivity growth in a
steady state, and the coefficients on trend unit labor costs and lagged inflation in the
markup equation are constrained to sum to one. (Unlike the price-price case, the data do
not reject this restriction for the wage-price system.) As a result, the implied pass-
through of higher food and energy prices into core inflation is larger and more persistent
than what is implied from the corresponding price-price model. We also experimented
with models that relaxed the accelerationist condition for the price markup equation;
while the results were closer to those obtained from the price-price model, this alternative
wage-price system underpredicts core inflation somewhat by the end of the simulation
period.


Oil-market model (Kilian, 2007b): The oil-market model is a three-variable recursive
VAR in oil production growth, aggregate commodity demand, and the real oil price (with
that ordering). We define oil production growth as the log-difference of world crude oil
production from the Oil and Gas Journal, and use the log real oil price shown in
Figure 3.

        For his measure of aggregate commodity demand, Kilian (2007b) uses an index of
shipping prices that he constructs himself. The reason for using this index, as opposed to
a measure of industrial-country production, is that Kilian seeks to capture the recent
contribution to world commodity demand from emerging-market economies like China.
Over the period we are concerned with (the 1970s and early 1980s), this factor is less
important. In addition, in the early 1970s Kilian’s index appears to be largely based on
shipping costs for grains; these are probably unduly affected by the food price increases
that occurred during this period. We therefore use OECD industrial production for the

78
   We obtained similar results from a model that used PCE price inflation in the wage equation and a
markup equation for the market-based core PCE deflator. (To simulate this alternative system, we assumed
that the path of relative nonmarket price inflation was equal to its actual path in both cases.)
79
   The relative importance weights for food and energy in the CPI shift in 1978 when the index moves from
a wage-earners basis to an all-urban-consumers basis.


                                                                                                      76
G-7 economies as our commodity-demand proxy (in the VAR, this variable is expressed
as a log-deviation from a cubic trend fit from January 1961 to June 2007).

        The VAR is estimated using monthly data from February 1971 to
December 1987. (Note that the impulse responses from our specification appear
qualitatively similar to what Kilian obtains from his system.)


Structural VAR model: We fit two recursive VAR specifications. The first is a four-lag,
four-variable VAR in core PCE inflation (defined as an annualized log-difference), the
unemployment rate, weighted relative food and energy price inflation (computed as the
difference between headline and core PCE inflation) and the federal funds rate. The
second model uses two lags and five variables—the first three variables listed above, the
annualized log change in the Producer Price Index for crude materials, and the federal
funds rate. (This is also their ordering in the VAR.) The data are quarterly, and the
sample extends from 1959 (this is dictated by the availability of the core PCE deflator) to
the end of 1985.

        Our use of retail food and energy prices, rather than, say, oil prices, is motivated
by two considerations. First, as discussed in Section 2.2, the direct impact of higher oil
(and food) prices on production is most likely second-order. The important recessionary
impacts of the shocks come from their effects on aggregate demand, and these are best
measured by retail prices (e.g., consumer energy prices rather than oil prices). Second,
the impact of oil shocks on real activity and inflation appears to have diminished since
the early 1980s. We therefore choose to end the model’s estimation period around that
time. And since we are constrained by the availability of the core inflation series, which
only starts in the late 1950s, degrees of freedom are at a premium. Hence, a more
parsimonious specification is preferable, and the specification we consider allows food
and energy prices to enter in as economical a fashion as possible.


3. Detailed descriptions of calculations

Stylized supply-shock examples (Figures 4 to 6): We use the price-price Phillips curves
for the core CPI estimated over the extended sample (1961-1984) to calibrate the effect of
an increase in the relative price of energy. We set the share of energy in consumption
(which is used to weight the relative energy price term) equal to its 1973-2007 average
of 0.063. To compute headline inflation, we note that the change in the headline CPI
equals the change in the core CPI plus ω times the change in energy prices relative to the
core, where ω denotes the relative importance weight of energy in the total CPI. We set
this equal to its 1973-2007 average of 0.081.


Neoclassical effect of supply shocks (Bruno-Sachs): To implement the Bruno-Sachs
calculations in Section 2.2, we require a measure of gross output and its deflator, the
share of (imported) energy in gross output, and the price of imported energy. We use



                                                                                          77
NIPA data on imported petroleum and products (nominal values and prices), and
compute nominal gross output as nominal GDP plus oil imports. We use a Tornqvist
aggregation formula to compute the gross output deflator (specifically, we combine the
imported oil and GDP deflators according to the formula). Each quarter’s change in the
real price of imported oil (the log difference in the oil import deflator less the log
difference in the computed gross output deflator) is then multiplied by −s/(1−s), where s
is the share of imported oil in gross output. (Note that each share s at time t is computed
as an average of the shares in quarters t and t−1.) This gives the quarter-by-quarter
effects on value added (GDP) of changes in the real price of oil, which are then
cumulated over a specified period to yield the estimated overall impact on real GDP of
the change in imported oil prices.

        As noted in the text, the Bruno-Sachs analysis can be extended to include
imported materials inputs more generally. This is done in our calculation by using NIPA
data on imports of petroleum and products (as above) along with data on imports of
nonoil materials (nominal values and prices). For these calculations, we modify the
definition of gross output accordingly (that is, we define it as GDP plus oil imports plus
imports of nonoil materials).


Input-output estimates of energy intensity: We used the 85-item 1972 and 1977
commodity-by-commodity total requirements tables from the input-output accounts,
along with the corresponding PCE bridge tables (which provide estimates of the
commodity content of the detailed components of PCE) to construct estimates of the
crude energy content of individual PCE components. We define crude energy as coal and
crude petroleum and natural gas (commodity codes 7 and 8). The bridge tables were
inputted by hand from various issues of the Survey of Current Business, while the 1972
and 1977 total requirements tables were downloaded from the BEA website.

        For the 2002-2007 calculation that is referred to in Section 5, we use the 1992
total requirements table and PCE bridge table; both of these were obtained from the BEA
website.
