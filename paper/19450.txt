Modeling Area-Level Health Rankings

                                               ABSTRACT

We propose a Bayesian factor analysis model to rank the health of localities. Mortality and morbidity
variables empirically contribute to the resulting rank, and population and spatial correlation are incorporated
into a measure of uncertainty. We use county-level data from Texas and Wisconsin to compare our
approach to conventional rankings that assign deterministic factor weights and ignore uncertainty.
Greater discrepancies in rankings emerge for Texas than Wisconsin since the differences between
the empirically-derived and deterministic weights are more substantial. Uncertainty is evident in both
states but becomes especially large in Texas after incorporating noise from imputing its considerable
missing data.

1     Introduction

Researchers consider a broad range of health, social, economic, and environmental deter-
minants when assessing population health and identifying areas of greatest need (Institute
of Medicine, 2011; Kindig et al., 2008). Population health assessments are often presented
to policymakers and communities as ranks, given their ubiquity and ease of interpretation
(Booske et al., 2010; Kanarek et al., 2011; Erwin et al., 2011). Local area rankings can
motivate stakeholders in lagging communities to design and promote local public health in-
terventions. Such rankings can also assist policymakers with resource allocation decisions,
which can be especially critical in times of declining local, state, and federal revenues. Un-
derstanding one’s community’s relative health status can help local o¢ cials assess the impor-
tance of public health initiatives relative to other priorities. At the state and federal levels,
knowledge of the least healthy communities can assist with funding decisions regarding local
interventions and demonstration projects (Remington and Booske, 2011).

    Despite the potential usefulness of local area-level health rankings, two important dif-
…culties arise in credibly assessing them. The …rst is the lack of a single comprehensive
observable measure of health. This necessitates the use of some weighting procedure that
combines available health-related variables into a single summary measure. The second is
the need to account for uncertainty arising from sources such as sampling error and missing
data. Observable attributes of health are often not available at the population level and must
instead be estimated using samples that can become small as the geographic area narrows.
The amount of uncertainty can therefore be considerable at local levels such as the county.
Moreover, data are often missing entirely for all or some components of health in certain
localities, so inherently noisy procedures for imputing missing data are necessary in order to
produce comprehensive rankings.

    The single most prominent local area-level health rankings are the County Health Rank-
ings (CHRs), produced by the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute (UWPHI)


                                               2
and begun in 2010. The CHRs address the di¢ culties inherent in local area-level health rank-
ings by making strong and sometimes unrealistic assumptions. These rankings acknowledge
the multi-faceted nature of health, but …x subjectively-assessed deterministic weights of each
component in contributing to the overall health measure rather than allowing the weights to
be empirically derived. The CHRs also do not account at all for uncertainty, despite their
use of sample data and an imputation process for missing data. It is therefore not possible
to assess whether reported di¤erences in counties’rankings are statistically meaningful.1

       This paper develops an alternative method for ranking county health that addresses
the issues of factor weighting and uncertainty through the use of a Bayesian hierarchal
model for factor analysis. We treat health as a latent variable that depends on observable
factors related to mortality and morbidity. The model empirically derives factor weights and
measures uncertainty, which is inversely related to population size and accounts for spatial
covariance. Incorporating information from neighboring areas improves precision, which can
be especially helpful in areas with small populations that would otherwise have high levels
of uncertainty. These features of the model follow Hogan and Tchernis (2004), who ranked
census tracts’levels of material deprivation in Rhode Island. We build on the Hogan and
Tchernis (2004) framework by also including an iterative procedure to impute missing data,
which is important in our context because a full array of health information is often not
available for small localities. We incorporate uncertainty from the imputation process into
the overall measure of uncertainty.

       We apply our method to the UWPHI’s county-level data for Texas (TX) and Wisconsin
(WI). Though our model could be utilized for any state, we choose these two because TX
is the state with the most counties while WI’s rankings served as the UWPHI’s template
for the CHRs. The results demonstrate the importance of addressing both of the key issues
of factor weighting and uncertainty. First, the data-derived factor weights are more similar
   1
    Subsequent to the initial version of our paper, Athens et al. (2013) provide a preliminary attempt to
account for uncertainty in the rankings coming from sampling error. They do not, however, address the
issues of determnistic factor weights or missing data.



                                                   3
to the UWPHI’s deterministic weights for WI than TX, making the di¤erence between our
rankings and the CHRs much greater for TX. This is also the case for our identi…cation
of least healthy counties and suburban-urban health disparities, two issues of particular
interest to policymakers. Second, allowing for uncertainty reveals a number of instances
where apparent geographic disparities are misleading. When the measure of uncertainty
depends only on population and spatial covariance, the mean rank of counties should be at
least 25 ranks apart in TX (21 ranks in WI) for them to di¤er with 90% con…dence. When the
uncertainty from imputing missing data is also considered, the overall amount of uncertainty
rises drastically in TX, where many counties have at least some missing information. Indeed,
it is not possible to reach clear conclusions for most of the counties in TX because of the
prevalence of missing data, although some of the least healthy counties can still be identi…ed.

   While we focus on county health rankings, our methods could be useful in a variety
of other contexts since they can summarize latent variables related to observed manifest
variables on any level of aggregation. Factor correlation need not be spatial; correlation
could also arise across observational units with, for instance, similar demographic, economic,
or historic characteristics. One possible application of our method could be to rank hospitals’
quality of care, where quality of care is a latent variable with observable manifestations such
as in-hospital mortality rates that are correlated across hospitals of similar sizes. As another
example, overall national economic performance could be modeled as a latent variable that
manifests itself through measureable statistics such as consumption and investment, which
may be correlated based on population demographics.

2     Methods

2.1    The Model

We incorporate a latent variable framework in which mortality and morbidity variables are
observed manifestations of the latent construct–health (Figure 1, left panel). The underlying
assumption of this framework is that health is not directly observed, but rather is manifested
through a number of measurable variables. Latent variable frameworks have been widely
adopted to assess quality of life (McAuley et al., 2006), investigate geographic patterns
of disease and their relationship to behavioral and social risk factors (Best and Hansell,
2009), and measure health inequality across population subgroups (Murray et al., 1999; van
Doorslaer and Jones, 2003). We consider the same mortality and morbidity variables as
the CHRs to facilitate comparison. In contrast to our latent variable framework, the CHRs
utilize a deterministic framework in which the construct health outcomes explicitly consist
of a weighted combination of mortality and morbidity variables (Figure 1, right panel).

    Before we present our methodology, it is useful to understand how the UWPHI calculates
the existing CHRs. UWPHI calculates an overall health outcomes score based on standard-
ized mortality and morbidity variables and their corresponding deterministic weights (Booske
et al., 2010). UWPHI …rst transforms the value of each mortality and morbidity variable
into its corresponding z-score based on the distribution of values within the state. Next, the
z-scores are multiplied by their corresponding deterministic weight. Finally, UWPHI sums
over the weighted z-scores to create a …nal score for each county. This score is the basis for
the county health rankings.

    We utilize a factor analysis model with spatially correlated factors to estimate the
distribution of ranks for counties within a state. The traditional factor analysis model
(Bartholomew and Knott, 1999) explains the variability in observed variables Yij for county




                                              5
i in the following way:
                                               Yij =    j   +       j i   + eij ;

where         j   is the average of variable j across counties, the factor                  i    N (0; 1) represents
latent health level for county i = 1; : : : ; n,            j   is the factor loading for variable j = 1; : : : ; J
which represents the covariance between the latent health and the observed variables, and
                    2
eij         N (0;   j)   are the idiosyncratic error terms. The model assumes that all of the observed
variables are in‡uenced by the underlying latent health factor represented by                         i.   The model
is identi…ed by decomposing the covariance matrix of the variables within the county into
the correlation represented by the factors since the error terms, eij , are uncorrelated,                       jk   =
0 8 j 6= k.

          Stacking over the variables within the county we can rewrite the model in vector notation
as follows:
                                                 Yi =       +        i   + ei ;

where          is a vector of stacked     j   and V ar(ei ) =              = diagf 2j g . Finally, stacking over the
counties we can write the model in hierarchical form:


                                          Yj           N( +               ; In      )

                                                       N (0; In )                                                (1)


where          = In        .

          The next step is to introduce the population sizes in the variance of both the error
terms and the factors. The assumption is that error terms and the factors in more populous
counties have smaller variance, which is reasonable since the sample sizes used to compute
the underlying factors are smaller in less populous counties as long as sampling is random
(i.e. small counties are not oversampled).2 We de…ne M = diagfmi g, where mi is population
      2
     One could also incorporate sample sizes rather than population sizes into the variance; we use population
for simplicity because the factors come from di¤erent data sources and therefore have di¤erent sample sizes.


                                                                6
of county i and specify the new model as follows:


                                                                  1
                                    Yj         N( +          ;M             )
                                                         1
                                               N (0; M       )                                           (2)


In this speci…cation the variances are inversely proportional to the county population sizes.
In sum, our model accounts for stochastic uncertainty as well as uncertainty from sampling
error and the fact that the factor loadings are estimated rather than known with certainty.



2.2     Spatial Correlation

The last step in the development of our model introduces spatial dependence of the factors.
So far our model assumes independence across geographic areas. However, it is reasonable
to consider spatial spillovers that can a¤ect area health measures. Thus we introduce spatial
dependence of the factors via the spatial correlation matrix                    . The model can be rewritten
in the following way.


                                                                  1
                                    Yj         N( +          ;M             )
                                                         1=2          1=2
                                               N (0; M            M         )                            (3)



    We work with the conditional autoregressive (CAR) speci…cation (Besag, 1974; Sun et
al., 1999) which produces a tractable relationship between the conditional and the marginal
speci…cations. Hogan and Tchernis (2004) show that this speci…cation performs well relative
to several alternatives. We start from specifying the conditional relationship between the fac-
tor for county i and other counties in the neighborhood of i, Ri , and de…ne the neighborhood
As long as population size and sample size are proportional, this distinction does not matter.

as the set of counties adjacent to i

                                                          X
                                i jf j   : j 2 Ri g   N          ij j ; v= i    :
                                                          j2Ri



As discussed in Hogan and Tchernis (2004), for identi…cation as part of the factor analysis
model we can only identify one parameter and thus restrict                     ij   = !, and v=   i   = 1. This
speci…cation models the conditional mean of the distribution of the factors as a weighted
average of the factors from neighboring counties, with higher values of ! representing stronger
spatial dependence. This conditional speci…cation results in the marginal distribution of
      N (0; (I   !R) 1 ), where Rij = 1 if a county j is adjacent to county i and Rii = 0. Thus
                 1
  = (I     !R)       is a full matrix inducing the correlation between variables between counties.
This speci…cation induces a restriction on the support of ! to be between the reciprocals of
the smallest and the largest eigenvalues of R.



2.3      Estimation

The model is estimated using MCMC methods (Chib and Greenberg, 1996). We use Gibbs
Sampler (Gelfand and Smith, 1990) with one Metropolis-Hastings (Chib and Greenberg,
1995) step to obtain draws from !. While the exact conditional distributions are summarized
in Hogan and Tchernis (2004), we will discuss here how we produce the samples from the
posterior distribution of health ranks. At each iteration of the sampler we rank the posterior
means of factors, resulting in one sample from the posterior distribution of ranks.



2.4      Missing Data

In our application some of the values of the manifest variables Yij are unobserved and thus
need to be imputed. UWPHI dealt with this issue simply by replacing missing covariates
with their corresponding state-level means. This approach is potentially problematic for


                                                      8
two reasons. First, it ignores the uncertainty inherent in the imputation process. Second,
imputing missing data with state averages may lead to biased rankings if counties with
missing data are systematically more or less healthy than the average county. For example,
the rank of a county missing data on all but one factor will approach the state average. In
practice, such a county may be rural and may therefore may be less healthy than average
(e.g. Weden et al., 2011).

        Accordingly, we consider two di¤erent approaches to missing data. Our baseline model
simply replaces the missing factors(s) with ordinary least squares (OLS) predictions based
on the other (non-missing) factors. This solves the problem of counties with missing data
automatically being drawn towards the middle, but it does not address the issue of uncer-
tainty.3 Our second imputation approach is therefore to sample from the distribution of
missing values conditional on the parameters of the model using (3) at each iteration of
the sampler.4 This incorporates the uncertainty of predicting missing values as part of the
estimation, similarly to multiple imputations procedure.5



3         Data

We implement the model using UWPHI data applied to the year 2011 county health outcome
rankings in TX and WI. We selected WI and TX as our two example states because the former
served as the focus of the precursor to the CHRs, the Wisconsin County Health Rankings
(Peppard et al., 2003 and 2008). The latter is a populous state, includes several of the largest
metropolitan areas in the US, and has the largest number of counties –our unit of analysis.
We used Matlab Version R2009a for all statistical analyses.
    3
     We also tried simply replicating the UWPHI’s state averages approach, and the results (available upon
request) were very similar to those obtained using the OLS imputation. This suggests the biggest problem
with the state averages imputation in this context is its neglect of uncertainty, not its introduction of
systematic bias.
   4
     See Hogan and Tchernis (2004) for details about the sampling algorithm.
   5
     Note that it is possible that even some of the non-missing data could be incorrectly reported; our model
does not account for uncertainty from such measurement error.



                                                     9
    Mortality and morbidity data were downloaded on June 1, 2012, from the website main-
tained by UWPHI: www.countyhealthrankings.org. The mortality variable used in the CHRs
is the years of potential life lost before age 75 years (“premature death”), estimated by UW-
PHI using 2005-2007 life table data from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS).
The morbidity variables used are: [1] the percent of adults reporting fair or poor health
(“self-reported health”), [2] the mean number of physically unhealthy days per month for
adults (“physical unhealthy days”), [3] the mean number of mentally unhealthy days per
month for adults (“mental unhealthy days”), and [4] the percent of live births with birth-
weight < 2500 grams (“low birthweight”). The …rst three morbidity variables were estimated
by UWPHI using 2003-2009 data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and
the fourth morbidity variable was estimated by UWPHI using 2001-2007 birth certi…cate
data from NCHS.

    UWPHI did not rank 31 out of 254 counties in TX because they were missing at least
four of the …ve variables. 116 of the remaining 223 counties had missing data on at least one
variable, and UWPHI applied their aforementioned imputation procedure to these counties.
UWPHI ranked all 72 counties in WI, only 2 of which had missing data on any variables.
To facilitate comparability, we focus only on the counties ranked by UWPHI. Our sample
therefore consists of 223 TX counties and 72 WI counties.



4     Results

4.1    Factor Weights

We estimate the model using data for TX and WI separately. Appendix Table A1 reports
the means, standard errors, and 95% probability intervals (PIs) of the posterior distributions
of all of the model’s parameters. We focus our discussion, however, on the results of most
interest, beginning with the estimated factor weights.


                                             10
       Table 1 compares the deterministic UWPHI CHR weights to our normalized square cor-
relations for the mortality and morbidity variables. Normalized square correlation represents
the proportion of the variance in the variable that is explained by the factors and, therefore,
is comparable to the weights used by UWPHI.6 Normalized square correlations di¤er between
TX and WI. Additionally, our squared correlations di¤er from the CHR weights, which are
applied uniformly across all states. For example, we estimate the squared correlation of the
mean number of physically unhealthy days per month to be 0.41 for TX (95% CI, 0.34 to
0.48) and 0.21 for WI (95% CI, 0.11 to 0.31), whereas UWPHI sets the weight of this variable
to 0.10 for all states. The fact that the di¤erence between our squared correlations and the
UWPHI weights is greater for TX than WI suggests that our rankings are likely to be less
similar to the CHRs for TX than WI. This di¤erence also illustrates the broader point that
assuming the factor weights to be constant across states may be problematic. For instance,
physical health might be more closely tied to overall health than mental health in one state,
perhaps due to di¤erences in demographic, economic, or cultural charactersitics, while the
reverse may be true elsewhere.7


                                         [Table 1 About Here]



4.2       Mean Rankings

For each county, we compute the posterior distribution of its health outcomes rank, including
its mean and 95% probability interval (PI). Appendix Tables A2 and A3 show our full county
rankings for TX and WI, along with the corresponding CHRs. In Figure 2 we summarize this
information in a way that illustrates the di¤erences between our rankings and the CHRs as
   6
     In addition, we estimated regression coe¢ cients by regressing the mortality and morbidity measures on
the posterior means of factors. These regression coe¢ cients are directly comparable to the UWPHI weights.
The information in these regression coe¢ cients was nearly identical to squared correlations and they are
available upon request from the authors.
   7
     Of course, similar logic suggests that in some contexts weights might di¤er within states, e.g. at the
Metropolitan Statistical Area level. In our view, it makes sense to keep the weights constant within the
geographic level for which the rankings are reported, which in this case is the state.



                                                    11
well as the extent of uncertainty in the rankings. Speci…cally, we plot the middle 95% of the
posterior distribution of ranks (horizontal line) and the mean of the posterior distribution
(solid circle) relative to each county’s UWPHI rank. These initial estimations use the OLS
imputations for missing data.


                                   [Figure 2 About Here]


   We begin by discussing the di¤erences between our (mean) rankings and the CHRs.
Greater distances between solid circles and the 45 degree line indicate greater di¤erences
between our rankings and the CHRs. A solid circle to the right of the 45 degree line indicates
our method ranks the county worse than the CHRs, and vice versa. Comparing the panels
for TX and WI, we observe that there are more disagreements in TX than in WI - the
intervals in the WI panel are much closer to the 45 degree line. The correlations between the
UWPHI ranks and our ranks are 0.65 for TX (95% CI, 0.60 to 0.71) and 0.89 for WI (95%
CI, 0.81 to 0.94). This is exactly as expected given the fact that our factor weights di¤er
more substantially from the CHR weights for TX than WI, as discussed in Section 4.1.



4.3    Uncertainty

We next turn to the results regarding uncertainty in the rankings. The horizontal lines from
Figure 2 suggest considerable uncertainty in both states. The 95% PIs range from 0 to 69
ranks wide in TX, with a mean width of 14.5 ranks and median width of 11 ranks. In WI,
the 95% PIs range from 1 to 38 ranks wide, while the mean and median widths are 12 and
12 ranks.

   We can use the measures of uncertainty to ask how far apart the ranks of two counties
should be to give a researcher reasonable con…dence that they are di¤erent (e.g., 90% or
95% con…dent). To answer this question we calculate the percentage overlap in the posterior
distribution of ranks between two counties that are k units apart in their mean rank. Consider


                                             12
Harris County, TX with mean rank equal to 66. The mean rank of Blanco County, TX equals
k = 5 ranks higher at 71; 2.2% of the posterior distribution of Harris County overlaps with
the posterior distribution of Blanco County (Figure 3, left panel). In TX, there are 216
unique pairs of counties with mean rank k = 5 units apart and we calculate the percentage
overlap for each pair. The median percentage overlap among the 216 pairs of counties is
12.8%.


                                   [Figure 3 About Here]


   As the di¤erence between mean ranks, k, increases, the median percentage overlap de-
creases. For example, as k increases from 1 to 5 to 10, the median overlap in the posterior
distributions equals 40.8%, 12.8%, and 1.3%, respectively (Figure 3, middle panel). When k
exceeds 25, 90% of county pairs have 1% or less overlap. Similarly, when k exceeds 30, 95%
of county pairs have 1% or less overlap. In WI, as k increases from 1 to 5 to 10, the median
overlap in the posterior distributions equals 41.7%, 13.5%, and 0.5%, respectively (Figure 3,
right panel). When k exceeds 21, 90% of county pairs have 1% or less overlap and when k
exceeds 23, 95% of county pairs have 1% or less overlap. Thus, to be reasonably con…dent,
say 90%, that two counties are di¤erent with respect to their health outcomes ranking, the
distance between the mean of their health rank distribution should be approximately 25
counties apart in TX and 21 counties apart in WI.



4.4      Least Healthy Counties

A key purpose of the CHRs is identifying the least healthy counties to more e¤ectively
mobilize action to improve the health of these populations (Friedman et al., 2003; Kindig
and Stoddart, 2003; McDowell et al., 2004). We therefore next examine how closely the
least healthy counties identi…ed by our rankings correlate to those from the CHRs. The
vertical and horizontal lines in Figure 2 represent the 80th percentile (178th out of 223


                                             13
ranked counties in TX and 62nd out of 72 in WI) separating the least healthy quintile of
counties. According to our model, the least healthy counties will be those counties in which
the mean of their rank distribution lies to the right of the vertical grey line. According to
the CHRs, the least healthy counties will be those with ranks above the horizontal grey line.
Again, the di¤erences are much more pronounced for TX than WI. In TX, 26 counties are
classi…ed as least healthy by both models, 19 are classi…ed as least healthy by our model and
not UWPHI, and 19 are classi…ed as least healthy by UWPHI and not our model. In WI,
13 counties are classi…ed as least healthy by both models, 3 are classi…ed as least healthy
by our model and not UWPHI, and 2 are classi…ed as least healthy by UWPHI and not our
model. Among the counties classi…ed as least healthy either by our rankings or the CHRs,
the correlation between the CHRs and our mean ranks was -0.06 for TX (95% CI, -0.17 to
0.14) and 0.68 for WI (95% CI, 0.34 to 0.85).

   It is also useful to examine the degree of uncertainty in our identi…cation of the least
healthy counties, which we can do by presenting the probability of each county being in the
least healthy quintile. Figure 4 presents county-level maps of TX and WI of this probability.
According to the CHRs, counties either are or are not in this quintile. In contrast, each county
in our model has a probability of being in the least healthy quintile, which is re‡ected in
increasing shades of gray. In TX, we observe a large concentration of unhealthy counties in
East Texas. The probability of being in the least healthy quintile is 1.00 for Austin County,
0.63 for Colorado County, and 0.59 for Polk County. In other words, the entire posterior
distribution of rankings for Austin County and 59% of the posterior distribution of rankings
for Polk County lie to the right of 80th percentile. In WI, the probability is high for several
of the northernmost counties (e.g., 0.96 for Douglas County) and several counties in the
Milwaukee area (e.g., 1.00 for Milwaukee County and 0.54 for Kenosha County).


                                    [Figure 4 About Here]




                                              14
4.5    Metropolitan Statistical Areas

Another useful feature of county health rankings is to identify broader patterns in disparities,
such as whether the urban core of metropolitan areas typically has worse health than outlying
suburban areas. We next illustrate the potential of our method to illuminate such disparities
by examining a metropolitan area in both of our sample states: the Dallas-Ft. Worth-
Arlington, TX Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) and the Milwaukee-Racine-Waukesha,
WI Combined Statistical Area (CSA) (O¢ ce of Management and Budget, 2009). Measuring
di¤erences in health rankings within metropolitan areas addresses disparities de…ned by
both demographic characteristics and geographic location (Phillips and McLeroy, 2004) and
the physical, social, and economic environments that shape these di¤erences. Weden et al.
(2011) investigated evidence of rural health disadvantage and found di¤erences in mortality
and morbidity among rural, suburban, and urban areas. For simplicity we continue to use
the factors weights estimated earlier for TX and WI, though in principle these could be
re-estimated using only the subset of counties within each MSA.

   Figure 5 plots the posterior distribution of health outcome ranks for each county of the
Dallas MSA, showing the median of each posterior distribution as a vertical line, the mean
as a solid circle, and the corresponding UWPHI rank as an open triangle. We observe a
suburban-urban gradient in health rankings. Counties north of Dallas County (e.g., Denton,
Collin, and Rockwell) rank healthier than the central urban county and they rank among
the healthiest in TX. In contrast, several counties south of Dallas County (e.g. Johnson,
Ellis, and Kaufman) rank less healthy than the central urban county and its surrounding
northern counties. Our results are quite di¤erent than those using the CHRs, as the CHRs
of only three of the twelve counties in the MSA are within our 95% PIs. We observe more
agreement between our ranks and the CHRs among the healthiest counties and more dis-
agreement among the least healthy counties. For example, we rank Johnson County at the
85th percentile (95% PI, 82nd to 86th percentile) compared to the 36th percentile by UW-



                                              15
PHI. Consequently, the suburban-urban health gradient is more pronounced in our rankings.


                                   [Figure 5 About Here]


   Figure 6 shows the results for the Milwaukee CSA. A suburban-urban gradient in health
again emerges, with the central county of the urban core – Milwaukee – having the worst
health in the CSA and close to the worst health in the state. The northern and western
suburban counties of Waukesha, Washington, and Ozaukee have the best health in the CSA
and are among the healthiest counties in the state. The southern counties of Walworth
and Racine rank relatively poorly but better than Milwaukee County, while the outermost
suburbs of Je¤erson and Dodge rank in the middle. As with the overall rankings and least
healthy counties, our results are much more similar to the CHRs in WI than TX. The CHRs
of all but one of the Milwaukee CSA counties are within our 95% PIs, and the conclusions
reached about suburban-urban disparities are the same.


                                   [Figure 6 About Here]



4.6    Missing Data

All our rankings thus far use OLS imputations for missing data. This approach does not
account for uncertainty about the imputed values, perhaps leading to PIs that are too narrow
and estimates of minimum ranking di¤erences necessary for statistically signi…cance that are
too small. This is likely especially problematic in TX, which –as discussed in Section 3 –has
much more missing data than WI. Figure 7 therefore explores the sensitivity of our results
to the use of the iterative imputation procedure. The left column ("Naive Imputation")
reproduces the results using the OLS imputations from Figure 2, while the middle column
("Posterior Imputation") uses the iterative procedure. Recall that our main sample includes
all counties with valid data for at least one of the …ve factors. Another useful comparison
is therefore to see how the results change using a more restrictive set of counties. To that


                                             16
end, the right column ("Restricted Imputation") drops counties with more than one missing
factor. This reduces the number of counties from 223 to 152 in TX, but does not a¤ect the
number of counties in WI.


                                    [Figure 7 About Here]


   The bottom half of Figure 7 shows that incorporating uncertainty from imputing missing
data has essentially no e¤ect on the results for WI. This is because only two of WI’s 72
counties have any missing data, and those two counties are missing only one factor. Since
no counties are missing more than one factor, the second and third …gures are exactly the
same.

   The top half of Figure 7 shows that the results are much di¤erent for TX. Keeping
all counties with at least one non-missing factor in the sample ("Posterior Imputation"),
we see that incorporating uncertainty from imputing missing data drastically increases the
overall amount of uncertainty. The 95% PIs for the 116 counties with at least one missing
factor generally expand to include almost the entire range of possible ranks. Even the PIs
for counties with no missing data widen considerably in most cases because of the shared
component in the uncertainty measure. When we drop the counties with two or more missing
factors ("Restricted Imputation"), the level of uncertainty drops relative to the previous
"Posterior Imputation" graph, but remains considerably greater than the baseline case with
the naive imputation approach. Of the 152 remaining counties, 71 have 95% PIs that reach
into the "least healthy quintile" range and 47 of these extend into the "least healthy decile"
range.

   The TX results illustrate the broader point that when the amount of missing data is
extensive, it is not possible to obtain clear conclusions for most counties after accounting for
all sources of uncertainty. Attempts to produce comprehensive county health rankings for
such states are therefore likely to produce a large number of misleading results. However,
this does not necessarily mean that no useful results can come from such analyses, only that


                                              17
caution should be used when assessing which results are reliable and which could simply be
a product of uncertainty. For instance, even in the full-sample TX graph with the iterative
imputation process, the 95% PIs for 10 counties lie entirely to the right of the 80th percentile
line. These 10 counties can therefore con…dently be identi…ed as among the least healthy in
TX despite the fact that clear conclusions cannot be reached for most other TX counties.



5     Conclusion

This paper implements a Bayesian hierarchal model for factor analysis to rank the health
of localities, where health is a latent variable that depends on observable factors related
to mortality and morbidity. Our model improves on the previous UWPHI CHRs by using
a data-driven process to determine factor weights and including a measure of uncertainty
that incorporates population, spatial covariance, and noise from imputing missing data.
Applying our method to county-level data from TX and WI reveals the importance of these
improvements. We show that our data-derived factor weights di¤er substantially from the
deterministic CHR weights in TX but less so in WI. Consequently, our results for overall
rankings, least healthy counties, and suburban-urban health gradients are much more similar
to the CHRs for WI than for TX. We also document considerable uncertainty in both states.
When the measure of uncertainty only re‡ects population and spatial covariance, the mean
rank of counties should generally be at least 25 ranks apart in TX (21 ranks in WI) to be
meaningfully di¤erent. When we also include the uncertainty inherent in imputation, the
overall level of uncertainty rises sharply in TX since the state has considerable missing data.
It becomes impossible to reach clear conclusions for most counties, although some of the
least healthy counties can still be identi…ed.

    Our framework is ‡exible enough to allow numerous variations in future research on
health rankings. Most obviously, our model could be estimated in other states using the
same …ve mortality and morbidity variables. It would also be straightforward to empir-


                                                 18
ically produce alternative rankings using additional health-related variables beyond these
…ve. Indeed, numerous other measures of health outcomes exist and are routinely measured
at the population level (Kindig, 2007). Our latent variable framework could incorporate
these additional manifestations of health and empirically derive their relationship on health
outcomes without requiring subjective expert opinion on variable weights. Moreover, our
method could easily be used to produce rankings at geographic levels besides the county,
such as the state or MSA. The existing state-level America’s Health Rankings (United Health
Foundation, 2010) su¤er from the same limitations as the CHRs –although sampling error
and missing data are probably less problematic at larger geographic levels. Our ranking
methodology could even be extended to international comparisons of health system per-
formance (Anderson and Markovich, 2010; Squires, 2011) or human development (United
Nations Development Programme, 2011). An additional application could focus on rank-
ing health and healthcare across hospitals, hospital referral regions, and physician hospital
networks to identify optimal and suboptimal areas.

   We also o¤er methodological innovations that could be useful in various contexts besides
health. While our model relies heavily on the framework developed by Hogan and Tchernis
(2004) to rank levels of material deprivation, we add to their framework an explicit procedure
for imputing missing data and incorporating noise from the imputation process into the
overall measure of uncertainty. Missing or incomplete data at local levels such as the county
is certainly not a phenomenon that is unique to health data. Moreover, Hogan and Tchernis
(2004) only studied one state – Rhode Island. By including multiple states we are able to
demonstrate the importance of allowing the estimated factor weights to vary in each state
rather than simply using national data to determine universal weights. It seems reasonable
to suspect this would be the case in non-health contexts as well.

   We acknowledge several limitations in this study that provide directions for future re-
search. First, we (and the CHRs) only rank counties with at least one morbidity or mortality
variable measured. Counties without any measured variables, which are often the smallest,


                                             19
may also be among the most disadvantaged and least healthy. Second, several morbidity
measures are based on self-reported physical and mental status, which may be subject to
di¤erential recall bias. Next, while rankings are useful to compare the health of populations,
they do not convey absolute di¤erences in health. A county may improve in health rank-
ing even though its population became less healthy if the health of other counties declines
faster over time. Depending on the research or policy goal, progress may be better measured
using absolute measures of population health. Whether we measure population health on
an absolute or relative scale, assessing the corresponding statistical uncertainty enables us
to evaluate meaningful di¤erences among counties. An additional caveat to our research is
that it only sheds light on whether one county is healthier than another; it does not address
why this is the case. Additional research is needed to understand how medical, behavioral,
social, physical, and biological determinants interact to produce health and perpetuate dis-
parities (Kawachi et al., 2002; Stoddart, 1995). Finally, ranking health at the county level
masks potentially substantial heterogeneity within counties. Future work could apply our
method to ranking zip codes or census tracts within counties, exploiting spatial covariance
to mitigate the considerable uncertainty from ranking at such a narrow level.

   In short, we provide several useful insights for researchers and policymakers interested
in local area health rankings. First, we demonstrate the importance of allowing the data to
determine the weights of the di¤erent health variables when constructing an overall health
measure. Second, we show that these weights can be quite di¤erent in di¤erent parts of the
country. Next, our results illustrate the signi…cance of appropriately accounting for uncer-
tainty. Even di¤erences in rankings that appear sizeable could still be misleading, especially
if the localities ranked are small or if some of the data are imputed. Finally, our …nding that
missing data can drastically limit the ability to draw clear conclusions underscores the need
to invest in comprehensive data if comprehensive locality health rankings are desired.

     The left panel shows the posterior distribution of health outcomes rankings for Harris County, TX (mean rank 66) and Blanco
     County, TX (mean rank 71). The overlap between the two posterior distributions shown in dark grey. The middle (right) panel
      shows the percentage overlap in the posterior distribution of ranks between counties that are k units apart in mean rank for
     Texas (Wisconsin). The 95% probability interval of the percentage overlap is denoted by a vertical line and median percentage
                                                   overlap is denoted by a solid circle.

                     The top (bottom) panel shows the posterior and UWPHI ranks for each county in TX
                         (WI). The 95% probability interval of the posterior distribution is denoted by a
                       horizontal line and mean posterior rank by a solid circle. The gray horizontal and
                     vertical lines represent the 80th percentile of ranks and the 45 line represents equality
                      between the UWPHI and posterior ranks. The restricted imputation excludes 71 TX
                                           counties with more than one missing variable.
