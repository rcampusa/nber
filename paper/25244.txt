The Impact of Medicaid Expansion on Voter Participation: Evidence from the Oregon Health
Insurance Experiment

NBER Working Paper No. 25244
November 2018
JEL No. I13,I28

                                          ABSTRACT

In 2008, a group of uninsured low-income adults in Oregon was selected by lottery for the chance
to apply for Medicaid. Using this randomized design and state administrative data on voter
behavior, we analyze how a Medicaid expansion affected voter turnout and registration. We find
that Medicaid increased voter turnout in the November 2008 Presidential election by about 7
percent overall, with the effects concentrated in men (18 percent increase) and in residents of
democratic counties (10 percent increase); there is suggestive evidence that the increase in voting
reflected new voter registrations, rather than increased turnout among pre-existing registrants.
There is no evidence of an increase in voter turnout in subsequent elections, up to and including
the November 2010 midterm election.

1. Introduction

The interaction between government policy and political participation is central to questions in
political science, political economy, and public economics. We focus on the impact on voter
participation of a specific, means-tested government policy: Medicaid. Medicaid is operated as a
partnership between the state and federal governments to provide public health insurance to low
income individuals. It is the largest means-tested program in the US; at over $550 billion in
expenditures in 2016, it dwarfs the next largest means-tested programs (food stamps (SNAP) and
the Earned Income Tax Credit, each of which were only about $70 billion in 2016).1

We examine how expanding Medicaid to previously uninsured low-income adults affected voter
turnout and registration. Credibly identifying the causal impact of a policy on political behavior
is challenging (Campbell, 2012). The expansion of Medicaid is no exception: Medicaid
recipients differ from the uninsured in many ways – such as, for example, socio-economic status
and health – that may directly affect voter participation. The confounding factors make it
difficult to make inferences about the causal impact of Medicaid from observational comparisons
of voting behavior of Medicaid enrollees compared to “similar” uninsured individuals.

In 2008, Oregon used a lottery to allocate a limited number of slots in its Medicaid program,
Oregon Health Plan (OHP) Standard, for low-income, previously uninsured adults (ages 19-64).
The state drew names at random from a waiting list of approximately 90,000 for 10,000 available
slots. Those selected were able to apply for OHP Standard and, if found eligible, to enroll.
Oregon’s use of a lottery offers the opportunity to assess the effect of Medicaid coverage using a
randomized evaluation design that is not contaminated by confounding factors.

Prior work on the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment used the lottery as an instrument for
Medicaid coverage and examined the impact of Medicaid on health care use, health outcomes,
and financial outcomes over the first two years (Finkelstein et al., 2012, Baicker et al., 2013;
Baicker et al., 2014; Taubman et al., 2014; Finkelstein et al., 2016). It found that Medicaid
increased health care use across a wide range of settings – including hospital admissions,
emergency room visits, prescription drugs, primary care, and preventive care; where it was
possible to analyze time patterns, these effects appear persistent over the first two years of
coverage. The prior work on the Oregon Experiment also found that Medicaid improved
financial security – reducing unpaid medical bills and out of pocket medical spending and
virtually eliminating the risk of catastrophic out of pocket medical spending – but had no impact
on employment or earnings. Finally, it found that Medicaid reduced depression and improved
self-reported health, but had no detectable impacts on several measures of physical health.

We now use the random selection in the lottery to study, for the first time, impacts on voter
participation. To do so, we link administrative data on lottery participants, whether they won the
lottery, and their Medicaid enrollment, to Oregon’s statewide voter lists. These allow us to
analyze voter turnout in elections from November 2006 through November 2010, and voter
registration as of June 2010. Prior to looking at the data on outcomes for the treatment group, all
of the analyses presented in the main text were pre-specified and publicly archived in a detailed
analysis plan.2

We analyze the impact of Medicaid on voter participation, using random selection by the lottery
(which occurred from March through September 2008) as an instrument for Medicaid coverage.
The results indicate that Medicaid increased voter turnout in the November 2008 presidential
election. Overall, Medicaid increased voter turnout by 2.5 percentage points (standard error =
0.014), or about 7 percent relative to the 34 percent mean turnout in the control group. The
impact was particularly pronounced for men, for whom Medicaid increased turnout by 5.4
percentage points (standard error = 1.86), or about 18 percent, and for residents in democratic
counties, for whom Medicaid increased turnout by 3.6 percentage points (standard error = 1.8),
or about 10 percent.

We also find some evidence that Medicaid increased voter registration, although the results were
statistically insignificant. Intriguingly, however, the statistically insignificant increases in
registration were roughly the same magnitude as the increase in turnout, and similarly
concentrated among males and among residents of democratic counties. We interpret this as
suggestive evidence that the increase in voter turnout may reflect the behavior of newly-
registered voters. We find no evidence of increased turnout in subsequent state-wide and local
elections after November 2008 and before November 2010, or in the statewide general election
in November 2010. We are unable to study the impacts of the 2008 lottery on voting beyond the
2010 elections because after that point, individuals who had been in the control group were given
the opportunity to sign up for a new lottery, effectively ending the experiment.

We note two important limitations or nuances to our findings. First, our results do not necessarily
generalize to other actual or potential Medicaid expansions. As discussed in more detail in
Finkelstein et al. (2012), our results should be interpreted in light of the particular characteristics
of the study population and the specific nature and timing of the Oregon Medicaid expansion.

Second, following prior work we use lottery selection as an instrument for Medicaid coverage.
These instrumental variable (IV) estimates are based on the exclusion restriction that the only
channel through which winning the lottery affected voting was via its impact on receiving
Medicaid coverage. However, the exclusion restriction is potentially violated when analyzing
voting behavior. It is possible, for example, that “winning” something from the government
affects voting behavior directly (see e.g. Mettler 2005). In addition, applying for Medicaid could

                                                                                                               2
increase voting – whether or not the applicant ultimately received Medicaid – since, under the
1993 National Voter Registration Act, public assistance offices are, in principle (although
compliance varies), required to offer clients voter registration forms and assistance (Michener
2016). In this case, the results should be interpreted as the impact of expanding Medicaid
eligibility, rather than the impact of expanding Medicaid coverage. We therefore also present
intent-to-treat estimates of the impact of winning the lottery (i.e. the ability to apply for
Medicaid); by construction, these estimates are one-fourth the size of the IV estimates of the
impact of Medicaid coverage (since winning the lottery increased the probability of Medicaid by
about one-fourth). Arguably, the impact of expanded eligibility is as, or more, interesting than
the impact of coverage per se, since eligibility, unlike receipt, is a policy lever that the
government can directly control (see e.g. Gruber 1997).

The rest of paper proceeds as follows. Section two briefly reviews potential channels by which
Medicaid may affect political participation and some of the existing evidence. Section three
describes the intervention and data, section four presents the empirical framework, and section
five presents the results. A final section concludes.

2. Medicaid and Political Participation: Potential Channels and Existing Evidence

A priori, the sign as well as the magnitude of any impacts of means-tested programs on political
participation are ambiguous, and may vary depending on their specific design. Broadly
speaking, the literature focuses on two potential mechanisms for policy feedback – i.e. ways in
which today’s policies can influence future political participation. These are: “resource effects” –
redistributing resources in a way that can affect political behavior – and “interpretive effects” –
changing the ways individuals perceive political institutions as well as their relationship with
those institutions (Pierson 1993; Campbell 2012).

It has been well documented that wealthy people are more likely to vote than the poor (Highton
and Wolfinger 2001; Leighley and Nagler 2014), although the causal impact of resources on
voting – as opposed to other correlates such as education or church involvement – is unclear
(Wolfinger and Rosenstone 1980; Brady et al. 1995; Mettler and Stonecash 2008). Evidence
from the Oregon experiment (Finkelstein et al., 2012; Baicker et al., 2013) as well as quasi-
experimental studies of recent Medicaid expansions (Hu et al., 2016, Mazumder and Miller 216)
indicates that Medicaid lowers out-of-pocket medical spending and medical debt. Thus,
Medicaid may increase political participation by increasing economic resources.

Another potential resource effect may be via an impact of Medicaid on improving recipients’
health. Poor health may discourage political participation by directing attention to personal
matters and away from political ones, and by inhibiting the cognitive abilities and civic skills
required for participation (Pacheco and Fletcher 2015; Blais 2000). Evidence from the Oregon
experiment on health impacts is mixed, suggesting that Medicaid improved self-reported health
and reduced depression, but had no detectable impact on measures of physical health (Finkelstein



                                                                                                   3
et al., 2012; Baicker et al., 2013; Baicker and Finkelstein 2013). Reductions in depression may
potentially increase individuals’ sense of political efficacy, and hence their political participation
(Ojeda 2015).

Medicaid may also have interpretative effects, but the sign of such interpretative effects is a
priori ambiguous. Universal programs may convey messages of inclusion and empowerment,
which then create positive psychological effects and encourage political participation (Wilson
1987; Skocpol 1991). Means-tested programs such as Medicaid, however, may undermine
political participation by conveying negative lessons about the quality and nature of government
as well as encouraging feelings of powerlessness (Schneider and Ingram 1993; Soss 1999; Soss
2002; Campbell 2012). On the other hand, the interpretative effects of means tested programs
could be positive: endorsement of welfare programs by major parties and politicians could
dampen or even reverse the negative stigmatizing effects (Clinton and Sances 2018), as could
expanded Medicaid eligibility.

Empirical evidence from randomized trials and regression discontinuity designs in developing
countries suggests that means-tested government benefits increase voter turnout (e.g. De La O,
2013, Manacorda et al., 2011, Labonne, 2013, Pop-Eleches and Pop-Eleches, 2012). However, in
the US, where there are relatively fewer causal estimates of the impact of means-tested benefit
receipt on voting, the existing studies point to decreases in turnout. Gay (2012) looks at the
impact of the Moving to Opportunity randomized experiment on housing mobility on voting,
finding that receipt of public housing assistance reduced voter turnout; she provides some
suggestive evidence that this was due to the disruption of social networks associated with moves
to better neighborhoods. Dave et al. (2016) use the quasi-experimental variation in the timing of
different state welfare reforms in the early 1990s, and find that welfare reform – which aimed to
reduce dependence on cash welfare – decreased voter turnout among low-income women, with
effects confined to presidential elections.

In our specific context of Medicaid, several prior papers have tried to examine the impact of
Medicaid on voter participation (e.g. Michener 2017), but the challenges to identifying causal
effects have been substantial. To try to surmount these challenges, two recent papers have
analyzed the relationship between geographic changes in Medicaid coverage arising from the
2014 Medicaid expansions under the ACA and geographic changes in voter participation.
Haselswerdt (2017) estimates that increases in Medicaid enrollment increased voter turnout in
the 2014 Congressional elections, while Clinton and Sances (2018) estimate that Medicaid
increased voter registration in 2014 (with effects persisting through 2016), and increased voter
turnout in 2014 but not in 2016.

3. Intervention and Data

3.1 Randomization and Intervention.

Oregon opened a waiting list for a previously closed Medicaid program in early 2008 and then
conducted eight lottery drawings from the waiting list between March and September 2008.
Selected individuals won the opportunity – for themselves and any household member – to apply
for health insurance benefits through Oregon Health Plan Standard (OHP Standard). OHP
Standard provides benefits to low-income adults who are not categorically eligible for Oregon’s
traditional Medicaid program. To be eligible, individuals must be: ages 19-64; not otherwise
eligible for Medicaid or other public insurance; Oregon residents; U.S. citizens or legal
immigrants; without health insurance for six months; with income below the federal poverty
level and assets below $2,000. Among the randomly selected individuals, those who completed
the application process and met these eligibility criteria were enrolled in OHP Standard. OHP
Standard provides relatively comprehensive medical benefits (including prescription drug
coverage) with no consumer cost sharing and low monthly premiums (between $0 and $20,
based on income), provided mostly through managed care organizations. The lottery process and
OHP Standard have been described in more detail elsewhere (Finkelstein et al., 2012).

Starting in the fall of 2009, the state conducted a new lottery for OHP Standard. As part of this
new lottery, the state mailed postcards to those on the original list that were not selected (our
controls) asking if they would like to be included in this second lottery. Those who returned the
postcard were added to the new waiting list and an initial draw was done just from that group. By
the end of 2010, all of the controls had been given the opportunity to sign up for this new lottery.
Our analysis therefore does not extend beyond 2010.

3.2 Data sources

Lottery list and Medicaid enrollment

The state provided us with a list of everyone who signed up for the lottery – including their name
and basic self-reported demographics – and whether and when they were selected. The lottery
list provides the basic demographics that we use in our heterogeneity analysis, including gender,
age, whether the primary language is English, and whether the zip code of residence is in a
democratic county, defined as a county in which the majority voted for Obama in 2008; we refer
to these as “lottery list variables”. The state also provided detailed data on Medicaid enrollment
for every individual on the list. We use this to construct our primary measure of insurance
coverage during the study period. Both data sets are analyzed and described in detail elsewhere
(see Finkelstein et al., 2012).




                                                                                                  5
Voting Data

The novel data used in this analysis are the voting data. Statewide voter lists are maintained by
Oregon’s Office of the Secretary of State, Elections. The data contain individual-level
information on whether the individual is registered to vote as of the data’s date (and if so the
current political party registration, if any), and whether the individual voted in various prior
elections. Elections in the data include both statewide elections (such as the November 2008
general election) and local elections in which certain districts vote on particular measures or elect
local politicians (e.g. school board members).

The data also contain the full name, date of birth, and gender of each individual on the list, which
we used to probabilistically match to the lottery study population, using standard techniques used
previously with this population (e.g. Finkelstein et al., 2012; Baicker et al., 2014; Taubman et al.,
2014; Finkelstein et al., 2016). Those on the lottery list who did not appear in the voter
registration records were assumed not registered (as well as have not voted).

We use two main data sets in our analysis: one that we obtained in June 2010 (hereafter “2010
data”) and one that we obtained in July 2013 (hereafter “2013 data”). There are two main
differences between the two data pulls. First, they provide information on current registration as
of different dates. Second, the 2010 data contain voting information on elections from May 2008
through May 2010 while the 2013 file contain voting data on elections from May 2006 through
May 2012, but omit some smaller local elections included in the 2010 data. As a result, we are
able to control for pre-lottery voting behavior using the 2013 file, but not the 2010 file. We
supplement both files with a “cancelled voter” file that we obtained in June 2015 and used to
replace a small number of missing voting records for registered individuals in the two main files.
Appendix A provides more detail on the data construction.

4. Analytic Framework

Our analytical framework follows the standard approach we have used in our prior analyses of
the Oregon Lottery. We briefly summarize it here.

4.1 Intent-to-Treat Effect of the Lottery (ITT)
Our treatment group is comprised of those selected in the lottery and our controls are those who
were not. We estimate the intent-to-treat (ITT) effect of winning the lottery (i.e. the difference
between treatment and controls) by fitting the following OLS equation:

yih = β0 + β1LOTTERYh + Xih β2 +Vih β3 + εih                                 (1)

where i denotes an individual and h denotes a household.




                                                                                                     6
LOTTERY is an indicator variable for whether or not household h was selected by the lottery.
The coefficient on LOTTERY (β1) is the main coefficient of interest, and gives the average
difference in (adjusted) means between the treatment group (the lottery winners) and the control
group (those not selected by the lottery); it is interpreted as the impact of being able to apply for
OHP Standard through the Oregon lottery.

We denote by Cih the set of covariates that are correlated with treatment probability (and
potentially with the outcome) and therefore must be controlled for so that estimates of β1 give an
unbiased estimate of the relationship between winning the lottery and the outcome. In all of our
analyses, Cih includes indicator variables for the number of individuals in the household listed on
the lottery sign-up form (hereafter “household size”); although the state randomly sampled from
individuals on the list, the entire household of any selected individual was considered selected
and eligible to apply for insurance. As a result, selected (treatment) individuals are
disproportionately drawn from households of larger household size. In all of our analyses we
cluster the standard errors on the household identifier since the treatment is at the household
level.

We denote by Vih a second set of covariates that can be included to potentially improve power by
accounting for chance differences between treatment and control groups in variables that may be
important determinants of outcomes. These covariates are not needed for β1 to give an unbiased
estimate of the relationship between winning the lottery and the outcome, as they are not related
to treatment status, but may improve the precision of the estimates by explaining some of the
variance in the outcome. Our primary analysis includes no such Vih covariates, but we also show
that our results are robust to including pre-lottery voting behavior as an additional, Vih covariate.

4.2 Local Average Treatment Effect of Medicaid (LATE)

The intent-to-treat estimates from equation (1) provide an estimate of the causal effect of
winning the lottery (i.e. winning the opportunity to apply for OHP Standard). This provides an
estimate of the net impact of expanding eligibility for public health insurance. We are also
interested in the impact of insurance coverage itself. We model this as follows:

yih = π 0 + π 1INSURANCEih + Xihπ 2 +Vihπ 3 + ν ih                                     (2)

where INSURANCE is a measure of insurance coverage and all other variables are as defined in
equation (1). Specifically, we define INSURANCE as an indicator variable for Medicaid
coverage at any point from the first lottery notification through the latest outcome analyzed. In
previous work we found that the lottery had no impact on non-Medicaid sources of insurance
coverage, such as private insurance (Finkelstein et al., 2012). In prior work, we found a first
stage (i.e. impact of winning the lottery on probability of being enrolled in Medicaid during the
one- or two-year study period) of about 0.25. This is primarily due to incomplete takeup among
lottery winners: only about 60 percent of those who won sent back applications, and about half


                                                                                                        7
of those who sent back applications were deemed ineligible, primarily due to failure to meet the
income eligibility threshold (Finkelstein et al., 2012).

We estimate equation (2) by two stage least squares (2SLS), using the following first stage
equation:

!"#$%&"'()* = ,- + ,/ 0122(%3* + 4)* ,5 + 6)* ,7 + 8)*                                                             (3)

in which the excluded instrument is the variable LOTTERY. We interpret the coefficient on
insurance from instrumental variable estimation of equation (2) as the local average treatment
effect of insurance, or LATE (Imbens and Angrist, 1994). In other words, our estimate of π1
identifies the causal impact of insurance among the subset of individuals who obtain insurance
upon winning the lottery but who would not obtain insurance without winning the lottery (i.e. the
compliers).

The LATE interpretation requires the additional identifying assumption that the only mechanism
through which winning the lottery affected the outcomes studied was the lottery’s impact on
insurance coverage. As discussed in the introduction, this exclusion restriction may well be
violated.

4.3 Analytic Weights

Our analysis takes place at several different points in time: November 2008 voting, June 2010
registration, voting through June 2010 (excluding November 2008), and November 2010 voting.
As in previous work (Baicker et al., 2013), for analyses of outcomes in Fall 2009 or later, we use
weights to adjust for a new lottery for OHP Standard which the state conducted beginning in the
fall of 2009; Appendix B describes these weights in more detail.

4.4 Balance

A central question in any analysis of a state-conducted randomization is whether the state
actually randomized as they described. We have explored this extensively in prior work (see
especially Finkelstein et al. 2012) and showed both via simulations and pre-lottery balance tests
that the state appears to have randomized as indicated.3


5. Results: Voting and Registration

Table 1 shows the results for voter turnout in the November 2008 general election, overall and
by pre-specified categories. This and all subsequent tables follow the same format: we present


3
 For completeness, Appendix Table A1 shows treatment and control balance on pre-randomization demographic
characteristics (“lottery list variables”) as well as whether the individual voted prior to the lottery (i.e. in a 2006 or
2007 election), and confirms that, as expected, these characteristics are similar between the treatment and control
prior to the lottery.


                                                                                                                             8
the control mean in column 2, the impact of lottery selection on the outcome (i.e. intent-to-treat
analysis) in column 3, the first stage impact of lottery selection on Medicaid coverage in column
4, the impact of Medicaid coverage on the outcome (i.e. IV analysis) in column 5, and the p-
value (which is the same for the intent-to-treat and IV analyses) in column 6. We focus our
discussion on the impact of Medicaid (column 5).

Panel A shows the results for voter turnout in November 2008, using three different measures of
voting: as measured in the 2010 data, as measured in the 2013 data, and as measured in the 2013
data, controlling for whether the individual voted in any pre-lottery election (i.e. in 2006 or
2007). The results indicate that Medicaid increased the probability of voting, although the results
range from statistically significant, to marginally significant, to marginally insignificant
depending on the specification. The point estimates indicate that Medicaid increased the
probability of voting in the November 2008 general election by 2.1 to 2.5 percentage points,
depending on the specification. This represents a 6 to 7 percent increase off the 33-34 percent
voting rate among the controls.

Panel B looks at results separately by pre-specified cuts of the data. The most striking pattern is
by gender. In the control group, voting rates are somewhat higher among women (37 percent)
than men (30 percent), but the impact of Medicaid on voting appears to be entirely concentrated
among men. Medicaid increased the probability of voting for women by a statistically
insignificant 0.4 percentage points (p-value = 0.83). By contrast, Medicaid increased the
probability of voting for men by a statistically significant 5.4 percentage points (p-value =
0.004); this represents an 18 percent increase in the probability of men voting relative to the
control group. There is also some evidence of larger effects in democratic counties – i.e. counties
where the majority voted for Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election. In such counties,
Medicaid increased the probability of voting by 3.6 percentage points (p-value = 0.048) or about
10 percent; in non-Democratic counties, Medicaid increased the probability of voting by a
statistically insignificant 0.8 percentage points (p-value = 0.74) or about 2 percent. Appendix
Table A2 shows these results are robust to measuring voting in the 2013 data instead of in the
2010 data, and also to controlling for whether the individual voted in a pre-lottery election in
2006 or 2007.

Table 2 looks at the impact of Medicaid on voter registration, which we measure as of June 2010
in the 2010 data. None of the results are statistically significant but the patterns are of interest,
especially when viewed alongside the turnout results from Table 1. In particular, the groups that
experienced larger increases in voter turnout – men and individuals in democratic counties – also
experienced larger increases in the probability of being registered to vote. The magnitudes are
also roughly similar. For example, we estimate that Medicaid increased the probability of being
registered in a democratic county by 3.7 percentage points and the probability of voting in a
democratic county by 3.6 percentage points. Likewise, we estimate that Medicaid increased the
probability of a man voting in the November 2008 election by 5.4 percentage points, and of a
man being registered to vote by 3.6 percentage points. We interpret this as suggestive evidence


                                                                                                    9
that the increase in voting may primarily reflect new voter registrations, rather than increased
turnout among pre-existing registrants.

Table 3 looks at voter turnout in other post-lottery elections. Panel A analyzes voter turnout in
the statewide November 2010 election. Once again, we present three different specifications (as
in Table 1) with broadly similar results. Turnout is lower in the 2010 midterm election (about
one-quarter rather than one-third for the 2008 election). There is no evidence that Medicaid
increased turnout in the November 2010 election; indeed, the point estimates are suggestive of a
possible decline in voting. In Panel B we examine voting in any post-lottery election through
June 2010 except for the November 2008 election; these consist of local elections, primaries, or
state-wide special elections that ran from late May 2008 through June 2010 (see Table A3 for
details). Once again there is no evidence of an increase in voter turnout due to Medicaid. The
point estimates are suggestive of a statistically insignificant 2.4 percentage point (over 10
percent) increase in voting (p-value = 0.11).

Overall the results in Table 3 suggest that the impact of Medicaid on voting in the November
2008 election does not persist over subsequent elections. This finding admits two – very different
– possible interpretations. One is that the impact of Medicaid on voting is confined to
presidential elections, or other high turnout elections. For our study population, voter turnout is
at least 50 percent higher in the November 2008 election than in either of the other two elections
we studied; Medicaid may only affect the marginal voter in such high-turnout elections. Another
possibility is that the impacts of Medicaid coverage dissipate over time. Given the
complementary findings from Clinton and Sances (2018) that the 2014 ACA Medicaid expansion
increased voter turnout in the 2014 election but not the 2016 (presidential) election, we read the
evidence as overall suggestive of an immediate, but temporary impact of Medicaid.

6. Conclusion

Decisions to expand or contract public benefit programs in general and public health insurance
plans in particular are often politically fraught, not least because of the implications for resource
allocation across groups. These issues are compounded by the differential voting patterns of
affected groups, and further complicated by the effect that program coverage might have on
voting behavior.

Despite the first-order importance of these questions, evidence of the causal effect of public
benefit programs on voter behavior in the US is limited. This paper examines the impact of a
major public program in the US, Medicaid, on voter registration and voter turnout. To do so, we
take advantage of a 2008 policy in Oregon that randomly assigned access to Medicaid to assess
the causal effect of Medicaid on turnout and registration. We find significant impacts on voter
turnout – particularly among men and in Democratic counties – that show up immediately after
the Medicaid expansion but do not persist two years later.




                                                                                                   10
Our finding of a temporary impact of the 2008 Oregon Medicaid expansion on voter turnout is
similar to what Clinton and Sances (2018) found in the context of the 2014 ACA Medicaid
expansions. This is striking since the political discourse surrounding the two Medicaid
expansions was very different. The Oregon Medicaid expansion stemmed from a state agency’s
decision about a fair way to allocate a limited number of available slots, and was not particularly
partisan or politicized. By contrast, the ACA Medicaid expansions were highly politicized and
partisan.

A “fade out” effect on voter turnout in these two very different climates suggests that the
temporary nature of Medicaid’s effect on turnout may be a more general result. This in turn
raises an intriguing puzzle, as neither resource effects nor interpretive effects are obviously
transitory in nature. Moreover, evidence that voting is habit forming (e.g. Plutzer 2002, Gerber et
al. 2003) would further suggest a permanent impact of Medicaid on voter turnout. The finding
from these two different studies of a temporary impact of Medicaid on voting presents a critical
puzzle for future work. More broadly, our results contribute important insights about the
relationship between the social safety net and democratic governance.

Notes: The first stage variable is an indicator for Medicaid coverage at any point from the first lottery
notification through the November 2008 election. In Panel A, different rows use different data pulls (as
indicated) and the third row additionally includes an indicator variable for whether the individual voted in a
pre-lottery election (defined as having voted in at least one of the 2006 or 2007 elections shown in Table
A3). Results in Panel B all use the 2010 data pull. Column (3) shows the intent-to-treat estimates from
equation (1); column (4) shows the first stage estimates from equation (3); column (5) shows the IV
estimates of the impact of Medicaid coverage using the lottery as an instrument for Medicaid from equation
(2). All analyses are unweighted, include controls for household size, and adjust the standard errors for
household clusters.

Appendix A: Voting Data

The statewide voter list is maintained by the Office of the Secretary of State, Elections Office, in
Oregon. The state’s data distinguish between three types of voters: active, inactive, and
cancelled. An “active” voter is someone who has voted or re-registered within the last 5 years. In
Oregon, people who do not vote for more than 5 years need to re-register to remain active. Only
registered individuals may vote, and they must update their voter registration in the case of a
move, a name change, or if they wish to register or change an association with a political party
(OregonLaws, Chapter 247). An “inactive” voter is someone who has not voted or re-registered
in five years; in addition, individuals may be moved from the active to the inactive file for
various administrative reasons (such as being incarcerated or having a bounced-back ballot
mailing or a signature challenge that the individual did not respond to). “Cancelled” voters are
individuals who are “inactive” for five years, who die, we are found to be registered in another
state.

We obtained three separate individual-level data sets from the Oregon Secretary of State’s
Election Division. The two main data sets we use were received in June 2010 (hereafter “2010
data”) and July 2013 (hereafter “2013 data”). Each of these data sets contains a list of currently
active voters, currently inactive voters, and a voting history over a series of preceding elections.
There are two key differences between these files. First, they provide information on the list of
“active” voters at two different points in time. Second, they contain voting histories for different
elections. Specifically, the 2010 data contain voting information on elections from May 2008
through May 2010 while the 2013 file contain voting data on elections from May 2006 through
May 2012, but omit some smaller local elections included in the 2010 data.

We received a third data set in July 2015 that contains a list of all names that were placed on the
“cancelled” voter list from 2006 on (hereafter “cancelled voter” data); since voters may remain
on the cancelled voter file indefinitely, names in this file may or may not appear in the 2010 and
2013 data.

We probabilistically matched each of these three data sets to the Oregon Health Insurance
Experiment lottery list using LinkPlus software. The match was done based on full name, date of
birth, and gender and followed the matching procedure done in earlier work with the lottery list
(see e.g. Finkelstein et al. 2012). Due to the protected nature of the lottery data, matching of the
lottery data to the voting data was done on a secure, non-networked computer, and all identifiers
were removed before analysis.

Individuals on the lottery list could thus match to each of the voter files or not. For each election
represented in each voter file (e.g. 2008 election as described in the 2010 voter data file), lottery
list members who matched could be characterized as having voted, being registered for the
election but not having voted, or not having a record for that particular election (e.g. having

                                                                                                   19
registered to vote in 2009, so not having a voting record for 2008). For individuals on the lottery
list who have missing voting records in each of 2010 and 2013 data pulls - either because they
did not match to the voting file or matched but had no record for particular elections - we match
them to voting information in the cancelled voter file. If matched, we replace these people’s
missing voting records in 2010 or 2013 data with records from the cancelled voter data.

We use these data to define two main outcomes of interest:

Registration: We measure registration – and the political party the individual is registered with
– as of June 22, 2010 in the 2010 data pull. Specifically, we define any one on the active voter
file as of that date as registered as of that date.

Voting: We measure whether the individual voted in various elections. Specifically we measure
whether the individual voted in:

   •   November 2008 general election. Our baseline specification measures this in the 2010
       data pull. We also measure this same outcome (whether the individual voted in the
       November 2008 general election) in the 2013 data.
   •   November 2010 statewide election – measured in the 2013 data pull
   •   Any election post-lottery through June 2010 except the November 2008 election. These
       were local elections, primaries, or statewide special elections that ran from 5/27/2008
       through 6/1/2010. They are listed in Table A3.
   •   2006 and 2007 elections. These data are only available in the 2013 data. We use them
       both to test for balance in voting behavior pre-lottery and as a control variable to increase
       power in studying the impact of Medicaid on post-lottery voting using the 2013 data. The
       2010 data do not contain these pre-lottery elections.

As noted above, in each data set, if the individual is missing a voting record, we tried to match
them to the voting information in the cancelled voter file and if we found a match, we replaced
the missing voting record with information from the cancelled voter file. In practice, this resulted
in few additional voters. For example in the 2010 data, we added 130 voters (0.5 percent) to the
November 2008 election, and in the 2013 data we added 927 additional voters to the November
2008 election.

Assessing data quality

Not everyone in the 2010 voter files appears in the 2013 voter files (and vice versa). Table A4
summarizes these results before we merge the cancelled voter data with 2010 or 2013 data pulls.
For example, it shows that of 43,201 people in the 2010 voter files (active or inactive), only
37,310 are in the 2013 voter files. Likewise, of the 40,819 people in the 2013 voter files, only
37,310 are in the 2010 voter files. There are several potential reasons for this. First, there could
be matching noise introduced by our probabilistic matching techniques. Second, there could be
genuine entry into the data between 2010 and 2013, due to new registrations. Third, there could


                                                                                                  20
be genuine exit from the data between 2010 and 2013, due to individuals being moved to the
“cancelled” file because of death, incarceration, a move out of state, remaining inactive for 5
years, or other administrative reasons.

Reassuringly, we found that only 170 people (0.2 percent of the lottery list) enter the data
between 2010 and 2013 and are recorded as having voted in the 2008 election; these presumably
reflect errors in our probabilistic match. Likewise, of the 32,383 people who have a voting record
(yes/no) in 2008 recorded in the 2010 and 2013 data, only 12 (<0.01 percent) have a different
outcome recorded. These checks suggest only a small amount of noise in our measures.

Our primary concern, however, is not with noise (mis-measurement, mis-matching, attrition etc.)
per se, but the potential for endogenous selection into the sample based on post-lottery behavior.
For example, if the lottery affected voting behavior in 2008, and voting behavior in 2008
affected presence in the 2010 files (i.e. someone who might otherwise have been moved to
“cancelled” is maintained), then using information in the 2010 file to infer the effect of the
lottery on voting behavior in 2008 would be contaminated by differential selection of treatment
and control groups into the sample. Likewise, any impact the lottery had on mortality or moves
out of state could also affect our ability to measure 2008 or 2010 voting behavior. Reassuringly,
our prior analysis shows no substantial effect of the lottery on mortality (Finkelstein et al., 2012),
but the other avenues still have the potential to affect the sample we observe.

Fortunately, we were able to obtain the list of all names placed in the cancelled voter file since
2006, which should capture any exit from our data between 2010 and 2013 due to individuals
being moved to the “cancelled” file. About 50 percent, or 2,987, of “exited voters” (those who
matched in 2010 but not 2013 data) can be found in the cancelled voter data. Beyond that, we
also find 4 percent, or 1,092, of lottery list individuals who did not appear in either 2010 or 2013
data in the cancelled voter file.

In Table A5 and A6 we cross tabulate the match status in cancelled and 2010 data files with
respect to voting records of November 2008 and November 2010 elections in order to assess the
quality of the cancelled voter file. In particular, we want to see how many missing voting records
can be found in cancelled voter file, and how often there are conflicting voting records between
the cancelled file and other two data sets. The results show that, cases of conflicting voting
records are rare (<10 cases or <0.1 percent of exiting records in both elections), while the file
only helps us fill in a marginal share of missing voting records among the lottery list individuals
- 0.3 percent and 0.7 percent in November 2008 and November 2010 elections, respectively.

Since there are still 50 percent of unexplained exits between 2010 and 2013 data, we performed
two additional tests for potential endogenous measurement as mentioned earlier. First, we looked
at whether entry or exit between 2010 and 2013 was correlated with treatment status. Second,
using the 2013 file, we analyzed whether pre-lottery (2006 or 2007) voting was correlated with




                                                                                                   21
treatment status. Both tests use updated 2010 and/or 2013 data sets after the inclusion of voting
records from the cancelled file. In each case we ran the following regression:

!"# = &' + &) *+,,-./# + 0"# &1 + 2"#                                       (1)

where i indexes individuals and h indexes households, LOTTERY is an indicator for whether
household h was selected in the lottery. Xih includes controls for household size indicators.
Standard errors are clustered on the household.

Table A7 shows the results, which are reassuring. The top panel shows that the probability of
voting in the pre-lottery period is balanced between treatment and control, and the bottom panel
shows that entry into and exit out of the data sets are also balanced.




                                                                                                22
Appendix B: Analytic Weights

For analyses of outcomes in fall 2009 or later, we use weights to adjust for a new lottery for OHP
Standard which the state conducted beginning in the fall of 2009. These weights were previously
used in Baicker et al. (2013).

At the start of the new lottery, the state mailed postcards to those on the original list that were not
selected (our controls) asking if they would like to be included in this second lottery. Those who
returned the postcard were added to the new waiting list and an initial draw was done just from
that group. Following that initial draw, the state opened the new waiting list to the general public
(including both our controls and our treatments as well people not on our original list); drawings
from this list were conducted approximately monthly. Unlike the original 2008 waiting list, the
new waiting list remained continuously open: individuals could sign up at any point. As with the
original lottery, draws were done on individuals, but the opportunity to apply for OHP Standard
(the treatment) was extended to the whole household. After each drawing, we probabilistically
matched (using LinkPlus software) the new waiting list to our study population to identify
individuals who were eligible for selection by the state (called “opt-ins”) and those who were
actually selected in a given drawing (called “selected opt-ins”). By December 6, 2010 the state
had selected everyone in our original sample who signed up for the new lottery.

Given the difficulty in interpreting the “treatment” received by those who were drawn in the new
lottery, we drop the selected opt-ins from our analytic sample and use weights to correct for this.
For each lottery drawing, the set of opt-ins is not a random sample of our study population:
signing up for the new list was optional, and thus subject to the influence of factors such as
underlying health. However, the set of selected opt-ins is a random sample of the opt-ins. We
therefore use weights to adjust for the individuals dropped because of the second lottery using
the following principle: within any (even non-random) subset of the original study population, a
randomly selected group can be weighted to stand in for the non-selected remainder based on the
probability of that random selection.

The weights we use are roughly analogous to weighting done for censoring or attrition in
longitudinal data (Cole and Hernán, 2008, Kalton, 1986). As in those settings, we weight each
observation at each time point by the inverse probability of being in the sample, and we generate
overall weights as the product of the weights across all time points. We do not need to model the
probability of being selected in the new lottery as a function of covariates; we know the process
was random and we can observe the selection proportions.

More specifically, let +3 be the set of opt-ins in our study population eligible for new lottery
drawing on date t. Let 43 be the set of opt-ins selected in drawing on date t. We define the
weight for individual i to be:




                                                                                                    23

                  ):;<
                         7= 7 7> +3 ?>@ 7> 43
       53 (7) = 9          0 7= 7 7> 43                                           (2)
                         1 7= 7 >CD 7> +3

where E3 is the probability of an opt-in being selected.

Selection probabilities varied by the number of household members on the new list, so in all
cases, we estimated the selection probability separately by strata of “tickets” (household
members on the new waiting list at time t).

The final analytic weight W is simply the product all the weights wt introduced up to the end
date. This end date is chosen based on the date of the outcome analyzed. Analysis of different
outcomes use different weights.

We refer to the set of weights by their end date (i.e. June 2010 weights use the product of
weights up through June 2010). Analyses of November 2008 voting are unweighted (since this
occurred prior to the lottery). Analyses of registration (as of June 2010), and of “any other
election in the data” (which includes elections through June 1, 2010), use the June 2010 weights;
analyses of November 2010 voting use the November 2010 weights.

Table A8 shows the distribution of the June 2010 and November 2010 weights. One can see that
the November 2010 weights involve a much greater share of individuals with zero weights (and a
higher upweighting of the remaining individuals), reflecting several large new lottery draws that
occurred between those dates. The control group is far more impacted by the weights than the
treatment group as they were more likely to sign up for the new lottery.

The voting in November 2008 precedes the new lottery so the analysis is unweighted. The June
2010 registration and voting through June 2010 uses weights to account for new lottery draws
through June 2010. The November 2010 voting analysis uses weights to account for new lottery
draws through November 2010. As the new lottery progressed, the weights become more
extreme, which has a potential precision cost.

Notes: We report the coefficient on LOTTERY from estimating equation (1) on the dependent variable shown in the first column. All dependent variables are measured
based on the lottery sign up, except for “every voted in the pre-period” which is defined as voting in a 2006 or 2007 election, as measured in the 2013 data pull and the
cancelled voter file. All regressions include indicators for the number of household members on the lottery list, adjust standard errors for household clusters. Columns (1)-
(3) are unweighted, (4)-(6) use weights through June 2010, and (7)-(9) use weights through November 2010. The final rows report the pooled F-statistics (and p-values)
from testing treatment-control balance on sets of variables jointly.

Notes: This table resembles Panel B of Table 1 except that results all use the 2013 data pull. The first stage
variable is an indicator for Medicaid coverage at any point from the first lottery notification through the
November 2008 election. Column (3) shows the intent-to-treat estimates from equation (1); column (4) shows
the first stage estimates from equation (3); column (5) shows the IV estimates of the impact of Medicaid
coverage using the lottery as an instrument for Medicaid from equation (2). All analyses are unweighted,
include controls for household size, and adjust the standard errors for household clusters. Panel B additionally
includes an indicator variable for whether the individual voted in a pre-lottery election (defined as having
voted in at least one of the 2006 or 2007 elections shown in Table A3).

Notes: “Missing” from the 2008 November voting data means that the individual is matched to the voting
data but we have no record of whether she voted in that election. That could be, for example, because she
was registered to vote after that election (but before the data pull).

Notes: “Missing” from the 2008 November voting data means that the individual was not registered at the
time of the election. We replace voting records in the 2010 data that are “not matched” or “missing” with

Notes: “Missing” from the 2010 November voting data means that the individual was not registered at the
time of the election. We replace voting records in the 2013 data that are "not matched" or "missing" with
matched voting records from the cancelled voter file.

Notes: We report the coefficient on LOTTERY from estimating equation (1) on the
dependent variable shown in the first column. All regressions include indicators for
the number of household members on the lottery list, adjust standard errors for
household clusters, and are unweighted. The first three rows (analyzing voting in pre-
lottery elections) use data from the 2013 data pull and the cancelled voter data. “Voted
in any 2006 or 2007 election” includes the November 2006 state elections and the
November 2007 special election (including 2 ballot measures) in the previous rows, as
well as the May 2006 and May 2007 primaries. “Entry” is an indicator for individuals
who appear in the 2013 data pull but not in the 2010 data pull or the cancelled voter
file. “Exit” is an indicator for individuals who appeared in the 2010 data pull but not
in the 2013 data pull or the cancelled voter file.

Notes: Table shows the distribution of weights used to account for the new health insurance lottery that
started in the fall of 2009. The top two panels (June 2010 weights) display the distribution of weights used
to analyze registration and voting in elections (excluding the 2008 general election and the 2010 midterms),
accounting for new lottery selection through June 1, 2010. The bottom two panels (November 2010
weights) report weights used to analyze voting in the 2010 Midterms, accounting for new lottery selection
through November 4, 2010.
