                 The Resolution of the Labor Scarcity Paradox

                                   ABSTRACT



     This paper reconciles the apparently contradictory evidence about

American and British technology in the first half of the nineteenth century.

Past studIes have focused on the writings of a number of distinguished British

engineers, who toured the United States during the 1850s and comented

extensively on the highly mechanized state of the manufacturing sector. Other

studies, however, have marshalled evidence that the interest rate was higher,

and the aggregate manufacturing capital stock was lower, in the United States

relative to Britain. We resolve this paradox by noting that British engineers

were most impressed by only a few industries which relied on skilled

workers. Using the 1849 Census of Manufactures, we estimate separate

production functions for the skilled sector and for the remaining, less

skilled manufacturing sector. We find strong relative complementarity between

capital and natural resources in the skilled sector, and relative

substitutability between skilled labor and capital. Using these parameters in

a computable general equilibrium model of the U.S. and British economies

indicates greater capital intensity (or labor scarcity) in the skilled

manufacturing sector, but overall capital scarcity and higher interest rates,

in the U.S. relative to Britain.

             A Most ingenious paradox! —— The Pirates of Penzance




      The influence of factor endowments on the pattern and rate of economic

 growth is an important theme in economic history and development. In partic-

 ular, the rapid expansion of nineteenth—century American manufacturing has

 often been attributed, both by observers at the time and later economic

 historians, to the influence of abundant land. Most notably, Rothbarth (1946)

 and I-Iabakkuk (1962) have argued that the land to labor ratio, which was higher

in the U.S. than in Britain, raised real wages in American agriculture,

thereby increasing the cost of labor to manufacturers. In turn, the higher

wage rate in American manufacturing induced entrepreneurs to substitute

capital for the dearer labor, leading to a pattern of growth more capital

intensive and more rapid than that in Britain.

     Temin (1966) formalized the Rothbarth—Habakkuk hypothesis in a simple

neoclassical model of agricultural and manufacturing production. While abun-

dant land in agriculture implied relative labor scarcity in manufacturing, the

model also implied that the U.S. interest rate should have been lower than in

Britain. Because the U.S. interest rate in the antebellum period was in fact

greater than the British rate, he concluded that U.S. had to have been capital

scarce rather than labor scarce in manufacturing. That is, although labor may

ha.ve been dear, capital was even dearer.

     This anomalous conclusion provoked a vigorous and enduring controversy.

Those supporting the Rothbarth—Habakkuk view sought to restore the labor

scarcity result in more general models in which all three factors of produc-

tion (labor, capital, and land) are used in the production of both outputs

(Fogel, 1967; Summers and Clarke, 1980).1 On the other hand, Field (1983a, b)
                                     2




has marshalled empirical evidence that the U.S. capital—labor ratio was far

below that in Britain. None of these studies, however, provides a plausible

explanation for all of the empirical regularities in the antebellum economy.

The problem with the capital scarcity view of U.S. manufacturing is that one

must simply ignore the reports of many distinguished visitorsto the antebel-

lum United States who found in a number of industries mechanization more

advanced than in Britain, at that time supposedly the most technically devel-

oped and capital rich country in the world. The difficulty with the labor

scarcity hypothesis is that it cannot explain the strong historical evidence

that the aggregate capital—labor ratio in manufacturing was lower, and that

the interest rate was higher, in the United States.

     This paper reconciles these apparent contradictions and resolves the long

debate on labor scarcity by distinguishing between manufacturing industries

using primarily skilled workers and those relying on unskilled workers. We

show that the technological compatibility between capital and natural re-

sources in the skilled manufacturing sector provided sufficient incentives to

substitute capital and inexpensive natural resources for skilled labor. This

strong technological complementarity did not extend to the less skilled sec-

tor, however; thus while the skilled sector was relatively capital intensive,

the less skilled sector (accounting for the great majority of total

manufacturing output), and hence the aggregate manufacturing sector, was

relatively capital scarce. Furthermore, this argument is not just limited to

demonstrating that such a theoretical structure could have generated the labor

scarcity result, but is instead firmly based on historical evidence from the

antebellum period.

     The British engineers who visited the United States picked out only a few

industries, primarily those employing skilled workers, for special notice.

 Matching those industries with 1850 Census of Manufactures classifications

 allows the estimation of two separate production functions, one for "skilled"

 industries, and one for "unskilled" industries. These parameters are then

 instituted in a three good, four factor computable general equilibrium model

based on the agricultural and manufacturing sectors of the U.S. economy in

1849. The model is strictly neoclassical, dealing with aggregated factors of

production taken to be the same across countries. Even if the machines, the

nature of skilled labor, and capital—labor relations in manufacturing differed

between America and Britain (e.g., Lazonick, 1981), such complications are not

essential to explaining the labor scarcity result and reconciling the

empirical evidence. However, the standard assumption is made that the United

States and Britain faced the same technology so that the same range of

productive techniques was available to entrepreneurs in both countries (Temin,

1966, pp. 283—284; Habakkuk, p. 215).2 Therefore the model is also

appropriate for Britain as well. By substituting British factor endowments

and then simulating the model, we generate factor returns and factor input

ratios. This simulation allows us to compare the capital—labor ratios in

America and Britain for both skilled and unskilled manufacturing. While

direct quantitative evidence on these factor intensities has not been

available, our model allows us to generate the relevant capital—labor ratios

necessary to resolve the labor scarcity controversy. It is shown that the

model produces results consistent both with the labor scarcity result and with

the existing body of empirical evidence on factor and product prices in both

countries.

     Section I surveys the labor scarcity debate, one of the longest lived in

economic history. The model is specified and the data are described in

                                       I.




      A number of foreign visitors during the first half of the nineteenth

century commented on the sophistication of equipment in some sectors of U.S.

manufacturing (Habakkuk, 1962, pp. 4—5; David, 1975, pp. 20—21). However, it

was   the American displays at the Crystal Palace Exhibition of 1851 that pro-
duced widespread surprise at the state of mechanization in so primitive a
country.   Many Britons were forced to admit grudgingly, "Yankees are no longer

to be ridiculed, much less despised" (Rodgers, p. 89). Two years later, a

group of English commissioners, charged with reporting on exhibits at the New

York Exhibition and not finding it open on time, took the opportunity instead

to tour about and report on the state of American technology. The Special

Reports to parliament of George Wallis and Joseph Whitworth, as well as the

report of the Select Committee on Small Arms (1854), together constituted

perhaps the most detailed and reliable description available of antebellum

U.S. manufacturing. Joseph Whitworth, one of the most prominent engineers of

his time and the world's foremost manufacturer of machine tools (Rosenberg,

1969, pp. 1, 20), confirmed earlier reports on the advanced state of

mechanization when he characterized U.S. production by "the application of

machinery wherever it has been practicable to manufacturers" (Rosenberg, 1969,

p. 388) and argued that this was the consequence of the scarcity and high

costs of labor (p. 28).
                                      S




      The effects of this higher labor cost, linked by Rothbarth (1946) and

 Habakkuk (1962) to land abundance, was reformulated by Temin (1966) who

 attempted to distinguish between the problems of technological practice and

 technological progress. Land abundance implied first that U.S. manufacturing

 was capital intensive relative to Britain, the "more machines" argument, and

 secondly that technical progress was both more rapid and more labor saving in

 the U.S., the "better machines" argument. The former he formalized in a

 simple two—sector general equilibrium model which, as we have noted, led him

to conclude that U.S. manufacturing must have been capital scarce relative to

Britain because of the higher U.S. interest rate.

     Fogel (1967) showed that it was possible to restore the labor scarcity

result in a more complex model based on Cobb—Douglas production functions with

three inputs in each sector rather than the two Temin had specified.3 Elab-

orating on this model, Summers and Clarke (1980) dropped the Temin assumption

that the U.S. was a small country with prices fixed internationally, instead

allowing for less than perfectly elastic product demand. They solved the

model analytically, obtaining the result that labor scarcity in manufacturing

depends on the elasticity of demand for agricultural products --   if   demand

were inelastic then land abundance, by lowering agricultural prices and wages,

would lead to an increased supply of manufacturing labor, thus contradicting

the Rothbarth-Habakkuk hypothesis.4 However, with perfect international

capital mobility so that the interest rate is taken as given, the case which

they argue was historically relevant, the traditional labor scarcity result

was restored.

     Other writers have objected to the restrictions of the Cobb-Douglas

production specification, which was imposed a priori without supporting evi-

dence. Most importantly, Rosenberg (1969, 1977) has emphasized the role of
                                       6




 natural resource abundance in biasing U.S. manufacturing towards capital-

 intensive techniques. In an ambitious attempt to reintegrate the "more ma-

 chines" and "better machines" components of the Rothbarth—Habakkuk thesis,

 David (1975) developed a theory of induced technical change which linked local

 technical change and the process of factor substitution. The abundance of

 land or natural resources, taken to have been a relative complement with

 capital, encouraged the choice of capital—intensive techniques in manufac-

 turing. In turn, the higher wage—rental ratio induced a pattern of localized

 technical change such that globally technical progress was more rapid and more

 labor—saving in the U.S.

      Finally, in contrast to the succession of post—Temjri models attempting to

 reestablish the Rothbarth—Habakkuk proposition, Field (1983a, b) argued that

American manufacturing was substantially less capital intensive than in

Britain. He supported this argument by comparing estimates of aggregate

capital stock in the respectiv.e countries for the mid-nineteenth century, and

by documenting the speed and intensity of capital operation by U.S.

entrepreneurs. A two-sector, two-region linear Leontief model was then

developed to demonstrate that a higher interest/profit rate would lead a

country such as the U.S. to adopt lower manufacturing capital intensity.

     The debate on labor scarcity has not been conclusive. The focus has

shifted from Habakkuk's documentation of American and British technological

development in the nineteenth century to the formulation of general theoret—

ical models assessing the impact of land abundance. There has been too much

concentration on comparing alternative models in which labor scarcity may or

may not occur and too little concentration on empirical evidence to determine

the appropriate model. Indeed, one of the remarkable features of this long

controversy is how little attention has been paid to the "facts".5 At a
                                      7




 minimum, a model explaining (or refuting) the labor scarcity result should be

 consistent with the following three empirical regularities for the antebellum

 period (which are supported in Appendix A):



      1. The United States was relatively capital intensive compared with

 Britain only in a limited number of manufacturing industries. These

 industries in general required primarily skilled rather than unskilled labor.



     2. Both the nominal and the real wage rate were higher in the United

States than In   Britain.


     3. Both the nominal and the real cost of capital were higher in the

United States than in Britain.



     None of the models in the labor scarcity literature can reconcile all

three of these empirical regularities. Temin greatly clarified the issue by

analyzing it in a general equilibrium framework, but by forcing it into the

Procrustean framework of a very simple model, he ignored Habakkuk's fundamen-

tal distinction that U.S. manufacturing was relatively more capital intensive

in only a few industries.6 "In many and probably in most fields of technology

the English were still far ahead of the Americans at this date r1850's]" (p.

5). Why should U.S. entrepreneurs have adopted sophisticated, capital—

intensive technologies relative to Britain in some industries but not in

others? Previous models could not answer such a question because they have

concentrated on demonstrating that the U.S. manufacturing sector as a whole

was labor scarce (or capital scarce), controverting stylized empirical fact

number i. Moreover, previous models have been unable to reconcile general
                                      8




labor scarcity with other empirical evidence. While accepting higher U.S.

interest rates, Temin (1966) and Field (1983a, b) were forced to deny the

United States was relatively labor scarce in manufacturing at all. Summers

and Clarke (1980) supported U.S. relative labor scarcity but only by claiming

that real interest rates were lower in the United States.

     The model presented in the following section, while limiting itself to

the "more machines" and not the "better machines" problem, will be more firmly

rooted in Habakkuk's original specification of the labor scarcity phenomenon

by distinguishing between two sectors of manufacturing. Because the exten-

sively mechanized industries were also characterized by more highly skilled

workers, we characterize those industries as the skilled manufacturing sector;

the other industries comprise the unskilled sector.8 Our resolution of the

labor scarcity controversy is based on the relative complementarity of capital

and natural resources inputs in the skilled sector.

     The complementarity of cheap natural resources provided sufficient incen-

tive for the entrepreneur to invest in the capital—intensive production

process, despite the high interest rates. Thus we can potentially reconcile

the seemingly contradictory evidence that although some industries displayed

ingenuity in the use of labor—saving equipment, the manufacturing sector as a

whole was capital scarce.




                                     II.




     The economy of the antebellum United States is characterized here by a

model with three sectors of production ——   skilled   manufacturing, unskilled

manufacturing, and agricultural goods, and four inputs ——     skilled   labor,
                                      9




unskilled labor, capital, and land. Other sectors extraneous to the argument,

services most importantly, are omitted for simplicity.9 Aggregate factor

endowments are fixed, although some intersectoral factor mobility is allowed.

      Industries were classed in the skilled sector if they were noted,

primarily by Whitworth and Wallis but also by Habakkuk, as being particularly

intensive in the use of machinery relative to Britain. These include

agricultural implements, furniture and other woodwork, machinery, hardware,

nails, clocks, and guns (Habakkuk, p. 4; Rosenberg, 1969, pp. 170—73, 216,

269, 273, 342, 343). We exclude two manufacturing industries, boots and shoes

and cotton textiles, from our group of skilled industries because the

mechanized production processes involving skilled workers were only a small

proportion of the total industry (see Appendix A for documentation).

      We refer to this grouping of industries as the skilled sector, since

their distinctive feature appears to have been a much greater reliance on

skilled labor.'° In 1849, these industries constituted only 7 percent of

total manufacturing output. The 1849 annual wage in these firms was $329,

substantially greater than the $237 average in all other manufacturing and in

large part an indication of a greater concentration of skilled workers.11

Note, however, that the inclusion of an industry in this group depends on

whether it was singled out by Habakkuk and others as being particularly

capital intensive relative to Britain, and not simply on whether industry

wages were above the norm. The skilled sector is taken to hire only skilled

workers, and the unskilled sector is assumed to hire only unskilled workers,

although both labor classes are assumed equally productive in the agricultural
           12
sector..

      Although the industries displaying advanced machinery were held to have

been more capital intensive than their British counterparts, they were not
                                             10



especially capital intensive compared with U.S. manufacturing as a whole. In

1849, the capital—labor ratio for this group was $539 as compared with $559

for all other manufacturing.

        The skilled and unskilled manufacturing sectors are assumed to have

Mukerji (1962) multifactor production functions that allow the partial elasti-

cities of substitution to differ between pairs of factors. Skilled labor,

capital, and agricultural resources are inputs tn the production of skilled

manufacturing products, while unskilled labor, capital, and agricultural pro-

ducts enter .the unskilled sector. The Mukerji generalization of the CES

function holds the ratio of partial elasticities constant over the entire

range of production. This can be seen by referring to the skilled and un-

skilled manufacturing production functions in Table I, which, after some

manipulation, indicate that


                   1+p
                   1+j         i,j,m =   1,2,3,   I   j   m
           im



where           is the partial elasticity of substitution between factors i and j,

   is   the constant production function parameter. The equation holds for the

unskilled sector as well. The function is not necessarily linear homogeneous,

though by appropriate scaling of p or Pu, local linear homogeneity can be

assured. Note also that the production function will generally not be

homothetic; thus at constant factor prices, scale effects will cause differing

proportions of inputs to be used. Agricultural production, by which we mean

natural resources processed sufficiently for use either in the manufacturing

sector or for consumption, is taken to be a constant return to scale Cobb—

Douglas function with inputs labor, capital, and farmland. This function is

also shown in Table I.
                                       11




      The existence of tariffs and transport costs restricted, within a wide

 range of prices, US, and British trading possibilities. The ratio of duties

 to the value of dutiable imports was over 25 percent in 1850 and higher than

 60 percent during some years in the antebellum period; in addition, Habakkuk

 found evidence of wholesale markups between 100-150 percent for imported

 products (p. 41). The existence of tariffs and transportation costs are,

 moreover, necessary to the labor scarcity argument, since they allowed both

 higher interest rates and wages in the United States, given the shared

technology.13 There was, however, significant importation of raw materials

 into Britain, accounting for 40 percent of total domestic agricultural con-

sumption in 1851. To a lesser extent the Americans exported agricultural

output as well. We therefore include an exogenous import and export sector,

in which consumption expenditures on the agricultural product diverge from

output value by the amount of the fixed import or export flow. In order to

maintain trade balance, an equal value of manufacturing goods is either im-

ported (in the U.S.) or exported (in Britain), with the composition of skilled

and unskilled manufacturing imports and exports determined by the proportional

output in each domestic sector. The demand functions, taken to be independent

of the income distribution, are derived from a CES utility function and are

also presented in Table i.14,15

     We next consider the estimation of parameters for the equations specified

in Table I. The nonlinearity of the Mukerji specification precluded robust

estimation of manufacturing production functions, so we adopted the less

restrictive translog production function instead to provide estimates of the

partial elasticities. The translog function was not chosen for the

simulations, however, because of its potential for wandering into non—economic

regions given counterfactual endowments, as well as for potential changes in
                                                   12



the relative substitution elasticities. Using data from the 1850 Census of

Manufactures, the production function with constant returns to scale and

symmetry imposed was estimated concurrently with two cost share equations for

efficiency (Burgess, 1975, p. 110). The estimating equations may be written

as:

        in Q -   in   A =
                            aK
                                 in(K/A) +         in    (L/A) +YKK(1/2(ln K)2
             -   in   K ln A +     1/2(in   A)2] +
                                                         LL112           L)2

             -   in   L in A +     1/2(in   A)2]                K ln L         (la)


             inKinA-lnLlnA+(lnA)2]+a0+UQ
        MK = aK +     KK    ln(K/A) + 1KL in(L/A) + UK

        ML = aL +     KL    ln(K/A) + 1LL ln(L/A) + UL                         (ib)

where K, L, and A denote capital, iabor, and agricultural inputs, and MK and

ML are the cost shares of capitai and iabor, in the respective manufacturing

production functions. The parameters satisfy the restrictions

             = 1                    = 0     ,      i,j   =   K,L,A   .         (2)


      The equations were estimated for skilled manufacturing on a pooled set of

state data by industry and for unskilled manufacturing on data by state using

the iterative Zeliner-efficient estimator which yields asymptotic maximum

likelihood estimates independent of the choice of which share equations are

included.16 The regression results are reported in Table II; remaining para-

meters may be computed using the symmetry and constant returns to scale

restrictions in (2).

      The Allen partial elasticities of substitution implied by the estimated

parameters and evaluated at the sample means are presented in Table iii.17

The substitution elasticity between capital and labor in unskilled manufác—

turing is less than one, a result consistent with other estimates for
                                      13



nineteenth-century u.S. manufacturing (Abraniovitz and David, 1973, P. 434;

James, 1981, p. 383). Moreover, the pattern of inequalities in unskilled

manufacturing, KL < KA < LA' is consistent with that for all U.S. manufac-

turing in the late nineteenth century (James, 1981, P. 383).

     Skilled labor appears to have been a better substitute for capital than

unskilled labor was, although this inference involves comparing parameters

from different production functions. This result is at variance with some

more recent evidence that skilled labor and capital are relative complements

(Griliches, j969; Hamermesh and Grant, 1979, p. 537),18 Substitution between

agricultural goods (or natural resources) and both skilled and unskilled labor

is elastic, with unskilled labor being the better substitute.

     Most importantly for the issues in this paper, the estimates here support

the David-Rosenberg emphasis on the nonseparability of the production function

between capital and natural resources. In both skilled and unskilled

manufacturing, capital and natural resources are relative

complements, KA < LA' although the relative complementarity is much stronger

in the skilled sector. An increase in natural resource inputs implies an

increase in the capital—labor ratio In both sectors (holding factor prices

constant), with a greater increase in the skilled sector.

     The influence of natural resource abundance in influencing the choice of

technique in American manufacturing has often been noted. Whitworth himself,

for example, observed that in the U.S., "In no branch of manufacture does the

application of labour-saving machinery produce by simple means more important

results than in the working of wood" (Rosenberg, 1969, p. 343)., Ames and

Rosenberg (1968) extend the argument in discussing the Springfield Armory.

          There is evidence which suggests that the woodworking
     machines which were popular in America and neglected in
     England were not only labour—saving but also wasteful of
     wood. Their adoption in America and neglect in England
                                                   14



         may be attributable not only —- or perhaps not even pri-
         marily —— to differences in the capital—labor ratios in
         the two countries but rather to the cheapness of wood in
         the United States and its high price in England. (p. 831)

Numerous examples of resource—using tendencies, particularly with lumber, in

American manufacturing are cited in Rosenberg (1972) and Hindle (1975).

        Probably more significant than the use of greater physical amounts of raw

materials in production was the fact that Mierican resource abundance made for

cheaper energy. Christensen (1981) shows that the cost of both water and

steam power per horsepower was lower in•the United States than in Britain in

the late antebellum period. The combination of inexpensive energy (i.e.,

natural resources) and the strong relative complementarity between natural

resources and capital must have provided a strong impetus for the U.S. skilled

        Finally, the factor shares in the Cobb—Douglas agricultural production

function are taken from Fogel and Engerman (1974, pp. 131—133) for antebellum

agriculture, and are also presented in Table iii.20

        Habakkuk emphasized that industrial labor was not only dearer in the

United States, but also that its supply was less elastic (pp. 1546). We

therefore specify an intersectoral labor supply function of the following

form.

function. Noting that the total supply of labor is assumed fixed, so that

LA + Lu + L5 =     L,       we can write the partial elasticity of manufacturing and

agricultural labor supply as


                            I
            =           -

                       L


where CS,        and CA          represent the skilled, unskilled, and agricultural
elasticities, respectively.

     The labor supply elasticity in each manufacturing sector is thus roughly

proportional to             or y; by varying these parameters, we can impose either

greater or less labor mobility in the U.S. economy. Initially we assume a

labor supply elasticity in the United States equal to .30, a value consistent

with recent estimates for less developed countries (Mundlak, 1978). Capital,

on the other hand, is assumed fixed within the agricultural and aggregate

manufacturing sectors; because we know from historical evidence their actual

levels, we need not simulate them. However, capital is assumed perfectly

mobile between the skilled and unskilled manufacturing sectors.

     This model is more Habakkukian In spirit even if not in all exact details

than previous contributions to the labor scarcity debate. However it is still

too simple to reflect the richness of detail and multitudes of conjectures in

Habakkuk's analysis. For example, we neglect the effects of differences in

the price of capital goods across countries,2' as well as those resulting from

greater imperfections in the U.S. labor and product markets, on the choice of
                                        16




capital and labor inputs. Habakkuk argued that average profit rates in U.S.

manufacturing may have been high relative to Britain due to local monopoly

power, but that these profit rates would have fallen rapidly as the firm

expanded past local product and labor markets, thereby providing American

entrepreneurs with Incentives for capital—intensive production methods (pp.

68—69, 74, 75). While these possible discontinuities in the rate of return

are not captured in our model, It is nevertheless complex enough to reconcile

the stylized facts of labor scarcity.

     Table IV presents the historical evidence on outputs of and factor inputs

employed in the agricultural and manufacturing sectors of the United States

and Great Britain in the mid—nineteenth century. This date is an appropriate

one to compare the choice of technique in the U.S. and Britain because the

U.S. labor scarcity question has generally been regarded as an issue only for

the antebellum period and it began to be widely discussed in the 1850's.

Quite conveniently, our stylized Mierican and British economies are very

similar in size at this time, both in terms of total output and output per

capita. As would be expected, however, factor endowments differed

dramatically. While the labor forces in each country were quite similar,

there was more than twice as much capital in Britain (Field, 1983a), but only

one—seventh the land.22

     Finally, consider the foreign sector. The British economy imported

substantial quantities of natural resource products. The total value of

agricultural products (or natural resources) imported into the U.K. minus re—

exports was £72.5 million for 1851 (Mitchell, 1962, pp. 291—292, 297).23

While there are no data for imports into Great Britain alone in 1851, we note

that in 1829, the destination of 98 percent of total U.K. imports was Britain

(Mitchell, 1962, pp. 289—292). Assuming a similar ratio held in 1851 and
                                     17




converting the figures into dollars at the par exchange rate, we find that

imports into Britain amounted to $354.2 million. Similarly, total exports of

crude materials plus crude foodstuffs from the U.S. in 1849 was $94 million.

     The computable general equilibrium model is solved in two steps. In the

first stage, the more detailed U.S. data on output, factor supply, and prices

are used to normalize the production and demand functions. For example, using

observed output, capital stock, labor, and agricultural inputs in skilled

manufacturing, along with estimates of the three elasticities of substitution

from Table 1.11, we can solve for p1. p2, p3, 81, 82, and 83. The final

parameter PS IS then set to ensure local linear homogeneity. Prices of all

final outputs are normalized to $1.00 in the initial U.S. equilibrium.

     The second stage is to calculate the new equilibrium in Great Britain.

We substitute factor endowments in Britain for those of the U.S., and allow

the model to iterate from the production side to the consumption side and back

again until a fixed point set of equilibrium factor and product prices are

realized. Solving the model in this way ensures local stability, although the

model may fail to converge for extreme parameters or odd starting values. The

model determines sectoral output in Great Britain. Together with the relative

prices determined within the structure of the simulation, and actual British

GNP in 1851, $1297.7 million, we can express British price levels relative to

the U.S. numeraire prices.




                                     III




    The simulation results comparing prices and the capital-labor ratio in

the U.S. and Britain are presented in Table V. The factor returns for the
                                     18



United States based on 1849 historical statistics are presented in the first

column. Recall that these returns are not the outcome of the simulation, but

rather are parameters implied by empirical evidence on factor income,

aggregate employment, and capital stock. The skilled wage exceeds the

unskilled wage by 39 percent ($329/$237), while the agricultural wage is

substantially less than the unskilled wage. Although the annual unskilled

wage rate of $237 compares favorably with the $253 wage constructed from evi-

dence on daily wages by Abbott (1905) and Goldin and Sokoloff (1982),24 the

agricultural, wage is well below estimates of average yearly earnings of farm

laborers. However, the problem here is not so much with the model as a more

fundamental difficulty in reconciling agricultural wages implied by national

product account factor shares with those observed directly; even if all the

proceeds of farm output were paid only to workers, they would have still

received a wage of only $183.25 The gross return to fixed capital in the

skilled and unskilled manufacturing sector, as specified in the 1850 Census,

was 0.45 and 0.43, respectively, figures consistent with higher real interest

and depreciation rates in the U.S. (see Appendix A). The divergence between

the return to manufacturing capital and the lower return to agricultural

capital suggests substantial capital immobility. Although our model does not

allow for capital mobility between agricultural and manufacturing sectors,

expanding the definition of manufacturing capital to include working capital

virtually eliminates the divergence in returns.26

     The results in brackets in Table V for the return to capital and for the

capital—labor ratio reflect the adjustment of manufacturing capital to

equalize factor returns, because.in the initial equilibrium the return to

capital in U.S. skilled manufacturing was slightly higher than in unskilled

manufacturing. The parameter values in the brackets therefore correspond to a
                                           19




redistribution of capital within the U.S. manufacturing sector to ensure equal

return to capital.

        Results for the simulated British economy are described in the second

column of Table V. First note that relative prices and wages between Britain

and the U.S. appear quite reasonable. The prices of skilled and unskilled

manufacturing goods are, respectively, 0.45 and 0.70, while the price of

agricultural products is one-third higher than in the United States. The

British prices of manufactured products are substantially lower than U.S.

prices,   but not so low as to preclude the existence of an American manufac-
turing industry once tariffs and transport costs are taken into account. As
noted earlier, the US.    tariff   in   1850 averaged   about 25   percent.   Transport
costs   for raw cotton over the 1840-1860 period, computed by comparing New York

and Liverpool prices, averaged about 15 percent of the final price (Mitchell,

1962, p. 491; U.S. Historical Statistics, 1975, p. 209), and such a figure for

shipping a bulk, easily transportable commodity is most probably a lower bound

for transport costs in general. The protection of distance would have suffi-

ciently insulated the U.S. skilled manufacturing sector.27

     The British wages in skilled and unskilled manufacturing, $207 and $149,

respectively, are 63 percent of the corresponding American wages, a ratio

slightly less than the 76 percent calculated in the Appendix from historical

sources but nevertheless quite close. The British agricultural wage is

calculated to be 26 percent below the unskilled wage rate, which agrees

closely with the reported difference of 32 percent by Lindert and Williamson

(1983). The essential equality of British and U.S. agricultural wages, while

in accord with Adams (1970), understates the true difference in earnings

between U.S. and British agriculture, because the self—employed American
                                       20



 farmer also received a return to land in contrast with British tenant farmers

 and laborers.28

      The return to capital in Britain is shown to be 0.16 in both manufac-

 turing sectors, and 0.07 in the agricultural sector. The return to capital in

 British manufacturing in the model is very similar to the independently cal-

 culated return on capital of 0.18 (see Appendix A). There is less information

 on the return to capital in British agriculture, but again it seems reasonable

 that the simulation indicates a lower relative return to the agricultural

 capital.

      Note that the model shows the United States to have been more capital

 intensive in the skilled manufacturing sector. The British capital-labor

 ratio in skilled manufacturing, $413 per worker, is lower than the $539 figure

 in the United States, while in the unskilled sector there was far less capital

per worker in the U.S., $559 versus $848 in Britain. The U.S. was more

capital intensive than Britain in the skilled sector, even though overall in

manufacturing it was less capital intensive. Thus the labor scarcity

hypothesis is confirmed by the simulation model.

     One might ask next: What are the effects of a change in the stock of

land on the capital—labor ratio in manufacturing? Not surprisingly, the

outcome of the simulation model parallels the results from the simpler Temin

two—sector model. Setting the elasticity of labor supply in the agricultural

sector equal to 0.3 (and y1 =
                              13) allows workers limited mobility between
agricultural and manufacturing sectors. The U.S. case (with equal factor

returns, so that the capital—labor ratios are in brackets) in the first column

of Table V can be compared with the third column, which calculates equilibrium

prices and quantities for the counterfactual U.S., differing from the actual

U.S. only by having a land endowment equal to that of Britain.   Reading from
                                         21



 column 3 to 1, we can see that increasing the land endowment increases both

 the wage of the agricultural worker and the capital—labor ratio in both

 manufacturing sectors. Such a result is not surprising; the introduction of

 an increased endowment of land leads to rising farm wages and migration from

 manufacturing into farming. Because the capital stock in all of manufacturing

 is fixed, the new manufacturing capital—labor ratio is higher, so the return

 to capital falls. In agriculture, on the other hand, the migration of labor

 along with increased land causes a rise in the return to capital (allowing for

 capital mobi.lity would reduce the magnitude of these effects). While the

 direction of change is not surprising, the minimal response of factor prices

to the seven—fold increase in land is noteworthy. The physical marginal

product of agricultural capital and labor rises significantly in response to

the abundant land. However, the lower price of agricultural output, caused by

the increased agricultural production, reduces the wage and the return to

capital (i.e., the value of the marginal product) sufficiently that the

magnitude of changes in the factor returns are quite small (Summers and

Clarke, 1980). Varying only the land endowment in this model therefore

provides results which are consistent with previous studies, but cannot

explain the historical pattern of lower overall capital intensity, a higher

real interest rate, and a higher skilled manufacturing capital—labor ratio in

the United States relative to Britain.

     A central focus of Habakkuk was the role of labor supply in explaining

American labor scarcity. Not only was industrial labor dearer in the United

States but its supply was also less elastic, owing to the barriers of high

information and transportation costs (p. 15—16). In addition, he felt that

the relative abundance of skilled workers in the U.S. led to a lower skilled

wage differential. The combination of a lower elasticity of unskilled labor
                                       22



 supply, a lower perceived skilled wage differential, and complementarity

 between skilled labor and capital led Habakkuk to believe that manufacturers

 would substitute out of labor and into more capital—intensive production

 techniques (p. 25). We can separate the argument into two parts.

      Consider first the role of the industrial labor supply elasticity. The

 U.S. manufacturing sector, having to attract workers from farming, would have

 been more likely to substitute capital for labor when the sector expanded,

 since the labor intensive methods would have led to yet higher wages. We can

 evaluate the. influence of the labor supply elasticity in our simulation model

 by posing the question: How would increasing the manufacturing labor supply

 elasticities from our assumed value of 0.3 to the counterfactual case of 0.6

 have affected the capital—labor ratio in American manufacturing?29 The

detailed results are presented in the first two columns of Table VIII in

Appendix B. As might be expected, increasing the labor supply elasticity

reduces the capital—labor ratio in both sectors of manufacturing; the higher

manufacturing wages attract more workers into manufacturing, thereby driving

down the capital-labor ratios. That is, if United States labor had been more

mobile (as Habakkuk suggested the British were), the manufacturing capital—

labor ratio would have been much lower. Conversely, if the labor supply

elasticity were significantly lower in the U.S. than in Britain, the labor

scarcity result would have been more likely to occur, strengthening the

simulation results in Table V. Note however that varying the labor supply

elasticity affects the capital—labor ratio levels in both manufacturing

sectors and thus cannot account for U.S. labor scarcity in only the skilled

sector. Differences across countries in labor supply elasticity alone are

neither necessary nor sufficient for a complete resolution to the labor

scarcity debate.
                                         23



      The second part of Habakkuk's argument distinguishes between skilled and

 unskilled workers. He suggests that a lower skilled wage differential in the

 United States created an incentive for manufacturers to substitute skilled

 workers and capital (taken to have been relative complements) for the inelas-.

 tically supplied unskilled workers. This argument clearly relies on the

 specification of the manufacturing production function, which in his implicit

model has three inputs ——   skilled   workers, unskilled workers, and capital.

Our simulation model cannot address this issue directly, because we separate

manufacturing into two sectors and include natural resources in both produc-

tion functions. There are at least a couple of reasons however to suggest

that such an explanation for labor scarcity is not correct. First, our

regression results (Table II) suggest it was the skilled artisans who were the

relative substitutes for capital, while unskilled workers were relative

complements in U.S. manufacturing. Andrew Ure, for example, observed that

early mechanization involved the substitution of unskilled for skilled labor

(Habakkuk, 1962, pp. 153—154). As a result, imposing a higher British skill

differential reduces, rather than augments, the labor scarcity result in the

simulation model. A 20 percentage point greater skill differential in Britain

(following Habakkuk), presented in the third column of Table VIII, increased

the capital—labor ratio in the skilled sector so much as to eliminate the

labor scarcity result. Second, evidence cited in Appendix A suggests the

skill differential in the United States was no different from that in

Britain. Williamson and Lindert (1980, p. 67) argue that while the skill

premium was lower in the U.S. early in the nineteenth century, it increased

rapidly relative to Britain over the antebellum period. This trend in the

skill differential is consistent with a trend toward labor scarcity in U.S.

skilled manufacturing before the Civil War.
                                        24



     Neither factor emphasized by Habakkuk, neither the more inelastic indus-

trial labor supply in the U.S. nor the lower skilled wage differential, is

necessary for the greater capital intensity in U.S. skilled manufacturing as

compared with Britain. Indeed, a lower U.S. skill premium weakens rather than

strengthens the labor scarcity result.

     Sumers and Clarke (1980) placed considerable importance on the

elasticity of demand for agricultural products. Therefore let us consider the

sensitivity of the labor scarcity result to changes in the elasticity of

substitution. parameter in the utility function. Reducing the substitution

elasticity parameter ()   to   0.75 (corresponding to a price elasticity of the

demand for food equal to 0.32 in the U.S.) indicates a capital-labor ratio of

$474 in skilled British manufacturing, still below the U.S. ratio of $539.

Increasing   to 3.0 (corresponding to a price elasticity of food equal to 1.26

in the U.S.) weakens the labor scarcity result only slightly, to an implied

value for the British skilled sector of $449. The choice of the proper elas-

ticity of substitution in demand is more important for the implied prices and

wages in the simulation model. Either extremely high or extremely low values

of   lead to unreasonably low values for British skilled manufacturing product

and agricultural wages.

     If it was neither land abundance alone, or differences in labor supply

elasticities, then what does generate the labor scarcity result? Consider

next simulations which compare the U.S. with Britain, rather than the U.S.

with a counterfactual IJ.S. economy. The simulations indicate that the

production function parameters are essential to obtaining the labor scarcity

result. If the manufacturing sectors are characterized by a CES production

function that imposes an equal elasticity of substitution among the three

factors, then the hypothesis of labor scarcity is rejected. When the common
                                     25



elasticity of substitution is set to either 0.8 or 1.2, the capital-labor

ratios in British skilled manufacturing was $773 and $791, respectively, as

compared with the U.S. figure of $539. The David—Rosenberg hypothesis

emphasized that capital and natural resources were relative complements in

production. Even though they were in fact relative complements in both the

skilled and unskilled manufacturing sectors, It was the much lower partial

elasticity in the skilled sector (.81 as compared with 1.71 in the unskilled

sector) that dictated the pattern of factor intensity reversal between the

U.S. and Brl.tain. Increasing this parameter to the unskilled value, 1.71, for

example, would imply capital scarcity in both U.S. manufacturing sectors.

(The detailed simulation results appear In Table IX of Appendix B). The

results are somewhat sensitive to the partial elasticity of substitution

between labor and capital in skilled industry as well. Reducing its value

from 1.34 to the equivalent value in unskilled industy, .85, makes Britain

slightly more capital intensive in skilled manufacturing (Table IX).

     The necessary conditions for the labor scarcity result therefore depend

on the production parameters in the two manufacturing sectors as well as the

pattern of factor endowments. In particular, the relative complementarity

between capital and natural resources, and the relative substitutability

between capital and labor in the skilled sector, combined with abundant land

and scarce capital, led to the curious phenomenon of labor scarcity.




                                      Iv.




     This paper reconciles the apparently contradictory evidence about

American and British technology in the first half of the nineteenth century
                                     26



and in doing so resolves the labor scarcity paradox. A computable general

equilibrium model for the U.S. and Britain at mid—century is developed which

follows Habakkuk's emphasis on distinguishing between skilled and unskilled

labor. Using empirically estimated production function parameters and actual

factor endowments, the simulation model supports the existence of limited

labor scarcity in the United States. The sector of manufacturing employing

primarily skilled workers is shown to have been more capital intensive than in

Britain, even though British manufacturing as a whole was much more capital

intensive than in the U.S. Finally, both the real and nominal wage rates and

the return to capital are shown to have been higher in America, a result also

consistent with the empirical evidence.

     While the model does indicate that an increase in land promotes labor

scarcity in manufacturing, Temin (1971, p. 177) proves to be ultimately

correct when he observed, "If labor was scarce in American manufacturing this

was not due simply to an abundance of land.1' In addition to land abundance,

the labor scarcity result appears also to depend on differences in production

technology between skilled and unskilled manufacturing. The arguments by

David and by Rosenberg emphasizing the relative complementarity of capital and

natural resources in production are confirmed here. Land or natural resource

abundance in the U.S. promoted greater capital intensity in manufacturing not

so much through its impact on the labor market but rather through its relative

complementarity with capital.3° Moreover, relative complementarity alone is

not sufficient for the labor scarcity result; as we have seen from the skilled

manufacturing sector, capital and natural resources must be strong relative

complements. If the manufacturing production functions are simplified to CES,

the labor scarcity result is lost.
                                     27



     In similar fashion, the capital—labor substitution relationship is also

important for the labor scarcity result. If skilled labor is no closer sub-

stitution for capital in production than unskilled labor, the greater capital

intensity in U.S. skilled manufacturing disappears. On the other hand, indus-

trial labor supply differences between the U.S. and Britain, emphasized by

Habakkuk, are not crucial to resolving the labor scarcity problem. A more

inelastic supply of labor to manufacturing in the U.S., ceteris paribus, does

lead to greater capital intensity In both the skilled and unskilled sectors in

the model. However, such differences in labor supply elasticities are un-

likely to explain labor scarcity by themselves, because they cannot account

for the lower overall capital intensity in the United States. The other

aspect of Habakkuk's argument, that lower skilled wage differentials in the

United States induced the substitution of skilled labor and capital for the

dearer and less elastically supplied unskilled labor, contradicts the

empirical evidence. First, from the Appendix, the skill differential in the

U.S. was no lower than in Britain, at least by the 1850's; second, from the

estimated production functions, skilled, rather than unskilled, labor was more

substitutable with capital. Thus, if the supply of industrial labor had been

more inelastic in the U.S. than in Britain, this would reinforce the labor

scarcity result, but in itself is neither a necessary nor sufficient con-

dition.

     A final unanswered question is, why did labor scarcity go away during the

second half of the nineteenth century? Habakkuk (pp. 126—127) suggested that

increased immigration after the 1840's, by increasing the elasticity of the

labor supply, reduced the incentive for capital—intensive investments. If the

labor supply factors were not central to the labor scarcity result during the

first half of the nineteenth century, it seems implausible that they could
                                     28



account for its demise during the latter half. Similarly, Habakkuk's argument

that technical progress in the second half of the century became more

dependent on the autonomous advance of scientific knowledge is neither well

documented nor particularly convincing (pp. 194—195).

     The ultimate reason why labor scarcity in U.S. manufacturing ceased to be

noteworthy was that the United States as a whole had, by the end of the nine-

teenth century, became more capital Intensive than Britain. The American

capital—labor ratio in manufacturing, which in 1880 had been slightly below

that in Britain, was by 1890 well above the British ratio ($1535 versus $1176)

(Feinstein, 1972, p. 199; U.S. Census Office, 19O2).3132 The same pattern

held for specific industries; the capital labor ratio in U.S. textiles was

$1963 in 1899, while in U.K. textiles the ratio was, in 1907, $811 at par

exchange rates. Similarly, the 1899 U.S. ratio in iron and steel was about

four times the corresponding 1907 U.K. figure (Great Britain Board of Trade,

1913, pp. 13, 35; U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1913).

     The disappearance of the labor scarcity question may well have been a

consequence of localized technical change. David (1975), as we have noted,

suggested that the relative complementarity of natural resources (or land) and

capital led to a pattern of local technical change in the United States that

was globally both more rapid and more labor—saving. James (1981) lent support

to this hypothesis by showing that natural resources and capital were indeed

relative complements in U.S. manufacturing for every Census year between 1850

and 1900. Thus the more rapid U.S. rate of labor—saving technical change

lowered the relative price of capital goods during the middle part of the

nineteenth century, thereby accelerating the rate of capital formation in the

manufacturing sector (David, 1977). Just as the combination of land abundance

and the complementarity between natural resources and capital induced the
                                     29



antebellum skilled manufacturing sector to choose more capital—intensive

techniques, the "more machines" story, it also promoted rapid and labor—saving

technical change in the manufacturing sector, or the Thetter machines"

story. It was the second half of the Rothbarth—Habakkuk argument, that lo-

calized innovation in both the skilled and unskilled manufacturing sector led

to greater use of capital, that ultimately can explain the disappearance of

the labor scarcity question by the end of the nineteenth century.

                                  APPENDIX A




Extent of Labor Scarcity

     The group of manufacturing industries which we Identify in Section II as

having been more highly mechanized in the United States by the 1850's are

essentially those identified by Habakkuk (p. 4) as areas of American

superiority. Since Habakkuk's classification in turn was based primarily on

the Special .Reports of Wallis and Whitworth (Rosenberg, 1969), we consider in

this section some of their observations on the state of American technology.

It should be reemphasized that they were much more than casual observers;

Whitworth in particular was impressively, perhaps uniquely, qualified to

compare American with British prodUctive techniques. Even though the evidence

here is impressionistic without quantified data to support it, it still

clearly must be reckoned with.

     The commissioners most probably focused on best practice or state of the

art technology in the various American industries. That these best practice

firms were not atypical representations is suggested by the fact that higher

depreciation rates (see later in the Appendix) insured that a greater propor-

tion of U.S. factories were of recent vintage.

     American woodworking superiority in the antebellum period was well recog-

nized (Rosenberg, 1969, pp. 32-49). Whitworth commented extensively on this

industry ("In no branch of manufacture does the application of labor—saving

machinery produce by simple means more important results than in the working

of wood" p. 343), and singled out agricultural equipment in particular

("Labour—saving machines are most successfully employed in the manufacture of

agricultural implements" p. 343). In addition, Wallis was impressed by the
                                     31



manufacture of decorative furniture (".   • .exterisjve   establishments exist for

the production of decorative furniture, the constructive portions being for

the most part prepared by machinery by which labour is greatly economised.

." p. 294).

     The industries distinguished by their mechanization were not limited to

woodworking. In metal working and hardware, Wallls declared that "In the

finish of the joints great accuracy is obtained, whilst the labour of filing

is saved by grinding the joints of the hinges on stones adapted to the pur-

pose, and driven by steam—power" (p. 269). Whitworth was similarly impressed

with clock manufacturing:



          the superiority obtained in this particular manufacture is not owing
      to any local advantage; on the contrary, labour and materials are more
      expensive than in the countries to which the exportations are made; it
      is to be ascribed solely to the enterprise and energy of the manufac-
      turer, and his judicious employment of machinery (p. 342; see also
      Church, 1975).


     Finally, the speed in which skilled gun workers could assemble a rifle

stock, as carefully timed and documented by Whitworth (pp. 364—65), so im-

pressed the British government that they sent a committee on machinery back to

the United States, ultimately to purchase more than 12000 in muzzle arid stock

producing machines.

     Not all industries awed the visiting British. Wallis, for example, did

not find particularly advanced technology in industries such as silk (".      . .in
the growth and preparation of the raw material, the United States have re-

ceded, and not advanced, since 1844" p. 232). Similarly, production tech-

niques In leather and furs differed "in no important point with the methods

used, or the purposes to which it is applied in Europe." (p. 235) Aside from

these clearly negative comments, many descriptions of the individual
                                           32



  industries simply lacked any specific comparison of production methods in the

  two countries; these industries included woolens and worsted, flax and hemp,

  carpets, wearing apparel and standard clothes, and glass and porcelain.

        We have excluded a few minor industries from our skilled sector, despite

  mention by the British observers, primarily because there was no straight-

  forward match between the 1850 Census classification and the observers' cate-

 gory. These include fishing net manufacture (p. 353), printing and dyeing (p.

 246) and type foundries in printing and publishing (p. 240).

        Two maj.or industries, boots and shoes and cotton textiles, are sometimes

 identified as having been more mechanized in the United States. While it was

 likely that they were more capital intensive than other U.S. manufacturing

 industries (Sokoloff, 1984a), we omit them from our specified group of indus-

 tries because American superiority was limited to only particular production

 processes and was not characteristic of the industry as a whole. In boots and

 shoes, lasts were cut using advanced techniques (p. 171), but the rest of the

 industry was unmechanized. Of the 11,639 workers employed during the late

1840's by the Lynn, Massachusetts shoe companies, only 321 cut the shoes from

the stock. The remainder were either female binders (7,170), male cordwainers

(4,132) or management. Owing to the aggregated nature of the data, we there-.

fore include the machine operators with the sewers and cordwainers in the

unskilled sector.

       Cotton textiles was another industry meriting notice by the British

visitors. Wallis noted that ".    . .it   is often found that a weaver will attend

to four looms in the United States, who, in the same quality of work, would

attend to only two in England." (p. 216) His observations are supported by a

comparison of looms per total factory workers in Lowell and the United King-

dom.   In 1850, the ratio of looms to workers in Lowell was 1.07, while the
                                     33



ratio in the U.K. was only 0.76 (Rosenberg, 1969, pp. 308—309; Mitchell, 1962,

pp. 185, 187). However, the ratio of spindles to total factory workers was

far lower in Lowell, 34.5, than the ratio in the U.K. as a whole, 63.4

although this difference may be an overstatement if British factories were

less integrated than those in Lowell. Aside from differences in machine speed

and quality of fabric, it seems clear that Lowell mills were relatively labor

saving in looms, but labor abundant in spinning. Because weaving cannot be

separated from spinning operations in the data, however, we are also forced to

consider the, aggregated industry, cotton textiles, as an unskilled industry.

It is interesting to note that wages for weavers (who were predominately

women) were between 18 and 48 percent higher than spinners in 1839—41 (Ware,

1931, p. 239), suggesting that the factories most readily substituted capital

for the skilled, rather than unskilled workers.

Wage Differences

     Extensive impressionistic and quantitative evidence indicates that un-

skilled wages were substantially higher in the United States than in Great

Britain during the first half of the nineteenth century. Habakkuk (p. 11)

cites estimates that wages were a third to a half higher, while Adams found

that American skilled workers earned 37 percent more, and unskilled workers 25

percent more than equivalent British workers in 1830. A comparison of 1850

nonagricultural unskilled wage in Britain and the United States (Williamson

and Lindert, 1983, p. 4; Abbott, 1905) indicates that the British wage, valued

at the par exchange rate, was only .76 of the American rate.

     Moreover, real wages, nominal wages adjusted by a cost of living index,

were even higher in the United States. The cost of living was lower in the

United States because of the lower prices for agricultural goods, which at

that time constituted the bulk of expenditures in a workingman's budget.
                                      34



 Using U.S. weights from Hoover's consumer price index (1960, pp. 177-178) and

U.S. and British price data from the Aldrich Report (the British Sauerbeck

 price series is reprinted there), we calculate that the real wage for a non-

agricultural worker in 1850 was 32 percent higher in the United States.33

With the much more aggregated budget shares for British laborers reported in

Lindert and Williamson (1983) the U.S. real wage advantage rises to 52 per-

cent.34 'Thus even though nominal wage rates in agriculture were similar in

the U.S. and England (Adams, 1970), the real wage in the U.S. would have been

higher because of the lower cost-of—living index.

     There is a substantial amount of evidence on the wage differential for

male skilled workers in Britain and America. Rosenberg (1967), citing

Zachariah Allen's 1829 manual The Science of Mechanics, found that carpenters

in the United States were paid 45 percent, and masons 65 percent above un-

skilled workers. The differential for most machine workers was not as sig-

nificant; between 25 and 42 percent for ordinary machine makers, and 50 to 75

percent for best machine makers.

     Zabler (1974) used evidence from iron firms in eastern Pennsylvania to

suggest that the skill differential in the U.S. was not particulary high. He

found a wage premium for skilled workers of only .15 during the period 1821—

1830. The problem common to all of these comparisons, that a large number of

occupations must be divided into only two categories, is most evident in this

study since the "skilled" miller earned less than the "unskilled" filler in 26

of the 31 years recorded. Adams (1970), on the other hand, reported higher

wage differentials of .73 in Philadelphia during the year 1830.

     Williamson and Lindert (1980) found a substantial surge in the relative

price of skilled workers from 1816 to 1856. While machinists received a 50

percent differential in 1825, it grew to 90 percent during the 1840's and rose
                                       35



 to 120 percent in the 1850*s (p. 68). The wage differential reached its

 maximum during the period 1850—60; "(T)he wage structure in urban Massachu-

 setts in the 1850's was almost exactly like that in England in 1825. It never

 again reached that height in the three decades that followed." (p. 71)

      Using a detailed compilation of army reports listing wages paid to civi-

 lians at military forts, Margo and Villaflor (1983) examined the skill diffe-

 rential paid to carpenters in the United States. The premium was highest in

 the southern New England states, where, for example, carpenters in Boston and

 New London were paid 73 percent more than laborers during the late 1830s and

 1840s, but the difference declined substantially in the frontier areas.

 According to their regression results, carpenters in the west north central

 region in 1840 were paid only 20 percent more than the unskilled workers.

     Finally, we present evidence on skilled daily wages, by detailed occupa-

tional group, from the Aldrich Report. The averages were weighted by the

number of employees reported as receiving the wage, and we calculate the skill

differential by comparing these wages with the average wage for male unskilled

workers (also using the Aldrich Report) computed by Abbott (1905). Table VI

presents the results; building trades were paid a premium of 65 percent during

1850—51, printing trades a premium of 75 percent, and engineers a difference

of 66 percent.

     The evidence suggests then that the skill differential in the United

States during the early 1850's was approximately 60 to 70 percent in the

eastern states, and somewhat lower in frontier regions.   Furthermore, the

decade of the 1850's probably represented a peak in the wage differential

relative to preceding and later years (although see Margo and Villaflor,

1983). We next turn to studies of British skill differentials.
                                      36



      Zachariah Allen observed British wage rates during the 1820's as well.

 The wages of carpenters were 31 percent above wages of common laborers, while

 both masons and ordinary machine makers were paid a 49 percent differential.

 The greatest wage premium was paid to best machine makers, who earned 2.62

 times the unskilled wage rate (Adams, 1970).

     The most detailed source of British relative wage data from around 1850

comes from the series of papers by Bowley and Wood, and compiled by Lindert

and Williamson (1983). Table VI also includes these estimates of British

wages. Ship.builders were paid a premium of 43 percent over nonagricultural

unskilled workers, while building trades and printing trades received a dif-

ferential of 48 and 67 percent, respectively. Although these two skill pre-

miums are less than the corresponding American values from Table VI, engineers

in Great Britain enjoyed a substantially larger differential than engineers in

the U.S. On average, however, the skill differential is about 60 percent, a

value quite similar to the premium in the U.S.

     There is little evidence from the late 1840's and 1850's therefore to

support Habakkuk's proposition that the skill differential was less in the

United States than in Britain (pp. 21—22). For both countries, the differen-

tial was approximately 60 or 70 percent in the more industrialized regions.

Since the skill differential was widening in the antebellum United States, the

1850's then may have been the first decade during which the United States had

caught up to Britain in terms of the skill differential.

     On the basis of this evidence, we constrain the skill differential in

British manufacturing to be equal to that in U.S. manufacturing in the

model. The premium actually used, 39 percent, represents the difference

between average annual wages in U.S. skilled and unskilled manufacturing. On

the one hand this figure may overstate the "true" skill differential between
                                     37



male workers because of the greater proportion of lower—paid women and

children in the unskilled manufacturing labor force;35 on the other hand,

however, the differential may be understated because many of the "skilled"

industries employed less skilled workers and assistants as well, while the

"unskilled" industries similarly employed some skilled workers and foremen.

Although we adopt 39 percent as our aggregate skill differential, the pattern

of results is not particularly sensitive to the level of the skill

differential.



Capital Cost Differences

     The real return to capital in manufacturing was significantly higher in

the United States than in Great Britain during the first half of the nine-

teenth century —- both gross and net, on average, and at the margin. The

average gross return to fixed capital in U.S. manufacturing in 1849 calculated

from Census data was 42.6 percent as compared with 18.0 percent in Great

Britain in 1851 (constructed from Table IV; Deane and Cole, 1969, pp. 143,

152; Lindert and Williamson, 1983, p. 4)•36 The relevant consideration in

choice of technique, the marginal user cost of capital, was higher in U.S.

manufacturing as well.

     Summers and Clarke (1980, p. 134) argue that even though nominal rates

were higher in the antebellum U.S. than in Britain the more rapid deflation

rate in Britain implied approximately equal real interest rates over the

period. This assertion is contraverted by Table VII which presents nominal

and expected real interest rates for the two countries averaged by decade for

the 1801-1860 period and is based on the same data used by Summers and

Clarke. Nominal interest rates in the U.S. are represented by yields on New

England municipal bonds and in Britain by yields on 3 percent consols.
                                       38



Expected real rates are constructed by adjusting the nominal interest rate by

the anticipated inflation rate ——   the predicted value from a regression of the
present inflation (or deflation) rate on those for the preceding two years

(the Warren—Pearson price index is used for the U.S. and the Rousseaux index

for Britain).37 With the exception of the first two decades, influenced by

the Napoleonic Wars, real interest rates were consistently and significantly

higher in the U.S. than in Britain. Over the whole antebellum period U.S.

real rates averaged 1.13 percentage points higher, and in the "peacetime"

decades of 1821-1860 they averaged 1.61 percentage points (or 46 percent)

greater. Indeed, taking the anticipated rate of price change into account has

virtually no effect on the magnitude of the differential. For the 1821-1860

period the US-GB differential in terms of nominal rates was 1.59 percentage

points and in terms of real rates, 1.61 percentage points.

     Furthermore, it seems quite unlikely that the observed differential could

be accounted for entirely by a risk premium.38 Precise measurement of the

premium resulting from a higher possible default risk of American bonds would

be very difficult or impossible. However, we may observe the response to the

defaults in the U.S. in the early 1840's. These defaults were not widely

anticipated, but they caused the differential to increase by only .42 percen-

tage points —-   from 1.43 percentage points in the 1830's to 1.88 percentage
points in the 1840's. By the 1850's the differential fell to only .18 percen-

tage points above the level in the pre—default decade. This relatively small

response suggests that risk considerations alone cannot explain higher U.S.

interest rates. Real interest rates therefore appear to have been higher in

the United States than in Britain in the period before the Civil War. Such

higher interest rates in the U.S. moreover are consistent with a wide range of

American social and economic phenomena —— from eating more quickly to holding
                                         39



smaller inventories than Europeans (Field, 1983a, pp. 414-415). They are also

consistent with the evidence on international net capital flows which shows

the United States to have been a continual net importer of British capital

(Williamson, 1964, pp. 89—124).

     The marginal gross return to manufacturing capital was higher in the

United States, owing to both the higher interest rates and higher depreciation

rates.39 In response to the higher real rate Americans attempted to reduce

capital costs by running their machines and factories longer and faster. In

cotton texti.les, for example, spindle speed was significantly more rapid in

the U.S. and increased substantially as well after 1828 (Habakkuk, 1962, pp.

54—55; Brito and Williamson, 1973, P. 243; Field, 1983a, pp. 412—413). Such

higher utilization, rates were in turn reflected in more rapid rates of depre-

ciation in the U.S.4° Further evidence may be seen in the well-known "flim-

siness" of American capital goods, such as machine tools and woodworking

machinery, relative to British products. Similarly, in railroad and canal

construction Americans produced less durable results than did the British

(Habakkuk, 1962, pp. 86—89). Again, here the construction of less durable,

more rapidly depreciating structures and equipment may be viewed as consistent

with a higher U.S. real interest rate.

     Direct calculation of the gross return to manufacturing capital from

national income figures and of a real interest rate series from nominal in-

terest and inflation rates both confirm that the cost of capital services or

return to capital was higher in the antebellum U.S. than in Britain. The

widely noted higher rates of utilization and depreciation of U.S. capital are

consistent with this, and Habakkuk's argument that product and factor markets

were more imperfect in America than in Britain in the early nineteenth century

reinforce this conclusion as well (pp. 63—79).

                                           Notes




     1.    In Temin's model (1966) only land and labor are used in the production of

 agricultural goods, and labor and capital in the production of manufactured

 goods.

 2.
           By specifying a smooth factor price frontier (as a result of assuming

 common well-defined production functions) we rule out the possibility of a

 factor intensity reversal due to a shift in technology.        In such a case a

 higher interest rate (in the u.s., say) might be associated with a more cap-

 ital—intensive technology. See Yeager (1976), pp. 323-324 and the discussion

 in Field (1983a), pp. 429—431.

 3.        This point is also argued by Ames and Rosenberg (1968). Such a result

 however is not inconsistent with Temin's more general argument (1971) that in

more complicated models the labor scarcity result may be possiblebut not

necessarily follow. Only in the simple two sector, two input model is the

general labor scarcity proposition a necessary consequence.

4.        Two other conditions must be met as well: 1) the share of land in agri-

culture must be greater than in manufacturing; 2) manufacturing must use a

higher proportion of the economy's capital than the labor (Summers and Clarke,

p. 132).

5.        Some valiant exceptions to this are Uselding (1972), Brito and Williamson

(1973), James (1981), and Field (1983a, b).

6.        Ternin (1966, pp. 281—283) is aware of this distinction but does not

incorporate it into his model.

7.        For example, Earle and Hoffman (1980, p. 1057) flatly and erroneously

assert, "Most American industries used demonstrably more machinery than
  equivalent British industries." Their analysis of the labor scarcity question

  is particularly confused, but they do find that "the characteristic feature of

  American capitalism" is "the use of cheap, instead of expensive inputs, pro-

  vided any differences in productivity are overcome."   (p. 1090)
 8.   The importance of the distinction between skilled and unskilled labor to

 the labor scarcity result, developed by Habakkuk, has been noted by Uselding

 (1975; 1977, pp. 164—165), Brito and Williamson (1973), and Goldin and

 Sokoloff (1982, pp. 755—756). Goldin and Sokoloff emphasize in particular the

 use of women-and children in manufacturing as another response to the problem

 of expensive male labor (1982, pp. 742, 755—756; 1983).

 9.
      Moreover, little is known empirically about production in the service

 sector, so specification would have had to have been rather arbitrary. See

James (1978).

 10. For example, Field (1980, pp. 162—163) classes the workers in these

industries in the two highest skill categories —— balanced and high skills.

11. Part of the difference however reflects the greater presence of females

in the unskilled sector. Counting the female wage as .5 of the male wage

(Sokoloff, 1984b), we calculate the annual male wage in the skilled sector as

$325 as compared with $276 in other manufacturing, still a significant dif-

ference.

12. Restricting the use of skilled labor to skilled manufacturing and un-

skilled labor to unskilled manufacturing ignores the possibility of substi-

tuting among skilled labor, unskilled labor, and capital in a generalized four

factor production function. The specification of such a function however

would present a very complex problem. Habakkuk, for example, quotes Andrew

Ure to the effect that early manufacturing growth involved the substitution of

unskilled labor and capital for skilled labor (pp. 153—154), but he himself
  argued that more capital—intensive production methods required more skilled

  labor per unit output than relatively labor—intensive ones (p. 24). Later

  writers have focused on one thread or the other of this argument. For

  example, Williamson and Lindert (1980) assume skilled labor and capital to

  have been relative complements, but Harley (1974) in his study of the choice

 of technique in Edwardian industry emphasizes the substitution of unskilled

 labor and capital for skilled labor.

      Nevertheless, in our specification here the unskilled labor market is

 still able to influence skilled labor conditions and the choice of technique

 through labor supply channels. In any case, this characterization is roughly

 consistent with empirical evidence and available data do not permit satisfac-

 tory estimation of a four factor production function (unskilled
                                                                   labor, skilled
 labor, capital, natural resources).

 13. Habakkuk (p. 43) also raises the possibility that if the tariff was

 levied primarily on relatively labor—intensive imports, it would have raised

 real wages relative to capital and thereby shifted U.S. demand toward products

made by capital—intensive techniques. The antebellum tariff did in fact

increase real wages the most, but its principal effect was to increase the

returns to both labor and capital at the expense of land and slaveholders, a

possibility which Habakkuk recognizes in a footnote. (James (1978), p. 248.)

14. Prices are not taken to be fixed at world levels in spite of the presence

of an international sector. The protection of tariffs and distance makes it

quite reasonable that U.S. producers faced downward sloping demand curves, and

it is not implausible that British producers faced them as well. British

manufacturers may well still have been price makers rather than price takers

in world markets, while in agriculture complete adjustment to the repeal of

the Corn Laws may not yet have occurred. To be sure, demand elasticities may
  have been greater than those facing krierican producers and if this were the

  case the differences between U.S. and British output and factor prices which

  the model predicts will be overstatements.

  15. Lack of data on Consumption patterns precludes a more detailed specifica-

  tion. A similar one for the demand side has been used by Williamson and

 Lindert (1980, p. 225). Rosenberg (1972, pp. 39—51) has argued that Americans

 were more disposed to accepting standardized goods produced by

 mechanization. If this had been the case, then the model, which assumes no

 differences in the nature of demand between America and Britain, is biased

 against finding labor scarcity in U.S. manufacturing.

 16. Value of output is deflated by a regional price index (Coelho and

 Shepherd, 1974). Labor input is measured by total employment with one ad-

 ditional worker per firm added to correct for entrepreneurial labor input

 (Sokoloff, 1984b). Atack (1976, p. 279) has shown that different measures of

 labor input, such as taking interstate variation in the sex composition of the

labor force into account, for example, has only very small effects on para-

meter estimates in nineteenth—century u.s. production functions. Capital

figures used are those reported in the Census of Manufactures, which are

argued by Davis and Gailman (1978, p. 9) to have represented market values.

The measure of agricultural goods input, A, is taken as the value of raw

material inputs deflated by a regional index of natural resource prices (see

James (1981), pp. 385—386). The observations are weighted by the ratio of the

number of firms in a given state to the total.

17. The Allen partial elasticity of substitution between inputs I and j    is
defined as



             =
                 (   fjXi/XjXj)(IF..(/IFI)
                                             i,j = K, L, A
  where F is the bordered Hessian of the production function f and
                                                                          is the

  cofactor of the ijth element of F.

  18. Williamson and Lindert (1980, P. 223) take this twentieth—century result

 to have been the case in the nineteenth century as well.

 19. Habakkuk (pp. 33—34) considered but rejected the influence of American

 resource abundance in accounting for labor scarcity. He suggested that away

 from the Fall Line supplies of power would have been both dearer and less

 elastic in fact than in England, contrary to Christensen's later calculations

 (1981, p. 322).

 20. The production function itself was based on data for Southern agricul-

 ture, although Fogel and Engerman take the estimated factor shares to have

 prevailed in Northern agriculture as well in their relative efficiency calcu—

 lations. We use these estimates rather than Gallman's (1972) which are based

 on assumed rates of return to agricultural capital much lower than the ones in

our model (Table V).

21. Note that if the price of capital goods had been higher in the IJ.S., the

capital—labor ratio in U.S. skilled manufacturing would have been

overstated. However, somewhat tenuous evidence from 1865 on British machine

tools suggests that the capital prices may have been roughly comparable

between the two countries by around mid-century. The mean price of machines

produced that year by the British firm of Greenwood and Batley was E89 as

compared to £92, the average price of machine tools sold in England by the

American firm of Brown and Sharpe (Floud, 1976, pp. 113-114). See also note

39.

22. In general, there has been little effort made to refine these measures of

factor endowments. For example, because of insufficient data labor force
  totals have not been adjusted for differences in composition, such as by

  converting them into a measure of male equivalent workers (Sokoloff,
                                                                          1984b).
  Differences between slave and free workers in terms of hours worked are ne-

  glected as well (Fogel and Engerman, 1977, PP. 285—288). Land input is simply

  measured in acres, not taking fertility differences between the U.S. and

 Britain into account.

 23. The natural resource imports
                                     were corn, coffee, sugar, tea, wine, timber,
 raw cotton, raw wool, silk, tobacco, flax, hemp, oils, seeds, hides and skins,

 dyewoods and. dyestuffs.

 24. Abbott (1905) reported daily unskilled wages of $.91. Noting that women

 comprised 26 percent of unskilled workers and that their relative wage was

 approximately 60 percent of men's (although this differential varied by

 region; Goldin and Sokoloff, 1982), average annual wages for 310 days of work

 would have been $253.

 25. Budd (1960, pp. 384—385) working up. from wage data and including implicit

earnings of slaves finds the labor share more than exhausts agricultural

sector income in 1850, a rather improbable result.    Part of this discrepancy
might be the result of assuming that slave workers, like free workers, receive

the going wage.

26.   In our basic simulation capital is measured as fixed capital, as reported

by the Census, and working capital is not counted.   Bateman and Weiss (1981,

pp. 116, 193—195), allowing for depreciation and adding a correction for

working capital to the denominator of the rate of return
                                                           calculation, compute
the 1849 net return to U.S.
                              manufacturing as 22 percent, a figure very close
to the 19 percent rate of return on agricultural capital in the model.

Equality of returns to capital across sectors therefore could be achieved by

Simply appropriately inflating the figures for manufacturing capital to
  reflect working capital as well as fixed. The problem with using this latter

  measure of capital, which would eliminate
                                              possibly theoretically objectionable
  divergencies in rate of return across sectors, is that there is not a good

  measure of working capital in the U.K. American entrepreneurs, responding to

  higher interest rates, were generally viewed as Conserving on working capital

 and holding smaller inventories than
                                        their British counterparts (Field, 1983a,
 pp. 414-415), but we do not know exactly how much lower.
                                                              Imposing some
 undocumented differential in the ratio of working to fixed capital across

 countries adas an element of arbitrariness
                                              to the comparison, while not

 influencing the results. In any case, it should be noted that the higher

 return to capital in manufacturing than in agriculture is consistent with the

 results of Bateman and Weiss (1981, P. 130).

 27. Moreover, the export of machinery from Britain was prohibited until 1843

 (Habakkuk, 1962, p. 96).

28. This point is also made by Habakkuk (1962, p. 13).

29. We do this computatonally
                                by fixing y and 2 assuming that the true
elasticity is 0.3. Then we double y and         and solve the simulation model.
30. Note that the focus has shifted from land abundance increasing the

agricultural wage (Habakkuk) to the influence of abundant natural resources,

primarily through decreasing the cost of power, and thereby spurring

mechanization. By land abundance here therefore we really mean natural

resource abundance.

31. This calculation of the British capital—labor ratio in manufacturing

assumes the share of manufacturing capital in the gross reproducible capital

stock to have been the same in 1880 and 1890 as in 1920.
  32. Note that a more elastic supply of unskilled workers after mid—century,

  as argued by Habakkuk, would seem to imply a lower manufacturing capital—labor

  ratio in the U.S. rather than a higher one.

 33. This figure probably understates the iS, advantage, because firewood and

 rents were excluded from the cost of living adjustments. In both of these

 categories U.S. prices should have been lower.

 34. This result, of course, ostensibly violates well known properties of

 index numbers. However, the U.S. and British weights do not cover the same

 range of comodjtjes, the U.S. weights being much more detailed. The results

 are consistent, however, in indicating substantially higher real wages in the

 U.S.

 35. See note 12.

 36. These figures are overestimates of the true rate of return because they

omit working capital from the denominator of the true rate of return

calculation. See note 28.

37. Summers and Clarke compute realized or ex post real rates (p. 134),

rather than expected rates which should be the relevant ones in the choice of

technique.

38. Summers and Clarke suggest that taking risk factors into account it may

well have been the case that the real return on capital in the United Kingdom

may have been actually higher than in the United States (p. 135).

39. Brito and Williamson (1973) emphasize another factor influencing the cost

of capital services, differences in the relative price of investment goods in

the two countries. They suggest that due to the tariff the ratio of the price

of capital goods to that of manufactured consumption goods was lower in the

U.S. and that the real costs of capital services were in fact lower in the

U.S. as well. To be sure, the relative price of capital goods in the U.S. did
 decline over the middle part of the nineteenth century, but this was not

 characteristic of the entire antebellum period (David, 1977). Direct evidence

 on Brito and Williamson's asserted inequality relationship is rather

 inconclusive. Sketchy data on American and British antebellum machinery

 prices preclude detailed comparisons, but the price difference between U.S.

 and British machinery in cottons and woolens did not appear to be

 systematically less than the tariff on manufactured goods over the 1810-1830

 period (Jeremy, 1981, pp. 188, 229). For example, for woolen spinning in the

 1820s the British price per spindle was $.40, while in the U.S. it was

1.25. Habakkuk (1962, p. 106) cites for a later period, the 1840s, the best

English opinion as believing that the same types of machines were generally

cheaper in Britain than in America (also see note 21).

40. It may be noted that this characterization of more intense capital use

and hence more rapid depreciation in the antebellum U.S. than in Britain is

reflected in the assumptions underlying the construction of capital stock

figures in the two countries. For the U.S. Gallman assumes a lifetime for

equipment of 15 years and for structures of 50 years, while for Britain Fein—

stein takes lifetimes of 40 and 100 years respectively (Davis and Gallman,

1978, p. 457; Feinstejn, 1978, pp. 52, 56).
