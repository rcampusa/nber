                   Ruling Out Nonstationary
                      Speculative Bubbles

                             ABSTRACT



      There is a large and growing empirical literature that tests for

 the existence of asset—price bubbles or !?sunspotI equilibria——equilibria

unrelated to market fundamentals. Our view is that even tests for non—

stationary asset—price bubbles should not be interpreted as such. In

the present paper we extend earlier work of ours which provided a strong

case for ruling out nonstationary speculative price bubbles in models

based on individual maximizing behavior. In the first part of the

paper we study the possibility of stochastic exploding price—level

bubbles of the kind proposed by Blanchard (1979). As in our previous

work, a scheme of fractionally backing the currency with real output

is sufficient to preclude such bubbles. In the second part of the

paper we examine conditions for ruling out implosive price—level bubbles,

equilibrium paths along which the price level asymptotes to zero even

though the monetary growth rate is constant. A condition on preferences

implied by any reasonable monetary transactions technology is sufficient

to prevent such bubbles from emerging. Given that anticipated future

disturbances can lead to price paths which are qualitatively indistinguish-

able from bubble paths, and given the strong theoretical basis for ruling

out nonstatioflary bubbles, our conclusion is that any "positive" evidence

of bubbles should be regarded only as evidence of omitted variables.

I.   Introduction



      There   is now a large and growing empirical literature directed at

testing for the existence of asset-price bubbles or "sunspot" equilibria——

equilibria unrelated to market fundamentals. This empirical work already

covers a broad range of markets and historical episodes, including the

gold market, the stock market, the foreign exchange market, and the

domestic currency market (during episodes of hyperinflation).1 Although

theorists have classified several different types of bubbles,2 almost all

empirical studies to date are concerned with nonstationary explosive or

implosive (stochastic) bubbles of the type analyzed here. Perhaps the

main reason why this particular class of bubbles is so important is that

there is as yet no well—defined methodology for positively identifying

other types of bubbles.

      Our view is that even tests for nonstationary asset—price bubbles

should not be interpreted as such. In Obstfeld and Pogoff (1983), and in

the present paper, we provide a strong case for rulinq out nonstationary

speculative price bubbles as equilibria in models based on individual

maximizing behavior. Given that anticipated future disturbances can lead

to price paths which are qualitatively indistinguishable from bubble paths,

and given the strong theoretical basis for ruling out nonstationary bubbles,

our conclusion is that "positive" evidence of bubbles should be regarded only

as evidence of a particular class of omitted variables. [Hamilton and

Whiteman (1984) point out that bubbles and omitted variables are obser-

vational.ly equivalent, and present a particular formalization of that idea.

Flood and Garber (1980) have noted the equivalence of bubbles and anticipated
                                    —2—




future disturbances. I

      In   our 1983 paper we demonstrated that explosive price bubbles are

theoretically possible in models of pure fiat money. But such bubbles

are not equilibria if there is some (possibly very small) probability that

the government will provide some (possibly very small) real backing for the

currency. Here we extend our previous work in two, literally opposite, direc-

tions (one explosive and one implosive). First, we study the possibility of

having stochastic explosive bubbles of the type proposed by Blanchard (1979).

In Blanchard's aggregative model, there exist price bubble paths which are

nonstationary in mean even though the bubble bursts with probability one.

This type of bubble might be appealing to those who believe that all real-

world bubbles eventually burst. We demonstrate here that bubbles very

similar to those described by Blanchard can indeed arise in a micro-based

model if the monetary regime is one with pure fiat money.    (The only

difference is that the stochastic bubbles derived from our optimizing

model do not burst with probability one. Instead, there is a positive probability

that the real value of money will go to zero in finite time.) However,

Blanchard-type bubbles only arise in the pure fiat money case. A fractional

backing scheme, such as the one discussed in our previous paper, is

sufficient to rule out such bubbles.


      In the second part of the paper we study conditions for ruling out

implosive price-level bubbles, equilibrium bubble paths along which the

price level asymptotes to zero even though the growth rate of the money

supply is constant. We derive a condition on preferences sufficient to

preclude implosive bubbles whenever the money-supply growth rate    is
                                 —3—



nonnegative. Our condition is implied by the weak requirement that the

derived utility from holding real balances to reduce transaction costs

be bounded from above. Almost any reasonable transactions technology

will obey this requirement [see, for example, Feenstra (l984y1.
                                                                       —4—




II. Explosive Stochastic Bubbles


     Blanchard (1979) has suggested a class of stochastic bubbles driven

by extrinsic uncertainty.                               [See alsoShiller (1978), Flood and Garber (1980).}

Along   the explosive price paths analyzed by Blanchard, there is a non—zero
probability         each period that the price level will return to its stationary

saddle—path value. In this section, we show how explosive stochastic

price—level bubbles can arise in Brock's (1974, 1975) maximizing model of

pure fiat money. Like nonstochastic bubbles, these too can be ruled out

through the fractional backing scheme discussed in our earlier paper.

     The economy is one in which individuals receive each period y units of

the perishable consumption good. Let c denote the representative

individual's consumption at time t, Mt her nominal money holdings, and

  = 1/1+5 her subjective discount rate. If the operator                                    yields

mathematical expectations conditional on time—t information, then the

infinitely-lived individual agent's problem is to maximize


                      t
(1) E {                   [u(c   t   )   +   v(Mt /Pt )]}
         ot=o

subject to

(2) M -         M         =   P (y -           c    )   + H
         t          t—l          t              t             t


the individual agent treats the path of the price level                                     and nominal

transfers {H}to as exogenous. In (1), u(•) and v(•) are increasing,

strictly concave, and have the usual smoothness properties. Further,

v() satisfies the Inada conditions

 (3) lim v' (m) =             , Urn v' (m) =                      0.

                                               —5--




Initial individual money holdings M are given.
                                                —l
      The Euler equation characterizing an optimal path for the individual

is



(4)   U'   (Ct) —   v' (Mt/Pt)                 (c)
      ___________ - E                    t{           _}.
               Pt                             Pt+1


In equilibrium, desired consumption c must equal aggregate output y in each

period, and nominal money demand must equal the money supply. The latter

is assumed to be nonstochastic and (for simplicity) constant at level N.

Accordingly, H          0. Let m stand for real balances Mt/P. Multiplying

(4) by M and substituting y for c, we obtain

(5) m[u'(y) -         v'(mtfl    =   u'(y)E{m}.
In a rational-expectations equilibrium, the stochastic process                     must
                                                                           mt}
satisfy (5), where the conditional expections E{.} is taken with respect

to the actual probability distribution of the price level.

      The model as stated contains no instrinsic uncertainty. Under certainty

there is a unique positive stationary level of real balances               satisfying (5)

[so v' () = (1 -       )u' (y)       1. When real balances are constant at ñ, the economy

is on its saddle path. Following Blanchard (1979), we introduce extrinsic

uncertainty as follows: Assume that if real balances are rn, then agents

expect next period's price level to be P = M/rn with probability one. If the

economy is on an explosive bubble path with m <             iii, then agents expect that
the price level will return ("crash") to its saddle—path level with

probability rr, but will continue on the bubble path with probability 1 -
                                                   —6—



By (5), this means that given m ,                  the value of m          that prevails if a
                               t                                     t+l
crash does not occur satisfies

(6) m{UT (y) - v1 (me)] =           u'      (y) [lTrn + (1 -


or
               mt[ut(y) -     v'(mt)]
                                              -    Tru'(y)rn
     mt+1       —
                                  — T)u'     (y)



     Before the foregoing price process can define an equilibrium path for

the pure fiat money economy, a final assumption is needed: If m = 0, then

m+1 =    0 with probability one. This assumption turns out to be necessary

for the existence of stochastic price bubble paths, but it also implies that

such babble paths do not burst with probability one as in Blanchard's model.

     Equation (6) leads to a diagram that shows the positive (feasible)

realizations of m consistent with intertemporal rational expectations

equilibrium. Define A(m)               m[u' (y) -        v'   (m)j and

B(m) E   u'   (y) {'rcrn + (1 -   'rr)m].     The difference equation (6) can then be

written as


          t
(7) A(m ) = B(mt+l ).

Figure 1 depicts the dynamics dictated by (7). As in Obstfeld and Rogoff

(1983), figure 1 applies to the case where lim my' Cm) =                         0, which admits
                                                                                       4
explosive deterministic bubbles under a pure fiat money regime.                            One path

that satisfies (7) is the saddle path, m =                          for all t.

     There are stochastic bubble paths that also satisfy (7). For example,

consider the path beginning at m in the figure. The initial price level

is P = M/m.         At time zero agents expect a t = 1 price level of P (with

                                                                                5

                                                  (with probability 1 -   ). If        no crash occurs

at t =    1,   the price level P1 is equal to P, defined by


(8)   u' (y) —         v'   (M/P) u' (y)
                p


At P,. agents expect real balances to jump to their saddle-path value with

probability r, and to be zero with probability 1 —                         rr       Equation (8) implies

that individuals have no incentive to reduce their real balances at m = m,

despite the fact that their money holdings may lose their real value forever.

(The possible capital loss is compensated by the current utility of money in

reducing transaction costs and the possible capital gain in the event of a
          6
crash.)

         If P subsequently jumps to P, the economy remains on the saddle-path

forever. If P subsequently becomes infinite, the Euler equation becomes

(and remains) [u'(y) -                 v'(m fl/Pt = 3u'(y)/P          ,   which is satisfied (given
                                              t             t+l
that urn my' (m) = 0           )       if   P =     and m = 0 in all future periods.


         It is easy to see that the stochastic bubble equilibria just described

cannot occur if the government provides a trivial amount of real backing for

the currency. Suppose that the government owns a portion of the aggregate

endowment y and rebates its share to the public in the form of lump-sum

transfers. As in Obstfeld and Rogoff (1983), the government can guarantee a

minimal real redemption value for money by promising to back each currency

unit by a claim to a small fraction of its endowment. This suffices to rule

out as equilibria the bubble paths considered above, since m = 0 (and rr = 0)

is no longer an equilibrium. 7

         We have not discussed implosive stochastic bubbles in this section
                                  —8—




becuase their analysis rests on the same principles as the analysis of

implosive nonstochastic bubbles. That subject is taken up next.

III. Ruling Out Implosive Price-Level Paths

       This section studies implosive price bubbles in a fully deterministic

version of the previous section's model. Because the precise rate of money

growth is now central to the discussion, we no longer restrict it to be

zero as in section II. A continuous—time framework is more convenient for

the analysis, and in this case the Euler equation for real balances is


(9)    m =        [p +   —   v'(m    )] m
        t                        t          t


where, again, p is the instantaneous growth rate of the nominal money supply

and    is the instantaneous subjective discount rate [see Brock (1974)]. To

simplify notation, the utility function has been normalized so that u' (y) = 1.

It is assumed for now that p >                  0.
       The positive steady—state level of real balances rn is given by

v' (m) = p +      . To       rule out as a possible equilibrium a solution to

(9) with m > rn, it is sufficient to show that this implosive path violates

the transversality condition



       t-
(10) urn e_t/Pt =


Since (10) is necessary but not generally sufficient for an equilibrium when

P >   0, violation of (10) is sufficient, but not always necessary, to rule
out an implosive path. The appendix shows why Euler equation (9) and

condition (10) are jointly necessary for an equilibrium under the present

assumptions. 8

       The following result provides the basis of our analysis:

Theorem 1. A necessary and sufficient condition for an Euler path starting

with m >     rn    to violate the transversality condition (10) is that
                                                             —10—




the integral


 (11) 7                      v (m) din
            0       [i + 6 —      v'(mflra

be convergent.9

Proof. Along an Euler path with m > Iii, (9) implies that


 (12) m=me
                             (i + 6)t —    f v'
                                           0
                                                  (m )
                                                    S
                                                             ds



Because m =
                t
                        et M 0/Pt
condition (10) is equivalent to

                        t
                     —i      v' Cm)   ds
(13)     urn        e0                     =   0,
         t-±o



which   holds if and only if


                    t
(14) lim f              v' (m)    ds
        t* 0


Now change variables from s to m in (14), using the fact that, by (9),

din =   [p + 6 -          v' (m)]m     ds along the path we are studying. Then (14) holds along

this path if and only if the utility-of-money function v(•) satisfies



        f            v'     (m) din                      =
        m
            0 [p+6—v'(m)]m
                                                  —11—




It follows that (10) is violated if and only if (11) converges. This completes

the proof.

       As was noted above, convergence of (11) is sufficient to rule out

implosive bubbles when            >   0.   But when ii    = o, transversality   condition (10)

is sufficient, as well necessary, for an equilibrium (see the appendix)

In this case, therefore, divergence of (11) is necessary and sufficient for

equilibrium.

       The following is a case in which                  = 0 and (11) diverges, so that

implosive Euler paths are equilibria:


Examp1e° Suppose that for largam, v(m) = 1/log(m).                         Then (11) becomes


 (15) f         _______ dm
       Tn
            0   m[5 log(m) — 11



Because          log(m) > 1 when m >       rn   and m is given by (9),



 (16)f          ________ >7                      _____
            0   m{5 log(m) — 1]                 0 m log(m)


It is therefore enough to prove that the right-hand side of (16) is divergent.

But


                   dm
(17)   f                     =   log[log()]       -   log[log(m
                                                              0
                                                                  )]   =
            0   m log(m)


Thus (10) is satisfied along this Euler path.

         Fortunately, equilibrium implosive price paths are not a problem

when i >         0.   The following calls into question the economic relevance and

interpretation of any implosive price path along which transversality

condition (10) holds:


Theorem 2. If (10) holds along an implosive price path, then


(18)     urn v(m) =


Proof.          By the concavity of v(•), form >

where the right-hand side of (20) equals the integral (11). If there exists

a finite B such that for all m,


(21) v(m) <

then   the left-hand side of (20) is bounded by

(22)
        f             [B - v(m)]dm
       in
            0    (m—ffi)m[i+5 —   v' (m)]

The integral (22) is convergent becuase i+5-v' (m) approaches 'i+c5 monotonically

as m            and j+5—v' (m) > 0 (see footnote 8). Therefore (11) can diverge only

if v(m) is unbounded as m --             . So   if v(m) is bounded, Theorem 1 tells us that

(10) cannot hold.
    No plausible transactions technology can yield the result that the

derived utility of money increases without bound for a fixed consumption

level, even if v'(m) > 0 for all finite m. We therefore conclude that
                                                                      11
implosive bubbles cannot reasonably occur in this model when i > 0.

     What about cases where 'i < 0? These are relevant to discussions of

the "optimal quantity of money." It turns out that imploding bubbles can
                                                          12
be equilibria in these cases even if (10) does not hold.       The reason

why (10) is no longer necessary is explained by Brock (1974, p. 764, and

1975, p. 145) but it is worth repeating. Transversality condition (10)

ensures that an agent cannot increase her utility by reducing her nominal

balances permanently by a dollar, provided this is feasible (see the appendix).

But this reduction is simply not feasible when nominal balances are

declining toward zero along the initial Euler path. The dollar would

eventually have to be repurchased to keep money holdings nonnegative, and

the cost of this transaction would, by (9), nullify the initial gain in

instantaneous utility. (This problem goes away if monetary growth, though

currently negative, goes to zero at some finite time in the future.)

     To summarize, a very weak preference restriction prevents imploding

bubbles when 'i > 0. but this restriction is inapplicable when     < 0. Note,

however, that a government promise to place a floor on the money—price of

output by unlimited purchases of goods with money at a sufficiently low P

prevents the emergence of imploding bubbles. And the government will never

have to exercise its guarantee. Placing a ceiling on the real value of

money is the mirror image of the threatened intervention that precludes

exploding bubbles in Obstfeld and Rogoff (1983) .   Wallace (1981) studies

a similar scheme in an overlapping—generations economy.

 IV.    Conclusion


            In this paper we have provided further microeconomic justification

for ruling out nonstationary price bubbles, stochastic and otherwise.

Given the strong a priori grounds for ruling out such bubbles, it

would appear that it is not meaningful to test empirically for their

presence. How can one then interpret the existing empirical literature

that tests for nonstationary bubbles? Co-isider once again the model of

section II, and assume there are no bubbles. Assume instead that in

period t, agents know that there will be an election at the end of period

t +    3.    Furthermore, agents know that if the current government stays in

power, the money supply will remain forever at its current level M; but

the money supply will be 2M, from period t + 4 onward, if the opposition

is elected at the end of t +       3.   The opposition party is expected to win

with an exogenous probability ii.       What does the path of the price level

look like if, ex post, the incuxpiDent party wins the election and the money

supply never changes? It is easy to show that the price level will follow

a path such as the one depicted in figure 2.

        An econometrician unaware of the election's signifcance for the

stochastic properties of the money supply process might mistake the price

path in figure 2fr evidence of an extrinsic price bubble, one that bursts

in period t +      4.   However, the analysis of this paper suggests that one

should not adopt that interpretation. In the absence of any observed change

in the money supply, a price path like the one in figure 2 should be inter-

preted as evidence of a market fundamental that cannot be observed by the
                                          13
econometrician——an omitted variable.

Appendix


       This appendix establishes that when monetary growth is nonnegative,

the condition



       t-
 (Al) urn st/p =
                 t


is necessary for a price—level path {P }                       to   be an equilibrium in this paper's
                                      t
model. (The discrete-time version of the model is used to aid intuition.)

A somewhat less formal proof is given in Obstfeld and Rogoff (1983)                           .   Brock
(1974) shows that the condition

             t
(A2) inn 3 m = 0
       t-D

                                                    14
is sufficient for an equilibrium.                        (Al) is equivalent to (A2), and thus

necessary and sufficient, when monetary growth is zero, as assumed in our

1983 paper. Clearly (A2) implies (Al) if the money stock is growing at a

nonnegative rate, but the converse is not true in general.

       Consider the deterministic version of the first-order condition (4).

Iterating this relation forward yields



(A3) u'(c )/P =
                         =
                         E

If   markets clear, so that c                   =   y and M         = M

                                                                     —16—




Assume that

(A5) lim f /P                  >   0.

We will show that (A5) implies fP }                                      s   not an equilibrium. In other words,
                                                                 t


an agent facing prices {P} can raise her lifetime utility by deviating from

                                                    S
the   plan c             =   y, Mt+i         = M
                   t+i                             t+i

       Consider the following deviatio: Consume P e dollars at time t,
                                                                                                  t

reducing nominal balances by this amount in period t and all succeeding

periods. Note that this is always a feasible deviation, for e sufficiently
                    5
small,     if M is not shrinking over time.

       The deviation causes an immediate consumption gain that exceeds u' (y+e)e

(by concavity) .               It    causes a lifetime loss of liquidity services less than

       =
       I           ivt [(M
                               S

        1=0


It is therefore certainly true that if there is a positive e such that



(A6) u (y+e)             >              v1 [(M               -           e)/P         1/P

3. Brock (1974, pp. 760-764) gives a condition on v(S) sufficient to rule

     out implosive equilibrium price paths when money growth is nonnegative.

     Our 1983 paper gives the impression that when the money stock is constant,

     no condition on preferences beyond a standard Inada condition is needed

     to preclude imploding bubbles, but this is not the case. The condition

     we derive here is somewhat more general than Brock!s (see footnote 9,

     below) ,   and is necessary as well as sufficient in the case i   = 0.

4. It is easy to see that stochastic as well as deterministic explosive

     price-level bubbles are not equilibria when lim mv (m) > 0.       Obstfeld and


     Rogoff (1983) show that this case is economically unreasonable, since it

     implies that v(0) =   -.
5,   Note that the inflation rate conditional on no crash occurring must rise

     with r to offset the possibility of a sharp capital gain on real balances.

6. If rr did not become zero once real balances were zero at t = 2, there

     would have to be some probability that real balances would become negative

      in period t = 3.    Otherwise the equilibrium condition (7) could not be

      satisfied, But the price level cannot be negative with free disposal.

      Thus, the stochastic bubble equilibria described here do not crash with

   probability one as in Blanchard's (1979) aggregative model.

   extrinsic bubbles can be ruled out in a stochastic growth irodel.

10. Guillermo Calvo and Roque Fernandez suggested this example.

11. The condition given in Theorem 2 is necessary, but not sufficient, for

     an implosive bubble path to be an equilibrium path when '        > 0.   The

     transversality condition (10) is violated for all v(s) in the :onstant

     relative risk aversion class (see footnote 8) , and some of these are

     unbounded as m +   . Of   course if urn v(m)     °,   the individual's objective

    function (1) may be unbounded for price paths P } such that P             0.   This
                                                           t


    would require reformulation of the individual's problem in terms of an

     "overtaking" principle.

12. Given our assumption that v'(.)>O, l1+c>0 is required for the existence

     of equilibrium. Brock (1974, 1975) discusses the possibility that v' ()<0

     for sufficiently large m. Note that if v' (m) = 0 for some finite m,

     (10) cannot hold along an implosive Euler path for p > 0.

13. Again, see Hamilton and Whiternan (1984).

14. It is easy to see that this sufficient condition never holds for

     imploding Euler paths with p >   0,   and always holdswhen p <   0.
