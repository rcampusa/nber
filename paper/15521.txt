                                              ABSTRACT

Economists are often puzzled by the stronger public opposition to immigration than trade, since the
two policies have similar effects on wages. Unlike trade, however, immigration can alter the composition
of the local population, imposing potential externalities on natives. While previous studies have addressed
fiscal spillover effects, a broader class of externalities arise because people value the 'compositional
amenities' associated with the characteristics of their neighbors and co-workers. In this paper we present
a new method for quantifying the relative importance of these amenities in shaping attitudes toward
immigration. We use data for 21 countries in the 2002 European Social Survey, which included a
series of questions on the economic and social impacts of immigration, as well as on the desirability
of increasing or reducing immigrant inflows. We find that individual attitudes toward immigration
policy reflect a combination of concerns over conventional economic impacts (i.e., wages and taxes)
and compositional amenities, with substantially more weight on the latter. Most of the difference in
attitudes toward immigration between more and less educated natives is attributable to heightened
concerns over compositional amenities among the less-educated.

        Standard economic reasoning suggests that immigration, like trade, creates a

surplus that in principle can be redistributed so all natives are better off (Mundell, 1957).

In practice redistributive mechanisms are incomplete so both policies tend to create

winners and losers. Even so, public support for increased immigration is far weaker than

for expanding trade.1 While the two policies have similar effects on relative factor prices,

immigration also changes the composition of the receiving country’s population,

imposing externalities on the existing population. Previous studies have focused on the

fiscal externalities created by redistributive taxes and benefits (e.g., MaCurdy, Nechyba,

and Bhattacharya, 1998; Borjas, 1999, Hanson, Scheve and Slaughter, 2005). A wider

class of externalities arise through the fact that people value the ‘compositional

amenities’ associated with the characteristics of their neighbors and co-workers. Such

preferences are central to understanding discrimination (Becker, 1957) and choices

between neighborhoods and schools (e.g., Bayer, Ferreira, and McMillan, 2007) and

arguably play an important role in mediating views about immigration.

        This paper presents a new method for quantifying the relative importance of

compositional amenities in shaping individual attitudes toward immigration. The key to

our approach is a series of questions included in the 2002 European Social Survey (ESS)

that elicited views on the effects of immigration on specific domains – including impacts

on relative wages and the fiscal balance, and a country’s culture life – as well as on the

importance of maintaining shared religious beliefs, language, and customs. We use a

latent-factor approach to combine these questions into two factors: one representing

concerns over wages, taxes and benefits; and another representing concerns over

1
 For example, a recent international opinion poll conducted by the Pew Foundation (Pew Global Attitudes
Project, 2007) found uniformly more positive views for free trade than for immigration. Mayda (2008)
documents the same divergence using data from the International Social Survey Program.
compositional amenities. We then relate views on immigration policy, and overall

assessments about the effect of immigration on the economy and the quality of life, to

these latent factors. Our method yields a simple decomposition of the differences in

opinions between demographic groups (e.g., more and less educated worker) into

differences in the two types of concerns.

        Our empirical analysis leads to three main conclusions. First, we find that

attitudes to immigration – expressed by the answer to a question of whether more or

fewer immigrants from certain source countries should be permitted to enter, for example

– reflect a combination of concerns over compositional amenities and the direct economic

impacts of immigration on wages and taxes. Second, we find that the strength of the

concerns that people express over the two channels are positively correlated. This means

that studies that focus exclusively on one factor or the other capture a reasonable share of

the variation in attitudes for or against increased immigration.2

        Our third conclusion is that concerns over compositional amenities are

substantially more important than concerns over the impacts on wages and taxes.3

Specifically, variation in concerns over compositional amenities explain 3-5 times more

of the individual-specific variation in answers to the question of whether more or fewer

immigrants should be permitted to enter than does variation in concerns over wages and

taxes. Concerns over compositional amenities are even more important in understanding

attitudes toward immigrant groups that are ethnically different, or come from poorer

2
  Some previous studies of attitudes toward immigration have ignored compositional amenity effects (e.g.,
Scheve and Slaughter, 2001) while others have focused on “non-economic” explanations for anti-
immigrant attitudes (Espenshade and Hempstead, 1996). An exception is Mayda (2006), who focuses on
both economic and non-economic factors. We interpret concerns over racial and cultural homogeneity –
which are sometimes interpreted as “non-economic” factors – as expressing the importance of
compositional amenities.
3
  A similar conclusion is reached by Citrin, Green, Muste and Wong (1997) using data for the U.S. and by
Dustmann and Preston (2007) using data for the U.K.


                                                    2
countries. Similarly, differences in concerns over compositional amenities account for

about 70% of the gap between high- and low-education respondents over whether more

immigrants should be permitted to enter the country.

       Reassuringly, the latent component of variation that our model identifies as a

concern over the economic impacts of immigration explains a much larger share of

differences in responses to the question of whether immigration is good or bad for the

economy. The contrast suggests that respondents distinguish between the wage and tax

effects of immigration and effects on the composition of the host country, and place

substantial weight on the latter in forming overall views about immigration policies.

       The next section of the paper describes our methodology for evaluating the

relative importance of concerns over direct economic impacts and compositional

amenities in shaping attitudes toward immigration. We describe our basic factor model

and the assumptions we use to identify the model using the questions in the ESS. Section

III gives a brief overview of the ESS and the patterns of responses to the key questions

about immigration in the survey. Section IV presents our main empirical findings, while

Section V presents a series of extensions and robustness checks. We summarize our

main conclusions in Section VI.



II. Theoretical Framework and Estimation Methodology

a. Basic Framework

       Assume that a given individual (indexed by i) evaluates alternative policy

scenarios though an indirect utility function that depends on his or her net income and on

the characteristics of his or her community:




                                               3
        ui( wi + bi − ti , ai ) ,

where wi represents individual i’s gross income, bi and ti represent transfer benefits and

taxes, respectively, and ai is a (multi-dimensional) summary of the characteristics of i’s

community, including such features as the racial composition and religious affiliation of

i’s neighborhood and workplace, and the mean income and poverty rate of i’s neighbors.

        When asked to decide whether more immigration should be allowed, we assume

that the individual compares a hypothetical environment in the presence of more

immigrants (wi′, bi′, ti′, ai′) to the current situation (wiº, biº, tiº, aiº) and reports a

transformation of the difference in indirect utilities:

        yi = gi [ ui(wi′ + bi′ − ti′ , ai′) − ui(wiº + biº − tiº, aiº) ] ,

where gi is a person-specific response function (assumed to be monotonically increasing).

Taking a first order approximation, and allowing for an additive effect from a vector of

covariates (Xi), the observed response of individual i is:

(1)     yi ≈ λ1i ( Δwi + Δbi − Δti ) + λ2i Δai + αXi + μi

where Δwi = wi′ − wiº is the difference in gross earnings between the alternative

scenarios, Δbi, Δti and Δai are the corresponding differences in benefits, taxes, and

compositional amenities, respectively, and μi is an approximating error. Defining λ1 =

E[λ1i] and λ2 = E[λ2i], equation (1) can be rewritten as

(2)     yi =     λ1 f1i + λ2 f2i + αXi + μi

where

        f1i ≡ [λ1i/λ1] × ( Δwi + Δbi − Δti ) and

        f2i ≡ [λ2i/λ2] × Δai .




                                                   4
The individual-specific variables f1i and f2i represent the relative intensities of individual

i’s concerns over the direct economic effect and the compositional amenity effect of the

change, respectively. Note that f1i and f2i incorporate both the magnitudes of the changes

envisioned by the individual (reflected in Δwi, Δbi, Δti, Δai), and the relative importance

of the changes to i (reflected in the magnitudes of λ1i/λ1 and λ2i/λ2).4 An individual may

express stronger concerns about the wage impacts of immigration, for example, because

she projects a larger wage loss as a result of the policy, because she has a higher marginal

utility of income, or because she interprets the response scale differently (i.e., has a

steeper gi function).

         We do not observe f1i and f2i directly. Instead, we observe responses to a series of

questions that provide information about an individual’s realizations of f1i and f2i.

Specifically, we assume that the intensity of concern about direct economic effects of

immigration is reflected in answers to five questions:5

i. Do you agree or disagree that wages and salaries are brought down by immigration?
ii Do you agree or disagree that immigrants harm the economic prospects of the poor?
iii. Do you agree or disagree that immigrants help to fill jobs where there are shortages
     of workers?
iv. Would you say that immigrants generally take jobs away from natives or help create
     new jobs?
v. On balance do you think that immigrants take out more (in health benfefits and
     welfare services) than they put in (in taxes)?



4
  From (1), λ1i = gi′ × ∂ui/∂wi and λ2i = gi′ × ∂ui/∂ai. Thus variation in λji/λj reflects variation in the way that
different individuals interpret the response scale used to measure their policy views, as well as in the
marginal utilities of wages and amenities. Note that the relative magnitude of λ1i and λ2i does not depend
on gi′.
5
  The economic impact questions in the ESS elicit respondents’ views about the effects of immigration on
wages and job opportunities in general, rather than about impacts on their own situation. This wording
choice was influenced by the findings of Kinder and Kiewert (1981) and subsequent researchers that policy
opinions are more closely aligned with answers to questions that pose sociotropic concerns than those that
pose narrow self-interest concerns. Whether this is because people care more about society-wide policy
impacts than personal impacts is widely debated. Our view is that answers to sociotropic questions identify
the strength of personal concern about an issue, and reflect a combination of perceived personal and social
impacts. A similar view is expressed in Bobo and Kluegel (1993).


                                                         5
We assume that concerns about compositional amenities are reflected in answers to five

other questions:

vi. Do you agree or disagree that it is better for a country if everyone shares the same
      customs and traditions?
vii. Do you agree or disagree that it is better for a country if there is a variety of different
      religions?
viii. Do you agree or disagree that it is better for a country if everyone can speak one
      common language?
ix. Would you say that a country’s cultural life is undermined or enriched by the
      presence of immigrants?
x. Do you agree or disagree that a country should stop immigration if it wants to
      reduce social tensions?

Formally, we assume that the responses to these 10 questions, denoted as (z1i, z2i,…,z10i),

are related to the underlying factors f1i and f2i and to observed characteristics of the

respondent by a set of linear equations:6

(3a)    zji = Mj f1i + cj Xi + νji        , j=1,2,…5.

(3b)    zji = Mj f2i + cj Xi + νji        , j=6,7,…10.

Thus, responses to the first 5 questions are treated as noisy indicators of f1i, while

responses to the second group of questions are treated as noisy indicators of f2i.

        To complete the model, we assume that the latent factors are related to the

observed respondent characteristics and a pair of idiosyncratic errors:

(4a)    f1i = b1 Xi + ω1i

(4b)    f2i = b2 Xi + ω2i .

Combing the preceding equations yields a set of reduced forms for the responses (yi, zji):

(5a)    yi = Γ0 Xi + ε0i

        Γ0 = λ1b1 + λ2b2 + α ;              ε0i = λ1 ω1i + λ2 ω2i + μi        ,


(5b)    zji = Γj Xi + εji

6
 Different questions in the ESS used different response scales. As explained below, we assign cardinal
values to the ordered responses then linearly transform the responses to lie between 0 and 1.


                                                    6
         Γj = Mj b1 + cj ;                     εji = Mj ω1i + νji ,          j=1,2,…5 ,

         Γj = Mj b2 + cj ;                     εji = Mj ω2i + νji,          j=6,7,…10 .

These equations form a linear system with cross-equation and covariance restrictions.

         Our goal is to identify the relative importance of the factors f1i and f2i in shaping

preferences over immigration policy.7 We proceed by making a series of assumptions on

the covariances between the error components in the structural equations (2), (3) and (4)

that allow us to identify λ1, λ2, and the Mj’s from the variance-covariance matrix of the

reduced-form residuals ε0i and εji (j=1…10). The remaining parameters – in particular the

coefficients α, b1, and b2 that determine the projection of y on the X’s – are then

identified from the Γj’s (i.e., the reduced-form regression coefficients).8

         Our key assumptions on the error components (μi, νji, ω1i, ω2i) are:

(6a)     Var[ω1i | Xi] = 1, Var[ω2i | Xi] = 1, Cov[ω1i , ω2i | Xi] = σ12 .

(6b)     Var[νji | Xi] = φj , Cov[νji , νki | Xi] = 0 ( j ≠ k ) ,

         Cov[νji, ω1i | Xi] = Cov[νji, ω2i | Xi] = 0 .

(6c)     Var[μi | Xi] = v, Cov[μi ,ω1i | Xi] = Cov[μi ,ω2i | Xi] = Cov[μi , νji | Xi] = 0 .

The assumptions in (6a) are normalizations: we scale the model by assuming that the

variances of the unobserved determinants f1i and f2i are both equal to 1, and we allow an

arbitrary correlation σ12 between them. The assumptions in (6b) are restrictive: here we

are assuming that the correlation between the structural errors for any two indicators




7
 Following footnote 4, note if λ1i = gi′ × ∂ui/∂wi and λ2i = gi′ × ∂ui/∂ai, then the relative magnitude of λ1i
and λ2i does not depend on gi′. So the relative strength of concerns is invariant to the response function.
8
 In practice we follow this “two step” procedure, first estimating a model for the variance-covariance
matrix of the reduced form residuals of the z’s and y, then estimating α, b1, and b2 from the Γj’s. In
principal we could also use a 1-step method.


                                                        7
arises solely through their joint dependence on the latent factors f1i and f2i. Substituting

these assumptions into (5b) and (5b) we have

(7a)   Var[εji | Xi] = Mj² + φj ,

(7b)   Cov[εji, εki | Xi] = Mj Mk       if j≠k and they are from the same group of indicators

(7c)   Cov[εji, εki | Xi] = Mj Mk σ12      if j≠k and they are from different groups.

Equations (7a)-(7c) restrict the 10×10 covariance matrix of the reduced form errors for

the observed indicators to be a function of only 21 parameters: the 10 Mj’s, the 10 φj’s,

and σ12.

       The assumptions in equation (6c) are also restrictive: here we are assuming that

the structural error in the primary response equation, μi, is uncorrelated with the

unobserved determinants of the latent factors, and with structural errors in the equations

for the indicators zji. Provided the two latent factors f1i and f2i are the only channels that

mediate concerns over immigration, these restrictions are plausible, since in that case μi is

effectively an approximation error. As discussed below we evaluate this assumption by

fitting a more general model that allows for a third independent factor representing

altruistic concerns over people in other countries.

       The assumptions in (6c) impose a simple structure on the covariances between the

reduced form error in y and the reduced form errors for the zj’s:

(8a)   Cov[ε0i, εji | Xi] = (λ1 + λ2 σ12 )Mj ,        j≤5

(8b)   Cov[ε0i, εji | Xi] = (λ2 + λ1 σ12 )Mj ,        j≥6 .

(8c)   Var[ε0i | Xi] = λ12 + λ22 + 2λ1λ2σ12 + v .




                                                8
Given σ12 and the Mj’s, λ1, λ2 and v are identified from these residual covariances. In

practice we fit equations (7) and (8) jointly and obtain (Mj , σ12, λ1, λ2, v) in a single

step.9



b. Decomposition of Differences Between Groups

         Although the relative size of λ1 and λ2 identifies the relative importance of

economic concerns and compositional concerns in explaining differences in attitudes

within groups, a decomposition of differences in attitudes between groups requires

estimates of the parameters (α, b1, b2). Equation (5a) specifies that the reduced-form

coefficients relating y to X can be decomposed as:

         Γ0 = λ1b1 + λ2b2 + α .

The total effect of X on y arises through three channels: economic concerns (λ1b1);

amenity concerns (λ2b2); and any direct effect of the X’s on attitudes (α). To sort out the

relative importance of these channels we need estimates of α, b1, and b2.

         Even knowing (Mj , σ12, λ1, λ2, v) it is not possible to separately identify (α, b1, b2)

without further assumptions. Indeed, equations (5a) and (5b) imply that the 11 reduced-

form coefficient vectors (Γ0, Γ1,…Γ10) depend on 13 structural coefficient vectors (α, b1,

b2, c1,… c10). Obviously we need to impose some restrictions on the c’s in order to

identify (α, b1, b2) from the estimated Γk’s. We consider three cases. As a baseline we

assume that cj=0 for j=1,2…10. Under this assumption, the X’s exert no independent

effect on the indicator questions. A weaker assumption is that cj=c for j=1,2…10 (i.e.,

that the X’s have a parallel effect on all the Z’s, holding constant f1i and f2i). A third,


9
 As explained below, we actually fit the system with multiple “y” variables, allowing separate values of λ1
and λ2 (and a separate value for the variance v) for each y-variable.


                                                     9
even weaker assumption is that the X’s have the same effects on the indicators for each of

the underlying factors, i.e., that

        c1 = c2 = c3 = c 4 = c5 = cE   and c6 = c7 = c8 = c9 = c10 = cA .

Each of these assumptions is sufficient to allow us to identify the key coefficients (α, b1,

b2). As we discuss in more detail below, our main decomposition results are quite

similar regardless of the restrictions we impose on the c’s to achieve identification.



c. Extensions

        The model represented by equations (2), (3) and (4) can be extended in a number

of directions. One possibility is that attitudes toward immigration depend on more than

the two factors included in our basic model. As a check we add a third “altruism factor”

reflecting concerns about the welfare of potential immigrants, and use a set of additional

questions in the ESS as indicators of this factor. In principal other factors could also be

added, although identification depends on the availability of suitable indicator questions.

        A second extension is to relax (or modify) the assumed relationship between the

observed indicator questions and the underlying factors. We report on two examples in

Section V, below. In one variant we add a 6th potential indicator of concern over

compositional amenities – a question on the potential relationship between immigration

and crime (“Are crime problems made better or worse by people coming to stay here?”).

In another variant we drop one of the indicators of economic concern (“Do you agree or

disagree that immigrants help to fill jobs where there are shortages of workers?”) that

has a relatively weak relation with the other four questions.

III. Data Sources and Descriptive Statistics

a. The 2002 ESS Survey

         The European Social Survey (ESS) is an annual cross-country survey covering 21

European countries, with 1,500-3,000 respondents per country.10 In collaboration with

the ESS survey design team we developed a special immigration module for the 2002

survey. The aim of the module was to gather respondents’ opinions about immigration

policy, and their views on how immigration affects conditions in their country, in order to

better understand the channels that mediate pro- or anti-immigrant sentiment. We

developed a series of questions that attempt to distinguish between the perceived impacts

of immigration on economic conditions (wages, taxes, unemployment) and social

homogeneity and cohesion that we use as indicators of economic and compositional

amenity concerns.

         Some basic descriptive statistics for the 2002 ESS survey are presented in

Appendix Table 1, which shows sample sizes and demographic characteristics of

respondents in each country. The pooled sample for all 21 countries contains about

36,000 observations and is just over 50% female, has an average age of 47, is made up of

about 90% natives and 10% immigrants, and includes about 3% minority group members

(most of whom are immigrants). As would be expected, the shares of immigrants (and

ethnic minorities) vary substantially across countries, with relatively low immigrant

shares in Finland, Italy, Hungary, and Poland and relatively high fractions in Luxemburg

and Switzerland. On average about one-half of respondents are employed and one-fifth

are retired: these fractions also vary somewhat by country. Forty percent of respondents

10
  Israel also participated in the 2002 ESS, but is excluded from our analysis. Detailed information on the
2002 ESS design and implementation is available at

have only primary schooling while 18% have some tertiary education. The share of less-

educated respondents is relatively high in Portugal, Hungary, Spain, Greece, Italy and the

UK, and relatively low in Norway and Germany.



b. Respondent Attitudes to Immigration

       This subsection describes the questions in the ESS that we use to measure pro-

and anti-immigrant sentiment. A preliminary issue that arises in any cross-country

survey is how to define “immigrants”. Although in Britain and the U.S. an “immigrant”

is usually interpreted as someone born abroad, in countries with citizenship based on

blood ancestry (jus sanguinis) “immigrants” may include people born in the country who

are not citizens. To eliminate ambiguity the questions in the ESS module refer to “people

who come to live in a country” (rather than immigrants or migrants) and solicit opinions

about whether more or less people should be allowed to “come to live here.” For

readability, however, we use the term “immigrants” throughout this paper.

       A related issue is how to measure respondents’ views about restricting the number

of immigrants from different source countries. The ESS module uses a 4-way

classification: richer European countries; poorer European countries; richer non-

European countries; and poorer non-European countries. It also asks separate questions

about admitting people of the same or different ethnicity than the majority population,

yielding a total of 6 questions on the tightening or loosening of immigration policies for

specific immigrant groups. We consider responses to each of these questions as well as

the “average response” to the four country-group-specific responses (i.e., an unweighted

average of the four ordinal responses).

        We also examine responses to two summary assessment questions about the effect

of immigration: (1) “Would you say it is generally bad or good for [this country’s]

economy that people come to live here from other countries?”; (2) Is [this country]

made a worse or a better place to live by people coming to live here from other

countries? These two, plus the seven questions on immigration policy for specific

groups, form the dependent variables in our statistical analysis (i.e., the “y” variables in

our model).

        The ESS questionnaire elicited views about allowing more or less people to come

from different source countries using a 4 point scale (“allow many to come here”, “allow

some”, “allow a few”, “allow none”). Opinions on the two summary assessment

questions were elicited using an 11 point scale (scored 0 to 10).11 Table 1 shows the

distributions of the responses to these questions across all respondents in our 21-country

sample.12 For the 4-point questions (Panel A) we show the complete distribution,

whereas for the 11-point questions (Panel B) we classify the responses into 5 intervals: 0-

1 (relatively strong negative opinion); 2-4 (somewhat negative); 5 (the midpoint

response); 6-8 (somewhat positive) and 9-10 (relatively strong positive).

        The responses in Panel A suggest a diversity of opinion on immigration issues,

with 40-45% of ESS respondents preferring to admit none, or only a few immigrants

from a particular source group, and 55-60% preferring to admit some or many.

Respondents are slightly more supportive of immigration from rich European countries

than from poor non-European countries, although the differential is modest. They are



11
   I.e., respondents were asked to fill in a number between 1 and 10 with 1 representing “bad for the
economy” (or “worse place to live”) and 10 representing “good for the economy” (or “better place to live”).
12
   In Table 1 and elsewhere in the paper we drop all missing or “don’t know” responses.


                                                    13
also more favourably disposed toward people of the same ethnicity than those of a

different ethnic background, but again the differential is small.

       The responses to the overall assessment questions, in Panel B, reveal a similar

diversity of opinion. Interestingly, people have more positive views about the economic

effects of immigration than on the question of whether immigrants make the country a

better place to live. For example, 38% rate the economic effect of immigration with a

score of 6 or higher (on a 0-10 point scale), whereas only 28% rate the effect on the

quality of life in the same positive range. In the context of our model this contrast

suggests that many respondents associate immigration with negative compositional

amenities that offset the economic benefits of population inflows.

       For ease of interpretation we linearly re-scaled the ordinal responses to these

questions so that the most positive (pro-immigrant) response is 1 and the most negative

(anti-immigrant) response is 0. Table 2 shows the correlation matrix of the re-scaled

responses to the 8 questions across the overall ESS sample. The main entries in the table

are simple correlations, while the entries in parentheses are adjusted correlations, based

on residuals from regressions on country dummies and a set of observed covariates

(gender, age, ethnicity, employment status, and city residence). Responses to the first

six immigration policy questions are highly inter-correlated, but the correlations between

these questions and the overall assessment questions are weaker. The adjusted

correlations are only slightly smaller in magnitude than the raw correlations, reflecting

the fact that the R-squared coefficients from the first-step regressions are modest (<0.15).

       Although our focus in this paper is on understanding the channels that mediate

pro- and anti-immigrant sentiment within a given country, much existing research has




                                             14
addressed cross-country differences in attitudes toward immigration.13 Appendix Table 2

presents the means of the standardized responses to the questions described in Tables 1

and 2 for each of the 21 countries in our sample. The range of national opinions is

relatively wide: in the two countries with the most negative views about immigration

(Greece and Hungary) the mean standardized response to the question on allowing more

immigrants of a different ethnicity is 0.3114, whereas in Sweden – the country with the

most positive view – the mean standardized response is 0.69. Using the same metric,

opinions are also relatively negative in Portugal (0.41) and Austria (0.44), and relatively

positive in Switzerland (0.59) and Italy (0.57).

        Figure 1 illustrates the cross-country variation in average responses to the two

“overall assessment” questions. Each point in the figure represents a country: the x-axis

shows the mean response to the question “Is immigration good or bad for the economy?”

while the y-axis shows the mean response to the question “Do immigrants make the

country a better or worse place to live?” Across countries the answers are highly

correlated (ρ=0.7), though there are some notable departures from the 45 degree line.

Sweden (SE) and Austria (AT) make an interesting comparison: residents of the two

countries have similar (and relatively positive) opinions about the economic effect of

immigrants, but much different views about their effect on quality of life. Interestingly,

their responses on the immigration policy questions are more closely aligned with the

latter: Swedes have the most positive opinion on allowing more immigrants whereas

Austrians are among the most negative.

  Note that the standardized response for this question assigns a value of 1 for “allow many”, 0.66 for
“allow some”, 0.33 for “allow few” and 0 for “allow none. A mean value of 0.31 implies that the average
response is somewhat less favorable than the second lowest category.


                                                   15
c. Indicators of Concerns about the Effects of Immigration

         An innovative feature of the ESS immigration module, and the key to our

identification strategy, is the series of “indicator” questions described in Section II that

ask respondents about the effects of immigration on wages, job opportunities, and taxes,

on one hand, and social, cultural, and linguistic cohesion on the other. Table 3 shows the

mean values of the standardized responses to these questions (column 1), along with the

correlations of the indicator responses with three summary measures of pro- or anti-

immigrant sentiment: the average response to the four questions about allowing

many/some/few/none people from different sending countries (column 2); the response to

whether immigration is good or bad for the economy (column 3); and the response to

whether immigrants make the country a better or worse place to live (column 4).15

         The mean responses to the indicator questions suggest a mildly negative opinion

about the economic effects of immigration. For example, the mean responses to the

questions “Do you agree or disagree that wages are brought down by immigration?” and

“Do you agree or disagree that immigrants harm the economic prospects of the poor?”

are 0.49 and 0.43, respectively, using the scaling convention that “strongly agree”=0,

“strongly disagree”=1, and “neither agree nor disagree”=0.5. Opinions on the

compositional effects of immigration are more variable. There is wide agreement that “it

is better for a country if everyone can speak a common language?” (mean = 0.17),

whereas respondents are evenly split over the value of a single religion (mean = 0.51) and

are mildly supportive of the view that immigration enriches cultural life (mean = 0.58).



15
  As with the questions on immigration policy and the overall effect of immigration, we standardize the
responses to the indicator questions using a linear transformation of the original ordinal scale that sets the
most negative (anti-immigrant) response to 0 and the most positive (pro-immigrant) response to 1.


                                                      16
        In one of our robustness checks (see section Va) we consider adding a sixth

indicator of compositional concerns, based on responses to the question “Are crime

problems made worse or better by people coming to live here?”. As shown in Table 3,

responses to this question show that many people believe immigrants cause additional

crime: the standardized response is 0.31, with 40% of respondents in the lowest 3

categories (0-3 on a 0-10 scale) 16 Responses to this question are reasonably highly

correlated with responses to the other 5 indicators of compositional concerns (with

correlations between 0.16 and 0.35).

        We also extend our basic two-factor model by adding a third channel of concern

reflecting international responsibility and altruism. We use responses to three additional

questions as indicators of this factor:

i. Do you think that when people leave their country to come here it has a good or bad
     effect on their country in the long run?
ii. Do you agree or disagree that richer countries have a responsibility to accept people
     from poorer countries?
iii. Do you agree or disagree that all countries benefit if people can move to countries
     where their skills are most needed?

Responses to these three questions are summarized in the bottom rows of Table 3. ESS

respondents tend to agree that emigration harms the sending country (mean response =

0.44), but also tend to agree that rich countries have a responsibility to accept

immigrants, (mean response = 0.60), and that free mobility benefits all countries (mean

response = 0.68).

        As shown in columns (2)-(4) of Table 3, responses to most of the indicator

questions are reasonably highly correlated with views on immigration policy (column 2),

and with overall assessments of the effects of immigration (columns 3 and 4). Focusing

16
  Unlike the case in the U.S. (see e.g., Butcher and Piehl, 2007) immigrants appear to be over-represented
in the prison populations in many European countries – see Wasquant, 1999.


                                                    17
on the indicators for our two main channels, the weakest correlations are for the question

of whether immigrants tend to fill shortages, and on the value of a common language.

The “fill vacancies” question is also weakly correlated with the other indicators of

economic concerns, so in one of our robustness checks we consider taking it out of the

model. The low correlation between the “common language” question and the y-

variables reflects the near consensus on the positive value of a common language.17

Looking across the rows of Table 3, the question asking whether immigrants undermine

or enrich cultural life has the strongest correlation with the overall assessment of whether

immigration is good or bad for the country (ρ=0.61). Responses to several other

indicators for economic and compositional concerns are also relatively highly correlated

with the “good or bad for the country” question, e.g., whether immigrants take away or

create jobs (ρ=0.47) and whether the country should stop immigration to reduce social

tensions (ρ=0.45). In contrast, the indicators for altruistic concerns are relatively weakly

correlated with the outcome variables.



IV. Estimation Results

a. Preliminaries

        Our estimation procedure has three steps. First, we estimate unrestricted OLS

regressions of the outcome variable (y) and the indicators (the z’s) on the observed

covariates X. Then we take the covariance matrix of the reduced form residuals and

apply a minimum-distance technique to estimate the structural parameters (M1,…M10,




17
  Over 90 percent of respondents either strongly agree (42%) or agree (51%) with the view that a common
language is better.


                                                  18
φ1,…φ10, σ12, λ1, λ2, v).18 Finally, we use these parameters and the estimated reduced-

form coefficients Γj (j=0,1,…10) to estimate the coefficient vectors b1, b2, and c1,… c10.

As explained in Appendix A, the third step is accomplished by a simple least squares

algorithm.

        We include in the vector X a constant, country dummies, and a set of 13 personal

characteristics: indicators for age (3 dummies), gender, education (2 dummies), labor

force status (3 dummies), immigrant status, minority status, and city size (2 dummies).

Thus, the Γj’s and the vectors (α, b1, b2, cj) all have dimension 34. As noted earlier, we

use 9 different y-variables (the 8 variables listed in Table 1 plus an average of the

responses to the 4 questions on allowing different groups to immigrate). Estimates of the

Γj’s for these 9 y-variables and the total of 13 potential indicator variables, as well as the

variance-covariance matrix of the estimated reduced form residuals, are available from

the authors on request.



b. Results for Baseline Model

        Table 4 summarizes the estimation results from our baseline specification. (A

complete set of parameter estimates is available on request). The columns of Table 4

shows the results for 3 choices of y: the average of the responses to the 4 questions on

allowing people to immigrate (column 1); the response to whether immigration is good or

bad for the economy (column 2); and the response to whether immigrants make the

country better or worse (column 3). For each choice of y we show the estimated values

of the “loading factors” (λ1, λ2), the estimate of the correlation σ12 between the two latent

18
   We use unweighted minimum distance. Our methodology is summarized in Appendix A. We actually
fit the model to the indicators and the full set of 9 y’s jointly. Thus we estimate (M1,…M10), (φ1,…φ10),
σ12, and 9 triples of coefficients (λ1, λ2,v) – one triple for each y. .


                                                    19
factors (which is the same, regardless of the choice of y), and the implied decompositions

of the estimated differentials in the outcomes between young (under 30) and old (over 60)

respondents (rows 3a-3c), between high- and low- education respondents (rows 4a-4c),

between unemployed and employed respondents (rows 5a-5c), and between big city

residents and residents of rural areas (rows 6a-6c).19

         Looking first at our main outcome measure – the averaged “immigration policy”

variable in column 120 – the estimates of λ1 and λ2 are 0.025 and 0.102, respectively.

Since the latent factors are scaled to have unit variance, these estimates imply that

concerns over compositional amenities are roughly 4 times more important in explaining

the variation in opinions on immigration policy within demographic subgroups than

concerns over economic issues.

         The estimate of the correlation of the latent factors is relatively high (close to 0.8)

so on average, people who express stronger concerns about one factor tend to express

stronger concerns about the other. In the context of the model represented by equations

(1) and (2) the scale of this correlation depends on the correlation of the presumed

impacts of immigration on respondents’ incomes and local amenities, and on how these

impacts are correlated with the “loudness” that people report their concerns on a survey

like the ESS. If people who tend to respond to questionnaires by selecting extreme

responses anticipate larger impacts of immigration on their wages and local amenities the

two latent concerns will be more highly correlated than if those who tend to select


19
   As shown in equation (5a), the reduced form regression coefficients Γ0 (from the regression of y on X)
can be decomposed as: Γ0 = λ1b1 + λ2b2 + α . Since all the elements of X are dummies representing
different categories of people, the estimated coefficients in Γ0 represent differentials in mean responses
across groups.
20
   This average is perhaps most similar to the question typically analyzed in the literature (e.g. Scheve and
Slaughter 2001; Mayda, 2006; O’Rourke and Sinnott 2003), which asks whether immigration should be
reduced or increased, with no reference to source country.


                                                     20
responses closer to the middle anticipate larger impacts.21 In any case, the high

correlation of the latent factors suggests that one could elicit a relatively accurate overall

opinion about immigration policy by only focusing on one channel or the other.

        The decomposition results in rows 3-6 suggest that a relatively high fraction of

the differences in opinions about immigration policy by age, education, labor force status,

and city size is explained by differences in concerns over compositional amenities,

whereas the contribution of economic concerns is smaller. Specifically, about 70% of the

gaps between older and younger respondents, and between low-educated and high-

educated respondents, are attributed to compositional concerns. The share of the gap

between employed and unemployed is smaller (50%) whereas the share of the gap

between large city and rural residents is a little larger (77%).

        The results in column 2 for the question of whether immigration is good or bad

for the economy provide an interesting contrast to those in column 1. Here, the loading

factors are 0.120 and 0.038, respectively, suggesting that the latent component of

variance we are identifying as “economic concerns” (over wages, taxes and benefits) has

over a 4 times larger effect on the overall assessment about economic effects of

immigration than the latent component we are identifying as “compositional amenity

concerns.” At first glance the fact that compositional concerns play any role in the

response on the “good or bad for the economy” question may be interpreted as a problem

for our identification assumptions. Our interpretation, however, is that respondents, like

many economists, view cultural, linguistic, and ethnic diversity as potential problems for

21
  Suppose that respondent i believes that an increase in immigration will lead to a change Δwi in her wage,
and a change Δai in the composition of her neighborhood. Suppose that people have similar indirect utility
functions u(w+b−t, a), but vary in their response functions gi. Respondent i’s concern about the wage
effect of immigration is gi′·∂u/∂w Δwi while her concern about the amenity effect is gi′·∂u/∂a Δai. The
correlation of the reported concerns depends on how gi is correlated with Δwi, and Δai.


                                                    21
the economy. Lazear (1999) for example, has argued that a common culture and

language enhance trade and specialization. Likewise a large literature in development

economics concludes that ethnic diversity harms political stability and growth (see e.g.,

Easterly and Levine, 1997; Alesina and La Ferrera, 2003).

       Consistent with the relative magnitudes of λ1 and λ2, a relatively large share of the

between-group differences in answers to the “good or bad for the economy” question is

explained by differential economic concerns. For example, about 70% of the 0.12 gap

between high- and low education respondents is attributable to economic concerns.

Economic concerns more than fully explain the gaps between young and old respondents,

and between the employed and unemployed.

       Column 3 shows the results for a second overall assessment question – do

immigrants make the country a better or worse place to live? For this question λ1=0.047

and λ2=0.100, implying that compositional concerns are about twice as important as

economic concerns. There is some tendency for the model to “over-explain” differentials

in answers to this question by age and education. Indeed, differences in compositional

concerns are large enough to fully explain the age and education gaps. Differences in

economic concerns tend to contribute more explanatory power.

       Although the average response to questions about admitting more or less

immigrants is a useful summary measure of policy views, it is also interesting to compare

the relative importance of economic and compositional concerns in explaining opinions

about specific immigrant groups. Table 5 shows the results for the average measure (top

row of the table) and for each of the four country groups, as well as for questions about

admission of people of the same or different ethnicity. The estimate of λ1 – which




                                            22
reflects the relative intensity of economic concerns – is a little bigger for questions about

European versus non-European immigrants, and for people of the same ethnicity than for

those of different ethnicity. One explanation for this pattern is that respondents perceive

Europeans and immigrants of the same ethnicity as potential substitutes for their labor

services, whereas non-Europeans and those of a different ethnicity as viewed as potential

complements. The estimates of λ2 – which reflect the relative intensity of compositional

concerns – follow a very different pattern, being lower for people from rich countries

(and for those of the same ethnicity), and higher for people from poor countries (and for

those of a different ethnicity).

        As shown in columns 3-8 of Table 3, differences in the intensity of economic

concerns explain a relatively modest share (10-20%) of the age and education gaps in

average opinions about admission of different groups. Differences in the intensity of

concern over compositional effects play a larger role, explaining 50% of differential

between high- and low educated respondents in views about admitting people from rich

European countries but 90% or more of the gap in views about admitting people from

poorer countries or those of a different ethnicity.



V. Robustness Checks and Extensions

a. Varying the Indicator Questions

        The identification of our structural model is predicated on the a priori link

between the latent factors and the indicator questions. We have estimated a number of

alternative specifications in which we add or subtract questions from the set that are

associated with each factor. In this section we briefly summarize two examples. First, we




                                             23
consider adding a sixth question on immigration and crime to the set of indicators of

concern over compositional amenities. Crime is a “hot button” issue that is often raised

by critics of immigration, and as we noted in the discussion of Table 3, responses on the

question of whether immigration makes crime better or worse are fairly high correlated

with our the indicators of compositional concern. Second, we consider removing the

question on whether immigrants fill job vacancies from the set of indicators of economic

concerns. Responses to this question are more favorable (i.e., pro-immigrant) than

responses to the other economic indicators and are also noticeably less related to opinions

on immigration policy (see Table 3).

       Table 6a summarizes the estimation results for the specification that adds the

question on crime as a sixth indicator of compositional concerns. This addition leads to a

larger estimate of λ2 and a smaller estimate of λ1 for all three outcome variables in the

table. For the immigration policy question (column 1) and the quality of life measure

(column 3) compositional concerns are now about 9-10 times more important than

economic concerns in explaining within-group variation in attitudes. For the “good or

bad for the economy” question (column 2) the relative size of f λ2 is also increased

relative to the baseline specification, though the change is small. When concerns over

crime are included as an indicator of compositional concerns, this factor also explains a

somewhat larger share of the variation in average responses by age, education,

employment status, or city size.

       Table 6b summarizes the results when we remove the “weakest” indicator of

economic concerns, which asks to what extent immigrants fill job vacancies. This

change leads to estimates that are very close to our baseline model, although for all three




                                             24
outcomes the relative importance of economic concerns falls slightly. Similar findings

emerge when we evaluate the effect of removing other indicator questions. In each case

we obtain estimates that are relatively close to those from our baseline model, with

similar magnitudes for the key factor loading parameters λ1 and λ2.

         We have also estimated variants of the model in which one (or more) of the

indicator questions is allowed to reflect both economic and compositional concerns.22 In

one case, for example, we allowed the question on whether “immigrants take out more

than they put in” to depend on both economic and compositional concerns. This

specification led to estimates of λ1 and λ2 that are not too different from those in our

baseline model, though again the relative importance of compositional concerns was

slightly higher. All in all we believe the estimates reported for our baseline model are

broadly representative of the range of results from alternative specifications of the

indicator variables.



b. Alternative Assumptions on the c-vector

         In our model the relative effects of economic and compositional concerns are

identified from the correlations of the responses of the indicator questions to the outcome

questions, after conditioning out the effects of the X’s (i.e., within demographic groups)

As noted in Section II, we then have to restrict the way that the X’s affect the indicator

questions (i.e., the c vectors in equations 3a and 3b) in order to identify the contributions

of economic and compositional concerns in explaining differences in average opinions

across demographic groups. Our baseline model imposes the rather strict assumption

22
  Formally, This change replaces equations (3a) and (3b) with a more general specification: zji = M1j f1i +
M2j f2i + cj Xi + νji . Provided that there are some indicators that only depend on f1i, and others that only
depend on f2i, the model remains identified.


                                                     25
that cj = 0 for all j. Table 7 compares the implications of this choice to two alternatives:

cj = c for all j (i.e., a single c vector) and cj = cE for all 5 indicators of economic concern,

cj = cA for all 5 indicators of compositional concerns (i.e., factor-specific c-vectors).23

Comparisons across the columns of Table 7 suggest that the alternative choices lead to

similar qualitative conclusions about the relative importance of economic and

compositional concerns in explaining views about admitting more or less immigrants.

Irrespective of the assumptions on the c-vectors, our model implies that most of the

differences in average opinions by age, education, employment status, and city size are

driven by differences in compositional concerns.

         We have also compared the decompositions of mean responses for the country-

group specific questions and for the two summary questions, and found that the

qualitative conclusions are invariant to the specification of the c-vector. Mean

differences across groups in response to the “better or worse for the economy” question

are largely attributable to differences in economic concerns, while differences in response

to the question “do immigrants make this a better or worse place to live” are mainly

attributed to differences in compositional concerns.



c. Three Factor Model

         Our baseline model assumes that respondents answer questions about immigration

policy from a purely self-interested perspective, giving no weight to the welfare of

potential immigrants. To evaluate the potential limitations of this view we developed an

extended 3-factor model that includes a third “altruistic” channel. We use the three


23
  Note that alternative assumptions on cj have no effect on the estimates of λ1, λ2, or σ12: in all three cases
these are the same as in Table 4.


                                                      26
questions described at the bottom of Table 3 as indicators of respondents’ altruistic

concerns. These questions ask whether respondents think immigration is good or bad for

the sending country; whether rich countries have a responsibility to accept migrants; and

whether they agree or disagree that free mobility benefits all countries (i.e., both sending

and receiving nations).

        Estimation results for this model are summarized in Table 8. The estimates of the

loading factors λ1 and λ2 are not too different from our baseline model, although in the

case of the immigration policy question (column 1) the altruism factor appears to pick up

some of the variation that was attributed to compositional concerns in our 2-factor model.

For the overall assessment questions (columns 2 and 3) the estimates of λ3 are statistically

different than 0 but of a relatively small magnitude. The estimated correlations of the

three latent factors are all relatively large and positive.

        Interestingly, the addition of altruistic concerns does not change our conclusion

about the relative importance of economic and compositional concerns in explaining

differences in views across groups. The decompositions in Table 8 suggest that

compositional concerns account for 60% or more of the gaps across age and education

groups, whereas economic concerns account for no more than 13%.



d. Fitting the Model by Country

        Up to this point we have pooled responses to the ESS survey from each of the 21

countries, adding a set of country dummy variables to the vector X to adjust for

differences across countries. Arguably, however, there are such wide differences across

European countries in the historical context of immigration, and in the salience of




                                               27
economic and compositional concerns, that the full set of parameters in our model may

vary across countries. As a final robustness check we therefore estimated our baseline

model separately for each country. The results are summarized in Table 9, where we

show the estimates of the key parameters λ1 and λ2 for each country, along with the

shares of the age and education gaps in average opinions about whether more or less

immigrants should be admitted that are attributable to economic and compositional

concerns.

         The estimates of λ1 and λ2 for the individual countries suggest that in nearly all

European countries, compositional concerns outweigh economic concerns in mediating

opinions about immigration policy. In three countries – Austria, Spain, and France – the

estimate of λ1 is actually slightly negative while in 8 others the estimate is positive but

relatively small and insignificantly different from 0. In contrast the estimates of λ2 are all

positive and significant, with a range of point estimates from 0.053 to 0.156.24 The sole

exception to the tendency for the estimate of λ2 to exceed the estimate of λ1 is Poland.25

         Reflecting the relative magnitudes of the estimates of λ1 and λ2, the

decompositions of the age and education gaps in opinions about immigration policy in

columns 3-8 of Table 9 suggest that compositional concerns are typically more important

than economic concerns in explaining the more negative opinions of older (over age 60)

versus younger (under age 30) respondents, and likewise in explaining the more positive

opinions of highly educated (at least some tertiary education) versus poorly educated

   Although not reported in the table, the estimates of the correlation between the latent factors are all in the
range of 0.70 to 0.90.

   The parameter estimates for Luxembourg are not reported in Table 9, since the estimates are extremely
imprecise. The estimates for λ1 and λ2 are -0.74 (standard error = 1.54) and 0.87 (1.54) respectively. We
attribute the imprecision to the very small sample of respondents with useable data from Luxembourg
(n=553).

(only primary schooling) respondents. The relative importance of compositional

concerns in explaining the education gaps for different countries is illustrated in Figure 2,

which plots the education gap in compositional concerns in each country against the raw

education gap for that country. The scatter of points suggests that a very strong

relationship between the total gap and the share attributable to compositional concerns.

           We also examined the relative importance of economic and compositional

concerns in explaining responses to the two overall assessment questions. Consistent

with our findings for the pooled sample, in nearly all countries economic concerns are the

dominant channel influencing views about whether immigrants are “good or bad for the

economy” whereas compositional concerns are the dominant channel influencing views

about whether immigrants make the country “ a better or worse place to live”.26 As in

Table 9, the estimates of λ1 and λ2 for the two overall assessment questions are relatively

tightly distributed around the corresponding point estimates from the pooled model,

suggesting that the pooled estimates are a good summary of the “average” importance of

the channels in different countries.



VI. Discussion and Conclusion

           Why is the general public more favorably inclined to the liberalization of trade

than to an opening-up of immigration? In standard models the two policies are

effectively substitutes. But these models fail to take into account the value that people

place on compositional amenities. Immigration, unlike trade, changes the composition of

the receiving country’s population: its ethnic distribution, culture, and religion. A large

body of economic research has shown that concerns over the characteristics of neighbors,
26
     Luxembourg generates poorly identified (and rather large) estimates for λ1 and λ2 for these outcomes too.

schoolmates, and co-workers play an important role in decision-making over what

neighborhood to live in; what schools to attend; which city to live in; and which

employees to hire. In this paper we argue that similar concerns play an important part in

mediating views about immigration policy.

       Using a set of questions explicitly designed for the 2002 European Social Survey

we estimate a simple structural model that assumes that people care about both the

“conventional” economic effects of immigration (on their wages, taxes, and benefits) and

the compositional effects on their neighborhoods, schools, and workplaces. Our

empirical results confirm that both concerns are important, though compositional

concerns are significantly more important in understanding the variation in attitudes

toward immigration policy. For example, 70% of the gap between the most- and least-

educated respondents in the ESS on the issue of whether immigration should be increased

or reduced is attributable to differences in the intensity of concern over compositional

amenities, while differences in economic concerns account for 10-15%. Differences in

compositional concerns also explain most of the differences in attitudes between older

and younger respondents. The age gap is a particular puzzle for models of immigration

preferences that ignore compositional amenities, because many older people are retired,

and face a much lower threat of labor market competition than young people.

       While our inferences are based on purely observational data, and rely on a

restrictive structural model, we present a number of robustness checks and extensions

that support our general conclusions about the importance of compositional concerns.

Importantly, however, we also show that economic concerns explain a very high share of

the variation in attitudes to a question about whether immigration is “good or bad for the




                                            30
economy”. Respondents appear to distinguish between the conventional economic effects

of immigration on relative wages and fiscal balances, and the effects on compositional

amenities, and place a relatively high weight on the compositional effects in deciding

their views about immigration policy.

Appendix A: Estimation Procedures and Identification


In this section we explain in detail how we estimate the parameters of the model and

derive standard errors. To simplify notation and allow for an arbitrary number of

concerns, we use matrix algebra notation. We assume the sample consists of N

independent observations on an outcome response (y), and a set of indicator responses

(z’s). Specifically, let y be the 1×N vector of outcome responses, z be the q×N matrix of

underlying opinions, X be the k×N matrix of covariates and f be the p×N matrix of

underlying factors (or “concerns”). Let μ , v and ω be 1×N, q×N and p×N vectors of

residuals. Model parameters then include a 1×p vector Λ , a 1×k vector α , a q×p vector

M, a q×k vector C and a 1×p vector B such that

(A-1) y = Λf + αX + μ

(A-2) z = Mf + CX + ν

(A-3) f = BX + ω

Equation (A-1) corresponds to equation (2), where we have combined λ1 and λ2 to form

the vector Λ and generalized to allow for p factors. Equations (A-2) and (A-3)

corresponds to equations (3-a), (3-b) and (4-a), (4-b) where we have again combined

parameters to form appropriate matrices. Note that M has the special form



          ⎛ M1      0    ...  0 ⎞
          ⎜                       ⎟
          ⎜ 0      M2    ... 0 ⎟
(A-4) M = ⎜                         .
             :      :     :   : ⎟
          ⎜                       ⎟
          ⎜ 0       0    ... M P ⎟⎠
          ⎝

To form the reduced form equations (corresponding to equations (5-a) and (5-b) in the

text) , we substitute (A-3) into (A-1) and (A-2) to obtain:
(A-5)    y = (ΛB + α ) X + ( μ + Λω ) = Γ0 X + ε 0

(A-6) z = (MB + C)X + (ν + Mω ) = Γ 1 X + ε 1

             ⎛ε ⎞
and let ε = ⎜⎜ 0 ⎟⎟ with Ω = E (εε') .
             ⎝ ε1 ⎠

Step 1: Estimating the reduced form

We begin by estimating the reduced form coefficients by standard multivariate linear

regression to form estimates Γˆ 0 = yX' (XX' ) −1 and Γˆ 1 = zX' (XX' ) −1 . This allows us to

condition out the effects of the variables collected in X, and work with the reduced form

                ⎛ εˆ ⎞
residuals εˆ = ⎜⎜ 0 ⎟⎟ = εP , where εˆ0 = y (I − X' (XX' ) −1 X) = yP = ε 0 P and
                ⎝ εˆ 1 ⎠

εˆ 1 = z(I − X' (XX' ) −1 X) = zP = ε 1 P . The variance-covariance matrix Ω is consistently

             ˆ =      1                    ˆ ) = 1 E (εPε ') = 1 E (trPεε') = Ω .
estimated by Ω           εˆεˆ ' , since E (Ω
                    N −k                        N −k          N −k

Asymptotically the estimates are distributed as

          ⎛ vecΓˆ − vecΓ ⎞     ⎛                                ⎞
                         ⎟ → N ⎜ ⎛⎜ 0 ⎞⎟, ⎛⎜ Ω ⊗ ( XX' ) 0 ⎞⎟ ⎟ ≡ N (0, V ) ,
                                                        −1
(A-7)    N⎜                       ⎜    ⎟                     ⎟
          ⎜ vecΩˆ − vecΩ ⎟     ⎜⎝0⎠ ⎜0                     Q ⎠ ⎟⎠
          ⎝              ⎠     ⎝           ⎝

where Q is an appropriately defined matrix of fourth order moments.

Step 2: Estimating the Loading Matrix Μ

We assume that (in accordance with equations (6-a), (6-b) and (6-c)) μ , v and ω are

mutually orthogonal so that

        ⎡⎛ μ ⎞⎛ μ ⎞ ' ⎤         ⎛σ μ 0 0 ⎞
        ⎢⎜ i ⎟⎜ i ⎟         ⎥   ⎜        ⎟
(A-8) E ⎢⎜ ν i ⎟⎜ ν i ⎟ X i ⎥ = ⎜ 0 φ 0 ⎟
        ⎢⎜ ω ⎟⎜ ω ⎟         ⎥   ⎜        ⎟
        ⎣⎢⎝ i ⎠⎝ i ⎠        ⎦⎥  ⎝0 0 Σ⎠

where φ is diagonal and the diagonal elements of Σ are all unity. Therefore

           ⎛ ΛΣΛ '+σ μ        ΛΣM ' ⎞ ⎛ Ω 11 Ω 12 ⎞
(A-9) Ω = ⎜⎜                          ⎟=⎜             ⎟.
           ⎝ MΣΛ '           MΣM '+ϕ ⎟⎠ ⎜⎝ Ω 21 Ω 22 ⎟⎠

            ˆ ,Σ
We estimate M  ˆ , φˆ by equally weighted minimum distance. That is to say we set the

                   ˆ ,Σ
free parameters of M  ˆ , φˆ to solve

             ˆΣ
(A-10) min v(M ˆM        ˆ )' v(M
                ˆ '+φˆ − Ω      ˆΣˆM        ˆ )
                                   ˆ '+φˆ − Ω
                           22                 22


where v(.) denotes the operator eliminating the supradiagonal elements from the

vectorisation of the argument (applied to avoid duplication of the off-diagonal moment

conditions). Vectorising and totally differentiating the moment conditions yields:

 d vec Ω 22 = [(MΣ ⊗ I q ) + (I q ⊗ MΣ)K qq ] d vec M + (M ⊗ M) d vec Σ + d vec φ

              = G M dvec M + G Σ dvecΣ + G φ dvecφ

where K qq is an appropriate commutation matrix and this equation defines G M , G Σ and

G φ . Hence




                                                39
          ⎛ vec M ˆ ⎞

where G 1 = ⎜ G Σ ' ⎟ and G 1+ = G 1 (G 1 ' G 1 ) −1 is the Moore-Penrose inverse.

            ⎜Gφ ' ⎟
            ⎝       ⎠

Step 3: Estimating the Factor Weights Λ

Having obtained estimates of M and Σ , we now estimate Λ by Λˆ = Ω
                                                                 ˆ M
                                                                   12
                                                                      ˆ +Σ
                                                                         ˆ −1 where

ˆ + =M
M    ˆ (M
        ˆ 'M
           ˆ ) −1 , which amounts again to applying equally weighted minimum

distance. Thus, vectorising and totally differentiating the above expression gives

d vec Λˆ = dΛˆ ' = [ Σ

                                                                       ˆ M + ]d vec Σ

from which, using standard formulae for differentials of inverses, we can form an

expression of the form d Λˆ ' = H 12 d vec Ω

for decomposing Γ̂ 0 into contributions through the p channels, λ̂i B̂i for i=1,…p, and

also for estimating α. Furthermore d λˆi Bˆ i = λˆi d Bˆ i + d λˆi Bˆ i from which standard errors

on the components of the decomposition can easily be calculated given the formula above

for the joint distribution of B̂ and Λ̂ .

Consider now the case where C ≠ 0. Suppose, for example, that C = ec where e is a q×1

vector of ones and c is a 1×k row vector of elements to be estimated. Then B and c are

jointly estimated by ⎜⎜ ⎟⎟ = (M          1

We can weaken this even further by keeping C = ec but generalizing e to a (q×p) matrix

of ones and zeros

case of C=0.
