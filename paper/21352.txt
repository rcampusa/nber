                                          ABSTRACT

This paper provides new evidence on how household labor supply responds to fatal and severe
non-fatal health shocks in the short- and medium-run. To identify the causal effects of these
shock realizations, we leverage administrative data on families' health and labor market
outcomes, and construct counterfactuals to affected households by using households that
experience the same shock but a few years in the future. We find that fatal health shocks lead to
an immediate increase in the surviving spouses' labor supply and that this effect is entirely driven
by families who experience significant income losses. Accordingly, widows, who face large
income losses when their husbands die, increase their labor force participation by more than 11%;
while widowers, who are significantly more financially stable, slightly decrease their labor
supply. Notably, however, the patterns of sensitivity to comparable income changes are similar
across genders. In contrast to fatal shocks, we find that non-fatal health shocks‚Äîin particular,
heart attacks or strokes‚Äîhave no meaningful effects on spousal labor supply, consistent with the
adequate insurance coverage for the associated foregone income. Overall, the results point to self-
insurance as a driving mechanism for the family labor supply responses that we estimate.
Combined with a stylized model, our findings suggest efficient ways to target government
transfers through existing social insurance programs.

1     Introduction
     Severe illnesses and the subsequent deaths of primary earners are among the most devastating

shocks that households face and are a major source of nancial risk.                            Studying how households

respond to severe adverse health events is therefore important for our understanding of self-insurance

behavior over the life cycle, where a key potential self-insurance mechanism against income shocks is

the labor supply of family members. Beyond its implications for household behavior, the degree to

which households insure through labor supply is central for the design of social insurance programs.

The programs that protect households against the potential income losses imposed by fatal and non-

fatal health shocksnamely, survivors and disability insurancehave become among the largest
                                                                                                     1
safety-net programs in most OECD countries in recent decades (OECD 2014).

     Consequently, economists have been long interested in analyzing the eects of adverse health

shocks on one hand, and in empirically uncovering the insurance role of spousal labor supply on the

other hand. Yet, there is markedly limited direct evidence regarding the important link between

these two signicant strands of the literature.               Specically, we lack clear consensus about family

members' labor supply responses to severe health shocks, and there is virtually no work on the

impacts of fatal shocks in the modern literature.

     Estimating these responses has been impeded by two main challenges. The rst is the unavail-

ability of large-scale    household-level     data on health and labor market outcomes, which are necessary

for accurate estimation of family (rather than own) labor supply responses. The second obstacle

is the diculty of isolating causal eects of shocks in the presence of complex dynamics. Identi-

cation of impacts in our context requires constructing counterfactuals that account for life-cycle

and time patterns in family labor supply which, among many other factors, are likely to depend on

ex-ante expectations. Some papers have successfully done so in various contexts by using matched
                                                                                            2
control groups from the pool of untreated units based on observables.                           However, as we illustrate

below, strategies that rely on unaected households as controls are inadequate for our purposes.

In particular, we show within our setting that aected and observably-similar unaected house-

holds exhibit substantially dierent behavioral patterns over time, in violation of the requirement

of parallel pre-trends across the two groups.

     In this paper, we study how spousal labor supply responds to fatal and severe non-fatal health

shocks by leveraging long panels of administrative data on families' health and labor market out-

comes. The datawhich encompass the entire Danish population from the years 1980-2011provide

register-based information on health-care utilization, income, wealth, and labor market behavior.


    1 For example, in 2014 the United States government paid 93 billion dollars to more than 4 million surviving spouses and 132
billion dollars to 9 million disabled workers through the Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance program. By comparison,
46 billion dollars were paid in unemployment benets, and the outlays within the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program,
the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and the Earned
Income Tax Credit (EITC) scheme were 51, 20, 76, and 60 billion dollars, respectively (SSA 2015; White House 2015).
     2 See, for example, Goldschmidt and Schmieder (2017) who study the eects of job outsourcing on wages, and J√§ger (2016)
who studies the substitutability of workers by analyzing the impact of worker exits due to unexpected deaths.




                                                               1
This combination of large-scale objective health and labor market information and the ability to

link across spouses provides us with a particularly well-suited setting for studying household labor

supply responses in the context of developed economies.                     Starting from the universe of married

and cohabiting couples, we study over 500,000 households in which one spouse experienced a fatal

health shock (including a sub-sample of fatal heart attacks and strokes), and over 70,000 households

in which one spouse experienced a non-fatal heart attack or stroke.

    To identify the causal eects of experiencing these adverse shocks, we employ a quasi-experimental

research design that constructs counterfactuals to aected households by using households that ex-

perience the same shock but a few years in the future. We combine event studies for these two groups

and estimate the short- and medium-run treatment eects using a straightforward dynamic (i.e.,

period-by-period) dierence-in-dierences estimator.                 Our identifying assumption is that, absent

the realization of the shock, the outcomes of the treatment and control groups would run parallel.

Among many other dimensions, this would ensure the similarity of the groups in terms of their

expectations. Reassuringly, we demonstrate that the pre-trends run parallel for all of the outcomes

we study. Of course, this approach has its own limitations; mainly, it places an upper bound on the

analysis' time horizon since the control group becomes treated within a few years. The estimation

strategy we use, that aims to estimate ex-post responses to realizations of shocks (rather than in

anticipation of them), relies on the common notion that the timing of the shocks within a short

period of time may be as good as random, which has been exploited for identication in a variety of

settings. As such, our use of one-dimensional matching on timing to construct counterfactuals may
                                                                                                                            3
also be useful for analyzing other economic events whose particular timing is likely unpredictable.

    With these data and design, we provide visually-clear estimates of individuals' labor supply

responses to spousal mortality and health shocks, and we additionally exploit the richness of the data

to analyze the potential mechanisms that may underlie these responses. Overall, we nd signicant

and persistent increases in spousal labor supply when income losses are large and households lack

adequate formal insurance.           While a variety of potential forces may be at play in the dierent

shocks that we consider, the ndings are all consistent with family labor supply as a self-insurance

mechanism.

    We begin with the focus of our study, the extreme shock of the death of a spouse, which can

lead to signicant and permanent income losses. We nd immediate increases in survivors' labor

supply following their spouse's death, which persist through the duration of our time frame. By the

fourth year after the shock, these responses amount to average increases of 7.6% in survivors' labor

force participation and 6.8% in annual labor income.

    The average eects that we nd are entirely driven by households that experience substantial


   3 We know of several concurrent studies in dierent settings that have found it useful in practice. These studies follow an
earlier version of this paper (which has been previously circulated as NBER Working Paper No. 21352) and include applications
such as analyzing the eects of inheritance on wealth accumulation and inequality (Nekoei and Seim 2017; Martinello 2017),
studying the eects of Social Security eld oce closings (Deshpande and Li 2017), and our own work on family spillovers in
health behaviors (Fadlon and Nielsen 2017).

income shocks due to the death of a spouse, and may therefore have greater need for self-insurance

through labor supply. In particular, we use dierent strategies and sources of heterogeneity to show

that the mean increase in labor supply is fully attributable to survivors whose deceased spouses

had earned a large share of the household's income, who have less disposable income at the time

of the shock, and who are less formally insured by government transfers. Notably, widowers, who

tend to be primary earners and need to nancially support one fewer person when losing their

wives, if anything decrease their labor supply; while widows, who tend to experience considerably

larger income losses when losing their husbands, signicantly increase their labor supply. By the

fourth year after their husbands die, widows increase their participation by 11.3%, which translates

to a 10.1% increase in their annual earnings.        Importantly, though the exposure to risk is highly

correlated with gender, female and male survivors exhibit similar sensitivity to comparable changes

in household income. Further bolstering the plausibility of the self-insurance mechanism, we provide

evidence that a fall in the cost of supplying labor following the death of a spouse does not appear

to be an operative alternative explanation for the average responses we document.

   In contrast to mortality shocks, non-fatal health shocks are well-insured in our setting through

social and private insurance.     Studying households in which one member has experienced a non-

fatal heart attack or stroke, we rst show that the earnings of the sick individuals drop by 19%

after the shock, comparable to the ndings of Meyer and Mok (2013) and Dobkin, Finkelstein,

Kluender, and Notowidigdo (2017) in the US case. However, we then show that the average decline

in these households' post-transfer income is only 3.3%.         Consistent with this lack of a signicant

average income drop, which suggests there is no substantial need for self-insurance on average,

there are no notable changes in spouses' labor supply. Yet while the average decline in household

income is negligible, there is still cross-household variation in income replacement rates, and we nd

substantial heterogeneity in spousal labor supply responses as a function of this variation. Though

fatal and non-fatal shocks dier in many aspects (such as in their impact on the composition of the

household), our results suggest that self-insurance is a key motive for spousal labor supply responses

to the nancial aspects of both types of shocks.

   As we described so far, our ndings on family labor supply responses to adverse health shocks

have direct implications for positive models of household self-insurance behavior over the life cycle.

To additionally oer a normative interpretation of our results, we conclude with a brief discussion of

their   qualitative welfare implications.   To do so, we adopt a stylized version of the model from Fadlon

and Nielsen (2016), which illustrates that the extent to which households self-insure against     realized
income losses using spousal labor supply is directly related to the degree to which they lack formal

insurance and would gain from more generous government benets. Exploiting this logic, we argue

that it may be welfare improving to let survivors benets depend on age, since the relative increase

in survivors' labor supply is substantially larger for older widows whose lower labor force attachment

makes them more nancially vulnerable. Also, since survivors' labor supply is strongly increasing in

the share of the household's income that the deceased had earned, there is an argument for survivors

benets to depend on the deceased spouse's work history. This is consistent with Persson (2015)



                                                       3
who nds higher valuation of survivors insurance by spouses with divergent levels of earned income,

as manifested by their higher marriage rates when the marriage contract includes such a scheme.

Additionally, as our ndings indicate a similar pattern of heterogeneity in responses to non-fatal

spousal health shocks, disability benets may also be more eciently distributed if made dependent

on the disabled spouse's work history. Evidently, all of these features characterize the current large

survivors and disability insurance schemes within the Social Security system in the US.

    This paper relates to two main strands of the literature. First, signicant research studies the

eects of adverse health. The majority of this work focuses on the impacts on                            own    labor market

outcomes and includes studies that use survey data (such as Gertler and Gruber 2002, Charles

2003, Gallipoli and Turner 2011, Chung 2013, Meyer and Mok 2013, and Dobkin et al. 2017) as

well as larger-scale studies in countries where administrative data that link health and own labor

market outcomes are available (such as Lundborg et al. 2011, Halla and Zweim√ºller 2013, Pohl

et al. 2013, and Gupta et al. 2015). However, despite the premise that households operate as tight

economic units, there is much less (and mixed) direct evidence regarding the eects of non-fatal

health shocks on      family   labor supply; and, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no work in

the last few decades on the impacts of fatal shocks. The existing household-level studies on non-fatal

shocks, which have generally utilized event-study type analyses and comparisons using unaected
                                                           4
households, have commonly used survey data;                    and by comparison, we know of very little work that,
                                                                                                                            5
similar to ours, uses rich administrative data and timing of objectively-identied health events.

    The combination of the data and research design that we use allows us to contribute to this

literature by oering estimates for household labor supply responses to both fatal and non-fatal

health shocks in the short- and medium-run.                     As the dataset includes comprehensive records of

the dierent components of household income and wealth, it also lets us observe households' overall

degree of formal insurance and income loss and analyze a variety of behavioral margins. This distinct

aspect of the data provides us with the opportunity to additionally study the potential mechanisms

that may underlie the labor supply responses to spousal shocks that we nd.

    Our paper also contributes to the numerous past empirical studies that have analyzed spousal

labor supply responses to individuals' wage and unemployment shocks (what is known as the added

worker eect).       While spousal labor supply has been commonly modeled as an important self-

insurance mechanism (e.g., Ashenfelter 1980; Heckman and Macurdy 1980; Lundberg 1985), this

prior empirical work has been largely unable to nd evidence of signicant responses to                             temporary
   4 Recent related studies are Charles (1999), Jim√©nez-Martn et al. (1999), Johnson and Favreault (2001), Gertler and Gruber
(2002), Coile (2004), Siegel (2006), Coe and Van Houtven (2010), Gallipoli and Turner (2011), Hollenbeak et al. (2011), Meyer
and Mok (2013), Braakmann (2014), and Dobkin et al. (2017). Older studies include Parsons (1977), Berger (1983), Berger
and Fleisher (1984), and Haurin (1989). To the best of our knowledge, only Berger (1983) and Haurin (1989) consider the case
of spousal death.
    5 Indeed, we have been able to identify only two such papers, which rely on comparisons of aected households and observably-
similar unaected households over time. Gar¬¢a-G√≥mez et al. (2013) study acute hospitalizations in the Netherlands, and in
a concurrent paper Jeon and Pohl (2017) study cancer diagnoses in Canada. In related work using Swedish data, Nahum
(2007) studies responses to spousal sickness absence from work as the identied shock, where the reference group is unaected
individuals with no sickness absence or those with short absence periods.



                                                                4
                              6
spousal unemployment.             A leading explanation for this lack of evidence has been that, in the context

of temporary unemployment, income losses are small relative to the household's life-time income

and are already suciently insured through formal social insurance (Heckman and Macurdy 1980;

Cullen and Gruber 2000). Consistent with this explanation, Stephens (2002), Autor et al. (2015),

and Blundell et al. (2016) nd that spousal labor supply is an important consumption insurance

device against signicant and permanent income losses (due to job displacements, wage shocks, or

disability insurance denials). Our ndings of no spousal responses to well-insured non-fatal shocks

are consistent with previous studies, and we provide new evidence on the important role of spousal

labor supply in osetting permanent household income losses in the context of fatal shocks.

     The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. We proceed with Section 2 that sets the

conceptual framework for the empirical analysis by theoretically illustrating with a stylized model

the self-insurance role of spousal labor supply.                 Then, prior to our empirical analysis, Section 3

outlines the institutional environment in Denmark and the data sources. In Section 4 we describe

the empirical research design that we use for recovering the causal eects of adverse shocks. Our

core empirical analysis is presented in Section 5.                  In this section we estimate individuals' labor

supply responses to fatal and non-fatal spousal health shocks and analyze the heterogeneity in these

responses to study their underlying mechanisms. In Section 6, we use the framework from Section

2 to briey discuss the qualitative welfare implications of our ndings. Section 7 concludes.



2     A Stylized Framework of Family Labor Supply
     To set the conceptual framework for our empirical analysis and to later describe its potential

normative implications, we start by analyzing a static model of household labor supply decisions.

The purpose of this section is to formalize how spousal labor supply can be used as insurance against

income shocks to the household. Intuitively, when individuals experience severe health shocks that

cause them to decrease their labor supply and earn less incomeor when they dietheir spouses
                                                                                                            7
can compensate for the imposed income loss by increasing their own labor supply.                                We show that

the relative increase in spousal labor supply in response to shocks grows with the income loss, so

this increase can reveal the extent to which the household needs to self-insure. While our empirical

analysis includes both extensive and intensive margin labor supply responses, the stylized model of

this section focuses on the intensive margin. As the goal of the model is merely to provide a simple
                                                                                                                                8
conceptual economic framework, this modeling choice is motivated by simplicity and transparency.


    6 See, for example, Heckman and Macurdy (1980, 1982), Lundberg (1985), Maloney (1987, 1991), Gruber and Cullen (1996),
and Spletzer (1997).
    7 Of course, there are important non-nancial linkages across spouses which we abstract from here since we want to highlight
the nancial channels that link household members. We return to mechanisms other than income loss that can drive spousal
labor supply in response to shocks later in our empirical analysis.
    8 Specically, the model belowincluding the setup and preference specicationprovides the simplest possible framework
to demonstrate the insurance role of spousal labor supply. It also provides a simple and intuitive formula that translates house-
hold labor supply responses to implications for the design of social insurance. In Fadlon and Nielsen (2016) we additionally study
the participation decision counterpart of this section's model, and extensively analyze and discuss important generalizations to


                                                                5
      Setup .         We study labor supply decisions of a two-person household, which consists of individuals

1   and      2.    We consider a world with two states of nature: a good state, state                                           g,   in which member

1   works; and a bad state, state                          b,     in which member             1   experiences a shocke.g., a severe health

shockand drops out of the labor force. We employ this extreme assumption regarding member

1's   labor supply for simplication, but any shock that leads to some degree of exogenous decline in

this member's labor earnings or income from other sources can be readily analyzed within the same

framework. Households spend a share of                                     ¬µg   of their adult life in state            g    and a share of       ¬µb    in state

b   (with ¬µ
            g        +   ¬µb   = 1).     In what follows, the subscript                      i ‚àà {1, 2}        refers to the household member and

labor incomeincluding transfers from any source of individually-purchased or employer-provided

private insurance, out-of-pocket expenses (such as medical bills), and potentially transfers from

pension schemes and retirement accounts and from relatives (in the simple case when those are not

endogenous to spousal labor supply). We denote by                                          zÃÑis (lis ) i's   net-of-tax labor income in state                s,   so

These are not means-tested in the simple framework of this section, but the model can accommodate

means-testing with some additional complexity. With this notation, the household's overall income

      Preferences.             Let   U s (cs1 , cs2 ; l1s , l2s )   represent the household's utility as a function of consumption

and labor supply of each member in each state. For simplicity, we assume that                                                          U s (cs1 , cs2 ; l1s , l2s ) =
us1 (cs1 )‚àív1s (l1s )+us2 (cs2 )‚àív2s (l2s ), where in each state usi (csi ) is member i's utility from consumption and
vis (lis )   represents member                i's   disutility from labor (including the utility loss from direct work costs

and the opportunity costs of lost home production). We employ the normalization                                                     us1 (0) = v1s (0) = 0.
This lets the model incorporate the case in which the bad state is a                                                    fatal   health shock (in which

cb1 = l1b = 0), so that the household's preferences reduce to the utility from member 2's allocation:
us2 (cs2 ) ‚àí v2s (l2s ). Additionally, we assume that the consumption utility and the labor disutility

      Household Behavior.                    In our illustrative static model of this section, the household consumes its

entire disposable income in each state of nature. Hence, the household's choices reduce to the labor

supply and consumption allocation decisions.                                          Formally, in each state            s   the household solves the

problem:

                                                       max U s (cs1 , cs2 ; l1s , l2s )    s.t. c1

                                                                                                        + cs2 = y s .

encompass savings, life-insurance purchases, and informal insurance arrangements), alternative assumptions about the house-

well as the presence of household public goods and economies of scale in the household's consumption technology.

experience fatal or non-fatal health events that lead to shocks to the household's income (from

foregone earnings or declines in other sources of income), their spouses can compensate for the

associated income loss by increasing their own labor supply. Since the relative increase in spousal

labor supply in response to shocks grows with the income loss, it can reveal the extent to which

the household lacks formal insurance and needs to self-insure. With this simple comparative statics

result at hand, which theoretically illustrates the insurance role of spousal labor supply in response

to household shocks, we now turn to the empirical analysis of the impact of fatal and non-fatal

spousal health shocks on individuals' labor supply.



3       Institutional Background and Data
      To study labor supply responses to severe spousal health shocks we leverage rich administrative

full-population data from Denmark. Compared to other countries, the Danish setting is unique in

providing large-scale register-based data on both health and labor market outcomes, combined with

spousal linkages. As such, it is a well-suited setting for the purpose of our study. In this section, we

describe the Danish insurance environment (both social and private) as it relates to sick individuals

and surviving spouses, and we list our data sources.


3.1       Institutional Setting

      It is useful to distinguish between two types of insurance: health insurance (coverage of medical

care) and income insurance (coverage of income losses in dierent health states). Health insurance

in Denmark is a universal scheme in which almost all costs are covered by the government, with a

few exceptions (such as dental care, chiropractic treatments, and prescription drugs) that entail a

limited degree of out-of-pocket expenses. Therefore, the Danish setting allows us to concentrate on

(social and private) income insurance for losses that go beyond immediate medical expenses.



                                                                     7
    In Denmark, income insurance against severe health shocks and the death of a spouse consists of

three main components that are generally typical of systems in developed countries: permanent So-

cial Disability Insurance, privately-purchased insurance policies, and other indirect social insurance

programs (such as early retirement and old-age pensions). In the rest of this section, we provide

an overall description of the features and benet levels for each of these components (which we also

summarize in Appendix Table 7 for convenience). Later, within our empirical analysis, we exploit

the data to show how the income streams provided to households from dierent sources (and their

combination) behave in practice in our analysis sample.

    Individuals who experience a shock that leads to a substantial reduction in their ability to

work (of at least 50% as determined by the assigned evaluator) can apply at the municipality level

for Social Disability Insurance (Social DI) benets. An approved application will provide benets

permanently, which in 2000, for example, amounted to DKK 72,100 ($9,000) per year for married or

cohabiting individuals and DKK 98,700 ($12,300) for single individuals (with potential supplements

that depend on factors such as disability severity).

    The basic eligibility criterion for this program is a prolonged need for support that is presumed

to last until the transition into the old-age pension. Importantly for our analysis, since 1984 the

Danish Social DI has a broad social insurance scope.                   That is, it can be awarded to individuals

who prove that they are unable to engage in substantial gainful activity either for medical or for
                                                        9
non-medical (vaguely dened) social reasons.                As an example for such non-medical reasons, Social

DI benets could be awarded to survivors who are out of the labor force and, upon their spouse's

death, are deemed unt for employment or training programs, e.g., due to their age (for additional

details see Haanes-Olsen 1987 and Bingley et al. 2011).                    Note that within the context of social

reasons, individuals will be automatically considered ineligible if their annual earnings in the years

just before their application exceeded a certain threshold (which in 2000 was DKK 148,000 for

married applicants and DKK 98,700 for singles). As there is no explicit survivors insurance program

in Denmark, Social DI eectively acts as the relevant social insurance program that may support

surviving spouses who, at the end of the cumbersome application process (which can take anywhere

between 1 and 14 months), are determined unable to maintain their standard of living on their own.

Indeed, we nd (and document later in the paper) signicant increases in the receipt rate of Social

DI by survivors in the year their spouses die (which are predominantly driven by female survivors

who did not work prior to the shock).              Correspondingly, we henceforth refer to Social DI in the

context of spousal mortality shocks as social survivors benets.

    While Social DI and its survivors benets component are state-wide schemes, they are locally

administered. Regional councils (in a total of 15 regions) decide whether to approve or reject an

individual's application, and municipal caseworkers (in a total of 270 municipalities) administer

the application and handle all aspects of each case. These include any contact with the applicant,


   9 In 1984 the notion of social reasons came to replace a complex mix of programs, such as survivors benets for women and
special old-age pensions for single women (where the motive behind this rule change was that the pre-1984 rules discriminated
between genders).



                                                             8
the preparation of the application, and the collection of nancial and health status records. The

local administration of the program, combined with the vague notion of awarding benets for social

reasons, has led to dierential application processing behavior across municipalities. In turn, it has

resulted in substantial variation in rejection ratesranging from 7% to 30%and thus in the mean

receipts of the program's benets across the dierent municipalities over time (Bengtsson 2002).

We exploit this municipality-by-year variation in the awarding of the survivors benets component

of the program later in the paper. Specically, we test the hypothesis that the generosity of this

alternative insurance mechanism against fatal spousal shocks substitutes for self-insurance through

labor supply.

    Another source of income to households that experience health shocks or in which a member

dies is payments from employer-based insurance policies, which have recently become standard in

labor-market pension plans.           Since 1993, most sectors covered by collective agreements (75% of

the labor force) have introduced mandatory pension plans, which may include components of life

insurance or insurance against specic health events. These schemes pay out a lump-sum to sick

workers, as long as they make contributions to the pension plan, or to the surviving spouse in

case the plan member dies, at rates that are set by the individual pension funds. In addition to

employer-sponsored private insurance, and subject to health screenings, individuals may purchase

similar insurance policies in the private non-group market. In our sample period, which spans 1980-

2011 and in which the average year of spousal death is around 1995, the life-insurance coverage rate

is generally low, since life-insurance holdings experienced signicant increases only more recently

with the gradual expansion of labor market pension schemes. As payouts from these private (group

or non-group) insurance policies are observable in our data as part of households' liquid wealth, we

later gauge the eective coverage rate within our sample by providing an analysis of actual changes

in household liquid wealth balances around spousal death (both in terms of wealth levels and in

terms of the fraction of households for whom shocks lead to wealth increases).

    Note that despite the private market for life insurance in Denmark, there is still an important

rationale for government intervention in the context of mortality shocks since unhealthy and older

Danish households are largely uncovered through the private market.                          First, with health screen-

ings required for purchasing life-insurance products in the Danish non-group market (which include

answering health status and behaviors questionnaires and even undergoing medical exams), appli-
                                                                                     10
cations by unhealthy or older households are occasionally rejected.                       Second, it is common in both

group and non-group markets that even when life-insurance products are purchased by younger

and healthy households, the coverage sharply declines with age (see a concrete example of such a

group-market policy in Appendix Table 7).                 The combination of these features of the private in-

surance market and the lack of a universal-coverage social survivors insurance scheme leaves older

Danish surviving spouses more vulnerable to the nancial shocks imposed by spousal death. In our


  10 These rejections by insurance companies can be explained by private information that is held by rejected households, which
provides a leading rationale for government intervention in our setting (Hendren 2013). Hendren (2013) also provides relevant
evidence in the context of life insurance markets in the US.



                                                              9
setting, while survivors in older households experience smaller losses through foregone labor income

(as their deceased spouses' earnings were lower), they are still exposed to substantial nancial losses

through the deceased spouses' non-labor income (including employer-based pension payments and

benets from government programs). This point will become relevant when we discuss the welfare

implications of our ndings in Section 6.

      Lastly, there are old-age social insurance programs that can indirectly protect eligible survivors

or households that experience other shocks, who can decide to take them up at dierent stages

(within the range of eligible ages) according to their nancial needs.                      At age 60 and until they

reach their old-age pension retirement age, individuals who have (voluntarily) been members of

an unemployment fund for a suciently long period (of 10 years before 1992 which has gradually

increased to 20 years thereafter) are eligible for the Voluntary Early Retirement Pension (VERP).

Approximately 80% of the population is eligible for VERP, which provides a at-rate annual income

that amounted to roughly DKK 135,000 ($16,875) in 2000. At the full-retirement age of 67 (or 65 for

those born after July 1st, 1939) all residents become eligible for the Old-Age Pension (OAP), which

provides annuities that in 2000 amounted to DKK 72,100 ($9,000) for married individuals and DKK

98,700 ($12,300) for single individuals (similar to the benet levels paid to Social DI beneciaries).

Note that DI and OAP are dierent components of the same social insurance program of Social

Pensions, similar to Social Security in the US, and that Social DI recipients automatically transition

into the Old-Age Pension program at their full-retirement age. Benets through both Social DI and

OAP are income-tested, with income thresholds and benet reduction rates as depicted in Appendix
           11
Figure 9.


3.2     Data Sources

      We have merged several Danish registers that include individual-level records with household

linkages that allow us to match spouses and cohabiting partners from 1980 to 2011. Doing so, our

analysis uses long panels of detailed administrative datasets for the universe of Danish households

with a wide range of objective measures of families' health and economic outcomes.

      Health Data.    To identify fatal and severe non-fatal health shocks we use two complementary

datasets. Our rst dataset is theCause of Death Registry , which includes death dates and causes.
Our second dataset is the National Patient Registry , which covers all hospitalization records (from

both private and public hospitals) with exact timing and detailed diagnoses (using the International

Statistical Classication of Diseases and Related Health Problems [ICD] system). The health shocks

that we focus on are heart attacks and strokes, which are commonly-studied pervasive health events

that are both sudden and severe (Chandra and Staiger 2007; Doyle 2011).

      Economic Data .     The economic data that we use cover years 1980-2011 and include comprehen-

sive information on all sources of family income: earnings, government transfers from any program


  11 An additional small government-mandated pension scheme (for all wage earners in Denmark) that supplements the OAP
and includes a limited amount of a one-time transfer to survivors is the ATP program. As this program represents a very small
fraction of government transfers to older households and surviving spouses, we postpone its description to Appendix Table 7.



                                                            10
(including old-age pensions, disability insurance, welfare benets, housing assistance, and unemploy-

ment benets), payouts from retirement savings accounts, annuity payouts from insurance compa-

nies, and capital income. Importantly, we also observe third-party reported liquid wealth balances

(measured annually on December 31st) from 1984-2011. Among other measures, these include bank-

account balances and lump-sum transfers from insurance companies. In our main analysis sample of

spousal mortality shocks, the baseline net asset   stock of the median household amounts to only DKK
11,179 or $1,397 (with a     single increase of $2,152 following the event) while the baseline median
household-level income     ow is DKK 253,843 or $31,730 annually (with an approximate decline of
$10,739   each year   after the event). Also, as we show later in the paper, any increase in net wealth

around spousal death (through insurance payouts, etc) is attributable to only a very small share of

households, as merely 5% of the aected households in our sample experience some growth in net

wealth caused by the shock (as compared to the counterfactual). Therefore, our analysis of labor

supply responses and their heterogeneity focuses on income losses.         However, we use the wealth

data in our robustness checks to account for life insurance payments and other potential changes in

household wealth.

      Our nal dataset is the   Integrated Database for Labor Market Research ,    which includes demo-

graphic variables for the entire population as well as administrative measures for full-time and

part-time employment for individuals younger than 60. These full-time and part-time employment

measures are constructed using records of employees' payments to the government-mandated ATP

pension scheme.       The mandatory level of payments into this program is a one-to-one function of

employment status, where full-time employment is dened as working at least 30 hours per week

all 12 months of the calendar year (full-time full-year), and part-time employment is dened as

working at some point during the year but either fewer than 30 hours per week or fewer than 12

months within the calendar year.

We describe our analysis sample and its summary statistics at the end of the next section after we

present the research design and explain how we construct the treatment and control groups.



4      Research Design
      The goal of our empirical analysis is to identify the dynamic causal eects of fatal and severe non-

fatal spousal health shocks on individuals' labor supply. In this section we describe the empirical

strategy that we use to overcome the selection challenges inherent in the identication of these

eects.    We then describe our analysis sample of treatment and control groups and report their

summary statistics.


4.1     Quasi-Experiment

      The ideal experiment for identifying the short- and medium-run eects of spousal shocks would

randomly assign shocks to households and track labor supply responses over time. Therefore, we




                                                    11
need to compare the ex-post responses to shocks of aected households to a counterfactual behavior

of (hypothetical) ex-ante similar unaected households. This requires comparing households with

the same expectations over the distribution of future paths, but with dierent realizations, to isolate

the unanticipated component of the shock. The access to three decades of administrative panel data

on the universe of Danish households allows us to employ a quasi-experimental research design that

mimics this ideal experiment, by exploiting the potential randomness of the timing of a severe (fatal

or non-fatal) health shock within a short period of time.

    To do so, we look only at households that have experienced the shocks that we consider at

some point in our sample period, and identify the treatment eect from the timing at which the

shock was realized. Specically, we construct counterfactuals to aected households using house-

holds from the same cohorts that experience the same shock but a few years in the future. Then,

we recover the treatment eect by performing traditional event studies for these two experimental

groups and combining them into a straightforward dynamic dierence-in-dierences estimator. Be-

fore formally describing the research design, we illustrate with a concrete example its basic intuition

of the similarity of households that experience shocks close in time.

    Illustrative Example.        Let us focus on a specic treatment group of married and cohabiting

individuals born between 1930 and 1950 who experienced a severe health shock, in particular, a

heart attack or a stroke, in 1995.            Consider studying the eect of the shock on some economic
                                                                                  12
outcome of these individuals, e.g., their labor force participation.

    In Panel A of Figure 1 we plot the outcome for this treatment group over time, and compare it

to the time trend of the outcome for married and cohabiting individuals from the same cohorts who

have not experienced this shock in our sample period. Inspection of this gure reveals considerably

dierent behavioral patterns and visible non-parallel trends prior to 1995 across the two groups.

The groups' divergent pre-trends persist even after we control exibly for key variables, specically,

age, gender, and education (see Appendix Table 8). This motivates the consideration of alternative

households, other than those who do not experience shocks, as potential control groups for the

construction of the treatment group's counterfactual behavior in the absence of the shock.

    We therefore proceed by looking only at aected households. Specically, Panel B of Figure 1

plots the outcome for the treatment group of households that experienced a shock in 1995 as well

as for households that experienced the same shock in 2010 (15 years later), in 2005 (10 years later),

in 2000 (5 years later), and in 1996 (1 year later). Notably, studying the behavior of households

that experienced the shock in dierent years reveals increasingly comparable patterns to those of

the treatment group's behaviorin terms of trends before 1995the closer the year in which the

individual experienced the shock was to 1995. These patterns conrm the intuition of comparability

of households that experience shocks closer in time, and suggest using households that experienced

a shock in 1995+4 as a control group for households that experienced a shock in 1995. Panel D of

Figure 1 displays a potential control group when we choose                  4 = 5.

  12 Illustrative examples that use other key household outcomes are available from the authors on request.




                                                             12
    Our estimation strategy generalizes this example by aggregating dierent calendar years. Simply

put, the design conducts event studies for two experimental groups: a treatment group composed of

households that experience a shock in year               œÑ,   and a matched control group composed of households

from the    same cohorts that experience the same shock but in year œÑ + 4.                      We identify the treatment

eect purely from the change in the dierences in outcomes (i.e., the dierence-in-dierences) across

the two groups over time. By construction, the research design matches households (only) on the

year the shock occurred, so it mechanically nets out calendar year eects.                             However, on top of

that and    without    directly matching households on any other dimension, the design constructs in

our setting experimental groups that are also very similar in the key dimension of age (as we show

below). Doing so, it eectively nets out life-cycle eects, which are a main identication concern in

the context of family labor supply.

    The trade-o in the choice of           4,   which captures the main limitation of the design, can be seen

in Panel C of Figure 1. On the one hand, we would want to choose a smaller                         4 such that the control
group is more closely comparable to the treatment group, e.g., those who experienced the shock in

1996 which corresponds to           4 = 1.   On the other hand, we would want to choose a larger                    4   in order

to be able to identify longer-run eects of the shock, since for each chosen                    4 the estimation strategy
provides estimates for up to period              4 ‚àí 1.   For example, using those who experienced a shock in

2005 (4     = 10)    will allow us to estimate the eect of the shock for up to 9 years. However, this

entails a potentially larger bias since the pre-trend in the behavior of this group is not as tightly

parallel to that of the treatment group. Our choice of                       4   is ve years, such that we can identify

eects up to four years after the shock. We assessed the robustness of our analysis to this choice
                                                                                          13
and found that local perturbations to             4   provide very similar results.

    Formal Description of the Design and Estimator.                    Similar to common practice (for example, in

the use of matching estimators; see, e.g., Imbens and Wooldridge 2009), our estimation procedure

can be broken down into two steps. The rst step constructs our treatment and control groups and,

in the second step, estimation and inference are conducted using traditional methods. We describe

the two steps successively.

    Fix a group of cohorts, denoted by              ‚Ñ¶,   and consider estimating the treatment eect of a shock

experienced at some point in the time interval                [œÑ1 , œÑ2 ] by individuals who belong to group ‚Ñ¶ .         We refer

to these individuals' households as the treatment group and divide them into sub-groups indexed by

the year in which the shock was experienced,               œÑ ‚àà [œÑ1 , œÑ2 ].   We normalize the time of observation such

that the time period,        t,   is measured with respect to the year of the shockthat is,                    t = year ‚àí œÑ ,
where   year   is the calendar year of the observation. As a control group, we match to each treated

group   œÑ   the households of individuals from the same cohort group                       ‚Ñ¶   who experienced the same


  13 In some applications (e.g., with smaller samples or shorter panels), the researcher may wish to include in the control group
households that experienced the same shocks less than 4 periods apart for improved eciency. That is, for identifying the
3-year eect one can include both households that experience the shock 5 years later and 4 years later, for identifying the 2-year
eect one can include households that experienced the shock 5, 4, and 3 years later, and so on. However, in our application,
which has a large number of households, this is not needed (nor does it alter the results), and using a single 4 has the advantage
of providing a transparent analysis of treatment and control groups that are both fully balanced for the entire analysis window.


                                                                 13
shock but at       œÑ + 4,   for a given choice of         4.   For these households we assign a placebo shock at

t=0        by normalizing time in the same way as we do for the treatment group, i.e.,                             t = year ‚àí œÑ
                                                                                    14
(where, by construction, their actual shock occurs at                     t = 4).
       Denote the mean outcome of the treatment group at time                            t   by   ytT   and the mean outcome of

the control group at time         t       C
                                      by yt , and choose a baseline period prior to the shock which we denote

by    p   (for prior). For any period          n > 0,   the treatment eect            Œ≥n   can be simply recovered by the

dierence-in-dierences estimator


                                                Œ≥n ‚â° ynT ‚àí ynC ‚àí ypT ‚àí ypC .
                                                                         
                                                                                                                                (2)

The treatment eect in period              n   is measured by the dierence in outcomes between the treatment

group and control group at time             n,   purged of the dierence in their outcomes at the baseline period

p.    Note that the choice of         4   puts an upper bound on           n   such that      n<4        (since the control group

becomes treated at         t = 4).
       The identifying assumption is that, absent the realization of the shock, the outcomes of the

treatment and control groups would run parallel. The plausibility of this assumption relies on the

notion that within the short window of time of length                 4 the particular year at which the shock occurs
may be as good as random. Similar timing-based variation has been exploited for identication in
                                                                            15
numerous previous papers within a variety of settings.                           To test the validity of our assumption,

we accompany our empirical analysis with the treatment and control groups' behavior in the ve

years prior to the shock year 0 in order to assess their co-movement in the pre-shock period. We

consistently show throughout the analysis that there are virtually no dierential changes in the

trends of the treatment and control groups before period 0. This validates the design and alleviates

concerns that the groups may dier by, for example, their expectations over the                                particular   year of
                                                                     16
the shock within our chosen ve-year window of                   4.
       It is worth noting that the research design does               not      preclude behavioral adjustments in expec-

tation of a shock among treated households; nor do our results imply there are no such adjustments


     14 The same household can appear both in the treatment group and in the control group, but is never used as a control to
itself. For example, if treated households that experienced a shock in 1990 (who are matched with households that experienced
a shock in 1995 as controls) are included also in the control group, it is only since households that experience a shock in 1985
are included in the treatment group as well. We repeated our main analysis using treatment and control groups that do not
overlap, either by including in the treatment group (and matching them with the corresponding control group) households that
experience shocks in every other year, or by randomizing overlapping households to only one experimental group. The results
remain similar (both qualitatively and quantitatively) and are available from the authors on request.
   15 Among many others, these include Ruhm (1991), Grogger (1995), Hilger (2016), and Persson and Rossin-Slater (2016) in
the context of household shocks, and papers such as Guryan (2004) and Bailey and Goodman-Bacon (2015) in the context of
program rollout.
   16 Conceptually, as long as there is no perfect foresight we can use the design with an appropriate choice of 4. This choice
is context dependent and requires empirical investigation, where any potential dierence across the experimental groups would
be included in the bias consideration in the choice of 4. Comparability is then an empirical question that can be investigated
in several ways, such as: (1) analyzing sub-samples of shocks that are more likely to come as a surprise; (2) studying the
robustness of the results to a rich set of controls; and the strategies that we mentioned above: (3) testing for parallel trends in
the pre-period; and (4) investigating the sensitivity of the results to the chosen control group by changing 4. We conduct this
set of tests in our application and verify the robustness of our results in support of our underlying identifying assumption. The
analysis of tests (1)-(3) appears in the paper, and the analysis of (4) is available from the authors on request.


                                                                14
in practice.     Indeed, the dierential pre-trends that we have seen across aected and unaected

households may be driven by exactly this type of anticipatory responses and these groups' diverging

expectations. However, since our empirical target is                 ex-post responses to the realization of the shock,
our aim has been to provide a control group with non-dierential expectations. Thus, the parallel

pre-trends across our constructed experimental groups do not mean that aected households do not

exhibit anticipatory eects. Rather, the non-dierential pre-trends signal that the research design

achieves its goal: conducting comparisons across closely similar treatment and control households

that hold comparable expectations.

      Estimating Equation for Average Eects .                 Much of our analysis graphically tracks the simple

dynamic dierence-in-dierences estimator of equation (2) to study the evolution of household re-

sponses.    To quantify the mean treatment eects, we estimate the regression counterpart of this

estimator, averaged over the years after the shock.                    These regressions are also useful for explic-

itly reporting statistical signicance (where we cluster the standard errors at the household by

experimental-group level) and for accounting for controls in robustness checks. Our baseline esti-

mating equation is of the known dierence-in-dierences form:

                                yi,t = Œ±i + Œ≤posti,t + Œ≥treati √ó posti,t + Œ¥Xi,t + Œµi,t .                                   (3)

In this regression,    yi,t   denotes an outcome for household            i   at time   t; treati   denotes an indicator for

whether a household belongs to the treatment group;                     posti,t   denotes an indicator for whether the

observation belongs to post-shock periods;              Xi,t   denotes a vector of potential (time-variant) controls;

and   Œ±i   is a household xed eect (which absorbs any time-invariant characteristic including the

main eect of     treati ).   The parameter       Œ≥   represents the average causal eect of spousal shocks on

household outcomes.


4.2     Analysis Sample and Summary Statistics

      Starting from the universe of married and cohabiting couples, our sample includes all households

that experience shocks from year 1985 to 2011 and in which both spouses were between ages 45 and

80 in the year of the (actual or placebo) shock. Our main sample is comprised of all households in

which one spouse experienced a fatal shock and includes 310,720 households in the treatment group

and 409,190 households in the control group. Our secondary sample of non-fatal severe health shocks

is comprised of all households in which one spouse experienced a heart attack or a stroke (for the
                                                                17
rst time) and survived for at least three years.                    These health shocks are commonly studied as

their timing within a short period of time is likely unpredictable (Chandra and Staiger 2007; Doyle

2011; WHO 2014). The average age of spouses precisely at the time of these cardiovascular health

shocks is just over 60 (60.67), and recall that most individuals become eligible for early retirement

benets when they turn 60.            Therefore, we focus in this second sample on households with both

spouses under 60 to ensure that the results we document are driven only by the health shocks


  17 Our choice of the number of years of survival was motivated by balancing between the sample size (that shrinks when we
condition on more years of survival) and the horizon of the analysis (that shrinks when we condition on less years of survival).
Perturbations to this number do not alter the qualitative results. This analysis is available from the authors on request.


                                                                15
                                                                       18
and not by eligibility for early retirement benets.                        The qualitative results and conclusions do

not change, however, when we look at the unconstrained sample. Our sample of non-fatal shocks

includes 37,437 households in the treatment group and 54,887 households in the control group. As

heart attacks and strokes are among the leading causes of death in the developed world (WHO

2014), fatal cardiovascular events provide us with a large sub-sample of deaths that likely come as

a surprise; which we additionally analyze in the estimation                       of   average household responses to fatal

shocks to validate that the estimation strategy isolates the ex-post responses to (unanticipated)

shock realizations.

      Panel A of Appendix Table 1 displays key summary statistics for the analysis samples and reveals

an advantage of the research design. Specically, the table shows the close comparability of the year

of observation and of the age of spouses across the treatment and control groups. In the baseline

period (chosen to be          t = ‚àí2),     the surviving spouse in the treatment group is observed on average

in year 1993 at age 62.86 and the spouse in the control group is observed on average in year 1993 at

age 62.27. The sub-sample of survivors under age 60, the age at which there is a large drop in labor

force participation (due to eligibility for early retirement benets as shown in Appendix Figure 1),

displays even closer similarities. Likewise, in the sample of non-fatal health shocks, at the baseline

period the spouse is on average 45.7 years old in the treatment group and 45.3 years old in the
                                                                                                         19
control group, where the mean calendar year is around 1992 for both groups.



5       Family Labor Supply Responses to Severe Health Shocks
      In this section, we present our primary analysis of the impact of fatal and severe non-fatal health

shocks on spousal labor supply. For extensive margin responses we analyze labor force participation,

dened as having any positive level of annual earnings; for intensive margin responses we analyze

annual earnings, and supplement the analysis with administrative measures for full-time and part-

time employment. We begin with the focus of our study, the extreme shock of spousal death, which

can lead to large and permanent income losses.                      We study the average labor supply responses of

surviving spouses, and then analyze the heterogeneity of these responses to uncover the mechanisms

through which they may operate. In particular, guided by the comparative statics in (1), we analyze

how survivors' behavior varies by the degree of income loss their spouse's death imposes and by the

extent of coverage through survivors benets, to investigate self-insurance as a mechanism for family

labor supply responses. We also analyze alternative potential mechanisms using a simple test that


    18 Eligibility for early retirement benets leads to a sharp decline in labor force participation at age 60 (see an illustration in
Appendix Figure 1). Since in the specic case of non-fatal shocks (within our setting and time frame) the average age at t = 0
is close to this age threshold, one might worry that in gures that depict raw means even very small age dierences across the
experimental groups may display small spurious responses to the shock. The purpose of our age restriction is to address such
concerns.
   19 We additionally report in Appendix Table 1 the means of main labor supply outcomes at the baseline for completeness.
Note that since comparability requires similar trends and not similar levels (like in any other dierence-in-dierences type
research design), the slightly higher levels of participation and earnings for the control group do not pose a direct threat to the
validity of the design.




                                                                  16
aims to assess the extent to which survivors' willingness to work may change in response to the shock.

Then, we study family labor supply responses to our second set of shocks, severe non-fatal health

shocks; specically, heart attacks and strokes.               We show that in our setting the resulting income

losses from the foregone earnings of the sick spouse are formally well-insured, primarily through

disability benets. Accordingly, in the context of non-fatal shocks, we do not expect spousal labor

supply responses from self-insurance motives on average.


5.1      Spousal Labor Supply Responses to Fatal Health Shocks

5.1.1      Mean Responses

      Panels A and B of Figure 2 plot the average labor supply responses of spouses in our overall

sample of fatal health shocks. The structure of these and subsequent gures is as follows. The x-axis

denotes time with respect to the shock, normalized to period 0. For the treatment group, period

0 is when the actual shock occurs; for the control group period 0 is when a placebo shock occurs

(while their actual shock occurs in period 5). The dashed gray line plots the behavior of the control

group. To ease the comparison of trends, from which the treatment eect is identied, we normalize

the level of the control group's outcome to the pre-shock level of the treatment group's outcome (in

period   t = ‚àí2).20     This normalized counterfactual is displayed by the blue line and squares. The

red line and circles plot the behavior of the treatment group.

      These panels rst provide a visual verication of parallel trends across the treatment and control

groups prior to period 0. Then, analyzing the eect of the shock, Panel A reveals an immediate

increase in labor force participation following the death of a spouse. By the fourth year after the

shock, the increase in the surviving spouses' participation amounts to 7.6%an increase of 1.6

percentage points (pp) on a base of 20.6 pp. Panel B of Figure 2 shows that this response translates

into a 6.8% increase in annual earnings (where we include zeros for those who do not work at

all).   Appendix Figure 2 repeats this analysis for a sub-sample of these survivors, whose spouses

experienced a heart attack or a stroke for the rst time and died within the same calendar year.

This allows us to focus on deaths whose particular timing is plausibly unexpected so that they are

more likely to come as a surprise, and for which we have a sucient number of observations. As

seen in the gure, the pre-trends, levels, pattern of response, and response magnitudes are all very

similar to those in the overall sample of fatal shocks; further validating that the estimation strategy
                                                                   21
isolates the ex-post responses to shock realizations.

      With signicant disparities in baseline participation rates and labor income, men and women

may face substantially dierent nancial distress when their spouse dies and, therefore, may respond

dierently to this shock. Indeed, Panels C and D of Figure 2 reveal clear dierences in the responses

of widowers (whose wife dies) and widows (whose husband dies).                         While on average widowers do


  20 We choose t = ‚àí2 as the baseline period in our gures to verify there are no dierential trend breaks just before the shock
(in t = ‚àí1) across the treatment and control groups. As will become visually clear in the gures, the results are very similar
when we use any of the pre-shock periods (‚àí5 to ‚àí1) as a baseline year.
   21 Similar results were found for the small sample of accident-related deaths (available on request).




                                                              17
not change their labor force participation when their wife dies (and, if anything, slightly decrease

their annual earnings), widows immediately and signicantly increase their labor supply following

the death of their husband. Four years after the shock, widows' labor force participation increases

by 2.2 pp from a baseline participation rate of 19.5 pp, which amounts to a considerable increase of

11.3% in their labor force participation with a corresponding rise of 10.1% in their annual earnings.

    This dierential response suggests that female survivors may have greater need to self-insure

through labor supply and that they may experience greater income losses when their spouse dies

as compared to their male counterparts. To test this conjecture, we plot the evolution of overall

household income (from any source) around the death of a spouse, including earnings, capital income,

annuity payouts, and benets from social programs. We begin by plotting the household's income

in the absence of behavioral responses on the part of survivors in order to capture the income loss

directly attributable to their spouse's death. To do so, we plot in Panel A of Figure 3 the household's
                                                                                                                          22
overall income, holding the surviving spouse's earnings and social benets at their pre-shock level.

    Before discussing this gure, it is useful to mention benchmarks for the changes that we observe

in household income in order to interpret their magnitude. Following a fatal health shock, the house-

hold's composition changes so that insuring the consumption of surviving spouses as singles does

not require the entire pre-shock level of household income. At the same time, potential economies of

scale within the household can make half of the household's income before the shock insucient for

survivors to maintain their pre-shock utility levels after the shock (see, e.g., Nelson 1988, Browning

et al. 2013). The share of the household's income that would keep individuals' consumption utility

at its pre-shock level is usually assumed to lie between 0.5 and 1 and is commonly referred to as the

adult equivalence scale. Some commonly used scales are the modied OECD equivalence scale of

0.67 and the square-root scale of 0.71. Hence, one would expect surviving spouses to broadly com-

pensate for income declines with respect to this general benchmark, such that decreases in household
                                                                                                             23
income on the order of 29-33 pp would not require self-insurance through labor supply.

    Panel A of Figure 3 shows that widowers, who do not change their labor force participation

on average, experience an overall decline of 32 pp in household income. However, as suggested by

their dierent labor supply responses, widows experience a signicant additional relative loss of 8 pp

compared to widowers, so that the decrease in household income is 25% larger for female survivors.

To study the actual (rather than the potential) change in household income, Panel B of Figure

3 takes into account the surviving spouses' labor supply responses and any change in the social

benets they may receive. The gure shows that widowers experience an actual decline of 31 pp

and that widows manage to decrease their additional potential lossthrough the increase in labor

supply and higher take-up of social insuranceto incur an actual decline of 35 pp. Overall, widows'


  22 Specically, we x the surviving spouse's labor income, Social Disability, and Social Security benets at their level in
t = ‚àí1.
   23 The relevant equivalence scales that we mention here as benchmarks for gauging magnitudes are for adults, because the
median age of the youngest child of our treated individuals born after 1930 (for whom we have data on children) is 30, with
only 10% having a youngest child under 18.

labor supply responses account for 22% of the 5 pp shrinkage (from 40 to 35 pp) in their potential
               24
income loss.        We return to additional male-female comparisons in Section 5.1.2, when we conduct

a within-gender analysis of sensitivity to household income loss that exibly accounts for a wide set

of observables.

    Younger Households.          The baseline labor supply behavior of individuals below and above age 60

substantially diers. At age 60 there is a sharp drop in participation when 80% of the labor force

becomes eligible for early retirement benets (see Appendix Figure 1). This implies that surviving

spouses under age 60 have a considerably stronger attachment to the labor force and hence notably

higher disposable income from own labor earnings.                      In turn, it raises the possibility that they

may be more nancially resilient when their spouse dies. Consistent with this view and with the

consequential notion that their need to self-insure through labor supply may be attenuated, Panels

A and B of Figure 4 reveal that working-age widows (under age 60) exhibit a much smaller relative

increase in labor supply compared to the universe of widows. Their shock elasticities amount to an

increase of only 3.3% in participation and 3.2% in annual earnings. Interestingly, widowers under 60

even respond with a decrease in their labor supply, which amounts to a 4.1% decline in their annual

earnings. The majority of these widowers (74%) were the primary earners in their households and,

compared to widows, they have signicantly higher baseline participation rates (0.78 compared to

0.715) and average labor income (DKK 227,560 compared to DKK 138,232). Therefore, in contrast

to widows, the behavior of working-age widowers is consistent with the idea that they no longer

support two people in the household and that, as singles, they may not require the entire amount of

their high labor income to meet their consumption needs. Put together, the labor supply behavior

of younger households suggests that higher participation rates and annual earnings may eectively

insure against the potential income losses imposed by fatal spousal shocks.                          We further test this

hypothesis more directly in Section 5.1.2, where we analyze heterogeneity in survivors' responses by

the level of their own pre-shock earnings.

    For younger surviving spouses, the data additionally consist of administrative measures for

full-time and part-time employment (as described in the data section). This allows us to further

investigate the dynamics and intensity of spousal labor supply behavior in response to fatal health

shocks.    As we show in Appendix Figure 3, in periods 0 and 1 there are temporary transitions

to part-time work, consistent with spending time with the dying spouse and mourning his or her

death. These short-term transitions stabilize thereafter so that the operative decision margin in the

longer-run becomes full-time work vs. non-participation.

    For completeness, we report in Appendix Table 2 estimates for the regression counterparts of

the main gures that we presented so far by using the specication of equation (3). We present in

this table the average treatment eects and their statistical signicance, and verify the robustness

5.1.2       Heterogeneity in Responses by Income Losses and Degree of Social Insurance

        We continue with further investigation of the heterogeneity in the survivors' labor supply re-

sponses across dierent subgroups which presents evidence that is consistent with the insurance

mechanism hypothesis. Using dierent strategies we show that the responses are proportional to

the loss of income that survivors experience when their spouse dies, and depend on the survivors'

degree of nancial stability and level of income insurance. We rst provide a simple (more descrip-

tive) analysis of heterogeneity across households (using cross-sectional variation with a rich set of

controls).     Then, we additionally exploit the municipality-by-year policy-induced variation in the

awarding of social survivors benets with the aim of isolating variation in households' income that
                                26
is likely more exogenous.

        Within-Gender Analysis of Heterogeneity by Income Loss.                    We begin by studying the eect of

the death of a spouse on labor force participation by the degree of income loss for each gender

separately.
              27
                   To this end, for each household we calculate the             potential   income loss due to the shock

in the following way.

        First, similarly to Panel A of Figure 3, we calculate for each household the overall income

(from any source) holding the surviving spouse's earnings and social benets at their pre-shock

level (in    t = ‚àí1).   Second, we calculate the ratio of this potential income measure in                     t=1     to the

household's income in       t = ‚àí1.    Third, we normalize this ratio for the treated households by the mean

ratio for the control households in order to purge life-cycle and time eects. This leaves us with a

measure of the potential income replacement rate for each treated household, which we denote by

rri ,   that captures the change in household income directly attributed to (and only to) the death

of a spouse. This measure is smaller whenever the deceased spouse's relative contribution to the

household's income was larger. Importantly, it accounts for the deceased spouse's income from any

source: labor earnings, private or social retirement income, and benets from government programs.

Therefore, as required for our analysis, it also captures the income loss imposed by the death of

older non-working individuals who receive income from sources other than the labor market.

        To study the heterogeneity in labor supply responses by the income replacement rate (rri ),

we augment the baseline dierence-in-dierences model of equation (3) and estimate the following

specication:


  25 These regressions present the medium-run eects (that are the focus of our analysis) so that post assumes the value 1
                                                                                                      i,t
for periods 2 to 4.
   26 Recall from Section 3.2 that our heterogeneity analysis focuses on income losses because the one-time change in households'
net asset stock following the shock is dominated by the annual changes in households' income ow following the shock. We
plot in Appendix Figure 7 the evolution of dierent moments and components of households' net wealth around the shock. The
combination of Appendix Figure 7, Figure 3, and Panel F of Appendix Figure 6 provides these income vs. wealth comparisons
for both medians and means. Appendix Figure 7 also highlights that any increase in net wealth caused by the shock pertains
to only a very small fraction of treated households in our sample. Nonetheless, we account for baseline wealth levels and for
changes in household net wealth in the regressions estimated in this section.
   27 We nd similar patterns in the analysis of labor earnings, which includes both extensive and intensive margin responses
(see mean results in Appendix Table 4; a more detailed analysis is available on request).


                                                              20

where
                                                   Œ≥i = Œ≥0 + Œ≥1 rri + Œ≥2 Zi,t .
In this regression, li,t denotes an indicator for the labor force participation of the surviving spouse in

household       i at time t.   We adjust the basic dierence-in-dierences design by allowing the treatment

eect,   Œ≥i ,   to vary across households and model it as a function of the household's potential replace-

ment rate,       rri .   Our parameter of interest is          Œ≥1 ,   which captures the extent to which the surviving

spouse's labor supply response (partially) correlates with the income loss he or she experiences.

Since    Œ≥1   can involve other dimensions of household heterogeneity beyond the income replacement

rate (either preference related or insurance related), we let the treatment eect vary with additional

household-level characteristics,          Zi,t ,   so that   Œ≥1   would further isolate the treatment eect's partial

correlation with the loss in household income. The variables that we include in                              Zi,t   are age xed

eects for the surviving spouse, xed eects for the age of the deceased at the year of death, year

xed eects, indicators for the number of children in the household and for the presence of adult
                                                                                                                            28
and young children, as well as the surviving spouse's months of education (and its square).                                      The

results are also robust to the inclusion of a quadratic in the household's net liquid wealth (which

also accounts for liquidation of housing assets and changes in mortgage debt). Note that                             Xi,t   always

includes the interaction of the variables in            Zi,t   with    posti,t , the variables in Zi,t   that are time variant,

and the interaction of these time-variant variables with                     treati .
    Table 1 reports the results of estimating specication (4) separately for each gender, with and

without       Zi,t , for the entire sample of surviving spouses and for only the sub-sample of survivors under
age 60. The results consistently show throughout the specications the strong partial correlation

between labor supply responses and income losses:                         survivors in households with lower potential

income replacement rates (lower             rri ),   who experience larger income losses, are much more likely

to increase their labor force participation in response to the shock.                        Specically, it implies larger

increases in spousal labor supply among households in which the deceased had earned a larger

share of the household's income.              Since controlling for the additional interactions with                   Zi,t      does

not change the results much, the evidence suggests that the heterogeneous responses may indeed

be driven by dierential income replacement rates. In addition, the estimation results reveal very

similar sensitivity to comparable income losses across genders; so that re-weighting the female and

male sub-samples using the regression in (4) to match on pre-shock own and spousal income would

lead to similar average responses across genders. This strengthens the conjecture that unobserved

gender dierences (e.g., in preferences) are unlikely to explain the observed dierential average labor

supply responses across female and male survivors, but rather their divergent income losses.


  28 Adult children are dened as being age 18 or older and young children are dened as being age 6 or younger (where the
results are robust to perturbations to these specic age cutos). Among other dimensions, the children controls aim to allow for
dierential costs of supplying labor due to, e.g., the presence of young children, and dierential informal insurance possibilities
due to, e.g., potential support from adult children.




                                                                  21
    Responses by Own Earnings.           The heterogeneity in responses with respect to the loss in household

income that we have analyzed so far has focused on income changes                   relative   to pre-shock ows. An

additional strategy for studying this sort of heterogeneity focuses on the                     levels   of the surviving

spouses' disposable income available at the time of the shock.                   To do this, we turn to analyze

how labor supply responses of surviving spouses may vary with their own level of earnings when

their spouses die, since higher-earning survivors have more disposable income and may therefore

eectively be better insured.

    We constrain the sample in the following way. First, we exclude surviving spouses whose av-

erage labor income before the shock was lower than that of their experimental-group-specic 20th

percentile. Then, for each household we calculate the pre-shock labor income share of the deceased

spouse out of the household's overall labor income and include only households in which both spouses

were suciently attached to the labor force. Specically, we keep households for whom the average

share was between 0.20 and 0.80. These restrictions allow us to focus on households in which there

has been some loss of earned income due to the death of a spouse and in which the surviving spouse

earned non-negligible labor income both in levels and as a share within the household. Note that

these restrictions also imply that labor supply increases within the results below for this sub-sample

are mainly driven by intensive-margin responses.

    We divide the remaining sample into ve equal-sized groups according to the surviving spouses'

pre-shock level of earnings, and plot in Panel A of Figure 5 the average labor income response (as
                                                                                                                       29
well as its 95-percent condence interval) against the pre-shock mean earnings for each group.

The gure reveals a strong negative gradient of labor supply responses with respect to the surviving

spouses' own level of earnings when the shock occurs. In particular, survivors at the bottom of the

labor income distribution increase their annual earnings by 7.79%, consistent with the view that it

may be necessary for them to do so in order to meet their consumption needs; while those at the

top of the labor income distribution decrease their earnings by 2.93%. Similar to what we found

for widowers younger than 60, the behavior of these high-earning survivors is consistent with the

notion that their high income is no longer necessary to support two people and that they may nd

lower levels of income sucient for their consumption needs as singles.

    Since these households' pre-shock labor income is composed of two earners, we need to also

account for the pre-shock earnings of the deceased spouse. Hence, we divide the sample into two

groups:    households with low-earning deceased spouses whose pre-shock labor income fell within

the bottom three quintiles of their group-specic distribution, and households with high-earning

deceased spouses whose pre-shock labor income fell within the top two quintiles. Panels B and C of

Figure 5 reveal that a negative gradient prevails in both sub-samples, such that surviving spouses

with lower earnings are much more likely to increase their labor supply when their spouse dies,

regardless of whether their spouse was a high or low earner.

    Panel A of Appendix Table 3 shows that these relationships are robust to the inclusion of xed

average labor income in the sample years prior to period 0.


                                                              22
eects for age and year (as well as to the inclusion of a quadratic in the household's net wealth),

by separately estimating the corresponding dierence-in-dierences specication of equation (3) for

each surviving spouses' quintile. Note that merely analyzing the average earnings response in this

sample would have masked the substantial heterogeneity that we documented. Panel B of Appendix

Table 3 shows that the average labor income increase for this sub-sample is DKK 585 (0.39%) and

is not statistically dierent from zero.

   Before we proceed, we might wish to consider whether some of the response heterogeneity may be

due to survivors' ability to respond. This could be the case when spouses in households with smaller

income losses have high or close-to-full rates of participation or full-time employment before the

shock. It is worth noting, however, that spouses in the sub-groups we have analyzed are generally

suciently far from full participation or complete full-time employment (e.g., as seen in Figure

4 and Appendix Figure 3), so that they can meaningfully respond upward on the extensive or

intensive margins. Also, we have found that high-earning and younger spouses, whose labor force

attachment is stronger on average, actually exhibit labor supply decreases (as seen in Figures 4 and

5). In addition, we have broken down the heterogeneity analysis by household replacement rates

(from Table 1) into sub-groups within which survivors have similar scope for labor supply increases.

For younger households, for whom we have distinct measures of participation/part-time/full-time

employment, we rst constrained the sample to spouses who did not work before the shock and

studied participation, for extensive margin responses; we then constrained the sample to spouses

who worked part time before the shock and studied full-time work, for intensive margin responses.

Likewise, for the entire sample, we ran similar specications that separately study earnings responses

by all spouses, spouses who did not work before the shock, and spouses who had positive earnings

before the shock. In all these estimations we nd negative correlations with household replacement

rates as before (see Appendix Table 4). Finally, note that sources of variation such as the spatial

variation in social insurance that we study next, which is uncorrelated with spouses' pre-shock

participation, are not subject to this issue. Overall, while clearly one cannot rule out this alternative

explanation, we think the evidence highlighted here reinforces self-insurance as a likely mechanism.

   Spatial Variation in Social Insurance over Time.     Lastly, we take advantage of spatial variation

in the administration of social survivors benets to study survivors' labor supply responses by

the generosity of social insurance.   This allows us to test the hypothesis that the self-insurance

mechanism underlies spousal labor supply responses using variation in the household's income that

is more plausibly exogenous.    It also allows us to analyze whether better social insurance crowds

out labor supply responses in our context of fatal spousal shocks. Consistent with our heterogeneity

analysis so far, we nd that the increase in survivors' participation due to the shock declines in the

formal insurance they receive from the government which mitigates their income loss.

   For this analysis, we constrain the sample to the period prior to 1994 due to a data break in the

reporting method of benets received from Social DI, the program through which social survivors

benets are provided; and to survivors under 67, the age at which the program automatically

transitions into the Old-Age Pension for the current sub-population. In addition, since the increase



                                                   23
in the take-up of the program following the shock is attributable to females within this sample, we

focus the analysis on widows (although the inclusion of widowers does not change the qualitative

results). Panel A of Appendix Figure 4 displays the aggregate insurance role of Social DI for widows,

whose take-up of the program increases by about 50% in the year their husbands die (primarily by

survivors who did not work prior to the shock).

     Recall that while the Social DI program and its survivors benets component are state-wide

schemes, they are locally administered. Regional councils decide whether to approve or reject an

application, and municipal caseworkers (in a total of 270 municipalities) administer the application

and handle all aspects of each case.                Since this structure and the vague denitions for eligibility

criteria in non-medical cases have led to substantial variation in rejection rates across municipalities,

it has created signicant variation in the mean receipts of the program's benets across the dierent

municipalities over time (Bengtsson 2002).

     We consider these year-by-municipality average receipts as an instrument for actual receipts.

In particular, we calculate for each municipality the average survivors benets received by non-

working surviving spouses through Social DI in each year. Then, in each period                               t   we assign to a

widow in treated household i, who resided in municipality                 m prior to the shock, the respective mean
of municipality      m at time t excluding her own benets (the leave-one-out                 mean), which we denote

by   SB ‚àíi,t,m .    The variation in this instrument is displayed in Panel B of Appendix Figure 4. We

estimate the following augmented dierence-in-dierences regression:

                         li,t = Œ± + Œ≤posti,t + Œ≥i treati √ó posti,t + Œ¥Xi,t + Œªtreati + Œµi,t ,                                 (5)
where
                                                       Œ≥i = Œ≥0 + Œ≥1 SBi,t .
In this regression,      li,t   denotes the labor force participation of the spouse in household                      i   at time

t,   and   SBi,t   are actual social survivors benets receipts, measured in annual DKK 1,000 ($125)

units.     Xi,t   includes age, year, and municipality xed eects. To further control for key potential

location-related (time-varying) confounders, we include in                Xi,t   municipality   m's unemployment rate
and average earnings at time             t   (as well as their interaction with   treati , posti,t ,   and   treati √ó posti,t ).
We instrument for       SBi,t     using   SB ‚àíi,t,m   (where the F-statistic on the excluded instrument in the rst

stage is 24.25). The identifying assumption is that, given our set of controls, the average of social

survivors benets transferred to other widows in a municipality in a given year aects a widow's

participation only through its inuence on her own survivors benets receipts. Note that the source

of variation that we use is within municipalities over time since we include municipality and calendar

year xed eects as controls.

     The two-stage least squares results are presented in column 3 of Table 2 (where columns 1

and 2 present the reduced-form and the rst-stage regressions, respectively). The estimate for our

parameter of interest,          Œ≥1 ,   is -.0057. With an average of DKK 23,262 ($2,908) in actual survivors

benets received by widows in the analysis sample (including zeros for those not on the program)

and with a baseline mean participation rate of 0.505, this estimate translates to a participation

elasticity with respect to social benets of -0.26 for widows under 67.                            This suggests that formal

social insurance provided to survivors crowds out labor supply increases on their part, which can

otherwise provide an informal self-insurance mechanism against loss of income following the death

of a spouse.

    In summary, the ndings of this section reveal the following pattern: there are signicant average

increases in labor supply in response to the death of a spouse, which are entirely driven by households

that experience large income losses due to this shock. At the same time, survivors whose pre-shock

earnings were high and represented a large share of the household's income decrease their labor

supply, consistent with the change in the household's composition so that they no longer nancially

support their spouse.          Put together, the results provide consistent evidence in support of self-

insurance as a mechanism for spousal labor supply responses in the extreme case of fatal health

shocks, which translate into large and permanent income losses for most households in our setting

due to incomplete formal insurance.


5.1.3      Alternative Mechanism: Changes in Spousal Labor Disutility

    Besides income losses, there are other important ways in which households can be directly af-

fected by mortality shocks that can drive our results. For example, potential changes in the surviving

spouse's labor disutility (or willingness to work) can directly lead to spousal labor supply responses

even when households are well-insured. We are specically interested in testing the hypothesis that

the increase in survivors' labor supply can be attributable to lower costs of supplying labor follow-

ing the death of a spouse, due to loneliness and the desirability of social integration or because the

survivor no longer has to care for an ill spouse. In this section, we briey discuss a simple intuitive

strategy that provides a suggestive test for this conjecture.

    Consider widows (for whom we nd an increase in participation in response to spousal death),

who did    not   work before the shock, within a simple framework in which time is divided between

labor and leisure (or any other use of time at home). Among these widows, those in households

where the deceased spouse did not work before his death, presumably experience smaller income

losses (taking into account the deceased's income from any source including government transfers)

but likely consumed more joint leisure; and hence may be more prone to experience social isolation

or loneliness following the shock.             Similarly, if the deceased spouses in these households did not

work prior to the shock because they were potentially ill in the years preceding their death, their

widows are also more likely to have taken care of them, thereby having more time available for

market work when their husbands die.                   Overall, survivors in this rst sub-set of households (in

which both spouses did not work prior to the shock) are presumably more likely to experience

a decrease in the utility cost of labor supply after the shock.                       In contrast, widows in the second

sub-set of households in which the deceased spouse worked before his death, likely consumed less

joint leisure (or provided less care-giving time) but experience larger income losses.                                Intuitively,

the hypotheses of social integration or of decreased care-giving time as the leading motives for the


  30 For a sense of scale, estimates for the net-of-tax participation elasticity are on the order of 0.25 (see, e.g., Chetty 2012).



                                                                25
average increase in these survivors' participation, are consistent with spouses in the rst group of

households increasing their labor supply more than spouses in the second group. Conversely, the

hypothesis of self-insurance as the leading motive for the estimated increase in these survivors' labor

force participation is consistent with the opposite pattern. Note that for our current analysis sample

of widows who did not work before the shock we include only those who were similarly detached

from the labor market for the entire pre-shock period (i.e., did not work in all periods from                           ‚àí5   to
                                                                                   31
‚àí1),    whether or not their husband worked before his death.                           The overall average increase in these

widows' labor force participation in response to their spouse's death is reported in column 1 of Table

3.

       To proceed, we rst verify in Table 3 the presumed dierential level of income losses across

the two groups of widows, by showing that households in which the deceased worked experience

signicantly larger drops in overall income (from any source; see column 3). Then, studying their

labor supply in column 2, we nd that the increase in the labor force participation of survivors in

households in which the deceased worked is much larger (by 4.61 pp); with a negligible eect for

survivors in households in which the deceased did not work (0.78 pp). Moreover, among households

in which the deceased did not work and received very low levels of (non-labor) income, there was no

increase in the widows' labor supply (see columns 4 and 5). Hence, in the context of this stylized

suggestive test, the evidence is inconsistent with the conjecture that a lower cost of labor following

the shock is what drives the estimated mean increase in surviving spouses' labor supply (where we

cannot, of course, completely rule it out as a mechanism).                              Rather, like the analysis so far, the

evidence supports the view that this increase is likely driven by self-insurance when the shock leads

to large income losses.


5.2       Household Labor Supply Responses to Severe Non-Fatal Health Shocks

       In our nal set of results, we study in this section household labor supply responses to severe

non-fatal health shocks. Recall that our analysis sample for these shocks consists of households with

both spouses under age 60 in which a spouse experienced a heart attack or a stroke (for the rst

time) and survived for at least three years.

       Panel A of Figure 6 shows that within three years following the shock, the sick individuals'

participation sharply falls, which translates into a large loss of annual earnings. Table 4 quanties

these eects by estimating a dierence-in-dierences regression, in which we allow for dierential

treatment eects in the short run (periods 1 and 2) and in the medium run (period 3), to account
                                                                                        32
for the gradual responses documented in Panel A of Figure 6.                                 Columns 2 and 4 of Table 4 reveal


     31 To further guarantee that we compare across two groups of spouses with similar labor force attachment, we repeated the
analysis only for widows who exited the labor force exactly at the beginning of the pre-period (t = ‚àí5) within both households
where the husband worked and those where the husband did not work, and reached similar conclusions.
  32 Specically, we estimate the following specication

                         yi,t = Œ±i + Œ≤a posta                     a            b                     b

where yi,t denotes an outcome for household i at time t, postai,t = 1 in periods 1 and 2 and zero otherwise, and postbi,t = 1 in


                                                                   26
that by the third year after the shock the labor force participation rate of the sick individuals drops

by 12 ppabout 17%and that annual earnings drop by DKK 36,070 ($4,500)a signicant drop

of 19%. Meyer and Mok (2013) and Dobkin et al. (2017) nd similar-magnitude eects of health

shocks on own earnings in their US context.

    However, while there is a signicant drop in the sick individuals' earnings, columns 5 and 6

of Table 4 show that the actual loss of income that these households experience is much smaller

and amounts to only 3.3% of overall household income.                      That is, taking into account the entire

household income, including any transfers from social or private sources (particularly Disability

Insurance benets that represent about 80% of the recovered loss), reveals that these shocks are

well-insured in the Danish setting.

    In line with this lack of a considerable income drop, which suggests there is no substantial need

for self-insurance, there are no economically signicant labor supply responses among spouses (see
                                                                    33
Panel B of Figure 6 and columns 7 to 10 of Table 4).                     While fatal and non-fatal shocks dier in

many aspects indeed (e.g., in their eects on the household's composition), in terms of the nancial

aspects of the shocks these results are consistent with our previous set of ndings.                          That is, the

behavior of spouses in our analysis of non-fatal health events is likewise in line with the notion

of self-insurance as a driving mechanism for spousal labor supply responses to shocks; here in a

context where there is no need to exercise this form of informal insurance since households are

formally well-insured.

    Consistent with this view, we provide two additional sets of results. First, we study how families

dierentially respond to non-fatal shocks with divergent degrees of severity (as dened by hospi-

talization days).      We show that while greater severity leads to larger participation and earnings

decreases by the sick individuals, the higher rate of social insurance (in part due to income test-

ing) equalizes the overall income loss across households with dierent degrees of shock severity (in

the sense that they exhibit no statistically dierent declines in post-transfer household income). If

family labor supply responses are primarily governed by self-insurance motives (rather than, e.g.,

by preference complementarities in time spent away from work), one would expect no dierential

spousal labor supply reactions across households that experience shocks of dierent severity, which

is what we nd. See Appendix Figure 8 and Appendix Table 5 for this analysis. Second, while the

mean decline in household income is negligible in the pooled sample, there is still cross-household

variation in overall income replacement rates (which hold the spouse's earnings and social benets

receipts at their pre-shock level). Studying this variation, we nd that also in the context of non-

fatal health shocks there is a strong partial correlation between spousal labor supply responses and

the imposed income losses. See Appendix Table 6 in which we estimate a specication similar to


period 3 and zero otherwise. Therefore, Œ≥a captures the short run eect, and Œ≥b captures the medium run eect.
  33 Specically, for participation we nd no eects in the short run and a small decline in the medium run (of less than
1%), and for earnings we nd an overall decline of about 1%. The papers by Gar¬¢a-G√≥mez et al. (2013) and Jeon and Pohl
(2017) document qualitatively similar responses of labor supply declines, where the latter paper estimates responses of larger
magnitudes in the context of cancer diagnoses in Canada.

equation (4). These additional sets of ndings provide further evidence in support of the insurance

mechanism hypothesis for spousal labor supply responses in the context of non-fatal shocks.

      Before we continue to the next section, it is worth noting that the data's scale and the research

design have allowed for a precise estimation of an economically insignicant average spousal response

to non-fatal shocks. This result points to a small but positive degree of complementarity in spouses'

labor supply in response to health shocks, with an estimate of 0.064 for the elasticity of the spouse's

earnings with respect to the sick individual's earnings. Since the household's income is not perfectly

insured, this response likely implies some degree of dependence of the household's utility on the

health state. Intuitively, the fact that, given a small loss of income due to the shock, the spouses'

decrease in labor supply involves an additional (very small) loss through their lower earnings is

consistent with two main health state dependence channels. First, it is consistent with households

in the bad state valuing income less than do households in the good statei.e., a consumption

utility state dependence. Second, it is consistent with an increase in the spouses' utility loss from

time spent away from home either because they would like to take care of the sick individual or due

to preferences for joint leisurei.e., a labor disutility state dependence.



6      Qualitative Welfare Implications
      Having analyzed family responses to severe health shocks from a purely positive standpoint, we

conclude with a brief discussion of the potential normative implications of our ndings. We do so

in light of our theoretical results from Fadlon and Nielsen (2016). In that paper we demonstrate

that, in frameworks of ecient household allocations, spousal labor supply responses to shocks have

direct implications for the gains from more generous government benets. Note, however, that a
                                                                                          34

      Formula.    To derive a concrete welfare formula for our application, we resort to the positive model

from Section 2. We make the following additional structural assumption regarding the spouse's labor

disutility function for the convenience of our illustrative exercise.

    34 While the qualitative normative investigation of our results is only secondary to our analysis, it is worth mentioning its
relation to prior work. Related studies that have assessed the welfare gains from social insurance programs (or have provided
analysis relevant for such an assessment) have analyzed their consumption smoothing eects, mostly in the context of disability
insurance with little direct work on the gains from survivors benets. This work includes reduced-form studies in the context of
health shocks and the death of a spouse (e.g., Myers et al. 1987; Hurd and Wise 1989; Auerbach and Kotliko 1991; Cochrane
1991; Stephens 2001; Bernheim et al. 2003; McGarry and Schoeni 2005; Meyer and Mok 2013; Chung 2013; Ball and Low 2014;
Dobkin et al. 2017) and studies that rely on structural economic modeling in the context of disability insurance and Social
Security (e.g., ¬ùmrohoro¬ßlu et al. 1995, 2003; Huang et al. 1997; Kotliko et al. 1999; Bound et al. 2004; Benitez-Silva et al.

This functional form assumption lets labor disutility vary by important variables, such as age and

other personal household characteristics (that are unrelated to labor market opportunities), which

may lead to variation in the (pre-shock) within-household division of labor across families.            This

allows us to make simple welfare comparisons across dierent sub-populations and households using

the corresponding formula from Fadlon and Nielsen (2016) that is presented in the following Lemma

(and is derived in Appendix A for completeness).

This formula illustrates that the gains from additional social insurance can be measured by evaluating

changes in spousal labor supply. The basic intuition behind this formula is as follows. More generous

government benets provide greater formal insurance, which decreases the need to compensate for

shock-induced income losses using the self-insurance mechanism of spousal labor supply. The formula

assesses the utility gain from this decreased labor supply (or, equivalently, from the additional

consumption of spousal leisure) by evaluating the benets from incrementally smoothing labor supply

across states. These are captured by multiplying the change in the quantity of spousal labor supply
                       l b
in response to shocks, g2 ‚àí1, by the rate at which the spouse's disutility from additional work changes,
                         l2
œï,   which captures the utility price of labor-supply quantity uctuations across the two states. All

else equal, the welfare gains from additional social insurance are higher whenever spousal responses

to shocks are largerthat is, whenever the household's baseline ability to smooth the spouse's

consumption of leisure across states is lower. In the comparative statics of our model in equation

(1) we saw that this quantity term increases with income losses and captures the self-insurance

role of spousal labor supply. Therefore, intuitively, larger spousal labor supply responseswhich

correspond to a stronger need to self-insureimply a greater scope for welfare-improving social

insurance due to lack of adequate formal insurance.       Similarly, the welfare gains from additional

benets are higher whenever      œï   is larger, as it implies that self-insurance through spousal labor

supply is more costly.

     The remainder of this section relies on the set of assumptions that we made so far. We use this

simplied framework to draw the suggestive (and local)        qualitative     implications of our ndings for

the design of social insurance in the context of fatal and severe non-fatal health shocks. We wish

to emphasize that the following discussion is limited to our set of assumptions, and also caution

against drawing quantitative conclusions from it. The assumptions that we outline here let normative

assessments using equation (7) focus only on the empirical moments that have been the target of

     Implications.     The heterogeneity analysis of survivors' labor supply revealed two notable patterns.

First, studying the behavior of widows below and above 60, the age at which there is a sharp decline

in labor force participation, we found a signicantly smaller relative increase in labor supply for

younger survivors. This nding was consistent with the notion that younger surviving spouses, whose

participation rates and labor earnings are signicantly higher, may be more nancially resilient after

the death of their spouse. Panel A of Appendix Figure 5 explicitly compares the relative change in

earnings for widows below and above 60. It shows that younger widows increase their labor earnings

(locally) larger potential welfare gains from providing more generous transfers to older rather than

younger widows.         For cardinal interpretation, consider the case of quadratic labor disutility (i.e.,

œï = 1).     In this case, an additional $1 transferred to survivors could create welfare gains equivalent

to 3.2 cents for widows younger than 60 and 94 cents for widows older than 60.                                 More broadly,

this result suggests that the dierential attachment to the labor force over the life-cycle, which can

eectively reduce the nancial vulnerability of younger survivors, may justify age-dependent social
                                                  35
insurance for spousal mortality shocks.

     Second, we found that increases in the surviving spouse's labor supply are strongly (partially)

correlated with the share of the household's income the deceased had earned.                                As the marginal

gains from social insurance in equation (7) grow in spouses' labor supply responses to shocks (all

else equal), this result suggests a justication for letting survivors benets depend on the deceased

spouse's work history. A similar pattern of heterogeneity in responses was found for non-fatal spousal

health shocks, so that disability benets may also be more eciently distributed if dependent on
                                             36
the disabled spouse's work history.


  35 At rst glance, this might seem at odds with a common view that older households should be provided with less life-
insurance coverage since their potential losses through foregone labor earnings are smaller. While this is indeed the case when
only labor earnings are considered, there are several important additional aspects that we should take into account. First, a
comprehensive view of households' nancial resources requires the incorporation of non-labor income streams (such as private
or social retirement income), which represent the majority of older individuals' resources and can involve signicant losses upon
spousal death. Second, the formal insurance environment should be considered. In many developed countries (including Denmark
as described in Section 3.1), the coverage of unhealthy and older households through the private market can be substantially
limited in practice due to screenings and rejections (see Hendren 2013 for evidence in the US context). In Denmark, this is
exacerbated as it is common in both group and non-group markets that even when life-insurance products are purchased by
younger and healthy households, the coverage sharply declines with age. Third, the dierential ability and opportunities to
self-insure through spousal labor supply and the divergent associated costs across age groups should be taken into consideration.
A combination of these aspects seems to drive the qualitative normative result.
   36 There may be countervailing arguments when distributional considerations are involved. We abstract from these potentially
important considerations since the focus of this section is to draw qualitative conclusions about how to eciently target benets



                                                                30
    While caution is warranted (as the two settings dier in many aspects), it is worth noting that

all of these features characterize the American Social Security system. Surviving spouses in the US

are universally eligible for benets through their deceased spouse's Social Security entitlement only

after age 60, so that survivors benets in the US discontinuously increase in age. These benets

are also a function of the deceased's work history and are therefore increasing in the labor income

the deceased had earned. The case is similar for disability benets, which are based on the disabled

worker's pre-shock average earnings.

    Overall, our ndings revealed signicant heterogeneity in responses across dierent                           pre-shock
dimensions of household characteristics, which suggests that enriching the policy tools to condition

transfers on these observable characteristics may be welfare improving. Of course, any policy consid-

eration that conditions transfers on pre-shock characteristics should also take into account potential

ex-ante behavioral responses with respect to these margins (including household specialization and

marriage market decisions).



7     Conclusion
    This paper provides novel evidence on households' labor supply responses to fatal and severe

non-fatal health shocks. Studying the critical event of the death of a spouse, we nd large increases

in the surviving spouses' labor supply that are driven by households for whom this event imposes

signicant income losses.         Analyzing households in which an individual has experienced a severe

health shock but survived, for whom income losses are well-insured, we nd no signicant spousal

labor supply responses.         While households that experience fatal and non-fatal health shocks are

aected in many (and dierent) ways, our analysis highlights how the self-insurance aspect of spousal

labor supply can provide a unifying explanation for our set of ndings. We additionally discuss the

implications of our ndings for potentially improving eciency in the distribution of government

benets.    The signicant heterogeneity in responses that we nd across dierent pre-determined

dimensions of household characteristics suggest that richer policy tools that condition transfers on

observable characteristics, such as age and household work history, may be welfare improving.




for the purpose of insuring households against the income loss imposed directly by mortality and health shocks.

Notes: These figures compare the labor force participation of a treatment group of married and cohabiting individuals born between 1930 and 1950,
who experienced a heart attack or a stroke in 1995, to that of potential control groups. Panel A compares the treatment group to married and cohabiting
individuals from the same cohorts who have not experienced this shock within our sample period (1980-2011), and reveals considerably different
behavioral patterns and visible non-parallel trends prior to 1995 across the two groups. Panel B adds the behavior of households that experienced the
same shock but in different years, and shows that the groups are becoming increasingly comparable to the treatment group‚Äîin terms of trends before
1995‚Äîthe closer the year in which the individual experienced the shock was to 1995 (the year in which the treatment group experienced the shock).
The figures reveal the similarity of households that experience shocks closer in time, and suggest using households that experienced a shock in year
1995+Œî as a control group for households that experienced a shock in 1995. The trade-off in the choice of Œî is presented in Panel C. On the one hand,
we would want to choose a smaller Œî such that the control group would be more closely comparable to the treatment group, e.g., year 1996 which
corresponds to Œî=1. On the other hand, we would want to choose a larger Œî in order to be able to identify longer-run effects of the shock, up to period
Œî-1. For example, using those who experienced a shock in 2005, which corresponds to Œî=10, will allow us to estimate effects up to 9 years after the
shock. However, this entails a potentially greater bias since the trend in the behavior of this group prior to 1995 is not as tightly parallel to that of the
treatment group. Panel D displays the potential control group for this example when we choose Œî=5. Our research design generalizes this example by
aggregating different calendar years.

Notes: These figures plot spouses‚Äô labor supply responses to fatal health shocks. The sample includes households in which one spouse died between
years 1985 and 2011 and in which both spouses were between ages 45 and 80 in the year of the (actual or placebo) shock. Panels A and B depict the
behavior of labor force participation and annual earnings, respectively, for the entire sample. Panels C and D break down these average responses by
the gender of the surviving spouse. The x-axis denotes time with respect to the shock, normalized to period 0. For the treatment group, period 0 is when
the actual shock occurs; for the control group period 0 is when a ‚Äúplacebo‚Äù shock occurs (while their actual shock occurs in period 5). The dashed gray
line plots the behavior of the control group. To ease the comparison of trends, from which the treatment effect is identified, we normalize the level of
the control group‚Äôs outcome to the pre-shock level of the treatment group‚Äôs outcome (in period -2). This normalized counterfactual is displayed by the
blue line and squares. The red line and circles plot the behavior of the treatment group.

Notes: These figures plot different measures of household-level income around fatal health shocks by the gender of the surviving spouse. Panel A plots
an adjusted measure of household income. Specifically, we fix the surviving spouse's labor income, Social Disability, and Social Security benefits at
their pre-shock levels (in period -1). Hence, this measure captures the income loss that is directly attributed to the death of a spouse. Panel B plots the
actual household income that is observed in the data, which takes into account the surviving spouse‚Äôs behavioral responses. The figures are constructed
as described in the notes of Figure 2.

Notes: These figures plot the labor supply responses of spouses under age 60 to fatal health shocks by the gender of the surviving spouse. Panel A
depicts the behavior of labor force participation, and Panel B depicts the behavior of annual earnings. The figures are constructed as described in the
notes of Figure 2.

Notes: These figures plot spouses‚Äô annual earnings responses to fatal health shocks by the level of their own pre-shock earnings. The households
included in the figures are a sub-sample of our sample of fatal health shocks which we construct in the following way. First, we exclude surviving
spouses whose average labor income before the shock was lower than their experimental-group-specific 20th percentile. Then, we calculate for each
household the pre-shock labor income share of the deceased spouse out of the household's overall labor income and include only households in which
both spouses were sufficiently attached to the labor force; specifically, we keep households for whom the average share was between 0.20 and 0.80.
These restrictions allow us to focus on households in which there has been some loss of earned income due to the death of a spouse and in which the
surviving spouse earned non-negligible labor income both in levels and as a share within the household. We divide the remaining sample into five
equal-sized groups by the surviving spouses‚Äô pre-shock level of earnings and plot the average labor income response as well as its 95-percent confidence
interval (where standard errors are calculated using the Delta method) against the pre-shock mean earnings for each quintile. Panel A includes all
households; Panel B includes households with low-earning deceased spouses, whose pre-shock labor income fell within the bottom three quintiles of
their group-specific distribution; Panel C includes households with high-earning deceased spouses, whose pre-shock labor income fell within the top
two quintiles of their group-specific distribution.

Notes: These figures plot household labor supply responses to severe non-fatal health shocks. The sample includes households in which one spouse
experienced a heart attack or a stroke (for the first time) between 1985 and 2011 and survived for at least three years, with both spouses under age 60.
Panel A depicts the labor force participation and annual earnings behavior of the sick individual; and Panel B depicts the labor force participation and
annual earnings behavior of the spouse. The figures are constructed as described in the notes of Figure 2.

Notes: This table reports the interaction of the treatment effect of fatal spousal shocks with the household‚Äôs post-shock income replacement rate
using the specification of equation (4). This replacement rate is calculated as follows. First, we fix the surviving spouse's labor income, Social
Disability, and Social Security benefits at their pre-shock levels (in period -1). Then, we calculate the ratio of this adjusted household income in
period 1 (post-shock) to that in period -1 (pre-shock), and normalize it by the average ratio for the control group in order to purge life-cycle and
time effects. Panel A reports estimates for the sample of all surviving spouses by gender; Panel B reports estimates for the sample of surviving
spouses under age 60 by gender. In each panel, we report estimates of two specifications. Specification 1 in each panel estimates a baseline
differences-in-differences specification which interacts the treatment effect with the replacement rate variable. Specification 2 in each panel
extends specification 1 to include interactions of the treatment effect with additional household characteristics: age fixed effects for the surviving
spouse, fixed effects for the age of the deceased at the year of death, year fixed effects, indicators for the number of children in the household and
for the presence of adult children (18 or older) and young children (6 or younger), as well as the surviving spouse‚Äôs months of education (and its
square). The results are also robust to the inclusion of a quadratic in the household‚Äôs net wealth (which also accounts for liquidation of housing
assets and changes in mortgage debt). Since there are households with missing values for some of the controls (that are therefore included in the
estimation of specification 1 but not 2), we show the robustness of our estimate of interest (Treat √ó Post √ó Replacement Rate) to the inclusion of
this set of controls by reporting estimates for specification 1 for the sub-sample of households that are included in the estimation of specification
2. All specifications include year, spouse‚Äôs age, and household fixed effects, and additionally include the interactions with Post of covariates that
are interacted with Treat √ó Post, the variables among these covariates that are time variant, and the interactions of the time-variant variables with
Treat. The post-shock periods include periods 2 to 4. Robust standard errors clustered at the household by experimental-group level are reported
in parentheses. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.

 Notes: This table reports the interaction of the treatment effect of fatal health shocks with the generosity of survivors benefits that widows receive
 through the Social Disability Insurance (Social DI) program. We estimate the specification of equation (5), where the instrument we use for actual
 benefits received by widows is constructed as follows. In each year we calculate for each municipality the average benefits received by non-
 working surviving spouses through Social DI. Then, we assign to each widow in the treatment group her respective municipality-year leave-one-
 out mean. The sample includes widows under age 67 (the age at which the program transitions into the Old-Age Pension for the current sub-
 sample) in years prior to 1994 (when there is a data break in the reporting method of survivors benefits received through Social DI). The controls
 included in the estimation are municipality unemployment rate and average earnings (and their interaction with Treat, Post, and Treat √ó Post) as
 well as age, year, and municipality fixed effects. The identifying assumption is that, given our set of controls, the average social survivors benefits
 transferred to other widows in a municipality in a given year affects a widow's participation only through its influence on her own survivors
 benefits receipts. Note that the source of variation we use is within municipalities over time since we include municipality and calendar year fixed
 effects as controls. The post-shock periods include periods 2 to 4. Robust standard errors clustered at the municipality level are reported in
 parentheses. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.

Working Deceased
 Notes: This table reports estimates of the labor force participation responses of widows who did not work during the five-year period preceding
 their spouse‚Äôs death. The sample includes households in which a husband died and in which he either worked throughout the entire five-year period
 preceding his death (periods -5 to -1) or did not work altogether during this period. Column 1 reports the simple differences-in-differences estimate
 in a regression similar to equation (3), in which the outcome variable is spousal labor force participation. Column 2 adds an interaction of the
 treatment effect with an indicator for whether the husband worked before his death in a specification similar to equation (4). Column 3 runs the
 same specification as in column 2 but where the outcome variable is the household‚Äôs overall income. Columns 4 and 5 report mean spousal labor
 force participation effects (using the specification of equation (3)) for sub-samples of households in which the husband did not work and received
 very low levels of (non-labor) income before his death: column 4 reports the treatment effect for households in which the non-working deceased
 spouse‚Äôs overall income before the shock, including any transfer from government programs, was lower than the 10th percentile of this sample‚Äôs
 income distribution; column 5 reports the treatment effect for households in which the non-working deceased spouse‚Äôs overall income before the
 shock was lower than the 5th percentile. All specifications include year, widow‚Äôs age, and household fixed effects, and additionally include the
 interaction with Post of covariates that are interacted with Treat √ó Post. The post-shock periods include periods 2 to 4. Robust standard errors
 clustered at the household by experimental-group level are reported in parentheses. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.

    Notes: This table reports estimates of household labor supply responses to severe non-fatal health shocks and the effect of these shocks on overall
    household income using the specification of equation (6) (in footnote 32). We allow for differential treatment effects for the ‚Äúshort run‚Äù, periods
    1 and 2, and for the ‚Äúmedium run‚Äù, period 3, to account for the gradual responses documented in Figure 6. Household income (in columns 5 and
    6) includes income from any source‚Äîincluding earnings, capital income, annuity payouts, and benefits from any social program. The third row
    reports the counterfactual outcome based on the differences-in-differences estimation. Robust standard errors clustered at the household by
    experimental-group level are reported in parentheses. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.

                                           Life-Cycle Labor Force Participation of Spouses




Notes: This figure displays the life-cycle trends in spousal labor supply. As an illustration, we depict the labor force participation of spouses included
in the fatal health shock sample (of households in which one spouse experienced a fatal shock between years 1985 and 2011), where very similar
patterns can be shown for spouses in the overall sample of non-fatal health shocks (of households in which one spouse experienced a heart attack or a
stroke for the first time between 1985 and 2011 and survived for at least three years). The observations included in the figure are from the pre-shock
periods. The sharp drop at age 60 corresponds to eligibility for the Voluntary Early Retirement Pension (VERP).

Notes: These figures plot spouses‚Äô labor supply responses to fatal heart attacks and strokes. Specifically, we constrain our sample of fatal health shocks
to households in which an individual experienced a heart attack or a stroke (for the first time) between 1985 and 2011 and died within that year. The
panel on the left depicts the behavior of labor force participation, and the panel on the right depicts the behavior of annual earnings. The figures are
constructed as described in the notes of Figure 2.

Notes: These figures plot different margins of labor supply responses to fatal health shocks of surviving spouses under age 60. Panel A depicts the
behavior of labor force participation; Panels B and C depict the fraction of surviving spouses who are employed full time and part time, respectively.
These administrative employment measures are available for workers under 60 based on records of their payments to the government-mandated ATP
pension scheme. Full-time employment is defined as working at least 30 hours per week all 12 months of the calendar year (‚Äúfull-time full-year‚Äù); part-
time employment is defined as working at some point during the year, but either fewer than 30 hours per week or fewer than 12 months within the
calendar year. The figures are constructed as described in the notes of Figure 2.

Notes: These figures include widows younger than 67 in years prior to 1994 (when there is a data break in the reporting method of benefits received
through Social Disability Insurance). Panel A plots these widows‚Äô take-up of social survivors benefits through the Social Disability Insurance (Social
DI) program around the death of their spouse. This figure is constructed as described in the notes of Figure 2. Panel B displays the distribution of the
instrument that we use in the estimation of equation (5), i.e., the year-by-municipality (‚Äúleave-one-out‚Äù) mean of survivors benefits received by non-
working surviving spouses through Social DI.

Notes: These figures plot widows‚Äô labor supply responses to fatal health shocks by their age. Panel A depicts the behavior of annual earnings, and
Panel B depicts the behavior of labor force participation. In each panel, the figure on the left depicts the behavior of widows younger than 60, the age
at which there is a sharp decline in labor force participation due to eligibility for early retirement benefits; and the figure on the right depicts the
behavior of widows older than 60. The figures are constructed as described in the notes of Figure 2.

Notes: These figures plot household labor supply responses to non-fatal health shocks with different degrees of severity. The sample includes only
households in the treatment group within our sample of non-fatal health shocks, which we divide by the shock‚Äôs severity according to the 75th percentile
of the distribution of hospitalization days associated with the shock (12 days in our sample). We assign households to the ‚Äúlow severity‚Äù group if the
sick individual was hospitalized for less than 12 days following the shock, and assign households to the ‚Äúhigh severity‚Äù group if the sick individual
was hospitalized for 12 days or more following the shock. Panel A depicts the labor force participation and annual earnings behavior of the sick
individual; Panel B depicts the labor force participation and annual earnings behavior of the spouse. The figures are constructed as described in the
notes of Figure 2, but with the change that we treat the ‚Äúlow severity‚Äù households as the control group and the ‚Äúhigh severity‚Äù households as the
treatment group.

                      Notes: These figures plot the means-testing rules (at year 2000 rates and thresholds) in benefit levels transferred to households through the Social
                      Pension (SP) scheme, which includes the Social Disability Insurance (DI) and the Old-Age Pension (OAP) programs. Panel A plots the rules for single
                      recipients, and Panel B plots the rules for married or cohabiting recipients. In both DI and OAP, the income-tested transfers consist of a basic benefit
                      of DKK 49,560 (solid black lines) and a supplement of DKK 49,140 for single individuals and DKK 22,536 for individuals in a couple (solid gray
                      lines). The y-axis denotes (pre-income-tax) benefit levels; the x-axis denotes the corresponding means-testing (pre-tax) income bases. For the basic
                      benefit, the income base for DI recipients is own overall non-SP income, and the income base for OAP recipients is own labor earnings. For the
                      supplement, within both DI and OAP, the income base in Panel A is own overall non-SP income, and the income base in Panel B is the household‚Äôs
                      overall income (excluding own SP benefits).

 Notes: This table presents means of key variables in our analysis sample. All monetary values are reported in nominal Danish Kroner (DKK)
 deflated to 2000 prices using the consumer price index. In that year the exchange rate was approximately DKK 8 per US $1. For each event, the
 treatment group comprises households that experienced a shock in different years, to which we match as a control group households from the same
 cohorts that experienced the same shock but five years later (Œî=5). Column 1 reports statistics for the fatal health shock sample of households in
 which one spouse died between years 1985 and 2011 and in which both spouses were between ages 45 and 80 in the year of the (actual or placebo)
 shock. Column 2 reports statistics for the sub-sample of households with surviving spouses under age 60. Column 3 reports statistics for the non-
 fatal health shock sample. It includes households in which one spouse experienced a heart attack or a stroke (for the first time) between 1985 and
 2011 and survived for at least three years, with both spouses under age 60. The values reported in the table are based on data from two years before
 the actual shock for the treatment and two years before the placebo shock for the control group (i.e., from period t = -2 for both groups).

 Notes: This table reports estimates of spouses‚Äô labor supply responses to fatal health shocks by the gender of the surviving spouse, using the
 differences-in-differences specification of equation (3). Panel A reports the responses of all surviving spouses in the sample of fatal health shocks,
 where widowers are those who lost their wives and widows are those who lost their husbands. Panel B reports the responses of surviving spouses
 under age 60. These regressions present the medium-run effects (that are the focus of our analysis) so that Post assumes the value 1 for periods 2
 to 4. Robust standard errors clustered at the household by experimental-group level are reported in parentheses. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.

Notes: This table reports estimates of spouses‚Äô annual earnings responses to fatal health shocks for each quintile of the surviving spouses‚Äô pre-
shock level of own earnings, using the differences-in-differences specification of equation (3). The households included in these estimations are a
sub-sample of our sample of fatal health shocks which we construct in the following way. First, we exclude surviving spouses whose average labor
income before the shock was lower than their experimental-group-specific 20th percentile. Then, we calculate for each household the pre-shock
labor income share of the deceased spouse out of the household's overall labor income and include only households in which both spouses were
sufficiently attached to the labor force; specifically, we keep households for whom the average share was between 0.20 and 0.80. These restrictions
allow us to focus on households in which there has been some loss of earned income due to the death of a spouse and in which the surviving spouse
earned non-negligible labor income both in levels and as a share within the household. We divide the remaining sample into five equal-sized
groups by the surviving spouses‚Äô pre-shock level of earnings. Panel A separately estimates equation (3) for each surviving spouses' earnings
quintile. Column 1 includes all households; column 2 includes households with low-earning deceased spouses whose pre-shock labor income fell
within the bottom three quintiles of their group-specific distribution; column 3 includes households with high-earning deceased spouses whose
pre-shock labor income fell within the top two quintiles. The gradient of surviving spouses‚Äô labor supply responses with respect to their own level
of pre-shock earnings is also robust to the inclusion of a quadratic in the household‚Äôs net wealth. Panel B reports average treatment effects within
this sample, where the second row indicates counterfactual outcomes based on equation (3). The post-shock periods include periods 2 to 4. Robust
standard errors clustered at the household by experimental-group level are reported in parentheses. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.

Notes: This table reports the interaction of the treatment effect of fatal spousal shocks with the household‚Äôs post-shock income replacement rate
using the specification of equation (4). This replacement rate is calculated as described in the notes of Table 1. Panel A reports estimates for the
sample of surviving spouses under age 60: in column 1 we study participation responses by surviving spouses who did not work for the entire pre-
period; and in column 2 we study full-time employment by surviving spouses who worked for the entire pre-period where at least one of these
periods involved part-time work. Panel B reports estimates for the sample of all surviving spouses: in column 1 we study earnings responses by
all surviving spouses; in column 2 we study earnings responses by surviving spouses who did not work for the entire pre-period; and in column 3
we study earnings responses by surviving spouses who worked for the entire pre-period. In each panel, we report estimates of two specifications.
Specification 1 in each panel estimates a baseline differences-in-differences specification which interacts the treatment effect with the replacement
rate variable. Specification 2 in each panel extends specification 1 to include interactions of the treatment effect with additional household
characteristics: age fixed effects for the surviving spouse, fixed effects for the age of the deceased at the year of death, year fixed effects, indicators
for the number of children in the household and for the presence of adult children (18 or older) and young children (6 or younger), the surviving
spouse‚Äôs gender, and the surviving spouse‚Äôs months of education (and its square). In both specifications 1 and 2 we include only households for
whom there are no missing values for this entire set of controls. All specifications include year, spouse‚Äôs age, and household fixed effects, and
additionally include the interactions with Post of covariates that are interacted with Treat √ó Post, the variables among these covariates that are
time variant, and the interactions of the time-variant variables with Treat. The post-shock periods include periods 2 to 4. Robust standard errors
clustered at the household by experimental-group level are reported in parentheses. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.

    Notes: This table reports estimates of changes in household labor supply and overall income in response to non-fatal health shocks with different
    degrees of severity. The sample includes only households in the treatment group within our sample of non-fatal health shocks, which we divide
    by the shock‚Äôs severity according to the 75th percentile of the distribution of hospitalization days associated with the shock (12 days in our sample).
    We construct a binary variable of ‚Äúhigh severity‚Äù by assigning the value 0 for households in which the sick individual was hospitalized for less
    than 12 days following the shock, and the value 1 for households in which the sick individual was hospitalized for 12 days or more following the
    shock. We then estimate a specification similar to equation (6) (in footnote 32), where we substitute the variable Treat with the variable High
    Severity. Household income (in columns 5 and 6) includes income from any source‚Äîincluding earnings, capital income, annuity payouts, and
    benefits from any social program. Robust standard errors clustered at the household level are reported in parentheses.

    Notes: This table reports the interaction of the treatment effect of non-fatal spousal health shocks with the household‚Äôs post-shock income
    replacement rate, using a specification similar to equation (4). This replacement rate is calculated as described in the notes of Table 1. Panel A
    estimates a baseline differences-in-differences specification which interacts the treatment effect with the replacement rate variable. Panel B extends
    the specification in Panel A to include interactions of the treatment effect with additional household characteristics: age fixed effects for both
    spouses, year fixed effects, indicators for the number of children in the household and for the presence of adult children (18 or older) and young
    children (6 or younger), the spouse‚Äôs gender, the spouse‚Äôs months of education (and its square), and a quadratic in the household‚Äôs net wealth.
    Both specifications include age fixed effects for both spouses, year fixed effects, and household fixed effects, and additionally include the
    interactions with Post of covariates that are interacted with Treat √ó Post, the variables among these covariates that are time variant, and the
    interactions of the time-variant variables with Treat. The post-shock periods include periods 2 to 4. Robust standard errors clustered at the
    household by experimental-group level are reported in parentheses. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.

Notes: This table compares the labor force participation patterns prior to 1995 of a treatment group of married and cohabiting individuals born
between 1930 and 1950, who experienced a heart attack or a stroke in 1995, to that of a potential control group of married and cohabiting
individuals from the same cohorts who have not experienced this shock in our sample period. We run a regression with calendar year fixed effects,
an experimental group indicator, and the interaction of these two sets of variables, where the baseline year is 1994. The table reports the interaction
terms in the periods prior to 1995 (the year at which the treatment group experiences the shock) to compare the pre-trends across the two groups.
Column 1 includes age and gender fixed effects; column 2 replicates column 1 but for the sub-sample of individuals for whom we have non-
missing values for education; column 3 adds controls for months of education and its square. Column 4 includes interactions of the baseline
variables (year fixed effects, the experimental group indicator, and their interactions) with gender; and column 5 includes interactions of the full
set of variables (including age and education) with gender. The table shows the divergent pre-trends across affected and unaffected households,
which persist even after we account for key variables. Robust standard errors clustered at the household level are reported in parentheses.

    Planner's Problem. Denote the vector of tax rates on labor income by T ‚â° (œÑ1 , œÑ2 ), and the vector of

     Welfare Gains from Social Insurance . What is the welfare gain from providing more generous benets
when the bad state occurs? To answer this question, consider transferring resources from the good state g
to the bad state b through a small increase in, e.g., the tax rate œÑ1 to nance a balanced-budget increase in
benets in the bad state B b . The social gain from this perturbation consists of the household's valuation
of additional insurance. To construct a measure for this valuation, consider rst the household's utility loss
from the marginal increase in œÑ1 that nances the additional insurance. This loss is captured by ‚àÇJ(T,B)                   ‚àÇœÑ1    =
¬µ z1 ui (ci ), as the household's income in state g is reduced by z1 dollars, which are valued at ui (ci ) per
  g g g0 g                                                                              g                                 g0 g

budget increase in B b of the amount ‚àÇB              ‚àÇœÑ1 = ¬µb .              The household's valuation per $1 increase in B b is

             ‚àÇB b
                     = ¬µb ubi 0 (cbi ), since it produces a value of ubi 0 (cbi ) and is transferred to the household
with probability ¬µb . The utility gain from the increase in benets when the shock occurs is, therefore,
                  = ¬µg z1g ubi 0 (cbi ).

    Labor Supply Representation of Welfare Gains. We show next that the household's labor supply decisions
allow us to rewrite the marginal benet in (1) in terms of the indirectly-aected spouse's labor supply.

Lemma.     The marginal (gross) welfare gain from raising benets in the bad state b to households (with
        characteristics X) can be represented by

                                                                           l2b

Proof.        The household's optimality conditions imply that each household member's marginal utility from
consumption can be mapped to the spouse's marginal disutility from labor, since us1 0 (cs1 ) = us2 0 (cs2 ) =
 v2s 0 (l2s )                                                                                   v2b 0 (l2b )‚àív2g 0 (l2g )
w2 (1‚àíœÑ2 ) . This allows us to represent the marginal benet from social insurance by M B =            v2g 0 (l2g )
                                                                                                                          .
Intuitively, we use the household's optimality conditions to represent the degree to which households are able
   1 The   partial dierentiation of the government's budget allows us to focus on the gains from social insurance. To include
                                                   dB b
the costs, we would analyze the total derivative        which takes into account not only the required mechanical adjustments,
                                                   dœÑ1
but also the households' behavioral responses to the policy change that have an impact on the government's budget (the scal

externality).

       2 When   the third order terms of spousal labor disutility are not small, the labor supply representation of welfare gains

   requires an additional term, analogous to the additional term that involves the coecient of relative prudence in the consumption

   smoothing representation of welfare gains (Chetty 2006).
