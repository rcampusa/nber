Beveridgean Unemployment Gap

                                                ABSTRACT

This paper proposes a new method to estimate the unemployment gap (the actual unemployment rate
minus the efficient rate). While lowering unemployment puts more people into work, it forces firms
to post more vacancies and devote more resources to recruiting. This unemployment-vacancy tradeoff,
governed by the Beveridge curve, determines the efficient unemployment rate. Accordingly, the unemployment
gap can be measured from three sufficient statistics: the elasticity of the Beveridge curve, cost of recruiting,
and social cost of unemployment. In the United States the unemployment gap is countercyclical, reaching
1.5--6.5 percentage points in slumps. Thus the US labor market appears inefficient---especially inefficiently
slack in slumps.

Perhaps the most important statistic in the design of stabilization policy is the unemployment
gap: the di erence between the actual and the socially e cient unemployment rate. Once the
world emerges from its coronavirus quarantine and economic activity resumes, policymakers
will need to assess the unemployment gap. The gap will indicate how much ine cient slack
remains within their economies, and the extent to which stabilization policies need to be brought
to bear as a result.
    Two measures of the unemployment gap are commonly used (Crump et al.                       ); but neither
incorporates an appropriate estimate of the e cient unemployment rate. The rst is the di erence
between actual unemployment and its secular trend. This measure is awed because in most
models trend unemployment is not e cient (Pissarides               , chap. ). The second is the di erence
between actual unemployment and the non-accelerating in ation rate of unemployment (NAIRU),
obtained by estimating a Phillips curve. This measure is awed because the NAIRU never indicates
labor-market e ciency (Rogerson             ). Thus, although these two measures are easy to use, they
lack a theoretical foundation.
    This paper proposes a new measure of the unemployment gap that builds upon the theory of
e ciency in modern labor-market models (Pissarides                 , chap. ). These models feature both
unemployed workers and job vacancies, each associated with welfare costs: more unemployment
means fewer people at work so less output; more vacancies mean more work e ort devoted
to recruiting and also less output. Furthermore, these models feature a Beveridge curve, so
unemployment and vacancies cannot be simultaneously reduced: less unemployment requires
more vacancies, and fewer vacancies create more unemployment. Our analysis resolves this
unemployment-vacancy tradeo , characterizing the e ciency point on the Beveridge curve.
    At the same time, we strive to develop an unemployment-gap formula that is usable for
policy work. To that end, we adhere to the su cient-statistic method from public economics
(Chetty       ). A rst advantage is that our formula requires little theoretical structure. It applies
to any labor market with a Beveridge curve, irrespective of the structure of the labor market,
production, preferences, wage setting, and shocks; the model's relevant properties are captured

    In practice, many governments are mandated to reduce the unemployment gap to zero. In the United States,
the      Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment Act mandates that the government maintains the economy at "full
employment" using monetary and scal policy. Full employment should not be interpreted as no unemployment,
which is physically impossible, but rather as a socially e cient amount of unemployment; therefore, the mandate
of US policymakers can be interpreted as closing the unemployment gap. Macroeconomic theory also shows that
many stabilization policies should move in tandem with the unemployment gap. Such policies include labor-market
subsidies and taxes (Pissarides        , chap. ); monetary policy (Michaillat and Saez    ); public expenditure
(Michaillat and Saez      ); and short-time work (Giupponi and Landais      ).
by the formula's su cient statistics. Since the Beveridge curve appears in many models and has
been observed in many countries (Elsby, Michaels, and Ratner         ), the formula applies broadly.
A second advantage is that the su cient statistics are estimable, so the formula is simple and
transparent to apply.
   We begin by solving the problem of a social planner who must allocates labor between pro-
duction, recruiting, and unemployment subject to the Beveridge-curve constraint. The solution
gives the e cient unemployment rate, which we express as a function of actual unemployment
and vacancy rates, and three su cient statistics: the elasticity of the Beveridge curve, cost of
recruiting, and social cost of unemployment.
   Next, we compute the e cient unemployment rate in the United States. Between                and
        the e cient unemployment rate averaged . %. It started around % in the           s, steadily
climbed to reach about % in the mid-        s, fell to % in     , and remained between % and %
until       . These variations are caused by shi s of the Beveridge curve.
   Since the e cient unemployment rate is slow-moving while the actual unemployment rate is
countercyclical, the unemployment gap is countercyclical. We infer that the US unemployment
gap is almost never zero: the US labor market does not operate e ciently. In fact the unemploy-
ment gap is generally positive, averaging . percentage points over           ­    , so the US labor
market is generally ine ciently slack. The unemployment gap is especially high in slumps, reach-
ing for instance percentage points in         and . points in       : unsurprisingly, ine ciencies
are exacerbated in slumps.
   The most uncertain statistic in our formula is the social cost of unemployment, which corre-
sponds to one minus the social value of nonwork. Our midrange estimate for the social value of
nonwork is . , meaning that the value from home production and recreation during unemploy-
ment replaces      % of the marginal product of labor. For other plausible estimates of the social
value of nonwork, the e cient unemployment rate does not change too much: from a low-end
estimate of to a high-end estimate of . , the average e cient unemployment rate only increases
by . percentage points. In contrast, some macroeconomic studies argue that the social value
of nonwork is almost . Under this calibration the e cient unemployment rate is so high that
unemployment is always ine ciently low--even during the Great Recession. This result seems
implausible, suggesting that such calibration understates the social cost of unemployment.


                                 .   Beveridgean labor market

We introduce the labor-market model used to compute the unemployment gap. The main ingre-
dient is a Beveridge curve--a negative relation between unemployment and vacancies.
 ..     Beveridge curve

We consider a labor market with both unemployed workers and job vacancies. The unemployment
rate u is the number of unemployed workers divided by size of the labor force. The vacancy rate
  is the number of vacancies divided by size of the labor force. Labor-market tightness is number
of vacancies per unemployed worker:  = /u . The employment rate is the number of employed
workers divided by size of the labor force: n = - u .
      Unemployment and vacancy rates are related by a Beveridge curve: the vacancy rate is a strictly
decreasing and convex function of the unemployment rate, (u ). Many labor-market models
feature a Beveridge curve and so are nested into our framework (Elsby, Michaels, and Ratner                          ).
Importantly, models build around matching functions exhibit a Beveridge curve (Petrongolo and
Pissarides        , eq. ( )). This category includes the canonical Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides
model (Pissarides            , chap. ); but also its variants with rigid wages (Hall                    a; Hall and
Milgrom         ), large rms (Cahuc, Marque, and Wasmer                    ; Elsby and Michaels            ), and job
rationing (Michaillat           ). Even models without a matching function may feature a Beveridge
curve: for instance, models of mismatch (Shimer                     ) and of stock- ow matching (Ebrahimy
and Shimer          ).
      Our framework applies to any country that exhibits a Beveridge curve. There are many such
countries (Jackman, Pissarides, and Savouri                ; Nickell et al.        ; Elsby, Michaels, and Ratner
      ), including the United States (Blanchard and Diamond                   ; Diamond and Sahin             ; Elsby,
Michaels, and Ratner             ). As an illustration, we construct the US Beveridge curve. For the
unemployment rate, we use the standard measure constructed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics
(BLS) from the Current Population Survey (CPS) ( gure , panel A). For the vacancy rate, we use
two di erent sources because there is no continuous national vacancy series over the period.
For       ­     , we use the vacancy proxy constructed by Barnichon (                   ). Barnichon starts from
the help-wanted advertising index constructed by the Conference Board--a proxy for vacancies
proposed by Abraham (              ) that has become standard (Shimer                  , p.   ). He then corrects
the Conference Board index, which is based on newspaper advertisements, to take into account
the shi from print advertising to online advertising a er                      . Finally, he rescales the index
into vacancies, and divides the vacancy number by the size of the labor force to obtain a vacancy

     In many matching models, unemployment follows a law of motion, and the Beveridge curve is de ned as the locus
of unemployment and vacancies consistent with a steady level of unemployment. If unemployment converged slowly
to steady state, unemployment and vacancies would not always be on the Beveridge curve. However, Pissarides (        a,
p.     ) notes that "Perhaps surprisingly at rst, but on re ection not so surprisingly, we get a good approximation to
the dynamics of unemployment if we treat unemployment as if it were always on the Beveridge curve." The reason is
that labor-market ows are large so a er a shock, unemployment adjusts rapidly to its new steady-state level, where
in ows into unemployment equal out ows from unemployment (Pissarides               ; Hall    b; Pissarides    b; Elsby,
Michaels, and Solon        ; Shimer      ).

BLS in the Job Opening and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS), divided by the civilian labor force
constructed by the BLS from the CPS. We then splice the Barnichon and JOLTS series to obtain a
vacancy rate for          ­     ( gure , panel B).
      The Beveridge curve appears in scatterplots of the unemployment and vacancy rates (panels C
and D of gure ; for readability we separately plot the                  ­     and      ­         periods). The
Beveridge curve was stable in seven subperiods, during which unemployment and vacancies
moved up and down along a clearly de ned curve:                Q­       Q ,      Q ­       Q ,     Q ­     Q ,
       Q ­      Q ,       Q­      Q ,      Q­        Q , and        Q­        Q . At the end of each of the
 rst three subperiods, the Beveridge curve shi ed outward. A er the                 Q ­      Q and        Q­
       Q subperiods, the Beveridge curve shi ed back inward. Finally, a er the                     Q­      Q
subperiod, the Beveridge curve shi ed back outward.
      Plotted on a logarithmic scale, all the branches of the Beveridge curve are almost linear,
so each branch is isoelastic. A central statistic to measure the unemployment gap will be the
Beveridge elasticity:

D                 . The Beveridge elasticity is the elasticity of the vacancy rate with respect to the unem-
ployment rate along the Beveridge curve, normalized to be positive:

                                                    d ln( (u ))
                                               =-               .
                                                      d ln(u )

      In a Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides model with Cobb-Douglas matching function m (u , ) =
µu      - ,   the Beveridge elasticity is closely related to the matching elasticity  . In that model
the Beveridge curve is obtained by equating in ows into unemployment with out ows from
unemployment: s · ( - u ) = m (u , ), where s is the job-separation rate, so that

                                                               /( - )
                                                   s ( -u)

(Shimer          , p.   ). Hence, the Beveridge elasticity is

                                                             u

 . .    Social welfare

The Beveridge curve determines the tradeo between unemployment and vacancies. This tradeo
is central to the welfare analysis because both unemployment and vacancies enter the welfare
function.
      We assume that social welfare is given by a function W(n,u , ), where n is the employment
rate, u is the unemployment rate, and      is the vacancy rate. The function W is di erentiable and
strictly increasing in n . The e ects of unemployment and vacancies on welfare are given by the
following two statistics, which play a key role in calculating the unemployment gap:

D               . The social value of nonwork is the marginal rate of substitution between unemployment
and employment in the welfare function:

                                                W/u
                                           =        < .
                                                W/n

The social cost of unemployment is -  > .

D               . The recruiting cost is minus the marginal rate of substitution between vacancies and
employment in the welfare function:
                                                 W/

      Employed workers contribute to social welfare through market production. Unemployed
workers contribute to social welfare through home production and recreation (Aguiar, Hurst, and
Karabarbounis         ); this contribution is diminished if people su er psychic pain from being
unemployed (Brand          ). The social value of nonwork  measures the marginal contribution of
unemployed workers relative to that of employed workers. Since  is a social concept, it does not
include monetary transfers received by unemployed workers from the government or others.
      Unemployment is socially costly because unemployed workers' contribute less to welfare
than employed workers ( < ). The social cost of unemployment -  measures the social loss
of having a person unemployed rather than employed. Such loss comprises foregone market
production and psychological pain of being unemployed, net of the value home production and
recreation when unemployed.
      Vacancies enter the welfare function because the recruiting activity required to ll vacancies
diverts labor and other resources away from market production. The recruiting cost  measures
the resources absorbed by maintaining a vacancy, expressed in terms of labor. It is normalized to
be positive.
      Since the labor force is divided between employed and unemployed workers, the employment
rate satis es n = - u , and social welfare can be written as a function of unemployment and
vacancy rates:


( )                                     (u, )  W( - u,u , ).
The assumptions that  < and  > imply that the function ( ) is strictly decreasing in u and
 --which captures the social costs of unemployment and vacancies. Moreover, to ensure that the
social planner's problem is well behaved, we assume that this function is quasiconcave.
      In the Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides model the statistics  and  take a simple form. Let L
be the size of the labor force; p the productivity of employed workers; z < p the productivity of
unemployed workers; and p × c the resource cost of posting a vacancy (Pissarides           , chap. ).
The utility function is linear, so the welfare function is


                                   W(n,u , ) = (pn + zu - pc ) L .

Accordingly, the social value of nonwork and recruiting cost are

                                            z
( )                                     =       and  = c .

               .   E cient unemployment rate and unemployment gap

In a Beveridgean labor market, we de ne e ciency as the solution to the problem of a social
planner who is subject to the Beveridge-curve constraint:

D               . The e cient unemployment and vacancy rates, denoted u  and  , maximize social
welfare ( ) subject to the Beveridge-curve constraint   = (u ). The e cient labor-market tightness is
  = u  /  , and the unemployment gap is u - u  .
      We now represent labor-market e ciency in a Beveridge diagram, and then derive a su cient-
statistic formula for the e cient unemployment rate and unemployment gap.


 ..    Representation in a Beveridge diagram

The Beveridge diagram, with unemployment rate on the x -axis and vacancy rate on the y -axis,
is depicted in gure , panel A. In the diagram the Beveridge curve is downward-sloping and
convex; it gives the locus of unemployment and vacancy rates that are feasible in the economy.
The diagram also features an isowelfare curve: the locus of unemployment and vacancy rates
such that social welfare ( ) remains constant at some level (the equivalent of an indi erence
curve for a utility function or an isoquant for a production function). Since ( ) is decreasing in
unemployment and vacancies, all the points inside the isowelfare curve yield higher welfare,
so the green area delineated by the isowelfare curve is an upper contour set of ( ). Since the
function ( ) is quasiconcave, its upper contour sets are convex, which implies that the isowelfare
curve must be concave.
      The e cient unemployment and vacancy rates can easily be found in the Beveridge diagram.
First, they have to lie on the Beveridge curve. Second, since both unemployment and vacancies
impose a welfare cost, they must lie on the isowelfare curve that is as close to the origin as possible.
The closest that the isowelfare curve can be while remaining in contact with the Beveridge curve
is at the tangency point with the Beveridge curve. This is where the e cient unemployment and
vacancy rates are found. The e cient labor-market tightness is also visible on the diagram: it is
the slope of the origin line going through the tangency point.
      As with indi erence curves and isoquants, the slope of the isowelfare curve is minus the
marginal rate of substitution between unemployment and vacancies in the welfare function ( ):

                      ( W/u ) - ( W/n)    - ( W/u )/( W/n )    -
                  -                    =-                   =-   .
                           W/             -( W/ )/( W/n)       

The e cient unemployment rate is found at the point where the Beveridge curve, with slope
    (u ), is tangent to isowelfare curve, with slope -( -  )/ . This yields a rst result:

P                . In a Beveridge diagram, e ciency is achieved at the point where the Beveridge curve is
tangent to an isowelfare curve. Hence, the e cient unemployment rate is implicitly de ned by

                                                          -
( )                                            (u ) = -     ,
                                                          

where  < is the social value of nonwork and  > the recruiting cost.

      Formula ( ) simply says that when the labor market operates e ciently, welfare costs and
bene ts from moving one worker from employment to unemployment are equalized. When one
worker moves from employment to unemployment, the reduction in welfare is the social cost of
unemployment, -  . Having one more unemployed worker also means having - (u ) > fewer
vacancies. Each vacancy reduces welfare by the recruiting cost,  , so welfare improves by - (u )
through the reduction in recruiting activity. When welfare costs and bene ts are equalized, we
have -  = - (u ) , which is equivalent to ( ).
      Of course, there is no guarantee that the labor market operates e ciently ( gure , panel B).
The labor market may be above the e ciency point, where unemployment is too low, vacancies
are too high, and the unemployment gap is negative. This situation corresponds to a boom. It
may also be below the e ciency point, where unemployment is too high, vacancies are too low,
and the unemployment gap is positive. This situation corresponds to a slump. As slumps and
booms are ine cient, they lie on a worse isowelfare curve than the e ciency point.

Panel A depicts an e cient labor market in the Beveridge diagram. The statistic  is the recruiting cost,  is the
social value of nonwork, and (u ) is the slope of the Beveridge curve. Panel B describes ine cient labor markets. In
slumps, unemployment is ine ciently high, vacancies are ine ciently low, and the unemployment gap is positive;
in booms, unemployment is ine ciently low, vacancies are ine ciently high, and the unemployment gap is negative.
panels C­F are special cases of panel A: assumption holds, so the isowelfare curve is linear with slope -( -  )/ ,
and the Beveridge curve is isoelastic with elasticity  . Panel C shows that the e cient unemployment rate increases
when the recruiting cost increases. Panel D shows that the e cient unemployment rate increases when the social
value of nonwork increases. Panel E shows that the e cient unemployment rate increases when the Beveridge
elasticity increases (keeping welfare constant). Panel F shows that the e cient unemployment rate increases when
the Beveridge curve shi s outward (keeping the Beveridge elasticity constant).
 . .    Formula with su cient statistics

We rework the e ciency condition ( ) to obtain an explicit expression for the unemployment
gap. We begin by introducing the Beveridge elasticity:  = -(u / ) (u ) so  = - (u ). With this
result, we can re-express ( ) as  = ( -  )/( ).
      In panel B of gure , we also see that any point on the Beveridge curve above the e ciency
point has - (u ) > ( -  )/ , and any point below it has - (u ) < ( -  )/ . Using again  = - (u ),
we infer that tightness is ine ciently high whenever  > ( -  )/( ); and tightness is ine ciently
low whenever  < ( -  )/( ).
      Hence we can assess the e ciency of labor-market tightness from three su cient statistics:

P                  . Consider a point on the Beveridge curve with labor-market tightness  , Beveridge
elasticity  , recruiting cost  , and social value of nonwork  . Then tightness is ine ciently high if
 > ( -  )/( ), ine ciently low if  < ( -  )/( ), and e cient if

                                                           -
( )                                                =         .
                                                           

      Formula ( ) can be seen as a reformulation of the well-known Hosios (                 ) condition. Hosios
resolves the unemployment-vacancy tradeo and derives a condition to ensure e ciency when
wages are determined by Nash bargaining. The condition is that workers' bargaining power equals
the matching elasticity. While the Hosios condition has had a tremendous theoretical impact,
its practical impact has been more limited. In our view this is due to two limitations, which we
aim to address. First, measuring bargaining power is challenging (Pissarides                        , p.      ). In
contrast, formula ( ) involves labor-market statistics that are estimable. Second, Nash bargaining
poorly describes wage-setting over the business cycle (Shimer                   ; Hall      a; Jager et al.       ).
In contrast, our formula applies to any model with a Beveridge curve, irrespective of how wages
are set.
      Since the statistics  ,  , and  generally depend on tightness  , formula ( ) characterizes the
e cient tightness only implicitly. This limitation is typical of the su cient-statistic approach
(Chetty       ), but it complicates the task of computing the unemployment gap. To address it, we
use a workaround developed by Kleven (                ):

A                . The Beveridge elasticity ( ), recruiting cost ( ), and social value of nonwork ( ) do not
depend on the unemployment and vacancy rates.

    As a result the bargaining power is usually simply calibrated to . (den Haan, Ramey, and Watson     ; Pissarides
    ; Gertler and Trigari       ) or to the matching elasticity (Mortensen and Pissarides    ; Shimer      ; Costain
and Reiter       ).
      How realistic is this assumption? Panels C and D in gure suggest that the Beveridge curve
is isoelastic, so the assumption on the Beveridge elasticity seems valid in US data. We do not
have comparable evidence on the recruiting cost and social value of nonwork, but at least in the
Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides model, these two statistics are independent of the unemployment
and vacancy rates (equation ( )).
      Under assumption , we obtain a simple formula for the unemployment gap. The assumption
implies that the Beveridge curve is isoelastic:


                                                  (u ) =   · u - ,

where the parameter        > determines the location of the curve. On the Beveridge curve, tightness
is related to unemployment by

                                   (u )
                             =          =   · u -( + ) and   =                · (u  )-( + ) .
                                   u

We can therefore link the unemployment gap to the tightness gap:

                                                           /( + )
                                               u   
                                                 =                   .
                                               u   

Under assumption , ( ) gives   = ( -  )/( ), which yields the following proposition:

P                 . Under assumption , the e cient unemployment rate and unemployment gap can be
measured from current unemployment rate (u ), vacancy rate ( ), Beveridge elasticity ( ), recruiting cost
( ), and social value of nonwork ( ). The e cient unemployment rate satis es

                                                              /( + )
                                                   
( )                                         u =     ·                    u,
                                                   - u

from which the unemployment gap u - u  follows.

      The proposition gives an explicit formula for the unemployment gap, expressed in terms
of observable su cient statistics. The formula is valid in any Beveridgean labor-market model,
irrespective of the structure of the labor market, production, preferences, and wage setting.
Another advantage of the formula is that we do not need to keep track of all the shocks disturbing
the labor market--shocks to productivity, wages, labor-force participation, matching function,

    The Beveridge elasticity does depend on the unemployment rate in the Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides model
(equation ( )). However, as the unemployment rate is an order of magnitude smaller than the matching elasticity  ,
the Beveridge elasticity is approximately constant and equal to  /( -  ).
job separations, preferences, etc. The su cient statistics are all we need to observe.
      A secondary bene t of assumption is to simplify the shapes of the curves in the Beveridge
diagram: the Beveridge curve becomes isoelastic, and the isowelfare curve becomes linear with
slope -( -  )/ . The simpli cation yields additional results:

P                  . Under assumption , the following comparative statics hold:

    · An increase in recruiting cost raises the e cient unemployment rate and lowers the e cient tightness.

    · An increase in the social value of nonwork raises the e cient unemployment rate and lowers the
      e cient tightness.

    · A compensated increase in the Beveridge elasticity (increase in  keeping welfare constant) raises the
      e cient unemployment rate and lowers the e cient tightness.

    · An outward shift of the Beveridge curve (increase in    ) raises the e cient unemployment rate but
      does not a ect the e cient tightness.

      The intuition is conveyed by the diagrams in gure . When recruiting is more costly or
unemployment is less costly, the unemployment-vacancy tradeo becomes more favorable to
unemployment, and the e cient unemployment rate increases (panels C and D). A compensated
increase in the Beveridge elasticity (analogous to a compensated price increase in the context of
Hicksian demand) is an increase in  compensated by a change in                 so that the new Beveridge
curve remains tangent to the same isowelfare curve (panel E). Such a change steepens the
Beveridge curve: a rise in unemployment triggers a larger drop in vacancies, so the unemployment-
vacancy tradeo         is more favorable to unemployment, and the e cient unemployment rate
increases. Finally, the outward shi of the Beveridge curve does not change its elasticity so the
e cient tightness remains the same. Since the Beveridge curve is further out, however, the
e cient unemployment rate is higher.


                   .    Unemployment gap in the United States,                       ­

We apply formula ( ) to measure the unemployment gap in the United States over the                    ­
period. The rst step is to estimate the su cient statistics: Beveridge elasticity, recruiting cost,
and social value of nonwork.
    Without assumption , we could still obtain a formula for the unemployment gap, but it would require three
additional statistics: the elasticities of  ,  , and  with respect to the unemployment rate (Kleven ).
 ..     Beveridge elasticity ( )

We estimate the Beveridge elasticity by OLS regression of log vacancy rate on log unemployment
rate. Since the Beveridge curve shi s over time, we separately estimate the elasticity on the seven
subperiods during which the Beveridge curve is stable:               Q­        Q ,          Q ­      Q ,     Q ­
       Q ,    Q ­     Q ,          Q­      Q ,     Q­      Q , and        Q­         Q . One such regression
is illustrated in gure , panel A; the results on each subsample are displayed in gure , panel B.
      We nd that from              to     , the Beveridge elasticity uctuated between .                and . ,
averaging . . The Beveridge elasticity steadily increased from .                   in the         s to .   in the
       s, before dropping back to .      in      , and dropping further to .       in       . The elasticities are
precisely estimated: the standard errors vary between .           and . . And the t of the regressions
is good: the R vary between .           and . . The good t con rms that unemployment and vacancies
travel on tightly de ned, isoelastic curves.
      Our estimates of the Beveridge elasticity are consistent with the estimates of the match-
ing elasticity obtained by the empirical literature studying the matching function. A midrange
estimate of the matching elasticity is  = . (Petrongolo and Pissarides                   ). The average unem-
ployment rate over the             ­    period is u = . %. Combining these values with the expression
of the Beveridge elasticity in a Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides model, given by ( ), we obtain
 =[ . + .        /( - .     )]/( - . ) = . . This value is close to our average elasticity of  = . .

 . .    Recruiting cost ( )

To estimate the recruiting cost we use the               National Employer Survey. In the survey, the
Census Bureau asked ,              establishments about their recruiting process, and found that rms
spend . % of their labor costs on recruiting (Villena Roldan                   ). This means that in             ,
 = . % × ( - u ). In          , the average vacancy rate is . % and the average unemployment rate
is . % ( gure ). Hence, we nd that the recruiting cost in            is  = . % × ( - . %)/ . % = . .
Since there is no other comprehensive measure of recruiting cost in the United States, we assume
that the recruiting cost remains at its           value over the entire        ­        period.


 . .    Social value of nonwork ( )

To estimate the social value of nonwork, we rely on the work of Borgschulte and Martorell (                      )
and Mas and Pallais (         ).
      Using military administrative data covering           ­     , Borgschulte and Martorell study how
servicemembers' reenlistment choice is in uenced by unemployment. This choice allows them to
estimate the dollar value of the utility loss caused by higher unemployment during the transition
to civilian life, and compare it to the earnings loss caused by higher unemployment. They nd
that during unemployment home production, recreation, and public bene ts o set between             %
and     % of lost earnings.
     Using a large eld experiment, Mas and Pallais study how unemployed job applicants choose
between randomized wage-hour bundles. These choices imply that the value of home production
and recreation during unemployment amounts to            % of predicted earnings.
     Next, we translate these estimates into social values of nonwork. The rst step is to express the
estimates relative to the marginal product of labor rather than earnings. The marginal product
of labor is higher than earnings for several reasons. First, the wage paid by rms is usually
lower than the marginal product of labor. In a matching model the wedge amounts to the share
of workers allocated to recruiting, so the marginal product is about % higher than the wage
(Landais, Michaillat, and Saez       , eq. ( )). In a monopsony model, the wedge depends on the
elasticity of the labor supply, and the marginal product may be       % higher than the wage (Mas
and Pallais      , p.    ). Second, the wage received by workers is lower than that paid by rms
because of employer-side payroll taxes, which amount to . %. Third, Mas and Pallais discount
predicted earnings by % to capture the wage penalty incurred by workers who recently lost
their jobs; we undo the discounting because the penalty does not seem to apply to the marginal
product of labor (Davis and von Wachter        ). To conclude, to obtain a marginal product of labor,
Borgschulte and Martorell's earnings have to be adjusted by a factor between .      × .   = . and
 .    × . = . , and Mas and Pallais's earnings by a factor between . × .            × .   = . and
 .    × . × . = . . Accordingly, to obtain a value relative to the marginal product of labor,
Borgschulte and Martorell's estimates have to be adjusted by a factor between / . = . and
 / . = . , and Mas and Pallais's estimates by a factor between / . = . and / . = . .
     The second step only applies to Borgschulte and Martorell's estimates, from which we subtract
the value of public bene ts. All servicemembers are eligible to unemployment insurance (UI).
Chodorow-Reich and Karabarbounis (          , pp.    ­     ) nd that UI bene ts amount to     . % of
the marginal product of labor. But this quantity has to be reduced for several reasons: the UI takeup
rate is only   %; UI bene ts and consumption are taxed, imposing a factor of . ; the disutility
from ling for bene ts imposes a factor of . ; and UI bene ts expire, imposing a factor of . . In
sum, the average value of UI bene ts to servicemembers is        . × .   × .    × . × .      = % of
the marginal product of labor. Like all unemployed workers, servicemembers are also eligible to
other public bene ts, which Chodorow-Reich and Karabarbounis quantify at % of the marginal
product of labor. Hence, to account for bene ts, we subtract % + % = % of the marginal product
of labor from Borgschulte and Martorell's estimates.
     Combining these two steps, we nd that Mas and Pallais's estimates imply a social value of
nonwork between .               × .    = .    and .        × .
                                                 = . ; and that Borgschulte and Martorell's
estimates imply a social value of nonwork between ( . × . ) - . = . and ( . × . ) -
 . = . . The range of plausible values for the social value of nonwork therefore is ­ . ; we
set the statistic to its midrange value,  = . .
          We also keep the social value of nonwork constant over the business cycle. In some mod-
els, the productivities of unemployed and employed workers do not move in tandem over the
business cycle, generating uctuations in the social value of nonwork (for instance in the Diamond-
Mortensen-Pissarides model, as shown by ( )). However, Chodorow-Reich and Karabarbounis
(          , pp.        ­   ) nd no evidence of such uctuations in US data. Instead, they establish that
the utility derived by unemployed workers from recreation and home production moves pro-
portionally to labor productivity--which implies that  is acyclical. The social value of nonwork
could also exhibit medium-run uctuations, but we omit them by lack of evidence.


    . .     Unemployment gap

We now use the estimates of the Beveridge elasticity, recruiting cost, and social value of nonwork,
as well as the unemployment and vacancy rates from gure , to measure the unemployment gap
in the United States between                 and      .
          We begin by computing the e cient unemployment rate from formula ( ) ( gure , panel C).
It hovered around % in the                s, rose to % in the             s, and climbed to reach . % in      --a
level it maintained until              . The steady increase of the e cient unemployment rate between
          to       was caused by two factors: a steady increase of the Beveridge elasticity, from .           in
          to .     in       ( gure , panel B), and a steady outward shi of the Beveridge curve ( gure ,
panel C). Then, in             ­      , the e cient unemployment rate sharply declined to reach %. The
decline was caused both by a drop of the Beveridge elasticity from .                   to .   ( gure , panel B),
and by an inward shi of the Beveridge curve ( gure , panels C­D). The e cient unemployment
rate then remained stable through the                     s,     s, and       s, hovering between . % and %.
          Interestingly the e cient unemployment rate did not increase in the a ermath of the Great
Recession--despite the outward shi of the Beveridge curve ( gure , panel D). This is because
the Beveridge curve also became atter a er                       : the Beveridge elasticity fell from .    to .
( gure , panel B). The attening o set the outward shi , leaving the e cient unemployment
rate almost unchanged by the recession.
          Measuring the distance between the actual and the e cient unemployment rate, we obtain the
unemployment gap ( gure , panel C). Between                         and       , the unemployment rate averages
    . % and the e cient unemployment rate average . %, so the unemployment gap averages
    . percentage points. The unemployment gap is sharply countercyclical. It is close to zero at

Panels A and B: We estimate the Beveridge elasticity  with OLS regressions of log vacancy rate on log unemployment
rate (from gure , panels A and B) for seven subperiods:          Q­       Q ,      Q ­      Q ,   Q ­       Q ,    Q ­

for     Q­      Q ; the slope of the regression line gives  = . . Panel B depicts the estimates of  for all subperiods.
Panel C: The actual unemployment rate comes from gure , panel A. The e cient unemployment rate is computed
from ( ) with  = . ,  = . ,  from panel B, and the unemployment and vacancy rates from gure . Panel D:
Actual and e cient unemployment rates come from panel C. CBO unemployment rate is the long-term natural rate

business-cycle peaks: sometimes negative (- . percentage points in              and - . points in
       ); sometimes zero (in     ,    , and     ); and sometimes positive (for instance . points in
        and . points in        ). The e ect of wartime mobilization on the labor market is visible:
the unemployment gap was only negative in           ­     , during the Korea war, and in     ­     ,
at the peak of the Vietnam war. And the unemployment gap is highly positive at business-cycle
troughs: for instance, . points in        , . points in     , and . points in     . Unsurprisingly,
the largest unemployment gap occurred in the wake of the Great Recession.
   Assumption is required to obtain precise values of the unemployment gap (proposition ).
Yet, even without the assumption, the graph in panel C of gure continues to be informative: it
indicates whether unemployment is ine ciently high or low. Whenever unemployment is above
the e ciency line, we know from ( ) that /u < ( -  )/( ), which indicates that unemployment
is ine ciently high (proposition ). Conversely, whenever unemployment is below the e ciency
line, we know that unemployment is ine ciently low.
   In sum, the US unemployment rate is generally ine ciently high--an ine ciency exacerbated
in slumps. These results have implications for policymaking and macroeconomic modeling. First,
because the unemployment spikes in recessions are ine cient, it is warranted to deploy scal and
monetary policy in bad times to reduce unemployment. Second, given that the unemployment
rate is almost always ine cient, and sometimes markedly so, it might not be productive to insist
upon modeling the labor market as e cient--whether it is by assuming that the Hosios condition
holds or by focusing on a competitive-search equilibrium.
   Finally, to provide some context, we compare our measure of the unemployment gap to
three other measures: the di erences between actual unemployment and its trend, the NAIRU,
and the Congressional Budget O ce's natural rate of unemployment ( gure , panel D). Trend
unemployment and the NAIRU are constructed by Crump et al. (               , g. B) using state-of-
the-art techniques. The CBO's natural rate of unemployment--which features prominently in
policy discussions--is constructed by blending trend and NAIRU considerations (Shackleton          ,
app. B). The main similarity is that all four measures are countercyclical. This is because e cient,
trend, NAIRU, and CBO unemployment rates are slow-moving while the actual unemployment
rate is countercyclical. The main di erence is that our measure is higher than the three others;
the average di erence over the period is . ­ . percentage points. This is because the e cient
unemployment rate is lower than trend, NAIRU, and CBO unemployment rates.

value of nonwork. Given this uncertainty, we consider alternative calibrations of the social value

of nonwork and explore their impact on the e cient unemployment rate ( gure ).
      First, we consider an estimate at the low end of the range of plausible values:  = . Under
this calibration, the e cient unemployment rate follows the same pattern as under the baseline
calibration ( = .     ) but is on average . percentage point lower (panel A).
      Next, we consider an estimate at the high end of the range of plausible values:  = . , which
is consistent with the estimates from the macro-labor literature (Chodorow-Reich and Karabar-
bounis        , eq. ( )). The e cient unemployment rate follows again the same pattern as under
the baseline calibration, but it is on average . percentage point higher (panel B).
      These di erent calibrations show that around our baseline calibration of  = .   , the e cient
unemployment rate is fairly insensitive to the precise value of  . For any  in the ­ . range, the
e cient unemployment rate remains contained in a band whose average width is less than .
percentage point. This is reassuring as the range of plausible values for  is quite broad.
      Our baseline calibration implies that the social value of unemployment is much lower than
labor productivity; in contrast, some macro-labor studies argue that the two are very close. A
well-known calibration, due to Hagedorn and Manovskii (        ), is  = .   . Such a calibration has
a drastic impact: it pushes the e cient unemployment rate above      %, and sometimes as high as
  %, with an average value of     . % (panel C). Under this calibration, unemployment is always
ine ciently low, even at the peak of the Great Recession, which seems implausible.
      Finally, to provide further perspective, we compute the social value of nonwork that arises
under the assumption that US unemployment is e cient at all time. Proposition shows that this
value is


( )                                             = -  ,

where  is the actual labor-market tightness. To sustain e ciency, the social value of nonwork
would need to be immensely countercyclical, as low as - .     in booms and as high as .      during
the Great Recession (panel D). Then recessions would merely be vacations.


                                          .   Conclusion

This paper develops a new method to measure the unemployment gap--the di erence between the
actual and the socially e cient unemployment rate. We consider a labor-market model with only
one structural element: a Beveridge curve relating unemployment and vacancies. This framework
covers many modern labor-market models, including the Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides model.
We show that the unemployment gap can simply be measured from current unemployment
and vacancy rates, and three su cient statistics: the elasticity of the Beveridge curve, cost of
recruiting, and social cost of unemployment.
      We apply our unemployment-gap formula to the United States,          ­      . We nd that the
US unemployment gap is countercyclical: the gap is close to zero in booms, slightly positive or
negative; it is highly positive in slumps. We infer that the US unemployment rate is generally inef-
    ciently high, and such ine ciency worsens in slumps. Historically, it was therefore warranted
to activate scal and monetary policy in bad times to reduce unemployment.
      To cement our estimates of the unemployment gap, it would be invaluable to obtain more
evidence on the three statistics in the formula. The Beveridge elasticity could be estimated more
    nely by using more sophisticated econometric techniques or by imposing more structure on
the labor market; Ahn and Crane (        ) take a step in that direction. The recruiting cost could
be measured better in the future by adding a new question into JOLTS, asking rms to report
the number of man-hours devoted to recruiting in addition to the number of vacancies. Last,
additional estimates of the social cost of unemployment could be obtained from natural and eld
experiments, following the methodology in Borgschulte and Martorell (          ) and Mas and Pallais
(      ).
