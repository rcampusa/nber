                    What Do We Know About Worker
                 Displacement in the United States?




                              ABSTRACT



      In the United States roughly one-half million workers with 3+

years on the job have become unemployed each year during the 1980s

because of plant closings. There is evidence that this represents

an increase over earlier periods of similar macroeconomic

conditions. Wage cuts within the observed range lower only

slightly the probability that a plant will close. The average loss

of earnings, due to long spells of post-displacement unemployment

and to subsequent reduced wages, is substantial. While minorities

suffer an above-average rate of displacement, the earnings losses

they experience upon displacement are not disproportionately high.

Women and older workers are no more likely than others to become

displaced, and their losses are not disproportionate; but workers

who have been on the job longer lose more.

      Worker displacement---job loss among workers with significant

labor-force attachment- - -has attracted sharply increased attention

from policy-makers and recently from economists too. Proposals for

advance notification of plant closings and large increases in funds

for training displaced workers are among the responses in the U.S.

to what is perceived to be a. new unemployment problem. Who are the

displaced workers? How do they differ from the unemployed in

general? Has there been an upward trend in their number that is

distinct from the higher unemployment of the l970s and 1980s? To

what extent do wage cuts reduce the likelihood of displacement?

What is lost when a worker is displaced? I answer these questions

by examining recent data and research.

     I. Counting Displaced Workers: Demographics and Trends

      Substantial debate has arisen over which workers are to be

classified as displaced. From the most restrictive definition- --

trade-displaced,   long-tenure workers whose plants closed, to the

least restrictive---all laid-off workers, the estimated number of

displaced workers varies tremendously. Some of the confusion on

this issue was removed by special supplements that were added to

the January 1984 and January 1986 Current Population Surveys (CPS)

that asked workers if they had lost their jobs during the previous

five years. These Displaced Worker Surveys (DWS) produced counts

for 1979-83 and 1981-85.

      The federal government (Flaim-Sehgal, 1985) has settled on the

admittedly arbitrary definition of displaced workers as those who

lost jobs that they had held for three or more years either due to

slack work, abolition of the job or closing of the plant. By this

criterion 5.1 million workers were displaced during 1979-83, with

the same number counted as displaced during 1981-85. Although this

definition has become standard, and though it provides the basis

for disaggregation in published data, it is too broad. Abolition

of one's job or slack work are subjective notions that receive

subjective responses in the CPS.       "Slack work" can be used as an

excuse to rationalize one's job loss, as can "position abolished."

Counting only workers whose plants closed leaves 2.5 million

workers displaced during 1979-83, and 2.8 million displaced during

1981-85. Even with this restrictive definition- --workers with at

least three years of job tenure whose plants closed- --over one-

half million workers per year were displaced during the l980s.

     Using the official definition gives the impression that there

is distinct nonrandoinness in the incidence of displacement. Table

1 shows the ratio of the number of workers displaced during 1981-85

to total employment during 1983 in various demographic and industry

groups. Displacement is more likely among men than among women;

among blacks and Hispanics than among non-Hispanic whites; and

especially among manufacturing workers. Despite popular myth, and

despite the definitional requirement that a worker have at least

three years of job tenure, older male workers (those aged 55-64)

are no more likely to be displaced than workers aged 25-54. Other

data show displacement more likely in the Northeast and North

Central regions during this period.

      The official data do not provide a good indication of whether

increased interest in displacement is the result of any change in

the magnitude of the problem. They imply that the number of

                                   2
workers displaced in 1979 and 1980 was about the same as in 1984

and 1985. Fortunately, the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID)

asks respondents whether they left jobs because the plant closed.

Defining displaced workers as those (regardless of job tenure)

whose plants closed, weighted averages of the data for each year

during 1968-81 show very clearly that there was an increase in the

rate of displacement (Hamerniesh, 1983). For example, during the

1974-75 recession the displacement rate averaged 1.6 percent per

year; during the much milder 1980-81 recession it averaged 2.5

percent. During 1971-72 and 1978-79, periods of expansion with

almost identical aggregate unemployment rates, displacement rates

in the PSID sample averaged 1.6 and 2.0 percent respectively.

These data suggest that the increased public attention to worker

displacement reflects the growth of this labor-market phenomenon.

        II. Labor Costs and the Likelihood of Displacement

      The increase in the incidence of displacement provokes two

questions: 1) What causes plants to close, and, in particular, why

do workers not accede to cuts in labor costs that allow the plant to

remain open? and 2) What changes in the displacement process have

produced the increase? Plant closings must be handled by a theory

that focuses on the standard items that affect labor demand-- -labor

costs, technology and product price---modified to account for the

discreteness of the plant-closing decision.

      Despite the much-touted nominal wage cuts of the early 1980s,

they were really quite rare. Except during 1983, cuts were

accepted by no more than 5 percent of workers covered by major

union contracts from 1981-85 (Mitchell, 1985); and some of these

                                 3
wage cuts were accompanied by offsetting increases in the cost of

employee benefits. Given the pressures of foreign and domestic

competition on these and other workers, the paucity of wage cuts is

perhaps surprising.

      The relationship between the probability of a plant closing

and the wage can be viewed as part of an implicit contract between

the firm and its workers. The firm earns the same expected profits

given a particular distribution of stochastic product prices while

offering workers a package of higher wages and a greater likelihood

of plant closing. Workers can be compensated for a greater risk of

closing by higher wages. With a demand shock (a leftward shift in

the distribution of product prices) equilibrium is reestablished

with lower wages and a higher likelihood that the plant closes.

      Using PSID data for 1977-81, Hamermesh (1986) finds a

negative relationship between the probability that a worker loses a

job in a plant closing and the worker's wage in the last year on

the job (adjusted for the worker's demographic characteristics and

human capital). Hence, those workers whose wages were higher,

other things equal, are less likely to experience plant closings.

(Similar results have been produced by Dickens-Lang (1987)

comparing CPS data for 1973 and 1981.) Demand shifts dominated

movements along the labor-demand curve in determining the incidence

of displacement. Holding demand conditions constant, though, higher

wages did increase the likelihood of displacement, with an analogue

to the constant-output labor-demand elasticity equal to - .4, well

in line with estimates of conventional demand elasticities.



                                 4
     Workers could accept wage cuts and thereby reduce the

probability of the plant closing. That they do not is the rational

outcome of their realization that the wage cut guarantees a

reduction in their welfare. Plant closings are a low-probability

event whose major cause is product-market shocks that will swamp

the beneficial impact the wage cut might have on the probability of

closing. This conclusion is corroborated by Grossman's (1986)

study of the basic steel industry, where many plants have closed

and production-worker employment decreased from 448,000 in 1979 to

216,700 in 1986. Based on an expanded time-series labor-demand

equation, wage changes during this period accounted for essentially

none of the decline in employment. Part was explicable by changes

in the terms of trade and by the slow growth of real incomes in the

U.S. Nearly half of the decline could not be attributed to either

of these causes, and must instead have resulted from other causes,

perhaps very rapid labor-saving technical change.

               III. The Losses from Displacement

      The size and incidence of the losses- - -   in terms of lost work

time and wages- - -have been the most thoroughly studied aspects of

job displacement. Measuring them is important both to inform

decisions about the desirability of ameliorative or preventive

policies, and for structuring policies appropriately.

      One must consider the distinction between the private and

social costs of displacement. At the simplest level, which has been

accounted for in some of the studies we discuss, there is a need to

net out transfer payments when calculating private losses. At a

                                  5
slightly less simple level, which has been recognized in a few

studies, one needs to distinguish between income streams that are

lost because specific investments become worthless unexpectedly

early when displacement occurs, and those that disappear when rents

are wiped out. The former, including the returns to firm-, and

perhaps industry- and location-specific capital, represent the

social cost of moving toward a new labor-market equilibrium. The

latter, including rents accruing to beneficiaries of discrimination

and union-induced job queues, are not a social cost. At a more

complex level the losses incurred by the individuals studied are

part of a general equilibrium response to shocks. No study has

attempted to compare the private losses of these individuals to the

labor-market impacts on other workers. Many early case studies and

one recent one (Foibre et al, 1984) did, though, examine the

impacts of plant closings on particular labor markets. Other work

has demonstrated the huge rate of both plant closings and openings

relative to net changes in employment (Leonard, 1987).

      Even the estimation of the private wage and employment losses

incurred by the few individuals studied requires care. Unemploy-

ment and subsequent wages of displaced workers depend on their

search behavior. Workers whose reservation wages decline more

slowly with unemployment duration will have a lower likelihood of

reemployment and a higher post-displacement wage. This does not

mean that the unemployment is voluntary, any more than the

contracting approach discussed in Section II implies that workers

choose to have their plants close. Rather, the unemployment is the

involuntary result of an exogenous shock; but the incidence of

                                6
unemployment and the wage loss are endogenously determined. They

vary with workers' characteristics, whose effects on search

behavior must be modeled or somehow accounted for to discover the

incidence of the private losses attributable to the shocks. All

but two of the studies that consider this problem "solve" it by

including a selectivity correction that is not carefully modeled.

This difficulty casts some doubt on many of the studies, especially

since there is clear evidence that exit rates of displaced workers

from unemployment show negative duration dependence. This is a

particular problem in studies that use workers' post-displacement

experience without concern for their heterogeneity.

      Empirical work in this area is hardly new; but it took off in

the past ten years, and exploded in the last three years with the

analysis of data sets covering broadly representative samples of

displaced workers. Twelve studies using such U.S. data are

swmnarized in Table 2. The first three are based on special surveys

of displaced workers. The underlying data are retrospective, so

that data on pre-displacement experience may contain substantial

measurement error and biases; but the data have the virtue of

focusing on a narrowly-defined study group. Five of the studies

used the 1979-84 DWS, which has the virtue of producing large

samples, but the severe drawback of providing only retrospective

data. The remaining studies use the two major U.S. longitudinal

data sets. Neither has problems with retrospective data; but the

PSID provides very small samples of displaced workers, and the NLS

does not allow one to identify workers whose plants closed.

Clearly, currently there is no set of data that is a very

                                 7

satisfactory vehicle for measuring the incidence and amount of wage

and earnings losses.

      The DWS data demonstrate that the median reemployed displaced

worker suffered a real wage reduction of between 5 and 15 percent

(depending on the sample chosen). The median displaced worker who

found a job was unemployed for as much as 40 weeks (among female

workers in one sample). Estimates of the present value of average

earnings losses (in 1980$) over the remainder of the worker's

expected lifetime range from slightly more than $1,500 to over

$10,000. All of these are gross estimates for displaced workers

only, unadjusted for the effects of workers' search behavior and

for the possible impacts of displacement on other workers.

      Despite difficulties with data and lack of proper concern with

issues of job search, we can draw some conclusions about the

correlates of the losses from this large body of empirical research.

Most clearly and most relevant for policy, workers who had greater

tenure on the job from which they were displaced suffered the

greatest losses of subsequent wages and time employed. Patterns of

wage-tenure relationships before plant closings (Hamermesh, 1987)

suggest this finding is not an artifact produced by search

behavior. Whether it reflects the loss of firm-specific capital or

the destruction of successful job matches is not clear; but long-

tenure workers are made especially worse off by displacement.

Though the evidence is less strong, because of possible

 contamination by search behavior, workers who change occupation or

 industry suffer greater losses than otherwise identical workers.



                                 8
      All the studies that consider the issue show that less

educated workers spend more time unemployed and suffer dispropor-

tionate wage losses. Here the problem of search behavior severely

confounds the results, for access and ability to process labor-

market information is probably related to education level. Blue-

collar workers also suffer larger-than-average losses. Various

studies also stress correlations between earnings loss and such

demographic characteristics as age, sex and race; but for each such

study another finds the opposite correlation. Based on all the

available studies there is no basis for concluding that particular

groups, such as women or minorities, suffer especially large losses

from being displaced (though minorities are more likely to be

displaced).

      A particularly careful study (Ruhm, 1987) demonstrates that

there is no long-term employment effect of displacement once one

accounts for worker heterogeneity. No similar study has been done

on long-term wage effects; but the large wage gains generally made

by labor-force reentrants (Mincer-Ofek, 1982) suggest that much of

the wage loss may not be permanent either. These results imply

that projecting streams of wage and/or employment losses will lead

to overestimates of the present value of the private loss.

                        IV. Conclusion

     There is always substantial job displacement in a dynamic

developed economy; but displacement has shown a secular increase in

the U.S. that is independent of the business cycle. Wage cuts have

only small impacts in reducing the likelihood of displacement. The

                                9
social costs of displacement are unknown, but that there are large

private costs is well demonstrated. These costs are especially

large to workers with greater job tenure, but they are mostly not

long-term. There is no evidence that they are perfectly offset by

prior compensating wage differentials. That the adjustments that

engender them produce a net gain to society argues in favor of

offsetting labor-market policy if we can be fairly sure that the

disincentives produced are not great.
