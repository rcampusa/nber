We evaluate the effect of a politician’s age on political governance, reelection rates,and policies using
data on Italian local governments. Our results suggest that younger politicians are more likely to behave
strategically in response to election incentives: they increase spending and obtain more transfers from
higher levels of government in preelection years. We argue that is a sign of stronger career concerns
incentives. The results are robust to adopting three different identification strategies: fixed-effects
regression, standard regression discontinuity design, and an augmented regression discontinuity design
that controls for residual heterogeneity.

1         Introduction
Do younger politicians act differently than older ones? We provide some answers to this
question using data on mayors of Italian cities. Older mayors are supported by an older
city council and select older executive committee members. Younger mayors are more likely
to be reelected to office. Younger and older mayors choose a similar level of expenditures
and revenues on average during their term. However, younger mayors are more likely to
strategically increase expenditures and attract more transfers from the higher levels of gov-
ernment right before the election. Thus younger mayors tend to be more strategic. They are
also successful in doing so since we show that the presence of these fiscal cycles is positively
correlated with reelection of the mayor.
        Younger politicians may differ from older ones for three reasons. One is that they have a
potentially longer political career in front of them and therefore have more career concerns.
The second is simply that as younger citizens they have a longer horizon and therefore a
lower discount rate, causing them to adopt more long-term policies.1 The third and more
mundane reason is that younger politicians are more energetic and more productive at work.
Our results seem most consistent with the first explanation. In fact if young politicians were
simply more energetic than older ones, they would plausibly attract more transfers from
higher levels of governments in every year of their term, not only in preelection periods.
As for the second explanation, it is unclear why longer-horizon policies such as increasing
investments would be adopted only in preelection years and not independently of the timing
of elections.
        Evaluating empirically the causal effect of age on choices is tricky. Comparing the choices
of mayors of different ages would not allow us to identify our effect of interest, because
many other variables, not only observable but also not observable, are correlated with the
age of the mayor. In order to avoid this problem we adopt three different identification
strategies. First, we rely on fixed effects estimates, in order to control for all of the time
invariant confounding factors. Second, in order to account for any kind of municipality-
specific confounding factors, we employ a regression discontinuity design. Close elections
amongst candidates of different age generate exogenous variation in the age of the winning
candidate for mayor. However even in a regression discontinuity design, it is possible that

older mayors may differ from younger mayors in other individual-level characteristics. In fact
older mayors have less education and more political experience on average in our data set.
Even in settings where individual-level covariates are balanced, the econometrician cannot
rule out the possibility that individual unobservable characteristics are unbalanced. In order
to alleviate these concerns, we augment the standard regression discontinuity framework to
account for some residual unobserved heterogeneity. We then show, in the spirit of Altonji,
Elder, and Taber (2005), that our results are robust if the residual individual heterogeneity
at the threshold is no larger than the individual heterogeneity that we can identify by using
our rich dataset on individual characteristics and a regression discontinuity design. To the
best of our knowledge our application is the first that combines the intuition of Altonji et al.
(2005) with a standard regression discontinuity design. This strategy can be applied in other
settings to address the concerns of the applied econometrician when she is concerned that
some individual-level covariates may not be balanced at the threshold when analyzing close
elections.
   This paper is related to three branches of the literature. The first is the literature on
how certain characteristics of politicians affect their choices. While the standard Downsian
framework predicts that only the median voter determine policies, a rapidly growing set of
studies, both theoretical and empirical, shows that the characteristics of political leaders
matters do matter for policies and outcomes (Alesina 1988; Washington 2008; Besley, Mon-
talvo, and Reynal-Querol 2011; Gagliarducci and Paserman 2012; Brollo and Troiano 2014).
The great majority of the papers belonging to this strand of literature has focused on gender.
An exception is Besley et al. (2011), which focuses on the role of the education of politicians.
In the context of studying the political responses to an anti-tax evasion program, Casaburi
and Troiano (2014) show a negative correlation between the age of the politicians and tax
enforcement following the program.
   The second is a literature which has provided quasi-experimental evidence about the
political economy of local governments around the world. Thanks to the recent availability
of administrative microeconomic data, this literature has been rapidly growing, and many
recent papers deal with how Italian local governments function (for instance, among many
others, Gagliarducci and Nannicini (2013), Casaburi and Troiano (2014), Alesina and Para-
disi (2014), and Grembi, Nannicini, and Troiano (2014)).
    Finally, by showing that younger politicians are more likely to increase investments and



                                               2
attract more transfers before the elections, our contribution naturally fits in the political
business cycles literature. See, for example, Ben-Porath (1975), Rogoff and Sibert (1988),
Rogoff (1990), Alesina, Cohen, and Roubini (1997), Persson and Tabellini (2002), Drazen
and Eslava (2003), Akhmedov and Zhuravskaya (2004), Brender and Drazen (2005), Shi and
Svensson (2006), Brender and Drazen (2008).
        This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes our data and the institutional
settings of Italian local governments. Section 3 describes our methodology. Section 4 presents
our results, and the final section concludes.


2         Data and Institutional Framework
2.1        Institutional information
The Italian municipal government (Comune) is composed of a mayor (Sindaco), an exec-
utive committee (Giunta) appointed by the mayor, and an elected city council (Consiglio
Comunale) responsible, among other things, for authorizing the annual budget proposed
by the mayor. The mayor and the executive committee propose changes in policies, such
as reductions in the tax rates or expenditures. Subsequently, the city council votes on the
proposed modifications. Municipalities manage about 10 percent of total public expenditure
in Italy and are in charge of many public services, such as preschools, waste management,
municipal roads, and municipal public housing.
        The local expenditures are divided into two types: capital expenditures, which are all
of those expenditures related to “multi-year production factors, where amortization does
take place”, and current expenditures, which are those expenditures that relate only to the
current fiscal year. The electoral regulations of local governments were significantly reformed
in 1993, when a new law changed the mayoral electoral rule from party to individual ballot
and introduced a two-term limit. In 2000 the duration of the mayoral term was extended
from four to five years. Municipalities with more than 15,000 inhabitants adopt a runoff
system to elect mayors, while a single-round system is in place in cities with a population
below this threshold.2 The number of city councilors depends on the size of the municipality.3
    2
     Bordignon, Nannicini, and Tabellini (2013) study the effect of the electoral rules on policies, finding that
under runoff elections, the number of political candidates is larger, but the influence of extremist voters on
equilibrium policy is smaller.
   3
     The electoral rule for the city councilors also depends on the size of the municipality: in cities with fewer
than 15,000 inhabitants, two thirds of the seats are assigned to councilors in the mayoral coalition, while the


                                                        3
Each observation in our dataset represents a mayoral term.


2.2     Data and Descriptive Statistics
The main database for the analysis includes administrative data on municipal elections and
politicians from 1993 to 2010, provided by the Italian Department of the Interior (Min-
istero degli Interni). We complement this dataset with socio-economic and demographic
information about Italian municipalities from the National Statistical Office and data on fi-
nancial reports from the Italian Municipal Association. Table 1 presents summary statistics
for the entire sample: mayor-level characteristics, municipality-level characteristics, political
governance, re-election rates, and public finance outcomes.
    We include in the sample all observations with non-missing data on the electoral vote
count and the mayor’s age. This creates a sample of over 20,000 observations for each
municipality-term pair.4 Observations where the incumbent cannot be reelected because of
a binding term limit are excluded from the reelection outcomes. The average age of the
city councilors belonging to the mayor’s coalition is 42.6 years, and the average age of the
executive committee is about 44 years. On average, Italian mayors in our sample are about
48 years old.
    In Table 2 and Table 3 we split our sample in two parts: municipalities where the older
candidate won the election, and ones where the younger candidate won the election. We then
summarize mayor and municipality characteristics (Table 2) and outcomes (Table 3) in each
of these two subsamples. The average age of the older winning candidate (52) is 8.5 years
older than the average age of the younger winning candidate (43.5). The age difference is
slightly smaller than the standard deviation of the mayor’s age, which is 9.7. Older winning
candidates tend to have one year more of prior political experience and one half year less of
education. In addition, older winning candidates are about 2 percentage points less likely to
be female (baseline: 7 percent) and 9 percentage points more likely to be born in the city
in which they were elected (baseline: 54 percent). We are interested in studying whether
the age of the mayor affects the age of the other municipal administrators, the reelection
rest of the seats are assigned proportionally to the vote shares. In cities with more than 15,000 inhabitants,
every seat of the city council is assigned according to the proportional rule.
   4
     We were able to obtain data on Italian financial reports only from 1993 to 2007, and the dataset contains
some missing observations: this implies that our sample for the public finance outcomes is smaller. To limit
the potential impact of outliers, we winsorize the public finance variables at the 99 percent level. The results
are very similar without winsorizing those variables.



                                                       4
rates, and the implemented policies. Older winning candidates tend to have a slightly older
coalition and executive committee, and they tend to increase taxes and spending by a smaller
amount than younger winning candidates. Older winning candidates are also less likely to
run for reelection or to be reelected, conditional on the term limit not binding.


3     Empirical Strategy
Comparing the outcomes of municipalities governed by mayors of diverse ages would not allow
us to identify our effect of interest, because many other variables, not only observable but also
unobservable, are correlated with the age of the mayor. In Table 4 we correlate the age of the
mayor with many predetermined covariates, both mayor-specific and municipality-specific.
The age of the mayor is correlated with most of the individual- and municipality-specific
covariates we consider. For instance, older mayors are more likely to be conservative and are
more likely to govern cities characterized by an older demographic structure or with higher
income per capita. Those results suggest that relying only on cross-sectional variation in the
age of the politician would likely not yield our treatment effect of interest. Therefore, we rely
on three different identification strategies to alleviate the aforementioned concerns: fixed-
effects regression, conventional regression discontinuity design, and an augmented regression
discontinuity design. We describe those methods in the next three subsections.


3.1    Fixed-Effects Model
We begin our analysis by using a fixed-effects (FE) model of the form

                              Yjt = βAjt + δ 0 Zjt + ηj + γt + εjt ,

where Y is an outcome, A is the age of the mayor, and Z is a vector of mayor characteristics.
The letter j indexes municipalities and t indexes election years. The parameters ηj and γt
represent municipality fixed effects and election-year effects. The outcome Yjt is typically
measured over the term in office of the winner in municipality j and election year t. For
example, Yjt could be the change in total revenue from the beginning to the end of the term.
    The effect of age is identified using within-municipality variation in the mayor’s age across
mayoral terms. Our identifying assumption is that the mayor’s age is strictly exogenous with
respect to the time-varying municipality and mayor unobservables, εjt . This assumption will

                                                5
hold if Zjt contains all outcome-relevant mayor characteristics correlated with age, and the
municipality and election-year fixed effects absorb all unobserved municipality and tempo-
ral heterogeneity that is correlated with both outcomes and the age of the mayor. If the
identification assumptions are satisfied, then β represents the expected change in Y from
increasing the mayor’s age by one year, holding the controls constant.


3.2       Conventional Regression Discontinuity Design
A major concern with the fixed-effects model is that time-varying unobservables may be
correlated with both the outcomes and the mayor’s age. For example, a change in voter
preferences may drive changes in outcomes and in the age of the winning mayoral candidate.
Alternatively, the age distribution of the mayoral candidate pool may change as a result
of changes in policy outcomes, if the candidate’s decision to run for office as a function of
current policy differs by age.
       In order to address these concerns, we adopt a regression discontinuity (RD) design and
focus on close elections between mayoral candidates of different ages. The running variable,
X, is defined as the older candidate’s margin of victory, measured in percentage points.
The main intuition is that, for each close election involving two candidates of different ages,
whether the older candidate wins is as good as randomly assigned. Let D equal unity if the
older candidate wins, and zero otherwise. Adopting the potential outcomes framework, let
Yj denote the policy outcome in the event that the winning politician is j years old, where
j ∈ {1, 2, . . . , J}. In addition, let AD ∈ {1, 2, . . . , J} be the age of the winning politician
when the election outcome is D. The usual monotonicity condition is satisfied, because
by construction A1 > A0 for all elections.5 We adopt the standard notation for the left
and right limits of a conditional expectation at the cutoff: V + = limx→0+ E [V |X = x] and
V − = limx→0− E [V |X = x].
       In contrast to most RD designs, our setting involves variable treatment intensity, because
   5
    See Imbens and Angrist (1994) on the importance of the monotonicity of treatment take-up with respect
to an instrumental variable.




                                                   6
A can take more than two values.6 In the appendix we show that the estimand of interest,

                                                   Y+−Y−
                                             ρ=             ,                                            (1)
                                                   A + − A−

identifies a weighted average of causal effects of increasing the mayor’s age by one year,
where each weight depends on the relative likelihood of observing a specific pair of candidate
ages in close elections.7 As usual, the causal effects apply only to outcomes following close
elections.
    In practice we estimate the equations

                           Ajt = α + δDjt + P (Xjt ) + Djt · P (Xjt ) + νjt

                            Yjt = γ + ρAjt + P (Xjt ) + Djt · P (Xjt ) + ξjt                             (2)

using data from elections decided by a relatively narrow margin of victory. We estimate ρ
using the outcome of the election, Djt , as an instrument for the mayor’s age, and controlling
for polynomials in the margin of victory on each side of the vote threshold. We report several
specifications which cluster the standard errors at the municipality level. The approach
described above is equivalent to local polynomial regression using a uniform kernel (see
Hahn et al. 2001). We also report estimates of ρ using local polynomial regression and a
triangular kernel.


3.3     Partially Identified Regression Discontinuity
By focusing on close elections in which the outcome is virtually random, the RD design
alleviates the concern that municipality characteristics may drive both election outcomes
and policy. However, the validity of the RD design may be questioned if other policy-relevant
mayor characteristics are correlated with age. Recall that identification in the RD design
relies on the continuity at x = 0 of E [YA0 |X = x], the conditional expectation of the potential
    6
      Another RD design with variable treatment intensity is featured in Brollo, Nannicini, Perotti, and
Tabellini (2013), who study the impact of federal transfers to municipal governments in Brazil. Their setting
is a fuzzy RD design due to cases of misassignment of federal funds. In our case the design is sharp, because
A jumps deterministically from A0 to A1 across the threshold X = 0 in each election. In other words, every
election is a “complier.”
    7
      This result is obtained by combining the identification results of Hahn, Todd, and Van der Klaauw
(2001) and Angrist and Imbens (1995). It relies on the assumption that the conditional expectation of the
potential outcome in the event that the younger candidate wins, E [YA0 |X = x], is continuous at x = 0. See
the appendix for details, and see the next section for a strategy to address violations of this assumption.


                                                     7
outcome when the younger candidate wins.8 This assumption is violated if the conditional
distribution of relevant observed and unobserved mayor characteristics other than age jumps
at the threshold. Intuitively, if both average age and, say, average political experience are
discontinuous at the threshold, we risk conflating the effects of age and experience in our
estimation framework. Luckily, our set of mayor covariates is sufficiently rich that we are able
to control for the characteristics that are correlated with age and that seem most relevant
to policy ex ante. Important mayor characteristics include gender, political experience, and
education.9 These covariates, along with the indicator for whether the mayor was born in
the same city, tend to be discontinuous in expectation at the threshold, as our balance tests
will demonstrate. Therefore it is important to check the robustness of our RD estimates to
the inclusion of these covariates in the estimating equations.
      However, there may also be unobserved mayor characteristics whose distributions are
discontinuous at the threshold, preventing us from point-identifying the treatment effect.
For ease of exposition, consider the partially linear model,

                                      Y = γ + ρA + g(Z) + ε,

where Z is a vector of observed mayor characteristics, and ε contains unobserved mayor
characteristics that affect the outcome. If ε+ − ε− 6= 0, then ρ is not point-identifiable.10
However, if we assume that unobserved selection effects at the threshold are no larger than
observed selection effects at the threshold, then we can identify upper and lower bounds
for ρ. This is the approach of Altonji et al. (2005), who estimate bounds on the effect of
Catholic school education on student outcomes. The identified interval for ρ is derived un-
der the assumption that (ε+ − ε− ) is no larger than (g(Z)+ − g(Z)− ) in absolute value.
This assumption is most credible when Z contains all observable characteristics that are
unbalanced at the threshold, and when Z is believed to contain most policy-relevant charac-
teristics that are correlated with age. We estimate the bounds using local linear regression
and a second-order polynomial approximation to g(Z), and we obtain confidence intervals
for the identified interval using a bootstrap procedure proposed by Horowitz and Manski

  10
     This is because ε+ − ε− 6= 0 implies that E [YA0 |X = x] is discontinuous at x = 0.

4       Results
4.1       Balance Checks
In Figure 1 we verify the absence of manipulation in our running variable, via the test
introduced by McCrary (2008). The estimated discontinuity in the density of the running
variable is −0.001 with a standard deviation of 0.033. These results suggest that in a
close election between candidates of different ages, neither candidate has any opportunity to
manipulate the results of the election, and older (or younger) candidates are not more likely
to be elected during close, mixed-age elections.
      The RD identification strategy relies on the fact that the age of the mayor is on average
higher when the older candidate won the election than when the younger candidate won the
election. In Table 5 we test for discontinuities in mayor and municipality characteristics at
the margin-of-victory threshold. In close elections the winning older candidate is on average
8 years older than the winning younger candidate. The graphical results of Figure 2 imply
that the mayor’s average age in cities where the older candidate barely won is higher than
the average age of mayors where the older candidate barely lost.
      However, it is possible that candidates who won a close election against another candidate
of a different age may differ according to characteristics other than age. Table 5 shows
that four mayor covariates have statistically significant discontinuities at the threshold. In
close elections the older winning candidate has one year more of political experience in
appointments in the city administration and half a year less of education than the winning
younger candidate. The older winning candidate is also 2 percentage points less likely to
be female and 8 percentage points more likely to be born in the same city where he or she
governs. We take account of these four unbalanced covariates in the empirical analysis to
test the robustness of conventional RD estimates of the effect of the mayor’s age. It should
be noted that the economical significance of these confounding variables is much smaller
compared to that of the main variable of interest: age. Other important individual covariates
are balanced at the threshold, such as their poltical inclination (i.e. probability of belonging
 11
      See Tamer (2010) for an overview on conducting inference on partially identified parameters.

to the conservative party), whether the mayor is term-limited, past political experience (in
any appointment), and the number of rivals that the mayor faced in the electoral ballot.
Figure 3 presents plots of the mayor characteristics relative to the older candidate’s margin
of victory. Out of twelve municipality variables tested, none has a statistically significant
discontinuity at the threshold. Visual inspection of those variables in Figure 4 and Figure
5 also supports the balancedness of city-specific covariates. We conclude that municipality
characteristics are balanced around the threshold in close elections, consistent with previous
work on the regression discontinuity design in close elections.


4.2    The Effect of Age on Political Governance and Reelection
First we estimate the effect of the mayor’s age on political governance and reelection. In the
first panel of Table 6 we present estimates of the coefficient on age in the fixed-effects model,
both with and without controls for experience, gender, years of schooling, and whether the
mayor was born in the same city. An increase in the mayor’s age by one year is associated
with an increase in the average age of the mayor’s coalition and executive committee by 0.12
years and 0.02 years, respectively. Put another way, a one standard deviation increase
in the mayor’s age (9.7 years) is associated with an increase in the average age of the
mayor’s coalition and executive committee by 3 percent and 0.4 percent relative to their
respective means. Additionally, a one-year increase in age reduces the mayor’s probability of
running again for office by 0.9 percentage points and reduces the probability of reelection by
1 percentage point, conditional on not being term limited. This means that a one standard
deviation increase in the mayor’s age reduces the probability of running again by 14 percent
and reduces the probability of reelection by 19 percent relative to their respective means.
All of the fixed-effects estimates are statistically significant at least at the 5 percent level.
Overall the coefficient estimates seem not to be sensitive to the inclusion of controls for
other mayor characteristics. The treatment effects are similar when scaled by the average
difference in age between the winning older candidate and the winning younger candidate in
close elections (8 years).
   The second and third panels of Table 6 present conventional regression discontinuity
estimates of the effect of the mayor’s age on political governance and reelection outcomes.
The estimates in both panels use the optimal bandwidth selected according to the procedure
of Calonico, Cattaneo, and Titiunik (2014a,b). The second panel presents estimates of ρ from


                                               10
the model in (2), using the outcome of the election as an instrument for the mayor’s age and
controlling for first- or second-order polynomials in the margin of victory on each side of the
threshold. The standard errors in the second panel are clustered at the municipality level.
The third panel presents bias-corrected estimates using the robust RD estimator in Calonico
et al. (2014b). The estimates are very similar across the two panels. Interpreting ρ in (2) as
a structural parameter,12 a one-year increase in age causes an increase of 0.12 years in the
average age of the coalition and an increase of 0.04 years in the average age of the executive
committee. In other words a one standard deviation increase in the mayor’s age increases
the average age of the coalition and the average age of the executive by 3 percent and 0.9
percent relative to their respective means. Additionally, a one-year increase in age reduces the
mayor’s probability of running again by 0.7 percentage points and reduces the probability of
reelection by 1 percentage point, conditional on not being term limited. Thus a one standard
deviation increase in the mayor’s age reduces the probability of running again by 11 percent
and reduces the probability of reelection by 21 percent relative to their respective means.
The effects of the mayor’s age on the age of the coalition, the probability of running again,
and the probability of reelection are statistically significant in all specifications. The effect
on the age of the executive committee tends to be statistically insignificant. As usual, all of
the RD estimates are externally valid only for mayoral terms following close elections.


4.3     The Effect of Age on Revenue and Expenditure
Next we look at the effect of the mayor’s age on average revenue and expenditure over the
term, both measured in euros per capita. The first panel of the Table 7 presents estimates
of the coefficient on age in the fixed-effects model, both with and without controls for mayor
characteristics. The second and third panels of Table 7 present conventional regression
discontinuity estimates of the effect of the mayor’s age on revenue and expenditure. Of the
18 point estimates presented in the table, only one is significant at the 10 percent level. In
addition, the absolute magnitudes of the estimates are economically modest.13
  12
     I.e., assuming a linear relationship between the outcome and age. See, however, the nonparametric
identification result in the appendix for a more nuanced interpretation of the RD estimand.
  13
     The fixed-effects estimates suggest that a one-year increase in the mayor’s age increases average revenue
by 65 cents per capita, increases average capital expenditure by 45 cents per capita, and reduces average
current expenditure by 18 cents per capita. This means that a one standard deviation increase in the mayor’s
age increases average revenue by 0.5 percent, increases average capital expenditure by 0.8 percent, and reduces
average current expenditure by 0.3 percent, all relative to their respective means. These estimates are all
statistically insignificant.


                                                      11
   As shown in the second and third panels, the signs of the RD estimates are in general
sensitive to the order of the local polynomial as well as the kernel used. The effect of a
one-year increase in age on average revenue ranges from −1 to almost 7 euros per capita, the
effect on average capital expenditure ranges from −1 to 2 euros per capita, and the effect
on average current expenditure ranges from −36 cents to 3 euros per capita. Therefore the
effect of a one standard deviation increase in age on revenue ranges from −1 percent to 5
percent, the effect on capital expenditure ranges from −3 percent to 4 percent, and the effect
on current expenditure ranges from −0.5 percent to 4 percent, relative to their respective
means.
   Overall, there is no evidence that older and younger mayors collect different amounts
of revenue or have different expenditure levels on average. Those results are confirmed by
visual inspection of Figure 7. In light of this result, it may appear puzzling why younger
mayors are more likely to get reelected.


4.4      The Effect of Age on Political Budget Cycles
Motivated by the literature on political budget cycles and their effects on reelection, we
test whether the mayor’s age affects the cyclicality of revenue and expenditure relative to
the electoral cycle. The estimates are presented in Table 8. The revenue and expenditure
variables are measured in terms of their change from the beginning of the term to the end
of the term, in euros per capita. The fixed-effects estimates in the first panel show that a
one-year increase in the mayor’s age decreases the change in revenue by 4 euros per capita,
decreases the change in capital expenditure by 3 euros per capita, and decreases the change
in current expenditure by 35 cents per capita. In other words a one standard deviation
increase in age decreases the change in revenue by 36 percent, decreases the change in
capital expenditure by 22 percent, and decreases the change in current expenditure by 9
percent, relative to their respective means. All of the fixed-effects estimates are statistically
at conventional levels.
   The regression discontinuity estimates in the second and third panels indicate that an
increase in the mayor’s age by one year reduces the change in capital expenditure over the
term by roughly 9 euros per capita. This means that a one standard deviation increase in
age reduces the change in capital expenditure by 79 percent relative to its mean. The effect
of age on the change in revenue is almost identical. That is, younger mayors increase capital


                                               12
expenditure at the end of the term relative to the beginning of the term by a larger amount
than older mayors, and they increase revenue over the term to pay for the extra expenditure.
These estimates are statistically significant in all specifications, usually at least at the 5
percent level. The RD estimates of the effect of the mayor’s age on the cyclicality of current
expenditure are very small and statistically insignificant. To determine the composition
of the revenue change over the mayor’s term, we disaggregate revenue into tax revenue,
transfer revenue, and non-tax revenue. Table 9 presents estimates for these different revenue
categories. It is clear from the RD estimates in the second and third panels that an increase
the transfers from higher levels of government is driving the increase in total revenue. These
results are visually confirmed in Figures 8 and 9.


4.5    The Effect of Political Budget Cycles on Reelection
Two of our main findings are that younger mayors increase investment right before the
election by a greater amount than older mayors, and younger mayors are more likely to
get reelected than older mayors. Do younger mayors have a higher probability of reelection
because they strategically increase spending right before the election, thus fooling voters?
This is a difficult question to answer, because spending decisions are endogenous, and may
be correlated, among many other things, with the expectations of reelection. For instance,
mayors who feel sure about their reelection may be less prone to political budget cycles, and
mayors who feel less sure about their reelection may be more prone to cycles. Nonetheless, we
can check for suggestive evidence supporting the hypothesis that strategic spending increases
tend to raise the likelihood of reelection. Table 10 presents regression estimates of the partial
correlation between the change in capital expenditure and the reelection outcome. Estimates
are reported with and without the use of fixed effects and controls for the mayor’s age,
experience, gender, years of schooling, and for whether the mayor was born in the same
city. For the sake of readability the independent variable is now measured as the change in
capital expenditure in hundreds of euros per capita. The first panel reports estimates using
the entire sample, and the second panel reports estimates using mayoral terms following a
“close” election (smaller than 10 percentage point margin of victory). The most credible
estimates are likely those that use both mayor controls and fixed effects—the last column in
the table. These estimates indicate that an increase of one hundred euros in the change in
capital expenditure is associated with an increase in the reelection probability by between


                                               13
0.4 and 0.7 percentage points (baseline: 52 percent). All of the estimates are statistically
significant at least at the 5 percent level. While suggestive that younger mayors’ strategic
spending decisions may contribute to their higher rate of reelection, these estimates should
not be interpreted as causal and the magnitudes may be biased either upward or downward.
Moreover, mayors that strategically increase spending before the election may exert more
effort towards reelection in other dimensions.


4.6       Partially Identified Regression Discontinuity
Table 11 presents estimates of the interval for ρ identified under the assumption that selection
on mayor unobservables at the threshold is no greater than selection on mayor observables at
the threshold.14 The term which accounts for discontinuities in mayor characteristics at the
threshold (described in the appendix) approximates g(Z) with a second-order polynomial in
experience, education, gender, and whether the mayor was born in the same city. Left and
right limits of conditional expectations are estimated by local polynomial regression of order
one or two, as indicated. The estimators use the optimal bandwidth for the point estimator
of ρ according to the bandwidth selector of Calonico et al. (2014b). Confidence intervals are
calculated by a bootstrap procedure (described in the appendix) using 200 repetitions. The
estimated intervals are quite tight, and the bounds are very similar to the conventional point
estimates already reported. The intervals for the effects on our main outcomes—average
age of the coalition, political cycles in total revenue, political cycles in capital expenditure,
whether the mayor ran again, and whether the mayor was reelected—exclude zero with at
least 90 percent confidence for both first-order and second-order polynomial specifications.
It bears repeating that the estimated intervals allow all four unbalanced mayor covariates
to influence the outcomes in a flexible manner, and they permit selection on unobservables
at the threshold to be as large as selection on observables at the threshold. Therefore the
interval estimates should be viewed as highly conservative. The broad similarity between
the interval estimates and the conventional estimates provides strong evidence that the
conventional estimates of the effect of the mayor’s age are not driven by other characteristics
correlated with age.

4.7    Other Robustness Checks
In the online appendix we present results from a series of robustness checks. Tables A.3
and A.4 show that the main results for political and budget policy outcomes are robust to
using a different bandwidth selector (Imbens and Kalyanaraman 2012), using a third-order
polynomial and the entire sample, including mayor controls directly in the RD regression
equation, and using a reduced-form RD estimand. Table A.6 presents RD interval estimates
for the different revenue categories, providing supporting evidence that the differential rev-
enue policies of younger and older mayors is driven by transfer revenue.


5     Conclusion
To the best of our knowledge this is the first paper to study the role of a politician’s age in
determining their policy choices. Using data from local elections in Italy and with regression
discontinuity approaches we find that younger politicians are more likely to engage in political
budget cycles of the following type: they spend more in preelection years and finance this
extra spending with increased transfers from higher levels of government. We attribute this
effect to stronger career concerns incentives. We also show that these political budget cycles
are successful in terms of reelection: the larger their size the more likely it is that the mayor
is reelected.

     Notes: Panel estimates use municipality and year-of-election fixed effects and standard errors clustered by municipality. Panel estimates are reported with and without
     controls for the mayor’s experience, gender, and years of schooling, and for whether the mayor was born in the same city (as indicated). Conventional RD estimates are
     obtained by local polynomial IV regression using old as an instrument for age, clustering standard errors by municipality. A uniform kernel is used and the polynomial is
     first-order or second-order, as indicated. The bandwidth is chosen using the Calonico, Cattaneo, and Titiunik (2014) bandwidth selector. Robust RD estimates are obtained
     by the estimation procedure of Calonico, Cattaneo, and Titiunik (2014) using a triangular kernel. Observations where the incumbent cannot be reelected because of a
     binding term limit are excluded from the reelection outcomes. See Table A.2 for variable definitions.

Notes: Panel estimates use municipality and year-of-election fixed effects and standard errors clustered by municipality.
Panel estimates are reported with and without controls for the mayor’s experience, gender, and years of schooling, and for
whether the mayor was born in the same city (as indicated). Conventional RD estimates are obtained by local polynomial
IV regression using old as an instrument for age, clustering standard errors by municipality. A uniform kernel is used and
the polynomial is first-order or second-order, as indicated. The bandwidth is chosen using the Calonico, Cattaneo, and
Titiunik (2014) bandwidth selector. Robust RD estimates are obtained by the estimation procedure of Calonico, Cattaneo,
and Titiunik (2014) using a triangular kernel. See Table A.2 for variable definitions.

Notes: The sample is restricted to mayoral terms in which the term limit is not binding. Results are reported with and
without controls for the mayor’s age, experience, gender, and years of schooling, and for whether the mayor was born in
the same city (as indicated). The equations in the first two columns are estimated by OLS, and the equations in the last
two columns are estimated using municipality and year-of-election fixed effects. In the second panel the sample is further
restricted to mayoral terms in which the mayor was elected by a narrow margin of victory (smaller than 10 percentage
points). For the sake of readability, ∆ Cap. exp. is measured in hundreds of euros per capita. Standard errors are clustered
by municipality. Observations where the incumbent cannot be reelected because of a binding term limit are excluded from
the reelection outcomes. See Table A.2 for variable definitions.

     Notes: RD interval estimates approximate the function g(Z), described in the text, with a second-order polynomial in experience, education, gender, and whether the
     mayor was born in the same city. Left and right limits of conditional expectations are estimated by local polynomial regression of order one or two, as indicated above.
     The estimators use the optimal bandwidth for the point estimator of the treatment effect according to the bandwidth selector of Calonico, Cattaneo, and Titiunik (2014).
     Confidence sets for the interval estimates are calculated by a bootstrap procedure (described in the appendix) using 200 repetitions. Observations where the incumbent
     cannot be reelected because of a binding term limit are excluded from the reelection outcomes. See Table A.2 for variable definitions.

Notes: The first panel presents estimates by local linear IV regression, clustering standard errors by municipality. The
bandwidth is chosen using the Imbens and Kalyanaraman (2012) bandwidth selector. Estimates in the second panel are
obtained by third-order polynomial IV regression using the entire sample. Standard errors are clustered by municipality.
Estimates in the third panel are obtained by local linear IV regression, controlling for unbalanced mayor covariates: experience,
gender, education, and whether the mayor was born in the same city. The bandwidth is chosen using the Calonico, Cattaneo,

procedure of Calonico, Cattaneo, and Titiunik (2014) using a triangular kernel. Observations where the incumbent cannot be
reelected because of a binding term limit are excluded from the reelection outcomes. See Table A.2 for variable definitions.

     Notes: RD interval estimates approximate the function g(Z), described in the text, with a second-order polynomial in experience, education, gender, and whether the
     mayor was born in the same city. Left and right limits of conditional expectations are estimated by local polynomial regression of order one or two, as indicated above.
     The estimators use the optimal bandwidth for the point estimator of the treatment effect according to the bandwidth selector of Calonico, Cattaneo, and Titiunik (2014).
     Confidence sets for the interval estimates are calculated by a bootstrap procedure (described in the appendix) using 200 repetitions. See Table A.2 for variable definitions.

A.1         Econometric Details
A.1.1       Nonparametric Identification

In the absence of selection effects at the threshold, we can nonparametrically identify an
average causal response (ACR) at the threshold by combining the identification results of
Angrist and Imbens (1995) and Hahn et al. (2001). Heuristically, we start with an identifica-
tion result for the IV estimator based on a multivalued treatment variable and a dichotomous
instrumental variable. We then condition on the running variable and take left and right
limits with respect to the running variable.
       Let Y denote the observed outcome, let A denote the winning candidate’s age, let X
(the running variable) denote the older candidate’s margin of victory, and let D be an
indicator equal to unity if the older candidate wins. Let Yj denote the policy outcome in
the event that the winning politician is j years old, where j ∈ {1, 2, . . . , J}. In addition, let
AD ∈ {1, 2, . . . , J} be the age of the winning politician, conditional on the election outcome,
D. Using monotonicity (A1 > A0 ) and continuity of E [YA0 |X = x] at x = 0, it follows that15

The parameter ρ is a weighted average of causal responses to a unit change in the politician’s
age (treatment), for those elections whose treatment status is affected by the instrument D
at the threshold. We focus on elections in which the first- and second-place candidates have
different ages, so that D always affects the treatment status. Thus, the causal effect of
increasing the winning candidate’s age from j − 1 to j is simply weighted by the relative
likelihood of viewing an election in which the older contender is at least j years old and the
younger contender is no more than j − 1 years old, conditional on the election being close.
       In our application we worry that the expected potential policy outcome when the younger
politician wins is discontinuous at the threshold, because expected politician observables such
as experience, education, gender and place of birth are discontinuous at the threshold. In

that case we have
                     PJ
      Y+−Y−            j=1   E [Yj − Yj−1 |A1 ≥ j > A0 , X = 0] P (A1 ≥ j > A0 |X = 0) + ∆
              =                            PJ                                              ,
      A+ − A−                                 k=1 P (A1 ≥ k > A0 |X = 0)

      where ∆ = lim+ E [YA0 |X = x] − lim− E [YA0 |X = x] .
                     x→0                    x→0


Now ρ is not identifiable because ∆ 6= 0. The expected outcome holding the politician’s
age constant at A0 is discontinuous at the threshold, because the conditional distributions
of relevant observables (experience, gender, education, place of birth) and unobservables are
discontinuous at the threshold. If we could point-identify ∆, then ρ would be identifiable
and

                                         Y+−Y−−∆
                                                   = ρ.
                                          A + − A−

However, because ∆ depends in part on selection on unobservables, it is not identifiable.
With additional assumptions we can identify an interval that contains ρ. Decompose ∆ in
the following way:

                                            ∆ = Ω + C,

where Ω is the effect of selection on unobservables, and C is the effect of selection on ob-
servables. If we account for “enough” observable characteristics in C, then it is reasonable
to make the following assumption.

Assume:    |Ω| ≤ |C| .

This is akin to the assumption in Altonji et al. (2005) that selection on unobservables is
no larger than selection on observables. The main difference is that our assumption applies
only to unobservable selection effects at the threshold (X = 0). The assumption allows us
to bound ∆:
                                         
                                         [0, 2C] if C ≥ 0
                                      ∆∈
                                         [2C, 0] if C < 0.




                                                  45
These bounds lead to the partial identification result,

                                       Y − Y − − 2C Y + − Y −
                                      +                          

                                       A+ − A−          A + − A−

Given that C is an estimable function of observed variables, we now have estimable bounds
for the treatment effect.

A.1.2       Semiparametric Partial Identification

In order to estimate the identified interval, we first need an explicit expression for C. For sim-
plicity we use a partially linear model in which age enters linearly and politician observables,
denoted by Z, enter in a possibly nonlinear manner:16

                                        Y = γ + ρA + g(Z) + ε.

We assume that g(Z) can be well-approximated by a second-order polynomial, denoted by
β 0 W , where W is a function of Z. For example, if Z = (z1 , z2 )0 , then W = (z1 , z2 , z1 ·
z2 , z12 , z22 )0 . Now the model can be written as

                                       Y = γ + ρA + β 0 W + ε.

       Because we know that E [W |X = x] is discontinuous at x = 0, we worry that E [ε|X = x]
is also discontinuous at x = 0. Taking conditional expectations and limits, we have

              Y + − Y − = ρ A + − A− + β 0 W + − W − + ε + − ε − ,

                                                                                

                          (A − A− )

As before, we assume that selection on unobservables at the threshold is no larger than
selection on observables at the threshold.

               ε+ − ε− ≤ β 0 W + − W −

Assume:
  16
    Note that we are only interested in identifying treatment effects locally around X = 0, and that the true
equation is approximately linear in a small enough neighborhood around X = 0.

Let C = β 0 (W + − W − ). Then ρ belongs to one of two possible intervals, depending on the
sign of C:

A.1.3     Estimation

We can estimate Y + , Y − , A+ , A− , W + , and W − using local polynomial regression. The
coefficients β can be estimated by OLS using observations in a neighborhood of the threshold
demarcated by the bandwidth h. The estimator for C is
                                       
                               0 c+   −
                         C = β̂ W − W
                         b          c     ,


                                             1 [−h < Xi < h] (Yi − γ − ρAi − β0 Wi )2 .
                                        X
                where β̂ = arg min
                                γ,ρ,β
                                         i


The resulting estimator is an interval whose endpoints are the lower- and upper-bound
estimates of ρ: [ρ̂L , ρ̂U ].

A.1.4     Inference

We use the bootstrap procedure of Horowitz and Manski (2000) to obtain confidence intervals
for [ρ̂L , ρ̂U ]. For each bootstrap sample we calculate an interval [ρ̂∗L , ρ̂∗U ]. The bootstrap 1 − α
confidence interval for [ρ̂L , ρ̂U ] is the interval [ρ̂L − zα∗ , ρ̂U + zα∗ ], where zα∗ is the smallest
number such that at least 1 − α percent of the bootstrap intervals are contained within the
confidence interval. The confidence intervals are calculated using 200 bootstrap repetitions.
