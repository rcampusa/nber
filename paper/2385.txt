         The production smoothing model of inventories
                                                            suggests that firms hold
   inventories mainly to smooth production in the face of
                                                                random fluctuations in
   demand. It is well known,
                                 however, that some stylized
                                                                facts appear to be
   inconsistent with both the
                                 spirit and the letter of the
                                                                model. One such fact is
   that in virtually all
                           manufacturing industries, the
                                                            variability of production is
   greater than that of shipments
                                       (Blanchard (1983), Blinder (l986a), West (1986)).
  A second fact is that
                           inventories tend to be
                                                    accumulated when demand is high and
  decumulated when demand is
                                low, precisely the Opposite of the pattern predicted
  by the production smoothing
                                 model (Blinder (l986a),
                                                            Summers (1981)).
       All the studies just cited
                                       assume that physical inventories are the only
  buffer between demand and
                           production. Backlogs of unfilled orders, however,
 might also serve as buffers.
                               They might be built up when demand is high and
 drawn down when demand is
                           low. If so, studies that
                                                     ignore backlogs may be
 mis leading.

      Indeed, in the presence of
                                    backlogs, the anomalous stylized
                                                                         facts probably
 are not even directly relevant
                                   to at least some versions of the production
 smoothing model. As initially stated
                                            (Holt et al. (1961)) and
                                                                       recently
 generalized (Blinder (1982)), the model does not impose
                                                              a nonnegativity condition
on inventories. If demand is
                                 too high, orders are put on a backlog. Backlogged
orders are implicitly
                         considered negative inventories.     If the model is taken
literally, the implication is that
                                        empirical studies should follow Holt et al.
(1961) and Beisley (1969) and use "nett' inventories, i.e.,
                                                            physical inventories
minus backlogs. If
                       backlogs are substantial, the bias
                                                             from using physical rather
than net inventories
                       may be large.

     This paper considers the
                             anomalous stylized facts for some industries where
backlogs in fact are large. it
                               assumes a model like that in Holt et al. (1961),

 11. The Model and Tests

         The empirical work requires data on backlogs. The Department of Commerce

 only collects such data for what are called "production to order" industries.

 The model used will therefore be one that is appropriate for such industries.

         These are industries in which orders ordinarily arrive before production is

 completed. Storage costs for the finished product tend to be
                                                                  relatively large
and the product line fairly heterogeneous (Abramovitz (1950), Zarnowitz (1973)).

According to Belsley (1969), most two digit industries produce primarily to

order, including virtually all durable goods industries.      Backlogs tend to be

substantial, relative either to shipments or to physical inventories.      This is

illustrated for aggregate durables in Figure 1, which plots backlogs, shipments,

and two measures of inventories, finished goods and the sum of finished goods and

works in progress. The backlog to shipment ratio, or the (backlog -      physical
inventories) to shipment ratio, suggests that customers typically wait anywhere

from one to five months for shipment.

        Let     be production, I, physical inventories, St shipments, Bt backlogs

(unfilled orders) and       new orders. The variables are linked by the identities

              Nt=St+Bt,

      is the net inventory stock, physical inventories minus unfilled orders.
                                  4

       The model I will use, which is developed in detail in the appendix, is a

slightly modified version of the one in Belsley (1969). The representative firm

minimizes the expected present discounted value of costs,

period costs C are

The u1 are zero mean, white noise cost shocks. Apart, perhaps, from these

shocks, the first two terms are standard.      The cost of changing production,

                 represents, for example, hiring and    firing   costs. The production

cost, a1(Qt+u2t)2, can    be   considered a Taylor series approximation to a concave

cost function.

order firm. It balances two costs. The first is a cost of having a lengthy

delivery period (bad customer relations,

rate of production        this   cost increases with _Ht (back1ogsphySiCal

 inventories): the bigger the backlog or the smaller the stock of physical

 inventories, the lengthier the delivery period.        The second is a cost of having

 to rush production (inefficient scheduling
                                                of batch production runs, etc.) Given

       this cost decreases with _Ht: the bigger the backlog or the smaller the stock

 of physical inventories, the greater the flexibility in scheduling production.
                                                         (1969) for further discussion.
 See Holt et al. (1961), Childs (1967) and Beisley

 It should be noted that all the tests in this paper are robust to the possibility
                                        5

      that a3=O, in which case the model is similar to that in Blinder (1982).

           I will consider two empirical
                                               implications of the model. The first concerns
  production variability. The model implies that net inventories are used
                                                                          to
  buffer new orders. If variables
                                  are stationary around trend, this suggests



  (4)            0    var(N)-var(Q),



  where ttvartl is an unconditional variance.
                                                      Inequality (4) follows under a variety
  of assumptions about market structure and
                                                     demand, as long as any effects of net
 inventories on demand are captured by the a2(.) term in (2). In
                                                                 particular, (4)
 is implied even if prices adjust in
                                     response to demand fluctuations. See West
 (1986) and the appendix for a precise argument.1

         If the variables are not
                                       stationary, var(N) and var(Q) do not exist. Related
 literature suggests that empirical tests that nonetheless assume that
                                                                       they exist
 may be seriously misleading (Fuller (1976), Marsh and Merton (1986)). By

 continuity, this also may be true in a given finite sample, if the variables are

nearly nonstationary. The data used here in fact appear to be nonstationary or

nearly so, even after growth is removed.

        Even if the data have unit roots,
                                                     is stationary. Since
                                                                            QtNt-AHt, Nt
and       are cointegrated (Engle and Granger (1987)), and a slightly more

cumbersome restatement of (4) is valid.            We have Qt=Nt-H, so N_Q=_2NtHt_AH.
Let "coy" denote an unconditional
                                            covariance. Under fairly general statistical
conditions, cov(N,AH) exists, even if Nt has a unit root (e.g., if (Nt,H)
follows a finite parameter ARMA
                                       process; see Fuller (1976) and West (1987)).
Whether or not there are unit roots, then, one can          test

high, accumulated when demand is low. Note, however, that cov(Nt,AHt)<O

                                    for (4) and (5). Since, as we shall see, (4) and

                                                                          and (6)

  The disturbance u is a linear combination of the cost shocks
                  t                                                  uit,    1=1 to 3. The

  the .    in   a complicated way. The exact formulas are not of interest, except

  perhaps to note that p2 is zero of the cost of changing production
                                                                             a0 is zero.
  Parameter estimates are consistent
                                          even if the variables have unit roots

  Stock and Watson (1986)).

  u are uncorrelated, one can estimate not only (6) but (7) as well by least

 squares. One can then trace out an impulse
                                                   response function, for how production
 and net inventories respond to a demand shock
                                                    Vt: aH/av=&0, aQ/l÷0,
                            etc. The model suggests that       will be drawn down in
 response to a positive demand shock

 meet the increased demand.



 XII. Empirical Results

 A. Data

     The data were monthly and
                                   seasonally adjusted, 1967-1984. (Data that are
not seasonally adjusted might be preferable (Miron and Zeldes (1986)) but
                                                                          are not
available for backlogs.) Nominal
                                        backlog data were conveniently available from
CITIBASE for aggregate durables and six two digit manufacturing industries:

stone, clay and glass (SIC 32), primary
                                             metals (SIC 33), fabricated metals (SIC
34), non-electrical machinery (SIC
                                        35), electrical machinery (SIC 36),
transportation equipment (SIC 37), and instruments (SIC 38). BEA constant (1972)

dollar inventory data on finished goods and works in progress inventories and

shipments were kindly supplied by Jeff Miron. Inventory data were converted
                                                                            from

(Appendix I in Foss et al. (1980)) suggests

firms value the entire backlog at current delivery prices. Real backlogs were

by the ratio of (nominal shipments/real

                                       suggests possible nonstationarity of the

                              appears in equation (5) was calculated

                              consistent with a comment in Blinder (1986a)

suggesting that inventories tend not to Granger cause sales.

     Table 1 contains point estimates
                                          of the right hand sides of (4) and (5) when
net inventories     finished goods inventories -   backlogs, Table 2 when net
inventories =   finished   goods + works in progress -
                                                          backlogs.   Units are billions
of 1972 dollars, squared. As may be seen, the production variance is less
                                                                           than
the new order variance, in all
                               specifications except instruments (columns (4) and
(6)).2 As in Blinder
                      (l986a), however, the production variance is almost always
                              10

greater than the shipment variance (columns (5) and (7)).

     Since column (4) is less than one and column (6) is positive, it follows

that cov(Nt,AHt)<O. Net inventories therefore on average are accumulated during

expansions, decumulated during contractions.    This is illustrated in Figure 2,

which plots detrended aggregate durables data, for net inventories =          finished

goods + works in progress -   backlog.   The tendency for H to be built up when N is

low, to be drawn down when N is high, is quite apparent.         The plots of B and

works in progress + finished goods inventories indicate that the theoretically

predicted pattern of fluctuations for H essentially reflects procyclical

accumulation of backlogs but not countercyclical accumulation of physical

inventories. It is worth noting that while the model does not formally determine

a level of inventories separate from that of backlogs, the actual inventory

behavior probably is consistent with production smoothing behavior in production

to order industries. Abramowitz (1950) and Belsley (1969) suggest that finished

goods inventories, at least, are built up in part because of unavoidable delays

in transit. One might therefore expect inventories to be built up when shipments

are high.

     Additional evidence on the role of net inventories in buffering production

may be found in the impulse response functions in Table 3. The functions are

 calculated from estimates of equations (6) and (7). (These estimates are

 available on request. Regression estimates and impulse response functions were

 also calculated for net inventories =    finished   good -   backlogs,   but are not

 reported because they were quite similar to those in Table 3.) Since the period

 is a month, the entry for period 12 indicates the response one year after the

 shock, for 24 two years after, and so on.

      The estimates indicate that from 40 to 80 percent of the initial impact of a

 demand shock is absorbed by net inventories, with production adjusting gradually.

   Figure 3 contains a plot for the
                                        aggregate durables entry in Table 3. Production
  is built up gradually to meet the increased demand. If the data
                                                                   are stationary,
  all variables return to their steady state levels, with production

  increased demand

  Note, however, that the return is
                                        painfully slow, indicating the borderline
  nonstationary behavior of inventories and
                                                  new orders. In fact, the roots of (1-

  for two data sets (fabricated metals
                                       and transportation).
       Figure 4 contains the comparable plot for a shock to shipments, when

 physical inventories alone are assumed to
                                                 buffer production. Little buffering is
 evident.

      A production smoothing model is qualitatively consistent with some
                                                                          aggregate
 data when it is assumed that net
                                  inventories (physical inventories minus
 backlogs), rather than physical inventories,
                                                   buffer production. The variance of
 production is less than that of
                                   new orders, so production is smoother than
demand. The covariance of new orders and        investment    in net inventories is
negative, so that net inventories are accumulated
                                                           during contractions,
decumulated during expansions. A positive shock to new orders is buffered
                                                                           by net
inventories, so that production rises
                                      only gradually to meet increases in demand.
     These results are in no sense definitive.
                                                      The model that I used assumed
rather implausibly that backlogs are negative inventories. No standard
                                                                       errors
were calculated in any of the tests. The data
                                                     were purely for production to
order industries.

     One therefore cannot jump to the
                                            conclusion that production smoothing is the
major determinant of both backlogs and      inventories.     Nonetheless, in conjunction

behavior (Kahn (1986), Maccini (1973)). Empirical

(1961) seminal research has found an important role for backlogs; recent

contributions include Blinder (l986b) and Maccini and Rossana (1984). Large and

volatile backlogs are perhaps more pervasive than many researchers, including

myself (West (1986)) have assumed: of the six two digit manufacturing industries

classified by Belsley (1969) as production to stock, two (apparel [SIC 23] and

chemicals [SIC 281) in fact are or have become largely production to order (Foss

et al. (1980, pplS8)).

 l.Technically, this requires a3=O and no cost shocks.     If, say, the penalty for
having a large backlog is prohibitive, demand shocks
                                                         may be passed directly to
production. In addition, if costs
                                    vary stochastically, the firm will tend to
produce a relatively large amount when Costs are low, thereby inducing extra

variability in production. The spirit of the model, however, is that the primary

role of net inventories is to buffer production from demand. It therefore seems

reasonable to expect (4) to hold, even if a3O and there are cost shocks.

2.The only reason the entries for var(N) and var(S) are different in the two

tables is the slightly different estimates of growth rates.

Appendix
                                       details and empirical results omitted
    This appendix contains algebraic

from the paper to save space. It has three parts:

I. Algebraic details on the model

II. Second moments for aggregate durables, under different growth rates and

different deflator (Table Al)

III. Estimates of equations (6) and (7)   (Table A2)
                                             -A2 -


 I.   Algebraic details on the model

        This considers (A)derivation of (4) and (5); (B)accounting for growth;

 and (C)derivatjon of (7).

 (A)Let Pt be the real price of output. The firm maximizes




 (Al)          max
                       Zbt(ptNt_Ct)
                      t=o




For simplicity it is assumed that the firms gets revenue when an order is

placed, rather than when it is shipped.

        Let C be as in (3), with a3u0u1=u2=O. Assume that all variables

have zero mean. (See West (1986) for why this is an innocuous assumption.)

Let         be the value of (Al), under the optimal policy. Consider an

1ternative policy in which QNt and HO for all t.              Costs C thus are
a0(AN)2 +      a1(N)2.       Under the assumption that all effects of net backlogs on

demand are adequately captured by the cost function, it will still be feasible

to obtain revenue pN under this alternative policy. Let              be the expected

present discounted value of cash flows under this alternative,




                 =
                     EoZbt(ptNtC).

Since the policy actually followed is assumed optimal, we have



(A2) V0
        A      *
              V0 => 0
                                 tA
                            E0 Zb (Ct-Ce)
                        =
                            E0 Ebta0(AN_Q) + E0 Zbta1(N_Q) - E0 Zbta2H
                                              -A3-




The third term is nonnegative by construction, since it is the expectation of

a sum of nonnegative random variables. A necessary condition for (A2), then,

is that




(A3)       0       E0 Zbta0(AN_AQ) + E0 Xbta1(N_Q)

           0       EZbta0(AN_AQ) + EZbta1(N_Q)
               =   (l-b)1[        a0[var(AN)-var(AQ)] +   a1E(N-Q)   I




The first implication follows from the law of iterated expectations, since,

under the assumption that at most one difference is required to induce

stationarity, each term in each infinite sum has a finite unconditional

expectation.

       In versions of the model in which 80=0 (e.g., Blinder (l986a)), equations

(4) and (5) follow from (A3). If a00 (e.g., Belsley (1969)), (4) and (5)

follow if 0<var(AN)-var(AQ). Although not reported in the paper, the sample

variances of N and AQ obeyed this inequality for all eight data sets.

(B)As stated in the text, the data actually used in the regressions were

scaled by a growth rate of (l+g)t. It is assumed that b(l+g)<l. In

explaining how this fits into the model, it is convenient to call h,                 and

   the original data in levels and H,                and Nt the scaled data (e.g.,

Hh/(l+g)t). The full cost function, including deterministic terms, is



                   =        +               + c1(q_m1) + c2(_h_a3q_m2)

                       + a0(Aq_m0) + a1(q_m1) + a2(_h_a3q_m2)

 deterministically, c.=(l+g)tc,.

It follows from algebra in part (C) below that if Nt is stationary in levels

or some difference, then so is Ht. Thus, if Nt grows at rate l+g, so does Ht.

(C)Call A1 and A2 the two smallest (in modulus) roots to the fourth degree

(A5) lag polynomial in Ht. The comparable polynomial in (A6) has roots
                                                 and l/[b(l+g)A2]. So if A1)<l and

the (A6) lag polynomial has exactly two stable and two unstable roots. Let

It follows from the argument in Blanchard (1983) that if the firm uses only

past new orders to forecast future new orders, and that equation (6)

represents the univariate new orders process, then equation (7) is the closed

form solution to (A7).
