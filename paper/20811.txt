                                              ABSTRACT

We examine heterogeneity in the impacts of exposure to mixed-ability ‘comprehensive’ schools in
adolescence on long-term health and smoking behaviour. We explore the roles that cognitive and non-cognitive
skills may play in moderating these impacts. We use data from the 1958 National Child Development
Study (NCDS) cohort, whose secondary schooling years lay within the transition years of a major
reform that transformed secondary education in England and Wales from a selective system of schooling
to mixed-ability comprehensive schools. We adopt a local instrumental variables approach to estimate
person-centred treatment (PeT) effects of comprehensive over selective schooling system. Our results
indicate that the newer comprehensive schooling system produced significant negative effects on long-term
health and increased smoking behavior among a small fraction of individuals, for whom the effects
were persistent over time. The ATE and TT were quantitatively similar and statistically insignificant
indicating that cognitive abilities, the major driver for selection in to comprehensive schools, did not
moderate the effects. The PeT effects indicate that individuals with lower non-cognitive skills were
most likely to be negatively affected by exposure to mixed-ability schools. Our results also show that
cigarette smoking could be a leading transmission channel of the long-term impact on health outcomes.

1. INTRODUCTION

The recent literature on human capability formation (Cunha and Heckman, 2007, 2008,

2010; Conti et al., 2010, 2011 and Heckman et al. 2014) has amassed compelling evidence

indicating that health behaviors and outcomes, as well as educational choices, are

simultaneously determined from a very early age by a complex network of factors that

include cognitive skills, socio-emotional development and initial health endowments.

Although the positive association between education and health has long been

established, it is vital for the guidance of economic policy to disentangle the causal

impact of education on health from the effect of selection into distinct educational paths.



The applied literature has examined the health returns of two distinct dimensions of

education: the length of schooling, and the type and quality of that schooling.

Concerning the health returns to length of schooling, different identification strategies

have allowed researchers to establish the existence of positive long-term mean effects of

the attendance of further schooling, in particular years of extended compulsory

education, on longevity and a wide range of health-related behaviors and outcomes: see,

for example Currie and Moretti (2003), Lleras-Muney (2005), Kenkel et al. (2006),

Oreopoulous (2006), Grimard and Parent (2007), Silles (2009), and Van Kippersluis et al.

(2011). More recently, this body of evidence has been extended in several important

directions.



Conti et al. (2010, 2011) use data from a large British cohort study to estimate factor

models with unobserved components to go beyond mean effects and recover the full

distribution of treatment effects for attendance at post-compulsory education. Their

results show that the average marginal effect of post-compulsory education is typically

higher than its estimated average treatment effect. The results indicate that the estimated


                                                                                         3
mean effects hide considerable heterogeneity in responses: for example, the effectiveness

of post-compulsory schooling in improving long-term health outcomes is highest for

males with low levels of social development and high levels of cognitive ability.



Heckman et al. (2014) extend this evidence further. They use data from the 1979

National Longitudinal Survey of Youth to estimate a sequential discrete choice model

with multiple schooling choices, covering the full range of participation decisions

regarding schooling levels from high school attendance to the completion of a higher

education degree. This model is identified using a set of instrumental variables, thereby

allowing the estimation of policy-relevant treatment effects at different margins of the

length of schooling. As in Conti et al. (2010, 2011), their results do not indicate that there

was selection on gains but that education has beneficial effects on health and cigarette

smoking, although the size of this effect varies considerably between different levels of

schooling. Finally, within each level of schooling, the effect of education depends on

individual characteristics, in particular on levels of ability. On average, high ability

individuals benefit more, in terms of their physical health, from the completion of

college degree than low ability ones. Interestingly, the converse happens in the case of

the effect of college completion on important dimensions of mental health, such as self-

esteem: low ability individuals are the only ones to benefit significantly from college

graduation in terms of self-esteem.



The literature on the effect of quality of schooling on health is more recent and much

sparser despite addressing a topical policy issue: are long-term health returns obtained by

simply extending years of education or the quality of that schooling also important?

Johnson (2010) and Jones et al. (2011) show that attending different types of schools can

have long-term effects on health and lifestyle, over and above the influence of years of


                                                                                            4
schooling and academic qualifications attained. It should be noted that quality of

schooling is defined in a broad sense, encompassing qualitative differences in schools’

curricula, endowments of human and material resources, along with differences in the

mix of pupils that may be associated with reference group and peer group effects.



This strand of research has looked mostly at mean effects of quality of schooling. We

advance this literature by going beyond average impacts and by exploiting data from a

policy intervention aimed at transforming the quality, rather than the length, of

secondary education. We examine the role of heterogeneity in the health effect of quality

of schooling, as well as to identify gainers and losers from the changes induced by the

reform. In our work, quality of schooling is determined by the environment in which

students get education. Specifically, we look at the impact of exposure to mixed ability

schools in adolescence. We compare two alternative systems of schooling: one in which

children took a test to determine whether they went to a more academic grammar school

or a more vocational secondary modern school, and the other in which the test was

abolished and all students, with varying abilities, attended comprehensive schools.



We use data from the National Child Development Study (NCDS). The NCDS follows a

cohort of around 17,000 individuals from their birth in the week of 3rd March 1958. The

NCDS cohort-members went through secondary schooling during the 1970s and

attended different types of school since their secondary schooling lay within the

transition period of the comprehensive education reform that was implemented in

England and Wales from the mid-1960s1. This reform restructured secondary education

by replacing the former system of early tracking of students with a non-selective,


1 Comprehensive schooling was introduced in Scotland much earlier than in England and Wales,
preventing the use of the Scottish sub-sample as an adequate comparison group for types of school and
educational qualifications.


                                                                                                   5
comprehensive, educational system. Comprehensive schooling was not implemented

simultaneously across the country, hence only some cohort members attended the

selective system of state-funded education, which comprised grammar schools,

secondary modern schools and a small number of technical schools. Among members of

the NCDS cohort, 12 per cent attended grammar schools at age 16, 25 per cent attended

secondary moderns and 57 per cent attended comprehensive schools. An additional 6

per cent attended private fee-paying schools, independent of the state educational system

and reforms2.



These reforms have been evaluated in terms of their direct effect on educational

attainment and subsequent impact on labour market outcomes (Kerkchoff et al., 1996;

Jesson, 2000; Dearden et al., 2002; Galindo-Rueda and Vignoles, 2005). More recently,

Pischke and Manning (2006) and Bonhomme and Sauder (2011) have raised concerns

about the results from earlier evaluations by providing evidence that suggests that these

did not account adequately for the effect of unobserved heterogeneity in the pupil

composition of the two educational systems, as possibility parental selection into, or out

of, the selective educational system. We draw on this literature and adopt a local

instrumental variables approach to deal with the issue of potential endogeneity and

recover the full distribution of the effect of quality of schooling on health and health

related behaviors (Basu, 2014).



Our results indicate that there is substantial heterogeneity in the effects and significant

persistence of these effects over time at the individual level. The newer comprehensive

schooling system produced significant negative effects on long-term health and increased

smoking among a fraction of individuals. However, the ATE and TT were quantitatively

2   This subsample is thus not used in our analysis.


                                                                                         6
similar and statistically insignificant indicating that cognitive abilities, which was the

major driver for selection in to comprehensive schools, did not moderate the effects.

Analysing the PeT effects shows that individuals who had lower non-cognitive skills are

most likely to be negatively affected in the long-run from exposure to mixed-ability

schools. Our results also show that cigarette smoking could be an important transmission

channel of the long-term impact on health outcomes.



2. THE COMPREHENSIVE EDUCATION REFORM

As Kerckhoff et al. (1996: 1-2) describe it, following the Second World War, a cycle of

educational reforms was initiated in Western Europe. This was characterised by a strong

conviction in the importance of educational expansion, and mounting dissatisfaction

with the stratified systems of schooling that most countries had inherited. Countries such

as Norway and Sweden, followed by France and Scotland, spearheaded a move away

from older stratified systems and towards unified, fully inclusive, systems of

comprehensive schooling. From the mid-1960s the comprehensive reorganisation took-

off in England and Wales, and aimed at promoting equal opportunity in society through

an improvement of the quality of the schooling accessible to children from

disadvantaged backgrounds. It replaced the selective educational system with a non-

selective, comprehensive system of secondary schooling. This policy reform was

implemented at different speeds at the local level: some local education authorities

(LEAs) implemented it quickly, but others resisted the change. This gradual and uneven

transition allowed the two systems to co-exist for a long period of time. The NCDS

cohort entered state secondary schools at age 11 in 1969 and completed their

compulsory schooling at age 16 in 1974; at that point 40 per cent of the cohort members

still experienced the selective system, while the remaining 60 per cent attended

comprehensive schools.


                                                                                        7
Grammar schools were academically oriented state schools that provided teaching for

the entire age range 11-18, and prepared pupils to go on to higher education. Admission

into these schools was determined by an exam taken at age 11 (the ‘Eleven Plus’) 3. Pupils

whose examination score did not permit entry into a grammar school attended either

secondary modern schools, which were less academically oriented and covered the ages

11-16 or, in a small minority of cases, vocational schools aimed at providing training and

technical apprenticeships4. Grammar and secondary modern schools were significantly

different in terms of their curricula, examinations and academic environment. They were

also very different regarding other qualitative aspects. Among the schools attended at age

16 by the NCDS cohort members used in our analysis, 69 per cent of grammar schools

were single sex, while only 13 per cent of comprehensive schools were single sex.

Streaming of classes by academic ability was common in secondary modern schools (42

per cent) and comprehensive schools (39 per cent) but rare among grammar schools (17

per cent). Some comprehensive schools were former secondary moderns (26 per cent) or

grammar schools (19 per cent), with the rest being newly created. Furthermore, the

distribution of indicators of quality of the school, such as the pupil-teacher ratio and of

the average number of expelled students, also differs across types of schools.



The issue of the relative advantages of early tracking versus late tracking of students in

secondary schools remains a topical education policy issue5. The comprehensive reform

continues to receive considerable attention in the social sciences. In the economic


3 As part of the comprehensive reform, the Eleven Plus was abolished as a national examination in
England and Wales by the 1976 Education Act. Despite this, the selective system and the existence of
grammar schools has persisted in certain areas, such as Kent.
4 In a few cases, pupils whose CSE grades were sufficient transferred to grammar schools or sixth form

colleges to complete their A-levels.
5 For example, the OECD evaluation of the results of the Programme for International Student

Assessment (PISA) - OECD (2005) - devotes great attention to comparing the relative performance of
national education systems with different degrees of selectivity.


                                                                                                    8
literature, Galindo-Rueda and Vignoles (2004) use the NCDS data to investigate the

effects of the reform on educational outcomes. Since type of school attended by each

cohort member may influenced by third factors, hence endogenous, they propose an

instrumental variables identification strategy, relying on two main instruments: the share

of comprehensive schools in a cohort-member’s LEA and Conservative Party control of

the cohort member’s LEA (which the authors claim to be negatively correlated with the

probability of attending a comprehensive school, but orthogonal to the educational

outcomes). Pischke and Manning (2006) revisit this issue and question the main results

of earlier work. They find that comprehensive areas were poorer and populated by

children with lower ability than selective areas. Thus, the policy impacts on pupils’

examinations scores, reported in the literature, are likely be influenced by observed and

unobserved heterogeneity and, possibly, affected by selection bias. In addition, they also

find that Conservative areas tended to be significantly richer and better educated than

Labour ones, hence the validity of Conservative control of individuals’ constituency as an

instrument for the educational system attended is open to question. These concerns, with

unobserved heterogeneity and selection, have been reinforced by Bonhomme and Sauder

(2011). They model test scores as the output of a production function and use this model

to generalise the difference-in-differences approach to identify the distribution of

potential outcomes. Their results suggest that unobserved heterogeneity, which

incorporates pupils’ initial endowment of cognitive skills, is likely to be a key factor

determining the differences in examination scores between pupils exposed to the

selective and to the comprehensive system of education.



We draw on these concerns and examine more closely the plausibility of the different

instrumental variable strategies proposed in earlier literature as a basis for our own




                                                                                        9
identification strategy. In doing so we allow for heterogeneity in the treatment effects

and estimate the full distribution of these effects.




3. EMPIRICAL STRATEGY

As shown by Conti et al. (2010, 2011), individual responses to different types of

education are likely to be heterogeneous. In addition, in our case, it is possible that

selection into comprehensive or selective schooling reflects these heterogeneous effects.

Pischke and Manning (2006) allude to the possibility that the results from earlier

literature on the comprehensive education reform are systematically biased due to the

presence of essential heterogeneity.



To address these issues, we define a model of potential outcomes and treatment choice

using the Neyman-Fisher-Cox-Rubin framework of potential outcomes. Consder two

treatment regimes – comprehensive schools (treated) state denoted by D = 1 and selective schools

(untreated) denoted by D = 0. The corresponding potential individual outcomes in these

two states are denoted by Y1 and Y0. We assume:



(1)             Y1  1( XO , XU ,  ) and Y0  0 ( XO , XU ,  ) ,

where X0 is a vector of observed random variables, XU is a vector of unobserved random

variables which are also believed to influence treatment selection (they are the

unobserved confounders) and  is an unobserved random variable that capture all

remaining unobserved random variables. ( XO , XU )  and XO            XU where        denotes

statistical independence.




                                                                                             10
Selection into treatment (prior to the realization of the outcome of interest) is

determined by:



(2)                       D = 1 if D ( X 0 , Z ) UD  0 ,



where Z is a (non-degenerate) vector of observed random variables (instruments)

influencing the decision equation but not the potential outcome equations, D is an

unknown function of X0 and Z, and UD is a random variable that is correlated with XU

and all remaining unobserved random variables influencing choice. By definition,

UD       , which also defines the distinction between XU and  in (1). Equations (1) and

(2) represent the nonparametric models that conform to the Imbens and Angrist’s (1994)

independence and monotonicity assumptions needed to interpret instrumental variable

estimates in a model of heterogeneous returns. As in Heckman and Vytlacil (1999) we

can rewrite (2) as:



(3) D = 1        if P( X 0  x 0 , Z  z ) V




where V = FUD UD |XO  xO , Z  z  , P(x0,z) = FUD|XO ,Z  D ( xO , z ) and F represents a

cumulative distribution function. Therefore, for any arbitrary distribution of UD

conditional on XO and Z, by definition, V ~ Unif[0, 1] conditional on XO and Z. Under

regular IV assumptions, Heckman and Vytlacil (1999) show that Marginal Treatment

Effects can be identified by:



      E (Y |XO  x 0 , Z  z )
(4)                               E ((Y1 Y0 )|XO ,V  v )  MTE( xO ,v ) ,
                p




                                                                                           11
where Y = DY1 + (1 - D)Y0 is the observed outcomes and v = P(xO, z).



Basu (2014) extends the LIV methods to identify PeT effects, which, for persons who

choose treatment, are defined by:



(5) EXu|XO ,P ( Z ),D E (Y1 Y0 |xO , P( z ), D  1)  E(Y1 Y0 |xO ,V  P( z ))

                                            = P( z )1 0
                                                         P( z )
                                                                  MTE( xO ,v ) dv .



Similarly, conditional effect for a person who did not choose treatment is obtained by

integrating MTEs over values of V greater than p.



Conceptually, a PeT effect is a weighted version of MTEs. For any given individual, the

PeT effect identifies the specific margins where that individual may belong given its

individual values of XO, P(Z) and D. It then averages the MTEs over those margins, but

not all as in CATE. Therefore, a PeT effect is basically the X-Z-conditional Effect on

the Treated for persons undergoing treatment and is the X-Z-conditional Effect on the

Untreated for persons not undergoing treatment. Further details can be found in Basu

(2014).



3.1 Identification

Endogeneity, induced by unobserved factors influencing both the type of schooling

experienced and the potential outcomes of interest, has been at the heart of the literature

on comprehensive schooling since its inception. Galindo-Rueda and Vignoles (2005)

suggest the existence of unobserved individual heterogeneity and of selection into types




                                                                                         12
of schooling based on unobserved gains (essential heterogeneity). For example, areas

subject to selective schooling may retain of a higher proportion of more able students if

their parents perceive that they would be likely lose from going to a mixed school as the

result of the reform. Galindo-Rueda and Vignoles (2005) propose instrumenting the type

of schooling experienced using the political affiliation of the child’s electoral constituency

(an area that is geographically smaller than the unit of implementation of the reform, the

Local Education Authority (LEA)). The rationale for this is grounded on the gradual and

decentralised implementation of the reform: while Labour areas tended to shift swiftly

towards comprehensive schooling, areas under the control of the Conservative Party

tended to resist and delay the implementation of the reform.



As mentioned above, Pischke and Manning (2006) question the validity of the political

affiliation as an instrument. They estimate the effect of attending the comprehensive

schooling system on test scores administered at age 11 (i.e. before the policy reform) as a

falsification test. They find large and statistically significant effects, thereby disputing the

validity of the political affiliation instrument. The NCDS includes another variable that

has also been used in earlier literature as an instrument to evaluate the reform: the

percentage of comprehensive schools in each individual’s Local Education Authority in

1974. Nonetheless, the transition into either the selective or the comprehensive systems

of schooling takes place in 1969, when cohort members were 11 years of age, rather than

in 1974. In order to use an instrument that adequately reflects the context of this

schooling transition we compiled data on the density of comprehensive schools by LEA,

published in the 1969 Statistics of Education for England and Wales (Department of

Education and Science, 1971). To assess the validity of this instrument we adapt the

falsification test proposed by Pischke and Manning (2006) to the analysis of health

outcomes and estimate the impact of comprehensive schooling on probability of cohort-


                                                                                             13
members suffering from at least four childhood morbidities at age 11 using the 1969

percentage of comprehensive schools in the LEA as an instrument.




3.2 Estimation

In order to estimate the impact of the comprehensive school system and the individual

heterogeneity in these effects, we use local instrumental variable methods (LIV) to

compute person-centered treatment (PeT) effects (Heckman and Vytlacil 1999; Basu

2014).



To estimate PeT effects, we follow the following algorithm (Basu, 2014):

1.   Run the first stage by regressing the indicator for comprehensive system (D) against

     observed factors (XO) and the instrument (Z) using a probit model and predict the

     propensity score, pˆ ( xO , z ) , for every individual.

2. Ensure that pˆ ( xO , z )     has mass at every value (rounded to 0.01) under both

     comprehensive and selective school systems, dropping any observations that do not.

3. Denote minp = min{ pˆ ( xO , z ) } and maxp = max{ pˆ ( xO , z ) }

4. Run the second stage LIV estimand for each binary outcome Y using a probit model

     with the following specification (determined by a series of goodness of fit tests): Y =

     (0  1  X O   2  pˆ  3  pˆ  X O   4  pˆ 2 ) , where Φ is the cumulative normal

     distribution function.

5. Numerical integration: For each individual i:

     a. Draw 1000 replications of u~Uniform[minp, maxp]




                                                                                              14
     b. Compute d ̂(.)/ dpˆ and evaluated it by replacing pˆ ( xO , z ) with each value of u.

         So there are 1000 values of d ̂(.)/ dpˆ for each individual i.

     c. Compute D* = 1( pˆ ( xO , z ))  1(1  u ) also generating 1000 values for each

         individual i.

     d. Compute the PeT by averaging d ̂(.)/ dpˆ over values of u for which (D* > 0)

         if D=1, otherwise, by averaging d ̂(.)/ dpˆ over values of u for which (D* ≤ 0)

         if D=0.

6. Estimated PeT effects provide individualized effects of treatment effects. Mean

     treatment effect parameters are computed: averaging PeTs over all observation gave

     ATE, averaging PeTs over over D=1 or D=0 gives the TT and TUT respectively.



We estimate the PeT effects of experiencing comprehensive schooling compared to the

selective schooling system on health outcomes (indicators for self-reported excellent

health, malaise and long standing illness) and cigarette smoking (indicator for current

smoking) at ages 23, 33 and 42 years separately. We use the estimated PeT effects to

study the following:

1. Differential drop-out: We compared whether there are systematic differences in

     the distribution of PeT effects at age 23 between those who would continue to

     participate at age 33 versus those who would drop out before age 33. Similarly, we

     looked at PeT effects at age 33 based on drop-out behaviors by age 42.

2. Time dependence of effects: We explored the dependence of PeT effects at age 42

     to those of the same individuals at age 23 in order to study the time dependence of

     effects.

4.   Effects on multi-dimensional outcomes: We compared the dependence amongst

     the PeT effects of malaise versus long standing illness for the same individuals in


                                                                                           15
   order to study the multi-dimensional effects of alternative schooling systems. We also

   repeated similar analysis between the effects on smoking at age 33 years and malaise

   at age 42 years in order to establish a potential channel through which alternative

   schooling systems may effect outcomes.

5. Heterogeneity: We studied how the average effects on outcomes among those who

   did not attend comprehensive schooling systems differed between those who

   attended secondary modern schools versus grammar schools. This comparison helps

   to illustrate if exposure to comprehensive schools would have had differential effects

   on students who went to the different types of schools within the selective system.

6. Finally, we develop a prediction algorithm based on individual factors that predict

   significant PeT effects on malaise and long-standing illness at age 42.



4. DATA

Members of the National Child Development Study (NCDS) cohort are followed from

birth, in the week of 3rd March 1958. In the early waves of the Study information was

obtained from parents, medical examinations, tests of ability and from the child’s school;

extensive data are thus available on the cohort-members’ childhood health, parental

background, and educational achievement. The subsequent waves include self-reported

information on social status in adulthood, health-related behavior and a wide range of

health outcomes.



Our empirical strategy aims at identifying the impact of educational attainment and of

the characteristics of secondary schooling experienced by members of the 1958 cohort

on adult health and health-related behaviors after controlling for a broad set of pre-




                                                                                         16
treatment factors6. These include measures of family socioeconomic status and the local

environment during early childhood; measures of childhood health and use of health care

and health within the family; and measures of cognitive and non-cognitive skills and

social adjustment of the child. Because the comprehensive reform was a secondary

education policy, we also condition on characteristics of the individual’s primary

education, which, in our case, constitute pre-treatment factors. The specific variables

used are described below and listed in Table A.1 in the Appendix.



4.1 Pre-treatment factors

Childhood health, genetic endowments and family background

The NCDS includes extensive information on the childhood characteristics that were

shown to be key predictors of health and lifestyle in adulthood in studies such as Case et

al. (2005) and Currie and Stabile (2004). Following Power and Peckham (1987), we create

morbidity indices by aggregating twelve categories of health conditions, that affect the

child at ages 7 and 11. We complement this with indicator variables for the occurrence of

diabetes, epilepsy and other chronic conditions among parents and siblings, in order to

account for hereditary conditions in the cohort member’s family. Following Carneiro et

al. (2007), parental socioeconomic background is proxied by the occupational social class

and the years of schooling of cohort members’ father. Following Case et al. (2005) and

Lindeboom et al. (2009), we augment this characterisation using data on the incidence of

household financial difficulties during the cohort member’s childhood and adolescence.



Local area characteristics

Rich information about the cohort members’ immediate milieu is available and

aggregated at different geographic levels, allowing a detailed demographic and
6 As noted by Dearden et al. (2002), these reflect early life circumstances, occur prior to secondary
schooling, and are not influenced by subsequent educational choices.


                                                                                                  17
socioeconomic characterisation of each individual’s local area: electoral constituency

level, local education authority level and census enumeration district level (the smallest

unit for which census statistics were then available, with an average population of about

500)7. Available variables include the percentage of the local population who are

unemployed or long-term sick, working women, employed in particular sectors

(manufacturing and agricultural), who are in different occupational groups

(professional/managerial, other non-manual, skilled manual, semi-skilled, unskilled),

owner occupiers, council tenants, non-whites, and immigrants (see Dearden et al., 2002;

Galindo-Rueda and Vignoles, 2004; Pischke and Manning, 2006).



Cognitive ability and socio-emotional development

Cognitive skills, socio-emotional development and personality traits have received

growing attention in the literature on human capability formation. In particular, these

factors were shown to be key determinants of health and health-related behaviors in

recent papers such as Carneiro et al., (2007), Keastner (2009) Conti et al. (2010, 2011).

The NCDS provides measures of early cognitive ability and social development collected

before respondents began their secondary schooling. Scores of ability tests taken at age 7

and 11 are available on a series of cognitive dimensions: mathematics, reading, copying

designs and general ability. These test scores are highly correlated at the individual level

leading to multicollinearity. To avoid this, we follow Galindo-Rueda and Vignoles (2005)

and use principal components analysis to construct a single measure of cognitive ability

using the first principal component8.




7 These small area data are available for the years 1971 and 1981 under a special licence, which imposes
restrictions on the handling and usage of the data.
8At age 11, the first principal component accounts for 85 per cent of the joint variation and, strikingly, the
weights attached to the three dimensions – 0.583, 0.567 and 0.582 – are virtually identical.


                                                                                                          18
Serendipitously, the three dimensions of cognitive ability used to construct our index –

mathematics, reading and general ability – along with the fact that the index derived from

the first principal component gives equal weight to each dimension, mirrors the three

elements of the Eleven Plus examination. Cognitive ability score at age 11 can thus be

interpreted as a proxy for performance in the Eleven Plus for those who took the

examination.



We draw on Carneiro et al. (2007) and use the score for the Bristol Social Adjustment

Guide (BSAG) as our measure of early social development. This is a measure of

problems with social adjustment at age 11: teachers were asked to report whether the

child had problems in twelve behavioral domains such as hostility towards children and

adults, anxiety, withdrawal, ‘writing off’ adults, unforthcomingness, depression,

restlessness, acceptance by adults, inconsequential behavior, and other psychological and

nervous symptoms (Stott, 1987). One point is attributed to each positive answer; points

are then summed to obtain the BSAG social maladjustment score.



4.2 Educational attainment and quality of schooling

Detailed information on the cohort-members’ educational attainment is available in the

NCDS. In order to exploit this wealth of data we build a measure of attainment in

secondary education with thirteen categories, ordered according to the grades obtained

and number of passes9. In our empirical analysis we use a simple 0-12 scaling of this

variable as a parsimonious measure of educational attainment, although we have also

used models with dummy variables for each category to check the robustness of the

results.



9This is variable ‘E386’ in the NCDS data dictionary; this information was collected in the 1978 Survey of
Public Exams, based on a questionnaire sent to the school attended by NCDS respondents at wave 3.


                                                                                                        19
Quality of schooling is captured by two sets of variables. First, as described in Section 1,

the NCDS cohort-members attended different types of schools; this is captured by

indicators of the school attended at age 16: secondary modern, grammar, and

comprehensive. Second, we use information on characteristics of the school, which have

been widely used as standard proxies of quality of schooling in applied work on

education and labour (see, for example, Dearden et al., 2002). These include the

teacher/pupil ratio, the ratio of expelled pupils to the total number, and indicators of

whether the school was single sex and whether classes were streamed by ability.



Finally, we control for information about the individuals’ primary schooling and parental

aspirations for their child. This includes the number of children in the child’s primary

school class at age 7 in 1965, whether parents reported that their child was unhappy at

school in 1965, and an indicator for whether parents wished their child to continue

beyond the minimum school leaving age.



4.3 Outcomes: health and health-related behaviors

Information on the particular medical condition associated with the long-standing illness

is available and classified according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-

10). The most prevalent conditions are illnesses of the musculoskeletal system (25.7 per

cent), circulatory system (11.8 per cent), respiratory system (11.4 per cent) and metabolic

problems (9.5 per cent), of which 70 per cent suffer from diabetes.



We also take into account mental illness in adulthood. Respondents answer to a series of

questions from the Cornell Medical Index Questionnaire, each targeting a particular

mental ailment. The number of positive answers given is then used as a malaise score

along the lines of Carneiro et al. (2007). The malaise score is a measure of psychiatric


                                                                                         20
morbidity (with a special focus on depression), developed at the Institute of Psychiatry

from the Cornell Medical Index (Rutter et al., 1970). The NCDS team suggest the use of

a severity scale: individuals are considered normal if they score between 0 and 7 points

and depressed if they score between 8 and 24 points (Rodgers et al., 1999). In our

analysis we use this scale to define an indicator variable that takes the value 1 if

individuals are depressed (malaise score above 7) and zero otherwise.



The NCDS also documents some of important health-related behaviors. The Study

includes self-reported information on the number of cigarettes smoked per day. These

data are only available once respondents are aged 23 and above.



5. RESULTS

5.1 Sample selection, missing values and attrition

Table 1 shows our sample selection and the number of observations lost due to various

exclusion criteria. Some NCDS cohort members are excluded from our estimation

sample because they attended private schools, which are independent from state

education and schooling reforms.

                                    -   Insert Table 1 here -

More significantly, a large number of observations is lost due to item non-response to

parts of the questionnaire that are essential for our analysis or because at some stage they

have attrited out of the NCDS. This is the most important cause of sample size

reduction in the economics literature that uses the NCDS. This is acknowledged in

several papers that feature sample sizes comparable to ours (Dearden et al., 2002;

Galindo-Rueda and Vignoles, 2004, 2005; Pischke and Manning, 2006, Lindeboom et al.,

2009; Jones et al., 2011). The degree, and repercussions, of non-random attrition has

been extensively examined in this earlier literature, which concludes it does not constitute


                                                                                         21
a serious source of bias (for example, Plewlis et al., 2004; Case et al., 2005 and Lindeboom

et al., 2009). Table 2 shows, in the case of our analysis, the comparison between included

and excluded observations. The difference in means for most covariates is small and

statistically insignificant, with a few notable exceptions. Individuals included in our

estimation sample tend to exhibit higher levels of cognitive and non-cognitive ability, to

live in slightly more affluent areas and to be less likely to have experienced financial

hardship in childhood. In light of these disparities, where possible we disaggregate our

key estimation results for included and excluded observations in the following sections.

                                       -    Insert Table 2 here -

It is also informative to compare the mean differences in covariates between the cohort

members in our treatment and control groups; these are reported in Table 3. Average

ability scores are higher amongst selective system pupils, when compared with their

comprehensive counterparts. This difference is also identified in Pischke and Manning

(2006), thereby substantiating their concerns with unobserved factors and parental

selection of the best pupils into the selective system. In addition, similarly to Pischke and

Manning (2006), Table 3 shows that selective areas tend to be slightly more affluent than

comprehensive ones. Importantly, however, Table 3 also shows that these differences are

almost entirely eliminated across the median of our instrument; this balancing of

observed covariates over the distribution of the instrument is reassuring of its ability to

deal with the issues of selection and unobserved heterogeneity.

                                       -    Insert Table 3 here -

In addition, our IV is not rejected by the falsification test. As suggested by Pischke and

Manning (2006), we estimate the impact of comprehensive school on the probability of

suffering from at least four childhood morbidities at age 11. The estimated ATE, TT and

TUT from this placebo regression approach are -0.01 (0.08), -0.001 (0.09) and -0.02

(0.07) and are not statistically significant.


                                                                                          22
5.2 First stage regression results

Table A.4 (in the Appendix) reports the results of the first stage regression: where we

regress the indicator for comprehensive system (D) against observed factors (X) and the

instrument (Z) using a probit model. The results show that the percentage of the cohort-

member’s LEA that is comprehensive in 1969 is a strong and statistically significant

predictor of the member’s schooling system. As explained in Section 2.3, we then predict

the propensity score pˆ ( x, z ) for each individual. Figure 1 shows the distribution of the

values of the propensity score amongst treated and untreated observations. Clearly,

pˆ ( x, z ) has mass at almost every value (rounded to 0.01) under both schooling systems –

there are only 20 individuals off the common support, which are dropped before running

the second-stage regression.

                                     -   Insert Figure 1 here -



5.3 Second stage regression results: health outcomes

We examine the effect of experiencing the comprehensive schooling system on our

outcomes of interest, at three different points of the life-cycle: ages 23, 33 and 42. We

also focus on retrieving three causal parameters: the average treatment effect (ATE), the

treatment effect on the treated (TT) and the treatment effect on the untreated (TUT).

Table 4 shows the effect of comprehensive schooling on the probability of cohort

members suffering from depression. The comparison between TT and TUT suggests

that, while this effect is large and positive in the long run (ages 33 and 42), individuals

who attended the comprehensive school system experienced no impact, or even a mild

negative effect in the short run (age 23).




                                                                                         23
Our results suggest that the long-term impacts of schooling are not necessarily related

with exam performance; they can be non-academic, such as an improvement in self-

esteem, or, more generally, mental health. Interestingly, these results are also in line with

new evidence brought to the fore in Heckman et al. (2014) regarding the effect of

educational choices on key domains of mental health. Graduating from college improves

self-esteem very significantly, but only for low-ability types. Their results also indicate

that it is the educational pathways (rather than the highest qualifications attained) that

has long-run health effects. Thus, our results suggest that selection into or out of

qualitatively different schooling systems is likely to be one of these pathways, one of the

channels through which education has short and longer-run health effects. We examine

this possibility in greater detail in the following sections.

                                        - Insert Table 4 here -

As identified in Section 4.1, a significant number of observations are lost due to attrition

and there are discrepancies between the mean values of some important covariates for

included and excluded observations. Figure 2(a) shows our treatment effects, at different

ages, for these two groups of observations. The distribution of these effects is markedly

more compressed at age 33, when attrition begins to slow down, than at age 23.

Nonetheless, these distributional differences do not deviate from the general pattern, of a

null or slightly beneficial effect at age 23, followed by a clear detrimental impact at age

42.

                                       - Insert Figure 2 here -



This pattern of effects is corroborated in the case of the probability of cohort-members

reporting excellent health at ages 23, 33 and 42. As shown in Figure 2(b), this effect

follows the same lifecycle trajectory identified for depression: attendance of




                                                                                          24
comprehensive schooling has a mildly beneficial effect at age 23, but this drops at age 33

and becomes clearly negative by age 42.



Figure 2(c) shows the estimated treatment effects of the attendance of comprehensive

schooling on the probability of cohort members suffering from a chronic condition at

ages 23, 33 and 42. Although our estimates are not statistically significant, the effect of

comprehensive schooling is mildly detrimental throughout the lifecycle.



5.4 Selecting into and out of selection: identifying gainers and losers

Unobserved heterogeneity is likely to influence selection into distinct educational paths,

which, in turn, affect health-related outcomes and behaviors throughout the lifecyle. The

person-centred treatment effects approach can be used to identify the cohort-members

who gain and lose out from selection into a particular schooling system. This is shown in

Figure 3, which illustrates the dependence between PeT effects of comprehensive

schooling on the probability of depression at ages 23 and 42. The agglomeration of

treatment effects in the top-right quadrant indicates that the individuals who, at age 23,

suffer a detrimental effect from having attended the comprehensive system are also those

who suffer a detrimental effect at age 42.

                                     - Insert Figure 3 here -



Heckman et al. (2014) find that the positive effect of choices regarding length of

schooling (for example the completion of a higher education degree) on mental health is

typically concentrated amongst individuals with relatively lower cognitive ability. Our

findings suggest that this concentration of mental health gains (and losses) appears to

also hold in the case of quality, rather than length, of schooling. Figure 4 shows the PeT

effects of comprehensive schooling on untreated individuals, i.e. those who experienced


                                                                                        25
the selective system of education. Interestingly, the mental health losses associated with

comprehensive schooling would be similar amongst cohort-members who actually

attended secondary modern schools (the less academically intensive schools) or the

grammar schools, highlighting that cognitive abilities that distinguishes these two group

of student may not be a driving factor for these effects.

                                       - Insert Figure 4 here -




5.5 Decomposition of the variance of PeT effects on the probability of depression

In order to identify the factors driving the variance in Pet Effects on depression at age

42, we focus on two approaches: 1) a Variance decomposition approach that estimates

how much of the overall variation in the PeT effects are driven by each baseline factor.

2) A stepwise backward logistic regression approach, with very conservative inclusion

criteria of p-value < 0.0001, to identify the group of baseline factors that are most

influential in predicting the individuals for whom comprehensive school would have

significantly increased in probability of depression by age 42.

                                       - Insert Table 5 here -

The variance decomposition results are shown in Table 5. Factors explaining at least 5%

of the variance in the PeT effects on depression at age 42 are highlighted. Both cognitive

and non-cognitive scores in childhood are identified in this list. However, when we focus

only on those individuals who would be significantly hurt due to exposure to mixed

ability schools, the factors most influencing in identifying these individuals do not

include cognitive ability (Table 6). However, children with one point increase in their

social adjustment scores are at a 10% greater risk of a significant increase in the

probability of depression at age 42.

                                       - Insert Table 6 here -


                                                                                       26
5.6 Transmission channels: quality of schooling, cigarette smoking and health

The design of economic policy requires the identification of the channels through which

quality of schooling affects health outcomes, at different stages in life. Earlier literature

(see Jones et al., 2011 and references therein) suggests that the adoption of health-related

lifestyles may be an important transmission mechanism of the health effects of education

policy. To explore this we estimate PeT treatment effects of comprehensive schooling on

the probability of cohort members reporting smoking at ages 23, 33 and 46. These

estimates are shown in Table 7 and in Figure 1(d): the mean effects of comprehensive

schooling are positive at all ages and particularly large, at ages 23 and 33.

                                       - Insert Table 7 here -

Our results also indicate that the cohort-members for whom PeT effect are the highest at

age 23, are also the ones who are most seriously affected in terms of their physical health

at age 42. This is illustrated in Figure 4: the concentration of PeT effects in the first

quadrant suggests that positive PeT effects of comprehensive schooling on smoking

track higher probabilities of suffering from a long-standing illness at age 42. This

corroborates the role of cigarette smoking as a transmission mechanism of the impact of

quality of schooling on health outcomes.



6. DISCUSSION

The health gradient by levels of education is a well established empirical regularity.

Nonetheless, a growing body of recent evidence indicates that the positive association

between education and long-term health outcomes can be decisively affected by the roles

of selection and unobserved heterogeneity. Conti et al. (2010, 2011) and Heckman et al.


                                                                                          27
(2014) use data from British and US longitudinal studies to unveil the full distribution of

the health returns to different levels of schooling. They provide solid evidence showing

that the effect schooling on health-related behaviors and outcomes varies considerably

between different levels of schooling and depends crucially on individual characteristics.

The health returns to different lengths of schooling are thus likely to exhibit considerable

heterogeneity that needs to be taken into account in the design of policy interventions.



We follow this strand of research and use data from a British longitudinal study to

examine whether heterogeneity is also an important feature of the health returns to

qualitatively different types of edcation. We obtain identification from a large natural

experiment that affected qualitative aspects of schooling, most specifically a mixed ability

environment but also encompassing schools’ curricula, endowments of human and

material resources. We adopt a local instrumental variables and estimate person-centred

treatment effects of different types of schooling, thereby recovering the distribution of

its effect on health and health-related behaviors at different stages of the lifecycle.



Our results indicate that the average impacts of exposure to comprehensive schools

compared to a selective schooling system in adolescence led to - 1) increased smoking

prevalence that peaks at age 33 and 2) increase probability of depression at ages 33 and

42. However, the average effects are not statistically significant. In fact we do not see

differences in the average treatment effect and the effect of the treated, where selection

into comprehensive schools was driven primarily cognitive ability levels. However, we do

find considerable variation in individual treatments effects (in line with Heckman et al.

2014) and the magnitude of these effects are persistent within individuals as they age. We

find that if all children in the NCDS cohort were sent to comprehensive schools, about

50% of them would have significant increases in the probabilities of long-standing illness or


                                                                                           28
depression at some point in their adulthood (up to age 42). Those who would be

significantly worse off on depression score at age 42 due to comprehensive schools are

more likely to be men and those who had lower non-cognitive abilities at age 11.



Finally, our results also show that the attendence of comprehensive schooling has strong

positive impacts on the probability of individuals being cigarette smokers later in life.

Intuitive explanation on the identification of Person-centered Treatment (PeT)
effects using local instrumental variable methods.


Suppose that in our example, we presume (only to get the general intuition)

comprehensive schooling to be more beneficial, in terms of long-term health, for

children with higher test scores in elementary schools and for children who are self-

confident. Moreover, choice of treatment is influenced by test scores and the self-

confidence of the child. However, our data on children from NCDS do not have a

measure of their self-confidence, and only contains for each student: test scores,

treatment, long-term health outcomes, and a characteristic that all agree is a powerful and

valid instrument. Let the instrument be a continuous variable (e.g. distance to the

comprehensive school). Greater the distance to the comprehensive, less likely will be the

enrolment to that school.



In this case, a traditional naïve regression would produce biased estimate of the average

treatment effect (ATE) and also the conditional average treatment effects (CATEs) for

children groups with low and high test scores groups due to the endogeneity of the

treatment status caused by the missingness of self-confidence levels in the analysis.



A traditional instrumental variable analysis, using a strong and valid IV, will also produce

biased estimates for ATE and CATEs due to the presence of essential heterogeneity, which

suggests that the treatment effects vary over unobserved confounders, which in this case

is the self-confidence status.




                                                                                          45
A local instrumental variable (LIV) approach can be used to overcome these issues when

a continuous instrument is available. LIV methods are used to estimate the marginal

treatment effects (MTEs) parameters. MTEs are the effects for individuals for whom the

influence of the observed characteristics (tests score and distance to comprehensive

school) balance with the influence of the unobserved confounders (self-confidence level)

on treatment choice such that they are indifferent to choosing between using the

comprehensive and selective schools. To estimate an MTE, LIV methods compare the

outcomes of two groups of, say, students with low test scores, where one group is

staying at a distance d from the comprehensive school and the other at a distance d+ε, ε

representing an epsilon (very small) change in distance. Therefore, the two groups are

identical in their distribution of self-confidence. Any difference in outcomes between

these two groups of students should be attributed to the changes in treatment choices

between these two groups, which is only brought about by the difference in distance.

However, since the difference in distance is very small, the effect can be attributed to a

margin of students who were indifferent between two treatment options and were moved to

change treatment choice by the small perturbation of the instrumental variable, i.e.,

distance. For this margin of stduents, one can quantify a normalized level of unobserved

confounders as they must balance the observed levels. Similarly, for another dyad of

distances, d’ and d’+ ε, one can estimate another MTE, which reflects the causal

treatment effect on students at another level of unobserved confounder. In this way, a

full schedule of MTEs can be estimated that vary over the unobserved confounder levels

(i.e. self-confidence) given any level of the observed confounder (i.e. test scores).

Intuitively, LIV methods estimates these MTEs by estimating the partial derivate of the

outcome with respect to the IV-based propensity score (reflecting epsilon changes).




                                                                                             46
Once MTEs are estimated over the range of observed and unobserved levels, they can

then be easily aggregated to form meaningful treatment effect parameters such as the

ATE, CATEs, TT and TUT and also study heterogeneity in effects using person-

centered treatment (PeT) effects. The PeT effect for a student in this stylized sample is

conditioned not only on that individual’s test score but his test score-specific MTEs are

also averaged over a distribution of self-confidence statuses that conforms with the

individual’s observed choice of schooling system. Thus these are deemed to be

personalized effect for this student.
