                                         ABSTRACT




 Policy  discussions  in Japan have increasingly    recognized the
 important role of land values and land-use patterns in Japanese
 macroeconomic adjustment.   In Japan in recent years, land wealth
 constitutes more than half of financial wealth, a proportion that
 is much higher than in the United States and other industrialized
 economies.   Consequently, shifts in land-use patterns can have
 important effects on Japanese savings and investment patterns,
 and thereby on the Japanese trade balance and current account.
 This papers studies the implications of land-use policies for the
 Japanese macroeconomy using both a theoretical model and a multi-
 sectoral dynamic simulation model.      -       .

       Japanese Structural Adjustment and the balance of Payments



  A   major    goal of current Japanese economic policy is to shift from export-

led growth to    domestic   demand-led growth, as part of a process of worldwide

economic adjustment.       The general objective is a reduction of the Japanese

trade surpluses in future years       (at   least as   a   proportion of   Japanese GNP)     in

line with a reduction of the U.S        trade deficits, in        manner which maximizes

                                                                       the
Japanese economic welfare and minimizes the economic volatility during

adjustment process.

   The case for domestic demand expansion is made on several interrelated

levels.    A   major   argument is KeynesIan.     It is widely assumed the U.S. policy

of reducing government deficits will reduce Japanese aggregate demand.                 In

this view, policy should attempt to offset that contractionary                force with a

domestic demand expansion.        This same   argument     is sometimes    put in terms of

Japan's global responsibilities:       as the U.S. ceases to be the engine of global

gr.wth, some assert that Japan should substitute for the U.S.

   Another case sometimes made for domestic-demand-led growth is that Japar. is

misusing   its   high savings by Investing heavily abroad rather than at home.

The argument holds that domestic distortions in the Japanese economy reduce

domestic   investment (e.g. in housing) and favor foreign investment, even

though the social returns of incremental domestic Investment would be higher.

In this view, greater domestic demand in the form of efficient domestic

investment should be encouraged.        Yet another argument is that Japan should

                                              1
reduce its large trade surpluses in order to reduce the risks of protectionism

abroad.

    There are significant differences of opinion both within Japan and in the

teat of the world about the kind of policiea that Japan should pursue to
                                                                         spur
domestic demand.         In part those differences reflect different assessments of

the functioning of the macroeconomy, and in pert they reflect the fact that

there ate many differing motivations for wanting to spur domestic demand in

the first place.         There are three main schools of thought
                                                                 regatdng possible
policy measures. One view holds that       as the U.S.   policy mix changes (towards
fiscal contraction and monetary ease), and the dollar depreciates, normal

market mechanisms will lead to a rise of Japanese domestic demand, even

without maJor policy actions by the Japanese government.1            A competing view
holds that such a market-based expansion would be insufficient to

counterbalance    a U.S. fiscal contraction, and that Japanese fiscal
                                                                      policy
should thetefote turn mote expansionary, for its own sake and for the rest of

the world.2      A   third view stresses the role of microeconomic      policy actions
in spurting domestic demand.        An important argument   is   that changes in land-

use policy (including zoning, land taxation, and import liberalization for

foodstuffs) could spur housing demand, and well as investment in

nonresidential   structures, and thereby overall aggregate demand.3

   The goal of this paper is to highlight some of the important effects which

various policy options, particularily those relating to land-use,
                                                                            might have

upon the Japanese economy.        The linkages we discuss have not, to our

knowledge,   been examined in the literature to date, and we consider their

potential role from both a theoretical and ampircsl perspective.            The

empirical work relies heavily on simulation models of the world economy, and


                     -                      2
of the Japanese economy.      One contribution of the paper is to illustrate how a

multi-sector dynamic model of the Japanese economy can be used to assess the

potential    role of land-use policy 10 Japanese demand management.           Our

contribution here is mostly conceptual, however, since considerable             further

work will be required to properly incorporate the range of factors which

currently affect land-use, in particualr         the role of fiscal policy and tax

regulations.

   The paper is organized as follows           In Section   2, we   briefly discuss the
reasons for the global trade imbalances in the l980s, and for Japan's large

trade surpluses in particular.      The following sections then turn to a multI-

sector simulation model of the Japanese economy, in order to evaluate (or ar

Least show how to evaluate) the interactions of land-use measures and the

macroeconomic   balance,    Section 3 considers     the theoretical arguments       for

linking land use, the demand for atructures         (including housing and northousing

structures), and the trade balance.       Section 4 presents a formal theoretical

model, while Section    5   introduces the multi-sector model, and describes          some

of the simulation results.       Since the results are very preliminary, there is

ample reason in the concluding Section 6 to suggest future lines of research

in this area.




Section 2.     Source of Global Imbalances and Japanese Policy Responses



   General public opinion makes the fundamental mistake of viewing trade

imbalances as a reflection of trade distortions, rather than as a reflection

of savings and investment behavior usually unrelated to trade policies,                   while


                                           3
we will indeed argue later on that there may be an effect of Japanese trade

liberalization cn the Japanese trade balance (through effects cn savings and

investment behavior that are typically neglected)   ,   there   is little reason to

believe that the growing trade imbalances since the early lPSOs have been

related in any important way with changes in trade policies in this decada,

Ample research has atressed several macroeconomic phenomena, rather than trade

policies, that adequately account for the growing imbalances.

   We enumerate the following major factors.

   (1)   The Japanese liberalization of the financial markets      n the early
1980s, especially    regarding international capital movements, which allowed for

the relatively    free outflow of Japanese excess savings to the rest of the

world;

   (2)   The divergent fiscal policies in the OECD countries,                 the
                                                              especially
growth of U.S. fiscal deficits and the reduction of fiscal deficits in Germany

end Japan; and,

   (3)   me   cutoff in lending to the debtor developing countries, which
                                                                          by
forcing a reduction in trade deficits in the debtot countries, resulted in a

corresponding    increase in trade deficits in the reet of the world.



In Sachs and Roubini (1987), a multi-country simulation model was used to

assess, however roughly, the quantitative role of these factors in accounting

for the trade imbalances in the United States and Japan. For the U.S. trade

balance, the Japanese trade balance, and the Yen-Dollar real exchange rate,

the effects of the three factors were
                                      quantified, with the results reproduced

in Table 1.     In each case, the column labelled "actual change" records the

change of the variable in 1985 relative to its value on average during 1978-

Notes:   The actua1 changea      measure the 1985 value of the
variable compared with the average valu, of the variable during
1978-80.   The trade balance is measured as a percentage of CNP.
The real exchange rate measures the percentage change in the
relative CPIs of the U.S. and Japan. corrected for changes in the
nominal exchange rate.     The positive value signifies a real
appreciation of the U.S. of 24 percent.    The predicted changes
come from a simulation of the McKibbjn.Sachs model based on
changes in fiscal policies in the the U.S., Japan (J), and the
rest of the OECD (ROECD) of the historically observed magnitudes;
an exogenous reduction in lending to the LDCs; and offsetting
monetary policies in the industrial countries. For details, see

80.     In this period, for exampe, the Japanese trade balanoe improved by 3.2

peroent of Japanese CNP, compared with 2.9 percent predicted by the multi-

country model.    Cf the predicted 2.9 percent accounted for by the model! 1.9

percent of CNF improvement resulted from the Japanese fiscal contraction! 1.4

percent from the U.S. fiscal expansion! C.3 percent from monetary policies in

the various regions! and -C.6 percent of CNP from the cutoff in lending to the

LDCs.

      The Japanese liberalzaticn of capital movements comes    noo   these esrizates

indireotly.     Sachs and Roubini point our that in the absence of liberalization

of international capital movements!     the large Japanese trade   irbalances could

not have occurred,     The Japanese fiscal contraction,   for example! rather than

inducing a capital outflow and a trade surplus, would instead have reduced
domestic interest rates    n Japan,   thereby reducing private savings and

increasing private investment.     The fall in government disaavings would have

then been balanced by a rise in private investment net of private savings.

      It is evident from Table 1 that even a complete reversal of the U.S. fiscal

policy expansion of the first half of the l9SOs would not substantially

eliminate Japan's large trade surpluses.     This is because   those surpluses have

resulted not mainly from the U.S. fiscal expansion, but from the

contemporaneous   Japanese fiscsl contrsction.   According to the model in
Roubini and Sschs, each reduction     in U.S. government expenditure of 1 percent

of CNP (which reduces the deficit by about 0.8 percent of CNP)       reduces

Japan's trade surplus by 0.4 percent of Japanese GNF.      Even a deficit

reduction of 3 percent of U.S. GNP (about $125 billion in 1987) would have the

effect of reducing the Japanese surplus only by about 1.5 percent of Japanese

GNP.


                                         5
   Is there a case then for augmenting a U.S. fiscal contraction with a

Japanese fiscal expansion (i.e. to reverse, on both sides, the fiscal events

of the l980s)?   On this we are sceptical, at least regards a significant

fiscal expansion (Japan introduced a very modest fiscal expansion in 1987,

which has probably had a minor stimulative effect).4       The best possible

argument for an offsetting Japarese fiscal expansion      is that a U.S. fiscal

expansion would have highly contractionary      demand effects on the Japanese

economy.    But the theoretical and empirical evidence on behalf of that

proposition   is remarkably weak.     In Roubini and Sachs it is explained at some

length that a policy mix of U.S. fiscal contraction and monetary ease (the

present settings of U.S.   policy)    would likely be stimulative on balance for

the Japanese economy, holding fixed the Japanese fiscal policy and money

supply.5 The traditional Keynesian thinking holds that such a policy aix, by

weakening the dollar, will tend to depress Japanese export demand, and thereby
lower Japanese overall demand.       What that analysis underestimates   empirically

is that the policy mix will also allow for a significant reduction in interest

rates, which will spur the non-export portion of Japanese demand.        In other

words, a tight-fiscal, easy-money policy in the U.S. will automatically spur

Japanese domestic demand at the same time that it depresses demand for

Japanese exports.    In sum, the overall effects of the U.S. policy mix on the

level of Japanese output will probably not be large, and may well be positive.




   There is a final important point to make in assessing the effects of U.S.

policy changes on other economies, such as Japan.        The size and even

direction   of responses outside of the U.S. depend on the nature of wage

setting in the foreign economies.       In general, the high flexibility of


                                           &
Japanese labor costs will tend to mute any employment effects of U.S.
macroeconomic policy charges.   Japanese nomtnal wages will tend to adjust

rapidly to offset any contractionary   effects of U.S. policy actions.

   The case for a significant Japanese fiscal expansion might still be made,

not on aggregate demand grounds, but on the putattve urgency of reducing the

Japanese trade surplus at any cost.    It is indeed true that a Japanese fiscal

expansion would have a significant effect in reducing the trade surplus

(approximately   0.7 percent of GNP for each 1 percent of GNP fiscal expansion.

according to the estimates in Sachs and Roubini, and by a similar arount in
the model reported below).    But in balancing thebenefits of a reduced trade

surplus (in terms of reduced international     tensions) utth the harms of renewed

large fiscal deficits,   it seems to us that the "cure of a fiscal expansion

could well be worse than the "djsease'       The same is true of a return to

capital controls.    A reimposition of capital controls, even with unchanged

fiscal policies, could substantially reduce Japan's trade surpluses.         Such a

policy would prevent further capital outflows, and thereby tend to reduce

Japanese interest rates and to spur private investment.      But again, there

would be high costs (both to the financial sector and to the economy as a

whole) of reversing several years of financial liberalization,     and the

putative benefits of reduced international frictions from a cut in the trade

surpluses probably do not justify such a course of policy.




III.   Land Use Policies and the Japanese Balance of Payments



   Because of the obvious shortcomings of renewed fiscal deficits,       or renewed


                                         7
capital controls, policymakers have been examining other methods of spurring

domestic investment (and with less enthusiasm, of reducing private savings).

One set of policies, outside of the focus of this paper, involves a possible

broad-based tax reform to encourge investment and discourage savings.              Another

set of policies    involves land-use management        with a focus on new means of

stimulating housing investment       (and   perhaps   investment in nonresidential

structures) by shifting more of Japan's scarce land resources into structures

and out of alternative uses.

   Japan's land scarcity puts the macroeconomic          role of land in Japan into

unusual macroeconomic    prominence.        Land is rarely discussed in macroeconomic

models (including, unfortunately,       standard macroeconomic     models of the

Japanese economy), but its central and unique macroeconomic significance in

Japan should be noted.     Remarkably, as seen in Table 2, the value of claims to

land in Japan accounted for about 54 percent of financial wealth in Japan in

1984, as opposed to a mere 24 percent in the United States.            The value of land

equalled about 317 percent of GNP in 1984. as opposed to 80 percent of CNP in

the United States.     For this reason, changes in land values should be expected

to have major significance       for patterns of savings and consumption     in Japan.

   High land prices mean that a significant proportion of the cost of housing
and non-residential     investments in structures       is due to the cost of the land

component   of the investment.     For all structures      (including housing and

nonresidential    structures),   the share of land in the            value of   structures

(Le. the sum of reproducible capital plus land) averaged about 71 percent in

Japan in 1984 (the data available to us did not allow us to break out housing

versus nonresidential    structures).       In the U.s., this ratio was on   tb    order

of 31 percent.6    In heavily concentrated urban areas, especially in Tokyo, the


                                               8
land component is far higher.          A recent estimate holds that for publLc

investment       spendIng in the Tokyo area, costs of land acquIsition account for

about 95 percent of project costs.7                   -




      Such a high share may have profound implications for the effectiveness of

fiscal policIes.        To the extent that bond-financed public     investment spending
covers mainly the costs of land acquisItion, rather than an expenditure on

final goods and services, the public spending is really a swap of assets (land

for bonds) rather than a purchase of goods and services.            The aggregate demand

effects of such an asset swap are certainl.y less stImulative           (If   present    at
all) than are the demand effects of a bond-financed         purchase of       final   goods.8

The price of land has recently had an even more direct effect on macroeconomic

policIes in Japan, since the sank of Japan has cited sharply rising land

prices in 1987 as a reason to avoid further monetary expansion or further Cuts

ifl   interest   rates.9

      The argument made for land-use changes revolves around varIous policies

that currently       act to raise the price of land for residential housing and

business investment in structures, and thereby contribute to a lower flow of

structures       investment   and a lower stock of structures   capital.     Japan's

housing stock as a percent of GNP is also shown in Table           2.   It    is   clear that

Japan's stock of physical capital in housing, equal to 53 percent of GNF, and

only 9 percent of net worth, is significantly below the shares in the U.S.

which are 90 percent of GNP and 27 percent of net worth.            The shar.e of housing

capital in GNP is also below the ratios in the U.K. and Germany <for which

comparable data are available).          Interestingly, no shortfall is evident         in

nonresidential structures: in Japan they equalled 51 percent of GNP, versus 52

percent of CNP in the tJ.S.There is apparantly a considerable amount of land in


                                             9

15% of total land, while housing takes up only 3.3%.

   Four kinds of policies are alleged to contribute to the high costs of

residential    Investment.   First, protectionist   agricultural   policies,

                                                         world levels, and
especially for rice, keep domestic food prices far above

                                                                      half of
rather than investment in bousng and other structures. Approximately

all Japanese arabic land is in rice production.

                                                  lend for agriculture           rather
    Second. various tax policies favor the use of

than for housing.     Inheritance   taxes on agricultural   land are far more

favorable     than similar taxes en residential real estate.       Similarly,   property

taxes are far higher on residential      than on agricultural properties.        Another

are held by the older

labor income, and accumulate assets over time to finance

the proceeds to finance
                        expenditures after retirement.            In this framework, a
decline in land values has a
                             very large effect on consumption,           since the old
must reduce their consumption  one-for-one with a capital loss on land. Thus,
if a trade liberalization occurs which
                                       depresses farm land prices, the older

generationwill sharply cut back on consumption.            At the same time, the young
will neither cut back nor sharply increase their

foreign assets.     The foreign assets ultimately     grow enough in the model below

to push consumption back up and to rebalance the current account.              Over the

course of adjustment, then, the trade liberalization leads to an increase in

net foreign assets.

   The liklihood of trade deficits immediately following a liberalizationof

food trade (or other policies that lower land prices) rises with the length of

the planning horizon of the households.         With long-lived households,      the drop


in land wealth does not produce a matching one-for-one drop in consumption,

but rather a much more modest drop in consumption.         The loss of wealth is now

smoothed over a very long consumption horizon.         For example, an infinite-lived

household can maintain a constant consumption stream by always consuming an

amount equal to the interest rate times its wealth         (i.e.   by consuming the

income earned on the stock of total wealth).         If a component of wealth falls,

                                                           that the household
therefore,    cosplete consumption smoothing would require

national consumption is much lower, the rise in national aavings much less,

and the chance much greater that the induced rise in housing investment will

exceed the riae in national savings.

     The long-run effects of a trade liberalization on the net foreign

investment pcsition of the economy can be understood in another way.           Moat

models of savings behavior of finite-lived households produce equilibria in

which the economy has a fixed atesdy-atate ratio of financial wealth to human

wealth,      This is because the accumulation of financial wealth comes from

savings of the young out of their labor earnings.        Financial wealth includes

claims on land, housing, and fdregn assets.        When land values decline becaule
of e reduction of food prices, the value of land in total wealth- falls.

Assuming that total wealth is unchsnged in the new long-run equlbrium (which
will    be the case   if Isbor earnings are not dreccly affected by
                                                                the trade

                                               the form of land must be
balanced by a rise in wealth held in the form of housing and foreign assets.
But the value of wealth held in the form of housing is equal to the discounted

value   of   consumer expenditures on housing   serrices, which itself will tend to
be   e fixed proportion of humsn wealth
                                        assuming that a constant shsre of

spending is allocated to housing.      Thus, if land wealth falls, and housing

wealth remains unchanged, net foreign assets must      ijg,t   in order to keep total
wealth unchanged.       In long-run equilibrium, therefore, the fell in land wealth

is balanced by a rise in net claims on the rest of the world.         On the

transition path, there must be current account surpluses on balance in order

to generate the steady-state rise in net foreign assets.



Section 4.    A   Formal Model of Land Use in the Macroeconomy    -




                                         15
      Consider the following formal framework, which is the basis of the large

simulation model in the next section,                    The stock of land is distributed

between housing and agriculture as previously described:



(1)        L       —              +
                           LF


Food is produced using only land (this assumption is made here only for

convenience;                   it is relaxed in the simulation model).      Without loss of

generality, we normalize units so that one unit of land produces one unit of

food:




(2)        F       —



For    simplicity,                the output all other final goods is denoted by Q, and is

assumed to be fixed, produced by a fixed stock of labor,




(3)        Q               Q




The discounted value of the stream of current and future Q                       is   the value of

human wealth in this model.                    The output Q   is   used for investment in housing,

I; final           domestic consumption expenditure                  and exports, X; so that   Q —   I
                                                               CQ;
+              +   X.
      CQ

      The housing stock (and also the flow of housing services, which is assumed

to be a fixed ratio of the housing stock) depends on reproducible capital in

housing,           K   ,       and land, according to a fixed proportions production technology:


                                                       16

                                    L.   /   v[


We assume that housing is provided by a housing industry, which purchases the

land and makes the capital investment.                       A unit increase of housing stock

requires u        units of physical capital, and                 v    units of land, and so has a

                                    u    +        *
total purchase price of:                      v         q     where         is the price of a unit

of land.     Equilibrium requires that the market value of an existing house,

  should also equal its reproduction cost.                      (This arbitrage relationship

assumes that there are no costs of adjustment                     in altering the stock of housing

either in a positive or negative direction.                      In the simulationmodel, costs of

adjustment due to capacity constraints in the construction industry alter the

arbitrage relationship slightly.)                 Therefore:



(5)           u    +   v   *



      In addition to the problem of adjustment costs, there are several important

qualifications     that must be made to               (5).   Host importantly, the model so far

assumes that all land is homogeneous,                   and equally substitutable between

housing and agriculture.            Land, however,           is almost inherently heterogeneous,

in that land in different locations will earn differing spacial rents.                         Land

in downtown Tokyo of course greatly exceeds the price of land on the

metropolitan fringe.       There is another factor of production, location, that

earns rents and contributes             to the value of houses.           Empirically,   it will be

important    to account for those spatial rents.                  A   percentage change in q1 will
have a far larger affect on the proportionate change in housing costs in the

fringe than in the city center.           We return to the theme of spatial rents in a

later subsection.

      The price of a unit of land is given by the discounted value of future

marginal value products of land in the agricultural sector, plus any subsidies

a that might be given to landowners.                      Each year,    a unit of agricultural land

                                                            The price   of land is such that
earns a rental
                  F plus   the subsidy a              .                                        the

total yield on land (capital gains plus rental yield inclusive of the subsidy)

should equal the market interest rate:




(6)                +
                       (p+s)/q                               r




In a full steady state, with          ,       a   ,       and r all constant,    (6)   reduces simply

to:




(6')                   + s)/r


Of course the land subsidy would have to be financed through other taxes, T,

with a present value T — (a *      F)/r
      Similarly, the full return on a house should also equal the market return.

With rental payments equal to             we have the following:



(7)               +               —       r

In a steady state, with         and r constant, we have:



(7')          —
                  H    /   r

                                                      18
      The model is closed by specifying consumption demand and the market

clearing conditions.       We use here, without detailed elaboration, the Blanchard

model of identical individuals who maximize intertemporal expected utility,

subject to the probability p of death each period.                When p—O, the model

behaves like the case of households with an infinite horizon.                     When p is tlose

to one, the model behaves more like an overlapping generations model.

      Intertemporal   optimization       leads to a simple formulation for consumer

behavior.       Each household consumes a constant proportion of its total wealth

each period, with the proportion equalling d+p, where d                 i   the subjective    rate

of time discount:                    -                                                       -



(8)     C   —   (d+p)W

We assume that the parameters have values such that: r > d >                 r-    p.   The first

inequality assures that the stock of non-human wealth is positive.                      The second

inequality is made to assure stability)7

      One criticiam of our model specification is that it ignores the possibility

of target savings for house purchases.               Ito, }Iayashi,   and Slemrod(l987),

amongst others, have discussed how savings in Japan may be artifically high
due to credit market imperfections which cause the young to save for large

down payments towards housing purchases.              Any policy which resulted in a

change in the price of a housing unit could in turn affect the steady-state

level of wealth by changing the savings of the young for this purpose.                      Our

model, which assumes perfact capital markets, ignores this so-called "house

savings" phenomenon.       Both the dynamic and long-run effects of changes in the


                                                19
pric, of land on savings due to this motiv, are quite complicated.                                             In

particular, they will depend upon the nature of the underlying liquidity

constraint, upon the elasticIty of demand for housing services,                                           and upon

whether or not the optimal timing of an initial purchase changes when housing

prices change.                   The linkage of "house savings" and land values will be

considered in future research.

      Total wealth, W, is the sum of human wealth, E                                ,   foreign    assets, B, housing

wealth                   * H, and wealth in farmlands, net of taxes T:



(9)     'W       —       E   +   B    +     q*H            +       q*F      -   T



Human wealth is just                      the discounted value of the exogenous                   output flow Q.        A

key to Blanchard's model is to note that for an individual agent, human wealth

is discounted by (r +                     p)   rather than simply r, since after the agent dIes, the

flow of labor income associated with the particular agent vanishes.                                            Thus,



(10)         E       —       Q/(r + p)


We will denote all wealth except £ as non-human wealth NE —                                       W   -

   Finally, we divide total consumption among its constituent                                         parts.    We
assume that households spend a constant share of their consumption on                                           food,
housing,         and the rest, so that:

     We assume perfect capital mobility with the interest rate r                                    fixed
exogenously           in world markets such that agents can borrow and lend freely at

the international               rate r, subject only to their long-term budget constraint.

     The model is closed with alternative assumptions about the food market.

Under conditions of completelyprohibited trade in food, as now exists in

Japan with respect to rice, the food market must obey CF — F, with the

domestic price    greater than the world price
                           F                       —      Alternatively,       F                                with

free trade in food, we must have domestic and world prices equal.                                       Thus, we

will use two          alternative            assumptions:




(14)(a)          CF
                       —       F                   (food autarky)

     It is useful to note that under either assumption, the current account

equation in (13) can be rewritten as GNP net of total consumption and total

investment (the term in paranrheses is GNP):



(13')      8      —(r8       +    Q   +             F       +

To see how to get from (13) to (13'), note that we can add                                    and subtract
                                                                                                                        H*

overall consumption C.                We thereby arrive at (13').

     We now consider a number of alternative experiments.                                The first is trade

liberalization,             i.e. a shift from equation                    (l4)(a) to equation (l4)(b).                  Then,

we turn to a shift in land taxes and a change in the land-house ratio.                                                 In   the
next subsection we analyze the steady-state implications of these changes, and

in the subsequent subsectionwe examine the dynamics.



Steady-state          effects of the policy changes




     To understand the workings of the model, note first that there is a fixed

ratio of non-human wealth, NE              —    W -         E, total wealth, E, housing wealth, and

total consumption            spending, C, to Q.                 These ratios are found by setting the

current account equal to zero, and substituting the various values for wealth

and consumption.             The results are as follows:


                                                        -
                                                                22

     Now note what happens when a trade liberalization occurs,                            The price of

food falls to world levels, and the price of land, which is                             the'   discounted

value of food prices, also falls in the same proportion.                              It should be clear

from (15) that total wealth and non-human wealth must remain unchanged in the

new steady state after the shift in policy.                     Moreover,     the wealth in the

housing stock qH * H will also be unchanged, with                            falling while the

physical housing stock H rises.                     In the new steady state, the decline in land

wealth will be matched by a rise in net foreign assets,19

     To calculate the long-run decline in land wealth note that the price of a

unit of land falls in equiproportionto the drop in the price of food.                                      This

causes the value of a housing unit to fall by a smaller proportion,                                since land

constitutes only a fraction of the value of a house.                         The change in the level

of          is simply v multiplied by the change in                      The change in the quantity

of housing is the inverse of the change in                         since the product               * H does

not change.            The change in H determines the change in F, since H                        +    F    —     L.
                     we can now calculate the total decline in land wealth,                           * F,
Therefore,

since we have derived the fall in F, and know the fall in qF already.                                  The


                                                        23
rise in     in the steady state must match the fall in          *   F,   in order that

total wealth remains unchanged.

   As we will see in the next subsection, the dynamic adjustment path is more

complicated, however,    because the shift in policy spurs a rise in the physical

quantity of the housing stock and the stock of non-residential            structures.    Ac

the time of the liberalization,   housing investment rises, tending to drive the

economy into a temporary current account deficit.          The boom in housing is

short-lived   (indeed instantaneous    in this particular model)     ,   however, and   the

economy moves to trade surplus.       Thus, the net foreign asset stock initially

falls, but then rises again to above the initial level.

   In the more carefully specified simulation model of the next section, the

investment boom in housing extends beyond the first period.              This is because

housing investment in the more elaborate model is supplied by a construction

industry,   that produces houses with a rising marginal cost in the short term.

Thus there are 'external" costs of adjustment in the short-run housing boom,

with the price of housing being bid up by the limited capacity of the

construction industry.    This short-run rise in construction costs has the

effect of spreading out over several periods the adjustment of the physical

stock of housing.

   We can similarly use the theoretical framework to study the effects of

other types of changes in land policy.         Consider,   for example, a policy of

reducing the current tax preferences      in favor of agricultural land, which are

proxied by the subsidy s in the model.         It is simplest to study a reduction of

a in the free-trade version of the model, in which domestic food prices are

fixed at world levels.     In this case, the presence of the subsidy drives up

the value of a unit of land       in the amount s/r, and thereby drives up the


                                          24
value of a unit of housing,                 since            is equal   (   u + v *

   Since       * H is a fixed multiple of               Q, the rise         in      due to the subsidy s

must be matched by         a   fall in the physical housing stock H.                   Since total land

is equal to L       F +    vH,     lower H means greater F.              In summary, a subsidy to

agricultural    land raises the price of farmland, and causes a shift in land

allocation from housing to farmland.

   Note that the subsidy on farm land must be financed with offsetting taxes.

Each period the subsidy is a *             F,    so that the discountedvalue of offsetting

taxes is T      (   a * F )/ r      .   Note     that the value of farm land net of taxes is


qFT  + s)/r    * F             (s * F)/r    —
                                                         -

                       -
                                                                                                      is

fixed on world markets.

   Now, suppose that a is reduced from a positive level to zero.                            Clearly,       the

housing stock H will rise and                   will fall, with             * H remaining unchanged in

the new equilibrium.           The value of land net of taxes is reduced, since F will

fail as H rises.      Total wealth must remain unchanged,                        as do housing wealth and

human wealth, while farm wealth net of taxes must fall,                            Therefore,   net

foreign assets       must rise.         Once again, the shift in policy causes a rise in

the physical stock of housing, as well as a rise in the long-run net foreign

investment position.           The result, therefore,            is likely to be a short-run

current account deficit as the investment boom in housing takes places,

followed by even greater current account surpluses in the future as households

rebuild their stocks of wealth.

   As a third kind of experiment, consider a shift in zoning which allows for

more housing per unit of land.             A    simple example would be an easing of

restrictions on the construction of high-rise apartment buildings.                              In this


                                                    25
case, the parameter v is caused to fall, since                      v   measures the land input to a

unit of housing service.        Consider the implications under a free trade regime,

in which        is fixed on world markets.            When v falls, the value of a unit of

                                                                                              v
housing will also decline in the steady state, since                                  — u +       *
                                                                                                      F—U+V*
       / r).   The fall in      results in a rise in H in the long term,                                  since        the


product of          and H are fixed. Therefore,           as in the previous example, the land

in farms, F, must fall, and the value of wealth in farmland must also decline.

The result will be an offsetting           increase in         .        Once again, the likely time

path for the economy will be that the reduction in v is followed by a housing
boom and current account deficits in the short term, and a sequence of even

larger current account surpluses in the future.



Dynamic Adjustments to the Policy Changes



    With a little preliminary rewriting of the equations,                               the dynamic


adjustment     process is surprisingly easy to specify.                          We focus here on the

example of trade liberalization.               The other cases can be worked out by close

analogy.       The key is to consider the dynamics of wealth adjustment.                                    Total

wealth is equal to W —       Q /   (r + p)       +        * F       +            * H     +            -    T       .    From

the housing arbitrage        condition,          — u +v *                   ,   so we can     see that                 * F +

    * H —       *   (F + V * H) + u *            —         *    L       +       U * H    —        *   L+ K         ,   where

L is    total land, and K is the stock of housing capital.                              Moreover,         for all of

                                                                                                               —
the experiments       that we are considering,                is fixed            (   usually at                   pF/r —
l/r )    after the policy change.          Thus, we may write:

W                                                     -
    — Q / (r + p) +
                         q*L       +   K   +     5        T    .    Along         the adjustment path, the


following variables are fixed:             Q, r, p,                L, and T.            Thus, in rate of


                                                     26
change form, along the                   edjusment                       path we have:



 (16)         W   —   NE             K       +       B                                       -




&lh tO nto                                                               however, U will change discretely when

changes discretely.                  Let
                                                 d(W0) signify the discrete change in wealth at the
instant of the policy change.                                    At the instant of the change, the only possible

wealth effects are the change in                                             and the change in T, since the sum                        K + B

is       fixed at any instant.                   Thus:




(17)                                              *          L           -
              d<W0)                d(q0)                                       d(T0)


(In the trade liberalizationexample,                                                         0 ).
                                     d(T0)
     Now, turn to the balance of payments condition                                                   (15).       We know that Q        +
*    H    +           *    F   + rB           can be rewritten as                            r *      NE      +    (r+p)   *       E, where NE

is non-human wealth and E is human wealth.2°                                                 Then, since C —           (d      +   p) * U, we
have:




(18)       B      —   (r-d)    * E       *       (r      -       d   -
                                                                             )*     NE   -
                                                                                              I


Now, bring I to the LHS                   of      (18)               and use (16) to write:



(19)       W      —   (r-d)    *    E     +      (r          -   d       -
                                                                             p) *   NE




Finally, define ne —                     NE      -       NE          ,    where NE is            the steady-state value of NE.

Then, since E is constant in (19), and since                                             W   —    E   + NE, we can re-write (19)


                                                                              27
as:




(20)     ne   —     -   (d + p     -
                                       r)   *    ne



      At any instant, the housing market must clear.                          Since there are no costs of


adjustment in housing investment the housing stock can change discretely at

any instant in order to maintain housing market equilibrium.                            This discrete

change should be thought of as a very sharp, short-term housing boom, one

which would be spread out over time in the presence of costs of adjustment to

                                  Market clearing in housing requires that                   * H    —

market clearing in housing requires that:

                             5H

At the moment of a policy change, both U and                             fall, and the nstantaneouse

effect on housing demand is indeterminate.                         On the one hand, wealth falls,

depressing housing demand.                      On the other hand, the price of housing falls.

For a small change in                       a simple calculation establishes          the following

proposition:

      The demand for housing rises (falls) on impact as long as the

      initial value share of land costs in total housing exceeds (is less than)

the initial share of land wealth in total wealth.

The condition for a rise in housing demand upon a fall in                               is almost surely

satisfied,        since actual data suggests that the share of land costs in housing

appears to be well above the share of land wealth in total wealth (includina


                                                              2B
                         Note that in long-run equilibrium, K                  rise   after a fall
 in       since the numerator in (21) returns to its pre-policy change level (L.e.

 W recovers to its       initial value)    while         ifl   the   denominator is   permanently

 reduced.

      At the moment of the policy change, the housing capital stock
                                                                    changes

 discretely in the amount         d(K0).
                                               How is this discrete change in H financed?

The answer is: foreign borrowing,              i.e. the country runs an instantaneous

current account deficit to finance the jump in K at the moment of the policy

change.       In particular, we have:
                                                                                        -




                                                                                -
 (22)                                      -
                                                   -
         d(0)             d(K0)



      Along   the path of adjustment, wealth rises, and
                                                        according to (21) so does
K.     The adjustmentpath is one of rising K, B, and overall non-human wealth

NE.21



      We can now finally put the pieces of the
                                               dynamics                 together.     Consider the
effects of a trade liberalization          that reduces              from a high, autarky level

to the lower world level.         On impact            falls, and so therefore does overall

wealth.       ne    which measures the gap between NE and its steady State value,

becomes negative.        Also, the demand for housing rises instantaneously                 because
of the fall in land costs, and so the housing
                                              capital stock jumps discretely
at the moment of impact, with the investment boom
                                                  being financed by foreign
borrowing.         Over time, non-human wealth NE recovers to its long-run level, as

the economy runs current account                          and accumulates net foreign claims
                                 surpluses,

B.    In the long     run, B rises above its initial value.              Along this path of


                                                 29
current account surpluses and              rising   wealth, the housing stock also rises,

according to (21).



Some Spatial Considerations




    Our model certainly overpredcts the wealth effects of a change in food

prices,    since land is treated homogeneously,              and jJ.   land   in the economy,

whether in    art   agricultural district or in the Cinza, is assumed to fall in the

same proportion.        In fact, the value of land in advantageous locations will

command a market price above the price available in agriculture, and the

proportionate drop in land values will be less than for agricultural land.                         In

this section we talk about some of the implications of introducing locational

rents as a way to relax the unsatisfactoryassumption of homogeneous                       land.

    Consider the following elementary extension of the model.                     Suppose that

proportion n         of the population lives in the central city, and proportion                   1-

n   lives in the outside of the city.               All farm land is in the outside of the

city as well.        For the moment, suppose that because of the capacity of public

amenities,    the placement of job sites, etc., there is no migration of

households between the two zones, so that the proportions                     n   and   1-n are

fixed.    The two regions differ only in terms of land availability.                     In the

city, land is fixed at                   and is used entirely in housing,         L,,   whtle in

the outskirts,       total   L   is equml to             —        +       .    Urban land is

scarce, so that the man-land ratio is much higher than in the outside of the

city:     n/LC >>      (1-n)/L0      .     For   all of the equilibria that we will look at,

we will also assume that n/LC >
                                                  (l.n)/L0    .




    Aside from      location,    all households have identical tastes.             In particular,


                                                    30
            they allocate an equal share of                  their consumption to housing.                     Under these

            assuciprions, the land price in the city will of course                              he higher than the land

            price in the outside of the city.                   In particular,                   —       n *    (d   + p) * V /

            (15 / v)     ,    and
              0                                                0                         C           0

                                                                                     H       >           -     In   the

            outskirts, we have          p°   —   u   *   r     +    v   *      where
                                                                                         q       is the value of a unit

            of land in agriculture.          Note that when                   changes,       say because of a

            lberalizarion in trade, only in the outskirts                           of the city will the price of

            housing change.

                  it can easily be checked that all of the earlier conclusions will still

            apply concerning the constancy of the ratios of Q to all of the forms of

            wealth.     The magnitude of the wealth effects of the policy change will now be

            considerably smaller, however,               because only          (1-n) proportion                of the

            population will experience a fall in land prices, and a consequent reduction
            in housing prices.

                  Now suppose that there is free nobility across the two regions.                                         Suppose

            that the urban center is preferred because of amenities (e.g. schools,                                           social

            services,        public transport, etc.),              The population will sort itself out until

            individuals are indifferent to living in the two regions.                                    This will occur

            when the costs of housing in the urban center are sufficiently above the costs

            in the outskirts to compensate for the difference in amenities. Now, when

            agricultural lard prices change, land prices both in the city and the

            outakirta        will change, becausa lower land prices in the periphery will induce

out-migration from the center, thereby relieving demand for the scare urban land.                                            It is

            still probably the case,         however,         that the proportionate decline in land

            prices in the outskirts will be higher, and perhaps significantly so, than the


                                                                    31
proportionate    decline   in land prices in the center.



Section 5.     Structural Change and the balance of Payments in    A   Dynamic Multi-

Sectoral Simulation Model




   In this section, we attempt to take a step toward empirical implementation

of the preceeding model by specifying a more appropriate multi-sectoral

simulation model of the Japanese economy.       The exercises   in this section are

still not true "empirical' estimates in the normal sense, however, for two

reasons,     First, the model itself is in a very preliminary form (we offer it

here   as a spur to research more than an illustration of finished research).

While we a still rather crude attempt to calibrate the model to mimic the

Japanese economy, we do not make econometric estimates of the key behavioral

relations    in the model, but rather make "guesstimates of parameter values,

These guesses must be subjected to statistical scrutiny in later work.

   The model that we will describe takes as given the values of key variables

in the international economy, especially U.S. interest rates and the levels of

output in the U.S.   ,   Europe and the developing countries.   We are planning in

the near future to integrate      this model into the multi-country    simulation

model that we discussed at the beginning of the paper, both to study the

effects of foreign policies on Japan, as well as to allow for the effects of

Japanese policy on international variables such as U.S. -dollar interest rates,



   The model is described in some detail in the appendix.        It is a five-sector

model of the Japanese economy, focussing on: food, manufacturing,        services,

durables,   and construction.    The "durables" sector is a sector that produces


                                          32
equipment   capital for investment, as well as non-housing    consumer durables for

households.    The manufacturing   sector includes all manufacturing except that

whIch    is produced by the durable goods sector.   These sectors each use primary

inputs (capital and labor, and land in the case of food arid construction)        to

produce value added, which is then combined with inputs of the other sectors,

and with imported Intermediate inputs, to produce final outputs,       In addition,

the agriculture sector and the housing sector use land in producing value

added.

   An input-output structure among the sectors is specifIed, with the input

requirements   depending an relative prices in the economy.     The input-output

structure   works as follows.   All sectors use manufacturing   and services as

intermediate    inputs, while food, durables, and construction are not

intermediate inputs into the other sectors.     The durables sector, as just

indicated, produces the good used for equipment investment      throughout the

economy, as well as the non-housing durables for households.       The construction

sector produces physical capital for housing, and physical capital for non-

residential    structures.

   The housing Sector i5 specified slightly differently from the preceeding

theoretical model, though without important economic effect.       In the

simulationmodel, owners of housing physical capital do not own the land under

their buildings.    Rather, they rent the land each period, at the same rental

rate as the land in agriculture.     Since the discountedvalue of those rents is

equal to the value of a unit of land, the owners of housing are indifferent            to

paying a per-period rental (as in this model) or to owning the land, as in the

theoretical model of the previous section.

   Empirically, we allow for heterogeneity in land holdings by assuming that


                                         33
land in the urban centers is a fixed constant price above the price of land at

the periphery (where the agriculture/housing        margin is shifting).    Thus, when


agricu.tural    land values decline, so to do urban land prices, by the same

absolute   amount (and obviously, by a smaller proportionate amount).         In the

calibration of the model, we assume that urban land not at the margin of

substItution averages approximately three ttmes the value of agricultural

land.

   Each of the sectors is assumed to be perfectly coOpetltive, wIth value-

maximizing firms         In each period, the capital stock in the sector is given,
                                                                           Thus the wage

sectoral changes are ignored at this point.         The nominal wage is set one


period in advance, at a level that in expectation will be compatible with full

employment.     Thus, in the absence of a contemporaneous                   disturbance,

made to reflect the high degree of flexibility of Japanese labor costs in

response to disturbances       in the economy, though the assumed flexibility is

perhaps    too extreme    in the current version,

      Firms make investment decisions subject to convex costs of adjustment         in

the    firms   capital stock, along the lines of Hayaahi (1982).        This makes the

firm's investment decision a function of Tobin's         q,   which is the ratio of the

firm's equity value to the replacement cost of capital.            In this now-familiar

specification,     shocks to the sector which increase current and future

profitability     lead to a rise in Tobin's q, which may be thought of as the

discounted value of future marginal products of capital, divided by the

replacement cost of capital.        The rise in Tobin's q then induces an


                                            34
accumulation of capital in the sector.          Over time, as the capital stock

increases,    there is a decline in the marginal product of capital today and in

the future.     Tobin's q falls, and the investment boom subsides.

   The fact that firms make investment decfsons based on rational

expectations    of the entire time path of future profitability sets this model

apart from Standard CCE models, which typically Specify myopic investment

behavior.     Sachs has assumed dynamic investment optimizatIon in several

aarlier simulation models, such as in Lipton and Sachs         (1983) and dynamic

models of McKfbbin and Sachs.     Most of those earlIer models focussed however,

on the interaction of everal one-sector economies.          A recent eXtension of the

Tobin's q approach to a one-country model with a multi-sectoral economy Is

tax   code changes on U.S.   investment.   The present paper is close in spirit to

that of Coulder and Summers, though unlike the Coulder and Summers study. our

model is a monetary model, and allows for a full linkage of the economy to

internatIonal    trade and capital markets.

   We assume that the economy is completely open to international           movements of

capital,    and that domestic and foreign assets are perfect subatitutes,        in the

sense that expected yields on yen and dollar (fe.          international)   assets are

equalized period to period.      The world interest rate in dollars is fixed, so

that the period-to-periodexpected return on domestic assets, when expressed

In dollars (i.e. when corrected for expected changes in the exchange rate), is

fixed at the international    level,   All domestic assets are also considered       to

be perfect substitutes among themselves.         Thus, the financial   yields on land,

housing, domestic equities in each sector, government bonds, and foreign

bonds, all have the same ax ante returns in every period.               Household

behavior is along the lines of Slanchard(].985) as described in the previous

section,   Households with a random time horizon, and a fixed probability of

death each period, make optimizing   incerteniporal consumption   dectsions.   Once

the total amount of consumption each period is decided upon, the consumption

spending is allocated to several final goods according to a Cobb-Douglas

utility function.   Thus, the share of consumption allocated      to the various


consumption goods is fixed.   The consumption goods are: food, housing, other

consumer durabies, other consumer non-durables,      The other consumer non-

durablas include domestic goods as well as imported final goods.

   Consumer durabies are handled in a special way, deserving separate note.

We assume that there is a separate consumer durabies industry that rents

consumer durables (which we define to include housing and all other durables)

to the household sector,   The supply of durables thus depends on the

investment decisions of the durables sector, and the rental rates on consumer

durables clear the durables market period to period,

   The model is specIfied in non-linear form, and then numerically linearized

around an initial equilibrium.   Certain variables    are linearized   in the levels

(generally, output quantities), while other variables     are linearized   in the

logs (in most part, wages, prices, and the exchange rate).        This strategy is

followed for computational purposes.    The linearization helps us to solve

efficiently for the rational expectations path of the economy, as well as to

calculate optimal policy rules given a prespecified intertemporal quadratic

loss function for the economy    (However, we do not compute any optimal policy

rules in this paper.)

   To summarize, the model is an elaborated computable general equilibrium

(CGE) models of the Japanese economy, with several features that Set it apart

from standard COB models.         First, And most important,            it is truly dynamic,

with firms and households making dynamic savings and investmant decisions

based on rational expectations of the future aconomic environment.                        In


contrast, most COB models have static decision functions                    for savings and

investment.       Second, it gives special focus to the nexus of land in housing

and agricultural production, which is the focus of our analysis.



Simulation Results

-     At   this prelLminary stage of investigating and calibrating the model, we

present only two simulations,            The experiment      is a liberalization     of food

    imports (as noted earlier, experiments involving            land tax changes might be

more relevant for the current policy discussions; we will pursue these other

simulations in later work).            We assume that domestic food prices are 50

percent above world levels, and are kept there by a fully prohibitive tariff.
The tariff iS      then   removed instantly and permanently         in the first year of the

    simulation.   We study two cases of the Blanchard model: p                 .01 (expected tire

horizon — 100 years) and p — .05 (expected time horizon — 20 years)

       Consider the longer time horizon first, as sho%m in Table 3.                 As soon as

food imports are liberalized, the price of food in nominal Yen terms falls by

38 percent, while the Yen exchange rate depreciates by 13.4 percent.                           (The

overall effect is a decline in $              prices   of 50 percent)   .   Land wealth    falls by

38 percent of ONP, and        tot:.1   wealth falls by 29.6 percent of CNP.           Since the

change in consumption is         (d +    p)    times the change in wealth, with d—.05 and

p—.01, we find a change in consumptionof 1.78 percent of GNP.                      Because of the

fall in land prices, value added in agrcu1ture falls by 0.91 percent of CNP.

As the housing capital stock rises, further encroaching on land utilization in

agriculture,    the agricultural output falls further, reaching a decline of 1.84

percent of GNP by the fifth year.

   The decline in consumption causes savings tp         rise,   in this case by 1.11

percent of GNP.     At   the   same time, though, there is a significant increase in

structures investment, both in housing and in non-residential          structures.     The

overall investment ratio rises by 1.09 percent of ON? in the first year, and

remains at 1.11 percent of ON? above baseline for the following few years.

Note that the savings rate begins to fall in the second year, so that the rise

in investment exceeds the rise in savings, thereby sending the current account

into deficit.     By the third year, the current account deficit is about 0.3

percent of GNP relative to the baseline, and by the fifth year the current

account deficit is about 0.5 percent of ON? relative to the baseline.

   Unlike the theoretical model, there is no one-time boom in housing or

structures.     Because the construction industry is only about 10 percent of

ON?, the rise in structures investment        of about 1.4 percent of ON? is a

significant    increase in output in the industry, which strains its capacity,

causing the investment boom to be spread Out for several years.

   Finally, notice the sectoral distribution of output in the years following

the shock.     Naturally, the agricultural       sector is the big loser, with a very

sharp drop in output.      All other sectors show some increase in output, with

construction showing the biggest gain in value added originating.

   The simulation in Table 4 carries out the same exercise but with shorter-

lived households.    We expect from the theoretical discussion that the wealth

effect of the land decline will hit consumption harder in this case, with the

result that the rise in savings should be larger.          In fact, there is now a     L7
percent of ON? increase in the savthgs rate in the year of the shock, which

Section   6.    Conclusions and Extensions




     The taking-off point for this paper is the current Japanese policy goal of

stimulating domestic demand,       That policy aim has several motivations:             (1)   to

counteract contractionary effects of a shift in the U.S. policy mix towards

fiscal contraction and monetary ease; (2) to reduce Japan's trade surplus in

order to reduce protectionist      pressures      in the rest of the world; and (3) to

rectify dtstortions in the Japanese economy that give advantage to foreign

investment over domestic housing investment.            We argued in Section     2   of this

paper the Keynesian case (argument I) for a policy-led demand expansion is

rather weak empirically and theoretically.            The shift in the U.S. policy mix

is unlikely to have highly deflationary consequences             for the Japanese economy;

indeed the changes could well be expansionary.              We also noted, however, that

even with a substantial shift in the U.S. policy mix, Japan's external

surpluses were likely to remain large.            Therefore,   if there is indeed a

pressing case for reducing those surpluses, further policy actions would

likely be necessary.      We pointed out two actions that would almost surely be

effective,      though perhaps at high   cost: a return to the large budget deficits

of   the late   1970s, and a return to capital controls,          The unattractivenessof

these   measures has   led   policymakers   to   consider   additional ways to   spur

                                             39
private investment, particularly housing investment.

   These possible measures,          involving changes in land-use policy, are the

focus   of sectIons 3 and 4     of   the paper.   Several kinds of policy measures were

considered:    (1)    trade liberalization   in foodstuffs;   (2)   changes in zoning

ordinances; and (3) changes in the tax treatment of agricultural             and housing

real estate.     We introduced a theoretical model to study the interactions of

land, savings        and investment.    The purpose of this model was to emphasize a

number of linkages which are particular to Japan, and could have important

implications    for the affects of policy upon the Japanese economy.           The   key
point from this discussIon is that these policies have effects both on
investment    and savings, often with indeterminate signs.           In general, policies

that reduce agricultural land values tend to raise savings, the external

surplus, and the net foreign investment position, while at the same tIme such

policies tend to raise housing invesment, thereby lowering the external

surplus and the net foreign Investment position.          In the models that we

studied,    the housing effect is necessarily short-lived.           In the long run, the

savings    effects dominate,     Most of the policies considered that would

contribute to a short run housing boom would also lead to current account

surpluses    in the longer term, and an actual      jein            the economy's net

foreign asset position.        We emphasize that these results are derived from a

highly stylized model of the Japanese economy, and that more definitive
results could only be obtained by carefully
                                            examining the other important

linkages which we have discussed above, but have nor chosen to focus on in

this paper.

   A multi-sectoral      simulation model was then introduced, to begin the process

of quantifying some of these effects.          We stressed the rudimentary nature of


                                             40
the empirical    estimates, but presented   them both to give an order of magnitude

and to encourage    further empirical investigation       of these issues.   e   noted

that the size of the current account effects from the policy changes depends

               on the nature of intertemporal consumption behavior,          The more
importantly

short-lived    are the horizons of households,     the more likely it is that a

reduction of land prices would produce a rise in the external surplus, rather

than the fall that is goal of the policy.

   Let us conclude wtth several obseriations about the research agenda in this

area.   In our view, it wIll be fruitful to proceed with a more careful

quantificatIonand specificatIon of a model like that presented in Section .

Most importantly, we need to broaden the scope of our theoretical work in

order to determine    the relatIve Importance      of the various tax and trade

                                                          In empirical work, much more
policies in maIntaining the high price of land,
information must be included about the patterns of land use in Japan, and the

technical     tradeoffs between alternative uses of land.       Even rudimentary

information such as the average ratios of land to fixed capital in various

uses should be investigated more fully.          Also,   the response of that ratio to

relative price changes should be examined econometrically.

   It should be possible to test directly for the effects of land prices on

the cost of housing and on the demand for housing.            Moreover, the links of

land prices to agricultural policies could also be studied fruitfully.             The

extraordinary premium of rice prices above world market levels is a relatively

recent phenomenon, dating back to the late l960s, when the regulations

involving price maintenance for rice were changed.             From the early 1960s to

the late l960s the premium of the domestic price of rice over the import price

of rice rose from about 20 percent to more than 100 percent.22            It should be


                                            41
    possible to study the effect of this policy change on contemporaneous         land

    prices and land use patterns.       Another area where quantification is

    importantly needed is on the effects of tax policies on land allocation

    decisions.     Little seems to be known rigorously about the overall effective

    tax rates on the different uses of land.

       The model has so far neglected various potentially important linkages of

    housing investment with other forms of spending, that could significantly

    affect the quantitative estimates.       Various kinds of consumer durables

    expenditures,    such   a   on furniture and household appliances, are complementary

-   with housing    investment,    It is widely believed that Japans relatively low

    stock of housing relative to income is matched by a lowsupply of other

    consumer durables relative to income.       Indeed, an important reason for the

    difference in U.S. and Japanese household savings rates is the fact that

    American households save a much larger share of income in the form of consumer

    durables (which typically gets counted as part of consumption rather than

    savings).     To the extent that a decrease in land prices stimulates housing

    demand it is likely that it would also stimulate the demand for other

    consumer durables, thereby increasing the liklihood in the short rim of a

    significant    reduction in the external surplus. Similarly,    one presumes that

    many forms of public investment spending (e.g. on sewage and roads) should

    also rise in tandem with a housing boom.       These complementarityeffects in

    private demand can be investigated through empirical estimation of copsulner

    demand systems.

      A further major area for empirical
                                         investigation is the fiscal implications
    of the land-use policies.       The current policies of high internal price support

    for food, for example,       have large direct budgetary consequences.   A   reduction


                                              42
of such price supports would not only lower internal land prices but also free

up government resources for public investment spending.         (In our theoretLcal

model, we assumed that reduction in substdies s were matched by reductions           tn

taxes T; alternatively   we could have allowed for reductions      in a to finance

increases   in public sector investment).     Similarly,   land sales by the

                                                  that could also provide the
government would probably reap enormous revenues,

fiscal base for higher public investment spending.

   An   important theoretical area   that should be investigated further involves
the   welfare and distributional implications of alternative      policy changes.

One of the motivations   for many of the    proposd changes in land-use policy       ts

the current market distortion againat housing investment.         How large are the

welfare costs of such distortions, and how would the welfare of different

generations   and different sectors be affected by elimination of those

distortions?

2.  Bergstert and Cline contended in late 1985 that "Japan, as the second
largest economy in the world and perhaps the major beneficiary of an open
trading system, must alter its fiscal policy substantially and go the extra
mile to deal with the criticisms so widely leveled against its trade
policies.    See Bergsten, C. F. and W. R. Cline, "The United States   Japan
Economic Problem", Institute for International Economics No. 13, October
1985, p. 129, More recently, Marris has argued for a Japanese fiscal
expansion: "Europe and Japan have not yet taken expansionary fiscal policy
action on the scale needed to offset the inevitable negative drag on their
growth as the US trade deficit is elfminated." In Marris, S., "Deficits and
the Dollar Revisited", Institute of International Economics, August 1987 p. 39.

3.  Th& role of strUctural policy measures, especially fn the area df land
use, has been a major point of emphasis in several important commissions in
Japan, including the Okita Advisory Committee for External Economic Relations,
April 1985, and the two reports of the Maekawa Commission.

4.  According to OECD estimates, the 1987 fiscal expansion amounted to
approximately a 0.3 percent of ON? rise in the structural deficit in Japan.
Some commentators have attributed Japan's recent rise in domestic demand to
this modest stimulus. In our view, more of the explanation lies in: (1)
falling real interest rates; (2) rising household wealth; (3) the terms of
trade improvement in Japan following the 1986 decline in oil prices, which
only recently have been pasied on to consumers.

5.  This calculation is based on the assumption that Japan pegs the money
supply, and not the interest rate. The U.S. policy mix causes Japanese short-
term tnterest rates to fall. If Japan instead pegged the interest tate, it
might choose to reduce the money supply in response to the U.S. policy
measures, and this could turn the mildly stimulative effect into a mildly
contractionary effect.

6. The U.S. number probably             the land share of value, since the 31
percent is estimated as the total value of non-farm land in the U.S. divided
by the sum of this value plus the value of net structures. Some of the land
counted in this ratio probably includes land that is not associated with
structures.  The 35 percent estimate is taken from a study of Hayashi, Ito,
and Slemrod (1987), who cite a 1982 survey of the ministry of construction.

7.   Cited   itt             "Japan Survey", December 5, 1987, p. 31

8. To the extent that land and government bonds are highly substitutable
financial assets in private portfolios, and to the extent that government
purcahses of land have little affect upon the price of land, a bond-financed
purchase of land would have little effect on aggregate demand.

9.  The price of housing land in Tokyo rose by about 95% in 1987, prompting
protests at the Bank of Japan's low interest rare policies, which were accused
of fueling land speculation. In all of Japan, land prices rose only by about
7%, however. (Data from The Economist, December 5, 1987)

l1.From personal correspondence with Mitsuhiro Fukac, Bank of Japan. The
majority of the remaining land (67% of total area) is covered by forests.

12.Roughly 10% of the labor force is reported to be employed in agriculture, a
much higher number than in other OECD countries, though part of the
discrepancy Is due to the large number of japanese whom report they are part-
time farmers In order to take advantage of certain fiscal benefits,

13. The interim report of the Maekawa Cemmisson made the following
observations' '2,4.1 The Enhancement of housing and social stock crucially
hinges upon the eclution of land problems; in particular, the prothotion of
land supply is indispensable. 2.4.2 there iS an urgent need to undertake
far-reaching measures in large urban areas in order to ensure the promotion of
the orderly supply of housing land and the stability of land prices. 2,4.3
In so doing, it Is necessary to implement specific policies with specIal
attention to: a the redistrIbutIon of space (e.g. easing regulatIons and
restrictions regarding the landfIll reclamation of public waters, promoting
the conversion of paddy land to other uses in urbanization promotion areas,
and reviewIng zoning regulations), b.  the intensive use of land (e.g. easing
regulations regarding on total floor space and promoting urban redevelopment
work to meet the need for more offices and other commercial sites), c. the
greater use of unused or under utilIzed sites (e.g. promoting the thore
efficIent use of government- and corporate-owned sites and encouraging the
conversIon of abandoned plant sites to housirg sItes), d. the utilIzatIon of
new modalities of housing land supply (e.g. formulas allowing joint-use with
the landowner, including land trust formulas and tenancy formulas), a,   the
utilization of tax policy to promote the supply of housing land. (e.g.
strengthening the application of taxation on agricultural land in urbanization
promotion areas to more approximate tax rates on residential land), and f.
the stabIlization of land prices (e.g. utilizing the National Land Use
Planning Act and levying hIgher tax rates on very short-term real estate
trading).

(Chairman: Maruo Maekawa), December 1, 1986.

14.  One interesting preliminary attempt to quantify the potential effects of
the Meekawa Commission recommendations is Takenaka and Ishli (1987). This
otherwise informative study does not, however, attempt to explain the precise
economic channels through which the ?taekawa recommendations would operate.

15.      It is useful to make a small point about the political economy of land
use   in
       Japan. There are important and well known    politicalexplanations for
the current land use policies in place. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party
is has long derived important support from rural areas, which are
disproportionately represented in the Japanese Diet. Agricultural groups

                                       49
contribute heavily to political campaigns and spend considerable sums in
political lobbying. Many of the policy changes that we will consider would be
difficult to carry out politically.  Our focus in this paper is on the
economic implications of various possible policy changes, and not on the
lklihood of their implementation.


l6.Throughout the paper we assume that individuals are able to "pierce the
corporate and fiscal veil". Given that a large amount of land ifl Tokyo, and
elsewhere in Japan, is owned by the corporate and public sector, we are
assuming that the fall in these land values will be reflected in stock prices
and future tax              liabilities,
                            and individuals will fully perceive these changes

         wealth,

                                    November 1987, pp. 299-314, for further
details on the open-economy version of the Blanchard model.

     in a simple economy where expenditure shares remain constant, i.e. a case
where consumer demand functions are Cobb-Douglas, and where the liquidity
constraint requires that agents pay a fixed proportion of the total cost of a
houae as a down payment, then the steady-state expenditure on housing would
not change as long as steady-state income did not change. If the policy
considered had no effect upon the nature of the liquidity constraint in the
housing market, than, in a model such as ours, the steady-state level of
aggregate wealth in the economy would be unaffected.

19.We assume throughout the text that the equilibrium is an interior solution
where some land is used in the agricultural sector so that the marginal
product land is determined by the price of food.

                                                  producing sectors: food,
 manufacturing services, durables and constructton,  Each sector purchases
 manufactures and services as intermediate iflUtZ and uses durables and the

 production functions have a nested Cobb-Douglas farm, and each sector uses
 three non-produced inputs  labour, raw materials and energy    The agricultural
 sector, as discussed below, also uses land as a

    The construction of housing and structures receives
                                                         special treatment in

and the construction good. The arbitrage condition for

rental price of a house is determined by

                                                      one-period lag. Supply

assumed to combine a fixed proportionof land per unit of the construction

equations which equate the present discounted values of the marginal product
of structures with the discounted cost of the
                                              required rents on land and

permit the reader to examine the parametization and specification of key
equations. A discussion of the remaining equations and the general
framework of the model is given in Appendix 1.

Structures and Housinz:

     As discussed in the text, we have assumed that each unit of- structures
and housing require one unit of the constriction good pius a fixed amount
of land. The initial paramterization may be expressed in value ta-ms. and
we have chosen the value shares               of land th the total cost of
one unit of structures and housing as       respectively.   09H
