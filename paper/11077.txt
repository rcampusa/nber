                                             ABSTRACT

The hypothesis that interest rate differentials are unbiased predictors of future exchange rate

movements has been almost universally rejected in empirical studies. In contrast to previous studies,

which have used short-horizon data, we test this hypothesis using interest rates on longer-maturity

bonds for the U.S., Germany, Japan and Canada. The results of these long-horizon regressions are

much more positive – the coefficients on interest differentials are of the correct sign, and most are

closer to the predicted value of unity than to zero. These results are robust to the use of different data

frequencies, sample periods, yield definitions, and base currencies. We appeal to an econometric

interpretation of the results, which focuses on the presence of simultaneity in a cointegration

framework.

1. INTRODUCTION

        One of the key stylized facts in the international finance literature is that interest rate

differentials fail to predict subsequent exchange rate movements in accord with the

“unbiasedness hypothesis”. Rather, much more common is the finding that exchange rates move

in a manner opposite that predicted; for instance Froot and Thaler (1990) report few cases where

the sign of the coefficient on interest rate differentials in exchange rate prediction equations is

consistent with the unbiasedness hypothesis, and not a single case where it exceeds the

theoretical value of unity.1

        As pointed out in Chinn and Meredith (2004), one notable aspect of almost all published

studies is that the unbiasedness hypothesis has been tested using financial instruments with

relatively short maturities, generally of 12 months or less. This focus made sense given the

brevity of the floating rate period, and the dearth of longer maturity interest rate data. Since these

constraints have been partly relieved in recent years, this paper tests the unbiasedness hypothesis

using instruments of longer maturity than those employed in past studies. Our results for the

dollar-based exchange rates of the major industrial countries differ strikingly from those obtained

using shorter horizons. For instruments with constant maturities of 5 years, all of the coefficients

on interest rate differentials in the unbiasedness regressions are of the correct sign. Furthermore,

it is never possible to reject the null hypothesis of a slope coefficient equal to unity.

        The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the unbiasedness hypothesis,

          Exceptions include Flood and Rose’s (1996) results for intra-EMS exchange rates, and
Frankel and Poonawala’s (2004) findings for emerging markets. Interestingly, Chaboud and
Wright (2003) find that UIP holds for major currencies at extremely high frequencies, such as
intraday.

through 2000. Section 3 presents estimates of the unbiasedness hypothesis using data on

government bond yields for Germany, Japan, Canada and the United States. Section 4 provides

an econometric rationalization for the results that are obtained. Section 5 provides concluding

remarks.



2. A REVIEW OF THE UNBIASEDNESS HYPOTHESIS

        If the conditions for risk-free arbitrage exist,2 the ratio of the forward to the spot exchange

rate will equal the interest differential between assets with otherwise similar characteristics

measured in local currencies,


                                                                                                       (1)


where st is the price of foreign currency in units of domestic currency at time t, ft,t+k is the forward

value of s for a contract expiring k periods in the future (both in logs), it,k is the k-period yield on

the domestic instrument, and i*t,k is the corresponding yield on the foreign instrument. Equation

(1) is a risk-free arbitrage condition that holds regardless of investor preferences. To the extent

that investors are risk averse, however, the forward rate can differ from the expected future spot

rate by a premium that compensates for the perceived riskiness of holding domestic versus

foreign assets. We define the risk premium, , accordingly:




        2
          These conditions include identical default risk and tax treatment, the absence of
restrictions on foreign ownership, and negligible transactions costs.

                                                    2
                                                                                                         (2)



Substituting equation (2) into (1) then allows the expected change in the exchange rate from

period t to period t+k be expressed as a function of the interest differential and the risk premium:


                                                                                                         (3)



       Uncovered interest parity (UIP) refers to the proposition embodied in equation (3) when

the risk premium is zero, and outcome that would occur if investors are risk-neutral.3 In this case,

the expected exchange rate depreciation equals the current interest differential. Equation (3) is

not directly testable since market expectations of future exchange rate movements are never

observable.4

       Typically, the concept UIP is tested jointly with the assumption of rational expectations in

exchange markets. In this case, future realizations of st+k will equal the value expected at time t

plus a white-noise error term   t,t+k   tht is uncorrelated with all information known at t, including

the interest differential and the spot exchange rate:


                                                                                                         (4)


where sret,t+k is the rational expectation of the exchange rate at time t+k formed in time t.

       3
          Note that some approximations and simplifying assumptions have been made in order to
arrive at this expression. See Engel (1996).
       4
        Indirect tests of UIP have been performed using surveys of published forecasts of
exchange rates. Chinn and Frankel (1994; 2002) find mostly positive correlations between the
forward discount and the expected depreciation, which is consistent with UIP.

                                                      3
Substituting equation (4) into (3) yields the following relationship:


                                                                                                       (5)


where the left-hand side of equation (5) is the realized change in the exchange rate from t to t+k.

         Under the unbiasedness hypothesis, the last two terms in equation (5) are assumed to be

orthogonal to the interest differential. Thus, in a regression context, the estimated parameter on

the interest differential will have a probability limit of unity in the following regression:


                                                                                                       (6)


The combined assumptions of no risk premium in equation (3) (i.e. that UIP holds) and rational

expectations is sometimes termed the “risk-neutral efficient-markets hypothesis” (RNEMH). In

this case, the disturbance in equation (6) becomes simply the rational expectations forecast error

 t,t+k, which by definition is orthogonal to all information known at time t, including the interest

differential. The RNEMH is not necessary, however, for the unbiasedness hypothesis to hold. All

that is required is that any risk premium and/or non-rational expectations error be uncorrelated

with the interest differential. RNEMH, however, does imply the somewhat stronger restriction

that no other regressors known at time t should have explanatory power, as the disturbance in

equation (6) will be white noise.

         Regarding the constant term, non-zero values may be explained by Jensen’s inequality,

which implies that the expectation of a ratio is not the same as the ratio of the expectations

(although this term is likely to be small in practice). Alternatively, relaxing the assumption of

risk-neutral investors, the constant term may reflect a constant risk premium demanded by


                                                   4
investors on foreign versus domestic assets. Default risk could play a similar role, although the

latter possibility is less familiar because tests of UIP (as well as CIP) generally use returns on

assets issued in offshore markets by borrowers with comparable credit ratings. In contrast, the

long-term government bonds used for estimation in Section 3 may not share the same default

attributes, so that a pure default risk premium might exist.

       As noted above, estimates of equation (6) using values for k that range up to one year

resoundingly reject the unbiasedness restriction on the slope parameter. The survey by Froot and

Thaler (1990), for instance, finds an average estimate for     of -0.88. Similar results are cited in

surveys by MacDonald and Taylor (1992) and Isard (1995), among others.

       Table 1 updates estimates of equation (6) for the period 1980Q1 to 2000Q4. The

exchange rates of the other six countries were expressed in terms of U.S. dollars, and the 3-, 6-,

and 12-month movements in exchange rates were regressed against differentials in eurocurrency

yields of the corresponding maturity.5 Estimation using the 6- and 12-month horizon data at a

quarterly frequency led to overlapping observations, inducing (under the rational expectations

null hypothesis) moving average (MA) terms in the residuals. Following Hansen and Hodrick

(1980), we used the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimator of Hansen (1982) to

correct the standard errors of the parameter estimates for moving average serial correlation of

order k-1 (i.e., MA(1) in the case of 6-month data and MA(3) in the case of 12-month data).6



       5
          Yields and exchange rates were both constructed as the average of bid and offer rates on
the last trading day of each quarter. Exchange rate movements and interest differentials are
expressed at annual rates.
       6
          Under the null, the a rectangular window should be used. A Bartlett window is used
instead, to guarantee positive semi-definiteness of the variance-covariance matrix.

                                                  5
       The results confirm the failure of UIP over short horizons, similar to other studies. At

each horizon, four of the six estimated coefficients have the “wrong” sign relative to the

unbiasedness hypothesis. The average coefficient is around -0.8, similar to the value in the survey

by Froot and Thaler (1990). Panel estimation with slope coefficients constrained to be identical

across countries yields estimates ranging from about -0.76 at the 3-month horizon to -0.54 at the

12-month horizon.7 In most cases it is possible to reject the hypothesis that   equals unity; in

cases where UIP cannot be rejected, the standard errors of the estimated parameters are quite

large. All of the adjusted R2 statistics (not reported) are very low, and occasionally negative.

Figure 1 provides a graphical depiction of this result for the DM/dollar rate at the 1 year horizon.

       Interestingly, while there is considerable variation over time in the point estimates of ß, in

general there is little evidence that the bias is disappearing, or becoming less pronounced.

Breaking the 1980Q1-2000Q4 sample into three equal sub-periods, we re-estimated equation (6)

for the 3 month horizon. The point estimates are displayed in Figure 2. For each currency, the

three bars denote the ß point estimates for the 1980Q1-86Q4, 1987Q1-93Q4 and 1994Q1-

2000Q4 periods, respectively. Statistically significant deviations from the ß=1 null hypothesis are

denoted by asterisks (since the data are sampled at a quarterly frequency, the issue of overlapping

horizons does not arise in this context).

       As is made apparent by the patterns in the Figure, there are many statistically significant

deviations from the ß=1 in the latest seven year period. Moreover, the point estimates are more

negative in the latter period than in the earliest, with the exception of the U.K. pound/U.S. dollar


       7
          These are fixed effects regressions which allow for a different constant across
currencies. The standard errors are constructed to allow for cross-currency correlations, as well as
serial correlation due to overlapping horizons. See Frankel and Froot (1987) for details.

                                                 6
rate. Thus, one can safely conclude that the forward rate bias phenomenon has not disappeared at

the short horizon.



3. LONG-HORIZON ESTIMATES

3.1 Some basic results

       As noted in the introduction, short-horizon tests of the unbiasedness hypothesis have been

facilitated by the availability of interest rate series that correspond closely to the requirements for

CIP. Data of comparable quality for longer-horizon instruments generally are much less readily

available. In particular, it is difficult to obtain longer-term rates in offshore markets on thickly-

traded instruments of a known fixed maturity. For the purposes of this study, then, we have used

data that are inherently somewhat less pure from the point of view of the UIP hypothesis.

Specifically, these on-shore instruments may be subject to differences in tax regime, capital

controls, etc., such that CIP might be violated. Nonetheless, based on the findings by Popper

(1993) that covered interest differentials at long maturities are not appreciably greater than those

for short (up to one year) maturities, we do not expect that rejections of long-horizon UIP will be

driven by deviations from CIP. Another problem is that some of our interest rate series are for

debt instruments with maturities that only approximate the posited horizons, and are not the zero-

coupon yields that would be exactly consistent with equation (1).

       Even if these data tend to exhibit more “noise” than those used for short-horizon tests of

UIP, for conventional errors-in-variables reasons we would expect the coefficient on the interest

differential in these long-horizon regressions to be biased toward zero, and away from its

hypothesized value of unity. Hence, the results we obtain should be conservative in nature.


                                                   7
        Using constant-maturity 5-year yields for Germany, the U.K., Canada, and the U.S., we

implement regressions of the form of equation (6) over the 1980Q1-2000Q4 period, to match the

sample to that for our short horizon results. The results reported in Table 2 are quite favorable to

the UIP hypothesis: for all three of these currencies, the slope coefficients are statistically

indistinguishable from the implied value of unity. The estimate for the DM is particularly close

to unity at 0.870, while those for the pound and Canadian dollar are closer to zero. However, in

no case can one reject either the null of zero or unit slope.

        Figure 3 presents a scatterplot of the relationship, for the DM/dollar rate again. Here, the

scatterplot has an upward slope. However, the relationship is by no means tight, as reflected in

the uniformly low R2'
                    s (ranging from 0.02 to 0.08 for individual currency pairs). Estimating a

fixed effects panel regression yields a point estimate of 0.674, and R2 of 0.10. The incorporation

of cross currency information, as well as time series, yields a slightly tighter estimate, as

indicated by the smaller standard error.

        The only other study that we are aware of that test the unbiasedness hypothesis over

similar horizons is by Flood and Taylor (1997). Flood and Taylor calculate 3-year changes in and

collect average data on medium-term government bonds from the IMF’s International Financial

Statistics (IFS). The data over the 1973–92 period are then pooled for a sample of 21 countries.

They obtain a coefficient on the interest differential of 0.596 with a standard error of 0.195. Thus

the hypotheses that      equals either zero or unity can both be rejected. These results are broadly in

line with our results.

        Other studies have tackled longer horizons. For instance, Chinn and Meredith (2004)

examine ten year bond rates over the 1973-1997 period, and found evidence in favor of UIP.


                                                    8
However, in this case, the sample period is extremely short relative to the horizon length. Alexius

(2001) examines 14 long term bond rates of varying maturities for the 1957-1997 period, drawn

from IFS.8 Her study also finds evidence in favor of the unbiasedness hypothesis at long

horizons, although it is difficult to interpret these statistical results as being consistent with

uncovered interest parity, as the sample encompasses periods of fixed exchange rates and

extensive capital controls.

        In any event, it is reassuring that despite data and methodological differences, these

results are similar to those obtained in our regressions, suggesting that the difference between

short- and long-horizon tests of UIP may be robust across countries, sample periods and

estimation procedures.



3.2 Robustness checks: frequency, sample, types of yields, and base currency




        8
       The IFS data are somewhat problematic in that the definitions of the long term bonds is
not homogeneous across countries and over time.

4. EXPLAINING THE RESULTS ECONOMETRICALLY

           The rather strikingly different results obtained at different horizons should be placed in

the context of recent findings that finds that it is much more difficult to reject the null hypothesis

of unbiasedness (e.g., Evans and Lewis, 1995), when the unbiasedness proposition is couched in

terms of cointegrating relationships. Here, we are not so much concerned with the specific

finding regarding cointegration with the posited values, but rather the econometric implications

of estimating equation (6). If the expected spot and forward rate are cointegrated, then it must be

true that the current spot and forward rate are also cointegrated. It turns out that it is more

convenient to work with this representation (Zivot, 2000). According to the Engle-Granger

Representation Theorem, one can write this latter cointegrated system as:



                                                                                                        (7)



where the horizon has been set to one (k = 1) for simplicity of exposition. As pointed out by

Phillips (1991), single-equation estimation of (7.a) is plagued by asymptotic bias as long as the

forward rate is not weakly exogenous. This assertion can be verified by enumerating the steps

necessary to convert equation (7) to (6). First, one must assume weak exogeneity of f (implying

that   2   = 0, so that we can ignore the second equation). Subsuming the constant into the

cointegrating vector, one obtains


                                                    12
                                                                                                                    (8)




where bi and ci are functions of the variances and covariances of           1   and      2   , and u is a function of

 1   and   2   , and their variances and covariances. In particular, b0 =   12  /   22   , which equals zero only

when the correlation between the ’s is zero. Imposing the restrictions                   0   = 0 and   1   = 1,10

equation (8) can be rewritten as:



                                                                                                                    (9)




Notice that equation (9) degenerates to equation (6) if and only if b0 = 0, bi = ci = 0 for all i, as

well as         0   = 0,   1   = 1 (Moore, 1994; Villanueva, 1999).

           To examine whether the standard assumption of weak exogeneity of the forward rate is

justified at either the short or long horizons, we generate implicit forward rates using the exact

relationship in equation (1), for both the 3 month and 5 year horizons. We then test for

cointegration between the forward rate and the future spot rate11 using the Johansen (1988)

maximum likelihood procedure. The results are reported in Table 5; in Panel 4.a are the

cointegration results for the 3 month forward rates and the future spot rates, and in Panel 4.b are



           10
           See Brenner and Kroner (1995) complications involved in imposing the                        0   =0
restriction in the cointegrating vector.
           11
          In principle, either specification is valid asymptotically. Zivot (2000) argues for testing
the cointegrating vector involving the contemporaneous forward and spot rate, while Villanueva
(1999) reports results demonstrating that lagged forecast errors yield more unambiguous results.

                                                           13
the corresponding results for the 5 year implicit forward rates.

       The first column displays the likelihood ratio for the Trace (top row) and Maximal

Eigenvalue (bottom row) statistic. The 10% critical value for rejecting the null hypothesis of no

cointegrating vectors in favor of the alternative of one is 17.85, using the trace statistic (13.75

using the Maximal Eigenvalue statistic). All the currencies evidence cointegration, save the

Deutschemark; and here the Maximal Eigenvalue statistic indicates borderline evidence of

cointegration.12 If the long run unbiasedness hypothesis is imposed, then in all cases save one,

the forward -- and not spot -- rate responds to the disequilibrium. The sole exception is the yen,

in which case the spot rate responds as well (although in a perverse fashion).

          For the 5 year implicit forwards and the corresponding future spot rates, cointegration is

detected for the pound, while less evidence of cointegration is detected for the Deutschemark and

Canadian dollar. For the pound one obtains the result that at horizons of 5 years, the spot rate

responds to the lagged cointegrating vector     1   with high statistical significance, while the

forward rate does not. That is, long term interest rate differentials are weakly exogenous in this

system.

       If one uses the more powerful Horvath-Watson (1995) test imposing the unbiasedness

hypothesis, one finds that test statistic for the Deutschemark of 4.21 is just below the 10% critical

value of 4.73 for the case with a zero mean in the variables (although it is much less than the

corresponding critical value of 8.30 for the possibly more relevant nonzero-mean case). If one

were willing to impose the prior of cointegration (see Kremers, Ericsson and Dolado, 1992), then


          12
          The Horvath-Watson (1994) test also indicates borderline evidence for cointegration.
However, if the weakening of the euro in 2000 is included in the sample, then the evidence for
cointegration is weakened somewhat.

significant. Hence, the data thus seem to suggest that the 5 year Deutschemark forward rate --

corresponding to the interest differential -- is less endogenous than the spot rate. In contrast, for

the Canadian dollar, little evidence of cointegration can be detected, so one cannot interpret the

reported coefficients as being meaningful.

        For two of the three currencies for which we have data, it appears that the forward rate is

weakly exogenous at long horizons, while at short horizons the spot rate is more likely to be

weakly exogenous. From a statistical standpoint, this explains some of the differences in the

results obtained at short and long horizons.



5. CONCLUSIONS

        We find evidence that the perverse relationship between interest rates and exchange rates

is a feature of the short-horizon data that have been used in almost all previous studies. Using

longer horizon data, the standard test of UIP yields strikingly different results, with slope

parameters that are positive, and insignificantly different from the value of unity. These results

hold up against a number of robustness checks, and support the earlier conjectures of Mussa

(1979) and Froot and Thaler (1990) that the unbiasedness proposition may better apply at longer

horizons.

        From an econometric perspective, the differential results can be explained in the context

of endogeneity of the right hand side variable. Deciding what type of economic model induces

such an endogeneity is a more contentious issue. In a related paper (Chinn and Meredith, 2004),

we suggest the difference in the results is consistent with the properties of a conventional


                                                      15
macroeconomic model. In particular, a temporary disturbance to the uncovered interest parity

relationship causes the spot exchange rate to depreciate relative to the expected future rate,

leading to higher output, inflation, and interest rates. Higher interest rates are then typically

associated with an ex post future appreciation of the exchange rate at short horizons, consistent

with the forward discount bias typically found in empirical studies. Over longer horizons, the

temporary effects of exchange market shocks fade and the model results are dominated by more

fundamental dynamics that are consistent with the UIP hypothesis.13

       Regardless of the reasons for the failure of the unbiasedness hypothesis at short horizons,

from an unconditional forecasting perspective, the conclusion remains that interest differentials

are little use as predictors of short-term movements in exchange rates. Even at long horizons,

they explain only a relatively small proportion of the observed variance in exchange rates,

although one recent study finds that UIP does well compared to other structural models of the

exchange rate.14




       13
         An alternative explanation for these results has been forwarded by Lim and Ogaki
(2003), who relies upon exogenously determined segmentation between short and long term bond
markets. Alexius and Sellin (2001) argues that UIP holds for holding period returns on long term
bonds, suggesting that it is the asset type, rather than horizon, that matters.
       14
         Cheung et al. (forthcoming) find that UIP performs best at predicting exchange rates at
long horizons, and does well as compared against the sticky price monetary model, a productivity
based model, and an ad hoc model incorporating productivity, interest differential, and portfolio
effects.
