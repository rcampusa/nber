Optimal Debt and Profitability in the Tradeoff Theory

                                          ABSTRACT

I develop a dynamic model of leverage with tax deductible interest and an endogenous cost of
default. The interest rate includes a premium to compensate lenders for expected losses in default.
A borrowing constraint is generated by lenders’ unwillingness to lend an amount that would
trigger immediate default. When the borrowing constraint is not binding, the tradeoff theory of
debt holds: optimal debt equates the marginal tax shield and the marginal expected cost of
default. Contrary to conventional interpretation, but consistent with empirical findings, increases
in current or future profitability reduce the optimal leverage ratio when the tradeoff theory holds.

    The tradeoﬀ theory of capital structure is the longest standing theory of capital struc-
ture1 and underlies much of the large body of empirical work that studies capital structure.
In the tradeoﬀ theory, the optimal amount of debt equates the marginal benefit of a dollar
of debt arising from the tax deductibility of interest payments with the marginal cost of
a dollar of debt arising from increased exposure to default. This framework implies that
changes in leverage over time, or variation in leverage across firms, can be attributed to dif-
ferences in the marginal interest tax shield and/or diﬀerences in the marginal cost of default.
The tradeoﬀ theory has been conventionally interpreted2 to imply that more profitable firms
should have higher leverage ratios–a prediction that is contrary to the empirical fact3 that
more profitable firms tend to have lower leverage ratios.4 Notable exceptions to this conven-
tional interpretation are presented in quantitative models by Hennessy and Whited (2005)
and Strebulaev (2007). In the stochastic dynamic model presented here, I analytically
demonstrate an alternative explanation of the negative relationship between profitability
and leverage that is found empirically.
    In this paper, I develop and analyze a model of capital structure that incorporates an
interest tax shield as well as the possibility of default. In some situations, the optimal amount
of debt will be determined by the equality of the marginal benefit of debt arising from the
interest tax shield and the marginal cost of debt associated with increased probability of
default–that is, optimal debt will be characterized by the tradeoﬀ theory. However, in
other situations within the model, optimal debt will not be characterized by the equality of
marginal benefit and marginal cost that epitomizes the tradeoﬀ theory. Because the model
allows for situations in which the tradeoﬀ theory holds and situations in which it does not
hold, the model has the potential to guide empirical tests by including both a null hypothesis
in terms of the tradeoﬀ theory and an alternative hypothesis that oﬀers an explanation of
leverage other than the tradeoﬀ theory. In particular, I show that the model developed
here accommodates situations in which higher profitability (either current profitability or
expected future profitability) is associated with lower leverage, specifically, a lower value of

     For instance, Myers (1993, p.6) states "The most telling evidence against the static tradeoﬀ theory is the
strong inverse correlation between profitability and financial leverage.... Yet the static tradeoﬀ story would
predict just the opposite relationship. Higher profits mean more dollars for debt service and more taxable
income to shield. They should mean higher target debt ratios."

market leverage, which is the ratio of debt to the market value of the firm. Furthermore, if
the probability of default is nonzero, these situations arise when and only when the tradeoﬀ
theory is operative. That is, the empirical finding that more profitable firms tend to have
lower leverage ratios, which has been viewed by others as evidence against the tradeoﬀ theory,
is viewed as evidence in favor of the tradeoﬀ theory when seen through the lens of the model
presented here.
     As the tradeoﬀ theory has developed over the past half century, it has become increasingly
complex, especially in empirical structural models of the firm that are designed to capture
realistic features of a firm’s environment.5 The model I develop here is stripped of these
complexities so that I can focus on its new features and implications in a framework that
admits analytic results without relying on numerical solution. The model’s biggest departure
from standard models of debt concerns the maturity of the debt. Many standard models
of debt6 assume that debt has infinite maturity and pays a fixed coupon over the infinite
future, or until the firm defaults. Clearly, the assumption of infinite maturity is extreme,
but it has been used productively over the years. I also make an extreme assumption about
maturity, but in the opposite direction. I assume that debt must be repaid an instant after
it is issued. The standard specification with infinite maturity can be viewed as the limiting
case of long-term debt and my specification with zero maturity can be viewed as the limiting
case of short-term debt, such as commercial paper, much of which has a maturity of only 1
to 4 days,7 as well as overnight repurchase agreements.
     The specification of zero-maturity debt is motivated by two considerations. First, this
specification makes salient the recurrent nature of the financing decision, in contrast to the
once-and-for-all financing decision in many models of debt.8 At each instant of time, the
firm decides whether to repay its debt or to default, and if it decides to repay its debt, it
chooses the amount of debt to issue anew. Because I do not include any flotation, issuance, or
adjustment costs, the amount of debt issued responds immediately and completely to changes
in the firm’s environment, and will not have the rich dynamics documented empirically and

analyzed by Leary and Roberts (2005). Second, zero-maturity debt is always valued at par,
which alleviates the need to calculate the value of debt that would arise with long-term
debt. Therefore, the firm’s decision about whether to default on its debt, which depends
on a comparison of the total value of the firm and the value of the firm’s debt, becomes
transparent.
    Because firms have the opportunity to default on their debt, rational lenders need to take
account of the probability of default, as well as their losses in the event of default, in order to
determine the appropriate interest rate on their loans to the firm. In this paper, risk-neutral
lenders have the same information that the firm’s shareholders have and they require a
premium above the riskless rate in order to compensate for the expected losses in the event of
default. In addition, if the amount of debt were suﬃciently large, it would trigger immediate
default. In the current framework with zero-maturity debt, lenders avoid being subject to
immediate default by refusing to lend an amount greater than the contemporaneous value
of the firm, which itself depends on the amount of debt issued.
    An important component of the firm’s financing decision is the stochastic process for the
firm’s pre-tax pre-interest cash flow, that is, EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes). I
specifiy a continuous-time continuous-state process for EBIT. Instead of a diﬀusion process,
as in Leland (1994) for example, I specify a Markov process in which EBIT remains un-
changed for a random length of time and then a new value of EBIT arrives at dates governed
by a Poission process with arrival intensity . On these dates, the value of EBIT changes
by a discrete amount, and a discrete decrease in the value of EBIT can lead the firm to
default on its debt. In the event of default, a fraction   0 of the firm’s value disappears
as a deadweight loss and the creditors take ownership of the remaining fraction 1 −  of the
firm. I do not consider re-negotiation between shareholders and creditors. Shareholders
and creditors have common knowledge. If they were to re-negotiate when a new realization
of EBIT would lead to default, the result of that re-negotiation would simply be a function
of the amount of debt and the level of EBIT at that time. But if shareholders and lenders
were to agree on terms that would apply when a new value of EBIT would lead to default,
they could simply write those terms into the debt contract. But then the debt contract
would become state-contingent in a way that would make the instrument not look like debt.
Since I want to focus on the leverage ratio as measured using conventional debt, I do not



                                                3
consider re-negotiation or the sort of "pre-negotiation" just described.9
     For simplification, the new values of EBIT are i.i.d across arrivals. Nevertheless, EBIT
displays persistence: EBIT remains constant during each regime, and regimes have a mean
duration of 1 , which could potentially be quite large. The unconditional correlation between
two values of EBIT that occur at dates   0 units of time apart is − , which is positive
and declines monotonically in . The advantage of using the i.i.d. specification is that it
allows for persistence in EBIT as well as analytic tractability.10 In particular, as I will show,
the optimal amount of debt is invariant to contemporaneous EBIT if the value of EBIT is
high enough that tradeoﬀ theory of debt is operative. As a result, the leverage ratio, which
is the ratio of debt to the value of the firm, is a decreasing function of EBIT, since the
value of the firm is increasing in EBIT. The stark result that optimal debt is invariant to
EBIT when the tradeoﬀ theory is operative is a consequence of the assumption that EBIT
is i.i.d. across regimes. In Section 7, I extend the model to allow for persistence in EBIT
across regimes. I show that optimal debt would no longer be invariant to EBIT when the
tradeoﬀ theory is operative. I present a simple example in which the conditional distribution
of EBIT is uniform and I show that in this example, optimal debt and the leverage ratio
are both decreasing in contemporaneous EBIT, thereby reinforcing the major result of the
paper. I also show that the conditional probability of default is a decreasing function of
EBIT, when and only when the tradeoﬀ theory is operative.
     When EBIT is i.i.d. across regimes, the firm’s optimal capital structure depends on
whether EBIT exceeds or falls short of an endogeneously determined critical value. For
values of EBIT that exceed the critical value, the tradeoﬀ theory is operative, provided that
the firm faces a positive probability of default. When the tradeoﬀ theory is operative, the
optimal level of debt is invariant to EBIT; since an increase in EBIT increases the total value
   9
      The debt contract that I analyze is not an optimal contract, but it is of the form commonly used in
practice and in analytical models. Although it is not optimal, it does have the important feature that all
participants in the debt instrument do so voluntarily and are not made worse oﬀ by participating. Biais,
Mariotti, Plantin, and Rochet (2007) derive "performance sensitive" debt as an optimal contract in a dynamic
framework.
   10
      In their analysis of the impact of temporary shocks on optimal issuance of debt, Gorbenko and Strebulaev
(2010) specify temporary shocks as Poisson arrivals from a given distribution; when they consider multiple
shocks over time, they assume that they are i.i.d., as in the framework used here. The temporary shocks in
Gorbenko and Strebulaev are drawn from a double exponential distribution; the shocks in the current model
are drawn from a more general distribution on finite support for which the density is finite and non-decreasing
and the restriction in equation (2) is satisfied.



                                                      4
of the firm, the optimal leverage ratio falls as profitability, measured by EBIT, increases.
This negative relationship between profitability and the leverage ratio, which arises from
the invariance of debt to EBIT, is reminiscent of Strebulaev’s (2007) finding that when
adjustment costs prevent the level of debt from changing, an increase in profitability reduces
the leverage ratio. However, the mechanisms that make debt invariant to profitability are
diﬀerent in the current model and in Strebulaev’s model. Specifically, the invariance of
optimal debt arises in the current model in the complete absence of any flotation, issuance,
or adjustment costs that prevent debt from adjusting in Stebulaev’s model.
    For values of EBIT below the critical value, the borrowing constraint that prevents im-
mediate default binds. In this situation, the tradeoﬀ theory is not operative and the optimal
leverage ratio is invariant to EBIT. To summarize, the model predicts a negative relation-
ship between the optimal leverage ratio and contemporaneous EBIT (which is consistent
with empirical findings) when the tradeoﬀ theory is operative but not when the constraint
on the firm’s borrowing is binding.
    To examine the relationship between the optimal amount of debt and expected future
profitability, I analyze the impact of a rightward translation of the unconditional distribu-
tion of profitability. This favorable shift of the unconditional distribution of profitability
increases the continuation value of the firm, which the firm’s current shareholders stand to
lose in the event of default; therefore, a favorable shift of the unconditional distribution
increases the cost of default facing these shareholders.11 In response to the increased cost of
default, the firm adjusts its capital structure to reduce the probability of default. Whether
this change in capital structure reduces the optimal amount of debt depends on the uncon-
ditional distribution of profitability. In the focal case of a uniform distribution, a rightward
translation of the distribution reduces optimal debt when the tradeoﬀ theory is operative.12
Thus, whether one analyzes the relationship between the optimal leverage ratio and contem-
  11
     To the extent that creditors recover a portion of their loans in the event of default, the social cost of
default is smaller than the loss to current shareholders. I assume that creditors receive a fraction 1 −  of
the continuation value of the firm in the event of default, so the social cost of default is a fraction  of the
continuation value. Therefore, the social cost of default, as well as private cost to current shareholders, is
increased by a favorable shift of the unconditional distribution of profitability.
  12
     Appendix D in the online appendix shows that this finding holds more broadly within the class of
truncated exponential distributions for density functions that do not slope upward too steeply. Only for
suﬃciently steeply upward-sloping density functions will optimal debt increase in response to a rightward
translation of the distribution function when the tradeoﬀ theory is operative.

poraneous EBIT (as described above) or between the optimal leverage ratio and long-run
average EBIT, the model predicts a negative relationship between the optimal leverage ratio
and EBIT if the tradeoﬀ theory is operative, but not if the firm faces a binding constraint
on its borrowing.
    Section 1 presents the economic environment facing a firm, including the opportunity
to borrow and the ability to default on outstanding debt. The availability and terms of
loans to the firm depend on the valuation of the firm. Section 2 characterizes the optimal
level of debt and the associated value of shareholders’ equity, which together sum to the
total valuation of the firm. An important component of this analysis is the critical value of
current EBIT, which is the boundary between low values of EBIT for which the borrowing
constraint binds and high values of EBIT for which the borrowing constraint does not bind.
Depending on whether this critical value of EBIT is at the minimum value of the support of
EBIT, the maximum value of the support of EBIT, or in between, the firm will find itself in
one of three scenarios, which are characterized in Section 3. Although optimal behavior in
two of the three scenarios can be derived very easily, optimal behavior in one of the scenarios
(denoted as Scenario II) entails more extensive analysis, which is presented in Section 4. Of
particular interest is subsection 4.1, which interprets the analytic results in terms of the
tradeoﬀ theory. Section 5 demonstrates that Scenario I, II, or III will prevail depending
on whether the tax rate is low, intermediate, or high, and it provides explicit expressions
for the values of the tax rate associated with the boundaries between adjacent scenarios.
Section 6 analyzes the impact of a rightward translation of the unconditional distribution of
EBIT on optimal debt, shareholder equity, the critical value of EBIT, and the probability
of default. Section 7 extends the model to allow for persistence in EBIT across regimes.
In the focal case of a uniform distribution, persistence strengthens the major result of the
paper that the optimal leverage ratio is a decreasing function of EBIT if the tradeoﬀ theory
is operative. Concluding remarks are presented in Section 8. To avoid disruption in the
narrative flow of the paper, the proofs of all lemmas, propositions, and corollaries are in
Appendix A. Appendix B presents the details of the calculation of the value of the firm.
An online appendix presents closed-form solutions for optimal debt and the value of the firm
in the special case in which the unconditional distribution of EBIT is uniform and creditors
recover zero in the event of default. It also contains a section analyzing the impact of
rightward translation of the unconditional distribution of EBIT when the distribution is a

1      The Firm’s Economic Environment
Let  () be EBIT, the pre-tax net cash flow from operations, before interest, at time .
The realizations of  () are generated by an exogenous stochastic process and thus are
independent of any actions taken by the firm. If EBIT at time 0 is  (0 ), then  ()
remains equal to  (0 ) until some random date 1  0 . At time 1 , a new value of EBIT,
 (1 ), is drawn from a distribution with c.d.f.  (), with  (Φ ) = 0,  (Φ ) = 1, and finite
density  () =  0 ()  0 everywhere on the support [Φ  Φ ], where −∞  Φ  Φ  ∞.
In addition, assume that  0 () ≥ 0 for all  in the support of  (), which will ensure that
the firm’s objective function is concave in debt. The unconditional expected value of EBIT
                                              RΦ
is assumed to be positive, that is,  {} = Φ  ()  0, which implies Φ  0 but does
not place a restriction on the sign of Φ . The arrival date of a new value of EBIT, that is,
the timing of 1 , is governed by a Poisson process with an instantaneous probability  of an
arrival of a new value of  (). Realizations of new values of EBIT are i.i.d. across regimes.
    I assume that the firm is managed on behalf of risk-neutral shareholders with constant
rate of time preference equal to   0. The shareholders have "deep pockets" in the sense
that they can infuse an unlimited amount of funds into the firm if its after-tax cash flow
from operations net of interest is negative. The support of the distribution for EBIT may
include negative values of EBIT, since Φ may be negative. If a negative realization of
EBIT is suﬃciently large in absolute value or suﬃciently persistent, current shareholders
might decide to abandon ownership of the firm to avoid a stream of future cash flows with
a negative expected present value. In principle, the shareholders of a firm might abandon
ownership of the firm either as a response to unfavorable current and prospective future
EBIT or as a means to avoid repaying the firm’s debt. My focus in this paper is on leverage
and the potential default associated with it, so I will restrict the stochastic process for EBIT
to be such that in the complete absence of borrowing, risk-neutral shareholders of the firm
would never find it optimal to abandon the firm.13 To formalize this restriction, define
 ( ()) to be the expected present value of current and future cash flows, if the firm is
  13
    In contrast to this assumption, Gorbenko and Strebulaev (2010) allow the unlevered value of the firm
to become negative, in which case shareholders would abandon the firm.

optimal to cease operation.14
    The firm borrows by issuing bonds to risk-neutral lenders who have the same rate of time
preference, , as shareholders. The maturity of these bonds is vanishingly small. If the
firm issues an amount  of bonds at time , then it must repay these bonds at time  + ,
where  is infinitesimal. Eﬀectively these bonds have instantaneous maturity. The interest
rate on these bonds,  (), is set at a level that compensates lenders for their expected losses
in the event of default. If the firm defaults on its debt, the shareholders lose all ownership
interest in the firm and receive zero. The creditors take ownership of the firm in default, but
the act of default imposes a deadweight loss equal to a fraction  of the value of the firm,
where 0   ≤ 1. Therefore, in default at time +, creditors receive (1 − )  ( ( + )),
where  ( ( + )) is the value of the firm, which is described more formally in equation
(7) below. Since creditors lose the value of the bonds,  , but recover (1 − )  ( ( + ))
in default, the expected loss to creditors due to default in the interval from  to  + 

where the first term, , is the riskless rate in the absence of any chance of default, and the
second term is the expected loss to creditors in default for each dollar of debt they hold.
    In addition to requiring an interest rate that includes compensation for the expected loss
in default, potential lenders to the firm will never lend an amount that is so large that the
firm would default immediately upon receiving the funds from issuing the bond. This limit
on the amount the firm can borrow is

                                        ≤  ( ())                                    (4)

I will refer to the limit on borrowing in equation (4) as an endogenous borrowing constraint,
though it could also be described as a non-negativity constraint on the value of the firm’s
equity, or equivalently, as limited liability.
   The taxable income of the firm, denoted  (), is operating profit,  (), minus interest
payments,  ()  , so using the interest rate in equation (3), taxable income is
                                          Z
                 () =  () −  −                 [ − (1 − )  ()]  ()       (5)
                                             ()


The tax rate on taxable income is constant and equal to  , where 0    1. If taxable
income is negative, the firm receives a tax rebate of −  ()  0.
   I assume that shareholders do not retain any earnings in the firm, that is, the firm pays
out all net cash flows as dividends,  (), so

                                () = (1 −  )  ()  +                           (6)

where  is the net increase in bonds at time , which represents a net inflow of funds to
the firm. The notation  () and  allows for dividends and net increases in bonds to
be discrete amounts, rather than flows, at a point of time. For instance, as I show later, the
arrival of a new regime that increases  () by a discrete amount may increase the amount
of bonds by a discrete amount at a point of time, so that  and  () are both positive.
    The value of the firm at time  is

where  is the date at which the shareholders decide to default on their debt, and hence
is endogenous.  ( ()) in equation (7) is the value of the firm at time  if it arrives at
time  with zero bonds outstanding. Equivalently,  ( ()) is the value of the firm at time
 immediately after it has paid oﬀ (with interest) its outstanding debt issued at  − , and
before it issues new debt at time .
    To describe the timing of events around time , it is useful to define − ≡ lim&0 −
as the amount of bonds issued by the firm an instant before time .

    1. The firm arrives at time  with − bonds outstanding.

    2. The values of profitability,  (), and the value of the firm  ( ()) are realized and
       observed by the firm and by lenders.

    3. The firm decides whether to repay or default on its outstanding bonds.

        (a) If  ( ())  − , the firm defaults on its bonds, creditors receive (1 − )  ( ())
            and shareholders receive nothing.
        (b) If  ( ()) ≥ − , the firm repays its bonds, and shareholders retain ownership.

    4. If shareholders retain ownership, the firm issues bonds  subject to the borrowing
       constraint  ≤  ( ()).

    5. The firm receives  (), pays interest  ()  , and pays taxes  [ () −  ()  ].

    6. The firm pays dividends  () = (1 −  ) [ () −  ()  ] +  , where15  =  −
       − .


2      Optimal Debt, Firm Value, and Shareholder Equity
Consider the firm at time  immediately after it has repaid its bonds − . At this instant,
the firm has no outstanding bonds and it decides how many bonds to issue at time  to
 15
    As it turns out, the firm will change the amount of outstanding debt only at times of regime change,
when  () changes. At these times, the amount of debt will change by a discrete amount,  .

problem can be represented by the following Bellman equation

                  ≤ (())         


where 1 is the date of the first arrival of a new regime after time . The value of the firm
in equation (8) is the sum of two terms. The first term is the expected present value of
dividends, , over the interval of time from  to the arrival of a new regime at time 1 .
The second term is the expected present value of the firm at time 1 , after observing the new
value of profitability,  (1 ). When the firm observes  (1 ), it can choose to become a firm
with value  ( (1 )), but to do so, it must repay its outstanding debt −1 , so the net value
to the shareholders of continuing their ownership in the firm is  ( (1 )) − − . Provided
this net value of continued ownership of the firm is non-negative, shareholders will repay
their outstanding bonds, and then issue a new amount of bonds, 1 . Otherwise, the firm
will default on its bonds, and shareholders lose their ownership of the firm.
    Other than deciding whether to default, the only decision that the firm makes is how
many bonds to issue at each point in time. The structure of the stochastic process for  ()
implies that the optimal value of  is simply a function of contemporaneous  (). I will
use the notation   b ( ()) to denote the optimal value of  . Profitability is constant, and
equal to  (), over the interval of time from  until 1 , so after-tax income, (1 −  )  (), and
the optimal amount of bonds outstanding,           b ( ()), are constant and equal to (1 −  )  ()
and  b ( ()), respectively, for all  in [ 1 ). With    b ( ()) constant over this interval of
time,  = 0 for all  in ( 1 ) , but  =     b ( ()) for a firm at time  after it has repaid
its debt −1 .
    It is straightforward but tedious to calculate the value of the firm, so I have relegated
the derivation to Appendix B, where I show that

and  ≡  ()  () is the unconditional mean of  (). To interpret the function  ()
in equation (10), which arises naturally in the derivation of the value of the firm, use equation
(3) to rewrite equation (10) as
                                                       Z
                           ( ) =   ()  −                    ()  () .                    (11)

I will refer to  () as the "tradeoﬀ function" because it contains the elements of the tradeoﬀ
theory of debt. The first term on the right hand side of the expression for  ( ) in equation
(11),   ()  , is the interest tax shield, which is simply the tax rate,  , multiplied by interest
payments,  ()  . The second term is the expected deadweight loss associated with default,
where the deadweight loss is  () if default occurs when profitability equals .
    Equation (9) can be expressed in terms of flows at time  by multiplying both sides by
+ and then subtracting  ( ()) from both sides to obtain the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman
equation
                  ( ()) = max [(1 −  )  () +  ( −  ( ())) +  ( )]                  (12)
                                ≤ (())

    The left hand side of equation (12),  ( ()), is the required return on the firm, which
is the product of the rate of return required by shareholders and the value of the firm. The
expected return to the firm, on the right hand side, has three components: the after-tax
profit from operations, (1 −  )  (); the expected change in the value of the firm if the regime
changes, which is the product of, , the instantaneous probability of a regime change, and
 −  ( ()), which is the expected change in the value of the firm when a new value of 
is drawn from its unconditional distribution; and  ( ), the contribution of bond financing
consisting of the interest tax shield,   ()  , less the expected deadweight loss associated
with default.
    The optimal value of debt is the value of  that attains the maximum on the right hand
side of equation (12). Since  enters the maximand on the right hand side of equation (12)
only through  (), the optimal amount of debt is16

                                   b ( ()) ≡ arg
                                                         max        ( )                           (13)
                                                      ≤ (())

  16
    Equivalently, the optimal value of  attains the maximum on the right hand side of equation (9), which,
since  +   0, is also given by equation (13).



                                                     12
Since  ( ) is independent of  (), the optimal value of debt,  b ( ()), is independent of
 () if the borrowing constraint,  ≤  ( ()), is not binding. However, if the borrowing
                            b ( ()) =  ( ()), which is increasing in  (), since, as shown
constraint is binding, then 
in Proposition 1 below,  ( ()) is strictly increasing in  ().
    To obtain the value function, substitute the optimal amount of debt,          b ( ()), from
equation (13) into equation (9), which yields
                                                                  ³          ´

Proposition 1  ( ()) is strictly increasing in  (). Moreover, for any 2  1 in the
support [Φ  Φ ],  (2 )−

   The proof of Proposition 1 is in Appendix A, but the logic of the proof is straightforward.
Suppose that 2  1 . If the firm were to maintain the same level of debt at  () = 2 as
                         b (1 ), the value of the firm would increase by 1− (2 − 1 ), so that
at  () = 1 , which is                                                 +
b (1 ) would be feasible when  () = 2 . Allowing for the possibility that optimal debt

changes when EBIT increases to 2 from 1 implies that the value of the firm may increase
                                                     1−
by even more, so  ( ()) increases by at least +     (2 − 1 ).
   The following proposition is an immediate consequence of the definition of optimal debt,
b
 ( ()), in equation (13) and the fact that  () is strictly increasing (Proposition 1).

                                          b ( ()), is
Proposition 2 The optimal value of bonds, 

   1. non-decreasing in the state,  (), and

   2. non-decreasing in time, , outside of default.

    Proposition 2 states that the optimal value of debt never falls below previous optimal
values of debt as long as the firm does not default. This behavior is consistent with the
time path of debt in Goldstein, Ju, and Leland (2001), in which it is assumed that, outside
of default, the firm does not decrease its debt.17
  17
    The second paragraph of Goldstein, Ju, and Leland (2001, p. 483) begins "Below, we consider only the
option to increase future debt levels. While in theory management can both increase and decrease future
debt levels, Gilson (1997) finds that transactions costs discourage debt reductions outside of Chapter 11."

                                          b ( ()), the value of shareholders’ equity in the
    Since shareholders owe a liability of 
firm,  ( ()), is
                            ( ()) =  ( ()) − b ( ()) ≥ 0                       (15)

where the inequality is the borrowing constraint. Because shareholders receive an amount
b ( ()) immediately when they borrow, they choose  to maximize  ( ()) =  ( ())+
rather than to maximize shareholder equity exclusive of ,  ( ()) =  ( ()) − .
    The following proposition provides bounds on the optimal amount of bonds. Because
the firm has the option to operate forever as an all-equity firm,  ( ()) is at least as large
as  ( ()) in equation (1), and the assumption in equation (2) that Φ  −   {} implies
that  ( ())  0. Therefore, even the lowest value of the firm,  (Φ ), is at least as high
as  (Φ )  0. It cannot be optimal to issue an amount of bonds smaller than  (Φ )
because to do so would fail to take full advantage of the interest tax shield, without any
exposure to the possibility of default. Therefore, the optimal amount of bonds is at least
 (Φ ). The borrowing constraint,  ≤  ( ()), implies that even when the firm attains
its highest possible value, the firm can never issue an amount of bonds greater than  (Φ ).

                                               b ( ()) ≤  (Φ ).
Proposition 3 If 0    1, then 0   (Φ ) ≤ 

                               b (Φ ) =  (Φ ), and  (Φ ) = 0.
Corollary 4 If 0    1, then 

   Corollary 4 follows directly from Proposition 3, which implies that       b (Φ ) ≥  (Φ ),
and from the borrowing constraint   b (Φ ) ≤  (Φ ). Therefore,   b (Φ ) =  (Φ ). Hence,
when  () takes on its minimum value Φ , the optimal amount of debt equals  (Φ ), which
implies that shareholders’ equity,  (Φ ) =  (Φ ) − b (Φ ), is zero.

Proposition 5 If (1) 0    1+     and (2)  ()  0 is non-decreasing for all  ∈ [Φ  Φ ],
then  ( ()) is concave in  () on the domain [Φ  Φ ].

   Proposition 5 provides suﬃcient conditions for the value function,  ( ()), to be concave.
One of the steps (formalized as Lemma 22 in Appendix A) in the proof of Proposition 5 is
to prove that if  ( ()) is concave, then the tradeoﬀ function  () is strictly concave in
 for  (Φ ) ≤  ≤  (Φ ), which is Corollary 6 below.18

all  ∈ [Φ  Φ ], then  () is strictly concave in  for  (Φ ) ≤  ≤  (Φ ).

    Define ∗ as the value of debt that maximizes the tradeoﬀ function  () over  ∈
[ (Φ )   (Φ )], ignoring the borrowing constraint  ≤  ( ()). Formally,

The strict concavity of  () in  implies that ∗ is unique. Since,  () is independent
of  (), ∗ is invariant to  (). If ∗ ≤  ( ()), the borrowing constraint does not bind,
and optimal debt,   b ( ()), equals ∗ . However, if ∗   ( ()), the firm cannot borrow
as much as ∗ and    b ( ()) =  ( ()).
    Define ∗ as the critical value of  ∈ [Φ  Φ ] above which  ()  ∗ and below which

   The tradeoﬀ theory is operative when optimal debt is determined by equating the mar-
ginal tax shield associated with interest deductibility
                                                  ³     and the

mally, the tradeoﬀ theory is operative when   ( ()) = 0 so that 
Proposition 7 implies that the tradeoﬀ theory is operative when and only when  () ≥ ∗ .
Therefore, Corollary 8 implies that when and only when the tradeoﬀ theory is operative,
the optimal leverage ratio is a decreasing function of contemporaneous profitability. This

                                                 16
result is remarkable because, as noted in the introduction to this paper, it is the opposite of
the conventional interpretation of the tradeoﬀ theory, which states that the leverage ratio is
increasing in profitability. However, empirical studies find a negative relationship between
the leverage ratio and productivity, consistent with Corollary 8 when the tradeoﬀ theory is
operative.
    Proposition 2 states that outside of default,   b ( ()) is a weakly increasing function of
the state  () and of time . The leverage ratio, however, is weakly decreasing in the state,
 (), and is not monotonic in time . To see that the leverage ratio can either increase or
decrease over time, consider several consecutive regimes in which  () ≥ ∗ . The optimal
value of bonds,   b ( ()), remains constant and equal to ∗ over time since  () ≥ ∗ .
When  () increases from one of these regimes to the next regime,  ( ()) increases and
the leverage ratio falls; when  () decreases from one of these regimes to the next regime,
 ( ()) falls and the leverage ratio increases.
    Under the optimal debt policy,   b ( ()), the instantaneous probability of default is

which is the probability that a new regime arrives that induces a value of the firm lower than
the currently outstanding debt,  b ( ()).

Proposition 9 The instantaneous probability of default   ( ()) =  min [ ( ())   (∗ )].

    In the framework analyzed here, default occurs only at times of regime change.19 If
 ()  ∗ , then b ( ()) =  ( ()) so default will occur at the next regime change if
the new value of profitability is lower than  () so the new value of the firm is less than
 ( ()) = b ( ()). Alternatively, if  () ≥ ∗ , then   b ( ()) = ∗ =  (∗ ) so that
default will occur at the next regime change if the new value of profitability is less than ∗
so the new value of the firm is less than  (∗ ) =    b ( ()). Thus, regardless of whether
 () is above or below the critical value ∗ , default will occur at the next regime change if
and only if the new value of profitability is less than min [ ()  ∗ ].

  19
     The model in Gorbenko and Strebulaev (2010) has a similar feature. Specifically, in their model, default
occurs only at the times at which a new value of the temporary shock has a Poisson arrival.

Proposition 10 The instantaneous probability of default,  b ( ()) , and the interest
rate,  (), are

                             b ( ())
   1. strictly increasing in 

   2. strictly increasing in  () if  ()  ∗

   3. invariant to  () if  () ≥ ∗ 

    In principle, there are two endogenous channels that can increase the probability of
default at the time, 0 , of the next regime change: channel (1) is an increase in the current
amount of bonds outstanding,       b ( ()); and channel (2) is a shift in the distribution of  (0 )
that shifts the distribution of  ( (0 )) in an unfavorable way. Statement 1 of Proposition
10 captures channel (1). Channel (2) is not operative in the current specification because
profitability, , is i.i.d. across regimes so the distribution of  ( (0 )) is invariant to  ().
    If  ()  ∗ , an increase in current profitability,  (), increases the probability of default
(Statement 2 of Proposition 10) because it leads the firm to increase its bonds,           b ( ()),
(channel 1) and the increase in current profitability does not improve the distribution of
 ( (0 )). If  () ≥ ∗ , an increase in  () has no eﬀect on the probability of default. These
counter-intuitive results are based on the assumption that  () is i.i.d. across regimes. In
Section 7, I relax this i.i.d. assumption and allow profitability to be persistent across regimes.
I show that an increase in  () can reduce the probability of default, if the tradeoﬀ theory
is operative.
    The following proposition describes aspects of optimal behavior when the borrowing
constraint binds so    b ( ()) =  ( ()).

   2. after-tax income (1 −  )  () is strictly increasing in  ()

    Statement 1 of Proposition 11 implies that if the after-tax income of the firm is positive,
then the borrowing constraint,     b ( ()) ≤  ( ()), cannot bind. Statement 2 is that
the after-tax income of the firm is strictly increasing in  () if the borrowing constraint is
binding, that is, if  ()  ∗ .20 Statement 3 is that if the borrowing constraint is binding,
and if there is not a change in regime, the shareholders of the firm will not receive positive
dividends. Negative dividends in this context means that the shareholders inject funds
into the firm to cover the negative flow of after-tax income because the binding borrowing
constraint prevents the firm from issuing additional debt to cover the negative after-tax
income.


3      Three Scenarios
∗ is defined in equation (16) as the value of  that maximizes  () over the interval
 (Φ ) ≤  ≤  (Φ ). In this section, I define and analyze three scenarios that are defined
by whether the lower bound  ≥  (Φ ) strictly binds, the upper bound  ≤  (Φ ) strictly
binds, or neither bound strictly binds. Formally, Scenario I is the set of configurations of
, , ,  , and  () for which the lower bound on  strictly binds, Scenario II is the set of
configurations of , , ,  , and  () for which neither bound strictly binds, and Scenario
III is the set of configurations of , , ,  , and  () for which the upper bound on 
strictly binds.
    The definition of ∗ in equation (16), ∗ ≡ arg max (Φ )≤≤ (Φ )  (), implies that

                    ∗ = arg max  () + 1 ( −  (Φ )) + 2 ( (Φ ) − )                                   (19)

 () and  b ( ()) are invariant to  () when  () ≥ ∗ . Therefore, after-tax income is strictly increasing
in  (), regardless of whether the borrowing constraint binds.

      • Scenario III:  1 = 0 and  2  0

    The remainder of this section will focus on Scenarios I and III. I will analyze Scenario
II in more detail in Section 4.


3.1       Scenario I
In Scenario I,  1  0 and  2 = 0, so the first-order condition in equation (20) implies
0 (∗ ) = − 1  0. Thus, the marginal interest tax shield, which provides an incentive
to increase the amount of debt, is overwhelmed by the marginal expected cost of losing
the continuation value of the firm in default. The complementary slackness condition in
equation (21) implies ∗ =  (Φ ). Therefore, the optimal value of debt is  (Φ ), which
is the highest value of debt that the firm can issue without facing a positive probability of
default.

                              ( () − Φ ) 

    Proposition 12 states that in Scenario I, the optimal value of debt equals 0 , which is
invariant to the tax rate and invariant to the current value of EBIT. The invariance of
optimal debt with respect to the tax rate reflects the fact that at the margin the tax shield
is so weak that it is completely outweighed by the cost of default. Therefore, shareholders
choose not to expose the firm to the probability of default. Nevertheless, because the tax
rate  is positive, the firm takes advantage of the tax shield on interest by choosing the
maximal amount of debt that does not risk default. In fact, when  () = Φ , the firm uses
the tax shield to completely insulate its value from taxes. That is, when  () = Φ , the
ability to issue bonds
                     h and deduct iinterest payments
                                               h      increases

 (Φ ) = 0 = + Φ +   {} from + Φ +   {} in the absence of debt.


3.2    Scenario III
In Scenario III,  1 = 0 and  2  0, so the first-order condition in equation (20) implies
that 0 (∗ )  0. The complementary slackness condition in equation (22) implies that
∗ =  (Φ ). Thefore, since  () is strictly concave in , 0 ()  0 for all  ∈
[ (Φ )   (Φ )]. The marginal intereset tax shield associated with an increase in debt
overwhelms the increased exposure to default associated with an increase in debt. Therefore,
the firm will issue as much debt as it can, driving shareholders’ equity to zero, so that
b ( ()) ≡  ( ()) for all  () ∈ [Φ  Φ ].

                                                                          1

    The expression for the value of the firm at  () = Φ depends on  as well as on the
exogenous parameters , , Φ , and . In the special case in which default destroys the
                                                                         1
entire value of the firm ( = 1), Proposition 13 implies  (Φ ) = +     Φ , which is simply
the expected value of the flow of Φ from the current time until the next regime change,
which triggers default because the new value of  ( ()) will be less than b (Φ ) =  (Φ ).
In this special case, the firm value,  (Φ ), is completely insulated from taxes.

4        Scenario II
Suppose that the firm is in Scenario II, so  1 =  1 = 0. Therefore, equation (20) implies
that 0 (∗ ) = 0. Diﬀerentiating  () in equation (10) with respect to  and evaluating
0 () at  = ∗ yields

Because  () is strictly concave, there is at most one value of ∗ that satisfies equation
(24).22 For  () ≥ ∗ ≡  −1 (∗ ), the borrowing constraint does not bind and the optimal
amount of debt is ∗ ; for  ()  ∗ ≡  −1 (∗ ), the borrrowing constraint binds and the
optimal value of debt equals the value of the firm,  ( ()).


4.1       The Tradeoﬀ Theory
When the borrowing constraint is not binding, the optimal amount of debt is ∗ , which
satisfies the first-order condition, 0 (∗ ) = 0, in equation (24).23 To interpret that first-
  22
      There will exist a value of ∗ that satisfies equation (24) if   ≤  ≤   , where   and   are defined
in Proposition 15.

      Flotation costs for bonds can lead to a modification of the tradeoﬀ theory. For instance, let  () be
the cost of issuing  units of bonds, and assume that  (0) = 0, 0 () ≥ 0, and 00 () ≥ 0 for  ≥ 0.
Subtracting these flotation costs h from operating profits, theivalue of the firm in equation (9) can be written as
 ( ()) = + 1                                        e ( ) , where 
                   max ≤ (()) (1 −  )  () +  +                 e ( ) ≡  ( ) −  ( ) is a "modified
tradeoﬀ function." Since  ( ) is strictly concave and  ( ) is convex, the modified tradeoﬀ function,
e ( ), is strictly concave. Define  e ∗ ≡ max ≤ (Φ )    e ( ). Suppose that 0 ( (Φ ))   , so that if
                                                          

where ∗ ≡  −1 (∗ ). First consider the special case in which  = 1 so that default
completely destroys the firm. In this case, the interest rate in equation (3) is  +  (∗ ) so
the left hand side of equation (25) is simply   (), which is the marginal interest tax shield
associated with an additional dollar of debt. To see why, suppose that the firm issues an
additional dollar of debt at time 0 , pays interest  +  (∗ ), then repays the dollar of debt
                                              ∗
at time 0 +  with probability − ( ) , which is the probability that it is not optimal
to default at 0 +  or earlier. Therefore, if the interest rate were to remain unchanged at
 +  (∗ ), the additional dollar of debt would increase the expected present value of the
firm’s after-tax cash flow over the next interval  of time by 1 − (1 −  ) ( +  (∗ ))  −
             ∗
− − ( ) , which equals the left hand side of equation (25) for small . Thus, the left
hand side of equation (25) is the marginal interest tax shield associated with an additional
dollar of debt.
     The right hand side of equation (25) is the marginal cost associated with the increased
probability of default resulting from an additional dollar of debt. By increasing the prob-
ability of default, a one-dollar increase in debt increases the default premium, and hence
increases the interest rate,  +  (∗ ), paid by the firm. To measure the increase in
the probability of default, define  () as the threshhold value of  that triggers default
when outstanding debt is . Formally,  ≡  ( ()) so 1 =  0 ( ()) 0 (). Since
 0 (∗ ) = +

 ≤  (Φ ), and the final inequality follows from ³  ´( (Φ ))    and the convexity of  (). Therefore,
 (Φ )  e ∗ ≤  (Φ ) and for any  () ≥  −1   e ∗ , the optimal amount of debt, b ( ()), equals e ∗ , and
                                                                                                 ³          ´
hence is invariant to  (). The optimal amount debt for these values of  (), satisfies    e0  b ( ()) = 0,
which can be viewed as a "modified tradeoﬀ theory." Note that when           e0 () = 0, 0 () = 0 ()  0.
In this case, the marginal interest tax shield is equated to the marginal expected cost of default, plus the
marginal flotation cost, 0 (). When this modified tradeoﬀ theory holds, the optimal leverage ratio will be
a declining function of  (), as in the text.

payments at time 0 by  (∗ ) ( + ) ∗ , which is the right hand side of equation (25) when
 = 1. Therefore, equation (25) represents the equality of the marginal interest tax shield
and the marginal cost associated with increased exposure to default, which is the essence of
the tradeoﬀ theory.
    In the more general case in which  ≤ 1, the interpretation of equation (25) in terms
of the tradeoﬀ theory is more nuanced. Define  ( 0 ) as the flow of (pre-tax) interest
payments at time  if the amount of outstanding debt is  and if the firm defaults if and
only if   0 . Thus,
                                                                  Z   0

so that  (   ( )) =  ()  , where  () is the interest rate in equation (3). If the value
of  that triggers default, 0 , were to remain unchanged, an increase in debt would increase

                                     =  +  (0 ). Therefore, when  = ∗ and 0 = ∗ , a
one-dollar increase in  increases the tax shield associated with interest deductibility by

                                       (∗  ∗ )
                                                   =  ( +  (∗ ))                        (27)

Therefore, the left hand side of equation (25) is the marginal tax shield.
    Now consider the impact on interest payments of an increase in 0 , holding the amount
of debt unchanged. Partially diﬀerentiating equation (26) with respect to 0 , evaluating
this derivative at 0 = ∗ , and using  (∗ ) = ∗ , yields

                                        (∗  ∗ )

                                          0

Therefore, equation (28) implies that if 0 were to increase by 0 (∗ ), as would be the case
if  were to increase by one dollar, after-tax interest payments would increase by

                                  (∗  ∗ ) 0 ∗

                                    0

The left hand side of equation (29) is the marginal expected default cost, measured in flow
terms, that reflects the increased probability of default when  increases by one dollar.

equation (29) is identical to the right hand side of equation (25), so the right hand side of
equation (25) is the marginal expected cost of default associated with a one-dollar increase
in  Thus, equation (25) is a statement of the tradeoﬀ theory, equating the value of the
interest tax shield associated with an additional dollar of debt, expressed per unit of time,
and the marginal cost of increased exposure to default resulting from this increased debt,
also expressed per unit of time.

the curve through  and , which represents  () for  ≤ ∗ , meets the line segment ,
which represents  () for  ≥ ∗ . As discussed, the left-hand and right-hand derivatives of
 () are equal to each other at  = ∗ , so the meeting of the curve through  and  and
the line segment  is smooth, that is, diﬀerentable, at point .26


5     Threshhold Tax Rates
The tax rate,  , determines whether the firm is in Scenario I, II, or III. For low values of
  0, the marginal interest tax shield is so small that it is overwhelmed by the marginal
expected default cost, and hence the firm is in Scenario I, where it does not expose itself to
any chance of default. For high values of  , the marginal interest tax shield is so strong
that the firm always borrows as much as lenders are willing to lend, and hence the firm is in
Scenario III. For intermediate values of  , defined in the following proposition, the firm is in
Scenario II, where the tradeoﬀ theory is operative if  () ≥ ∗ , and the borrowing constraint
binds if  ()  ∗ .

  26
     This smooth meeting of the curve through  and  and the line segment  is superficially similar to
the smooth-pasting condition that arises in optimal stopping problems with an underlying diﬀusion process.
In those problems, the value-matching and smooth-pasting conditions are two separate boundary conditions
that pin down two parameters in the solution. In the current framework, the fundamental stochastic variable
has finite variation whereas in optimal stopping problems with a diﬀusion process, the stochastic variable
has infinite variation. In the current framework, equality of the left-hand and right-hand derivatives of
 ( ()) at  = ∗ arises as a consequence of the value-matching condition. That equality does not impose
any additional structure or restriction on the solution.

6     Eﬀect of a Rightward Translation of  ()
I have examined the relationship between optimal debt and contemporaneous profitability,
 (). Now I turn attention to the relationship between optimal debt and the prospects for
future profitability represented by the distribution function  (). Specifically, I examine
an improvement in future prospects for profitability that is a rightward translation of the
distribution  () to a new distribution, indexed by  ≥ 0,  () ≡  ( − ) on the
support [Φ ()  Φ ()], where Φ () = Φ + , Φ () = Φ +  and [Φ  Φ ] is
the support of the original distribution  (). For a given value of , let  ( () ; ) be
the value of the firm when  =  (), let    b ( () ; ) be the optimal value of debt when
 =  (), let  ( () ; ) be the instantaneous probability of default when  =  (), let
 (; ) be the tradeoﬀ function  (), and let ∗ () and ∗ () be the values of ∗ and
∗ , respectively.
    The following proposition states that a rightward translation of the distribution  ()
increases the value of the firm,  ( () ; ), for any  () in the intersection of the supports
of the original distribution and the new distribution.

Proposition 16 For 0    Φ − Φ and any  () ∈ [Φ +  Φ ],  ( () ; ) 

6.1      Eﬀect of a Rightward Translation of  () in Scenario I
In Scenario I, the firm issues the amount of debt shown in Proposition 12, which is the
highest amount of debt that it can issue without exposing itself to a chance of default.

    A rightward translation of the distribution  () by one unit increases EBIT by one
unit in every state, which increases the expected present value of EBIT by 1 , since the firm
will never default and hence will receive a stream of EBIT forever. Therefore, the optimal
amount of debt increases by 1 units (Statement 1). A rightward translation of  () reduces
the value of equity for any given  () because the increase in the firm’s debt outweighs the
increase in total firm value resulting from improved future prospects of the firm (Statement
2).28 That is, the decline in the value of equity for a given  () is smaller than the increase in
the optimal amount of debt, so that, consistent with Proposition 16, a rightward translation
of  () increases the total value of the firm for any given  () (Statement 3). Finally, the
increase in debt and the decrease in the value of equity increase the leverage ratio for any
given  () (Statement 4).

Therefore, the first-order condition in equation (24) can be written as

    To understand why ∗0 ()  1, suppose that ∗ () = ∗ (0) +  so that a rightward
translation of the distribution by  increases ∗ by , which would leave the  (∗ () − )
and  (∗ () − ) unchanged but would increase  (∗ () ; ) through the direct eﬀect
of an increase in  on the firm’s value and through the eﬀect in Proposition 16. Therefore,
the marginal interest tax shield in equation (34) would remain unchanged, but the marginal
expected cost of default would increase, thereby reducing the reducing the optimal amount
of debt and hence reducing the associated critical value ∗ () below ∗ (0) + .

reduces the probability of default, which is  ( () − ). Thus, for any  (), a rightward
translation of the distribution of profitability reduces  ( () ; ) (Statement 1 of Proposi-
tion 19). A rightward translation of the distribution, which is an increase in , decreases
 +  (; ), which enters the marginal interest tax shield, and, since  0 (; ) ≥ 0, de-
creases  (; ), which enters the marginal expected cost of default. If  ()  0, then the
percentage decrease in the marginal interest tax shield exceeds the percentage decrease in
 () when  increases, and so the value of ∗ () falls. Since ∗ () =  (∗ () ; ), the
fall in ∗ implies that  (∗ () ; ) falls (Statement 2 of Proposition 19). Furthermore,
since an increase in  increases  (; ), the value of ∗ () falls to achieve the fall in
 (∗ () ; ) (Statement 3 of Proposition 19).
     If the distribution  () is uniform, so that  0 () ≡ 0, it satisfies the condition in
Proposition 19 that  () is non-decreasing. With  () being uniform,  () =  () =

distribution, a rightward translation reduces ∗ , reduces ∗ , and reduces  (∗ () ; ).
     Figure 3 illustrates the impact of a rightward translation of  () for the case in which
 (∗ () − )  0, which includes the uniform distribution. In response to a rightward
translation of  (), the value of ∗ falls from its initial value of ∗ (0) to its new value of
∗ () (Statement 3). In addition, the curves representing equity value, optimal debt, and
the total value of the firm move from the solid curves to the dashed curves. As shown,

value of the firm increases for all  () (Proposition 16), as shown by the shift from the
solid curve through , , and , to the dashed curve that lies above it. The response of
optimal debt to a rightward translation of  () depends on whether  is high or low. For
 () ≥ ∗ (0), the optimal value of debt, which is invariant to  () in this range, falls in
response to a rightward translation of  () (Statement 2). The continuation value of the
firm increases, thereby increasing the cost of losing this future value by defaulting on debt.
In response to this increased cost of default, the firm reduces its exposure to default by
reducing the amount of debt it issues and reduces the critical value ∗ . For  () ≤ ∗ (),
the optimal amount of debt increases in response to a rightward translation of  () because
the borrowing constraint is binding for low values of  () and a rightward translation of
 () increases the total value of the firm, which allows the firm to borrow an increased
amount. Finally, there is some    e ∈ (∗ ()  ∗ (0)), not labelled in Figure 3, such that a
rightward translation of  () increases optimal debt for  ()       e and decreases optimal
debt for  ()  .e 30

 (),31 it is helpful to recall that (       in the first-order condition in equation (34)
equals the marginal interest tax shield minus the marginal expected default cost. Holding
∗ () fixed, an increase in  (1) reduces the marginal interest tax shield (by reducing
 (∗ () − )) and, (2) if  () is uniform so that  (∗ ()) is invariant to , increases
the marginal cost of default (by increasing  (∗ ()  )). Therefore, an increase in 
             ∗ ())
makes (          negative. Because  (; ) is strictly concave in , a reduction in 
is needed to restore the first-order condition. In order to obtain the opposite eﬀect, that
is, in order for an increase in  to increase the optimal value of ∗ , an increase in  must
reduce the marginal default cost–and must do so by more than the reduction in the marginal

      The text has shown that when  (∗ )  0, ∗ ()  ∗ (0) =          b (∗ (0) ; 0). Note that ∗ () =
b ( () ; ) =  ( () ; )   ( () ; 0) = 

b (∗ () ; 0)  ∗ ()    b (∗ (0) ; 0). Since 
                                                    b (; 0) is increasing in  for   ∗ (0), there is a unique

      Section D in the online appendix analyzes the case in which the unconditional distribution of EBIT is a

interest tax shield. Such a reduction in the marginal default cost requires that an increase in
 reduces  (∗ () − ), for given ∗ (), by a suﬃciently large amount, which will occur
if  0 (∗ ) is large enough to make  (∗ )  0.
     The tradeoﬀ theory of capital structure is operative only in Scenario II and, indeed, only
for  () ≥ ∗ in Scenario II. When the tradeoﬀ theory is operative, i.e., when  () ≥ ∗ ,
the optimal value of debt equals ∗ . In the focal case of a uniform distribution, and
more generally when  (∗ )  0, Proposition 19 implies that a rightward translation of the
distribution  () reduces the optimal amount of debt and hence reduces the optimal leverage
ratio. When  ()  ∗ , the tradeoﬀ theory is not operative and   b ( () ; ) =  ( () ; ).
Therefore, Proposition 16 implies that the optimal value of debt increases in response to a
rightward translation of  () in Scenario II when  ()  ∗ . Of course, whenever  () ≤ ∗ ,
the optimal leverage ratio equals one and thus is invariant to a translation of  ().


6.3    Eﬀect of a Rightward Translation of  () in Scenario III
In Scenario III, the borrowing constraint binds, that is,        b ( () ; ) =  ( () ; ) for
all  (). Therefore, Proposition 16 implies that in Scenario III a rightward translation
of  () increases  ( ()) and hence increases       b ( ()) for all  (). Of course, with
b ( () ; ) =  ( () ; ) for all  (), the optimal leverage ratio equals one for all  () in
Scenario III.


6.4    Summary of Eﬀects of Increased Profitability
Table 1 summarizes the findings about the impact of increased profitability on optimal debt
when  ()  0, which includes the case in which  () is uniform. The top third of the table
summarizes characteristics of the diﬀerent scenarios. The tradeoﬀ theory will be operative
if and only if (1) the borrowing constraint (B.C., in the table) is not binding and (2) the
firm faces a positive probability of default. Only Scenario IIA meets these two criteria,
so the tradeoﬀ theory is operative only in Scenario IIA. Among the scenarios in which
the firm faces a positive probability of default (Scenarios IIA, IIB, and III), an increase in
profitability–either an increase in current profitability,  (), or a rightward translation of
the unconditional distribution  ()–can reduce the optimal leverage ratio only in Scenario
IIA, that is, only when the tradeoﬀ theory is operative. Thus, in the context of the model

presented here, in which the tradeoﬀ theory can be operative or not, the empirical finding
of a negative relationship between profitability and the leverage ratio is consistent only with
the tradeoﬀ theory being operative, if the probability of default is positive.


7     Persistence of Profitability Across Regimes
I derived the main result of this paper—that the leverage ratio is negatively related to prof-
itability when the tradeoﬀ theory is operative—by assuming that profitability is i.i.d. across
regimes. Under this assumption, the tradeoﬀ function  () defined in equation (10) is
independent of  (), which implies that ∗ is independent of  (). And when the tradeoﬀ
                                   b ( ()), equals ∗ so the optimal level of debt is invariant
theory is operative, optimal debt, 
                                         
to  (). Therefore, the leverage ratio, (())
                                          (())
                                                  , is decreasing in  () because the value of the
firm is increasing in  ().
    In this section, I show that with persistence across regimes, the optimal amount of debt


                                                34
can be a decreasing function of profitability when the tradeoﬀ theory is operative. To the
extent that higher profitability reduces the amount of debt, it strenghtens the major finding
of this paper that when the tradeoﬀ theory is operative, the leverage ratio is a decreasing
function of profitability. And to the extent that higher profitability reduces the amount
of debt, the probability of default is a decreasing function of profitability when the tradeoﬀ
theory is operative.
    Suppose that the current time is  and let 0 denote the time of the first regime change after
. Let  ( (0 )   ()) be the distribution of  (0 ) conditional on  (), and let  ( (0 )   ()) ≡
 ((0 )())
    (0 )
                 be the associated conditional density. I will model stable persistence in prof-
itability across regimes by assuming that

                                       ( (0 )   ())    ( (0 )   ())

Persistence is captured by the first inequality in equation (37), which implies that if 2  1 ,
then the distribution of  (0 ) conditional on  () = 2 first-order stochastically dominates
the distribution of  (0 ) conditional on  () = 1 . The second inequality captures stability.
For instance, it implies that a one-unit increase in  () increases each q-quantile of the
conditional distribution of  (0 ) by less than one unit.32
   Under the conditional distribution  ( (0 )   ()), the tradeoﬀ function  () in equation

implies that 0 ≤     ()       1.

Proposition 20 If  ( (0 )   ()) is non-increasing in  (), the value function  ( ()) is

    The first of the two terms on the right hand side of equation (40) is the marginal interest
tax shield. Equation (37) implies that a higher value of  () leads to a lower value of
this marginal interest tax shield for any given value of , thereby reducing the incentive to
issue debt. The second term on the right hand of equation (40) is the marginal expected
cost of default. A higher value of  () could lead to a higher or a lower value of this cost
by increasing or decreasing the density,  ( −1 ()   ()). If the impact on the marginal
interest tax shield outweighs the impact of any change in the marginal expected cost of
default, the value of ∗ falls.
    The instantaneous conditional probability of default at time  in equation (18) is

which is the instantaneous conditional probability that a new regime will arrive with a value
of  (0 ) that is low enough that the new value of the firm,  ( (0 )), is less than outstanding
bonds,    b ( ()). Therefore,
                                                                           ³     ³           ´      ´

    The two terms on the right hand side of equation (42) correspond to channels (1) and (2),
respectively, introduced in the discussion following Proposition 10. The first term captures
the eﬀect on the optimal amount of debt of an increase in  (), and the consequent eﬀect
on the probability of default. The second term captures the direct eﬀect of a change in the
conditional distribution on the probability of default at a given value of debt. If  () is i.i.d.

                                                36
across regimes, the second term is zero, and the sign of 0 ( ()) is the same as the sign of
                                                                         b ( ()) =  ( ());

      The following proposition describes optimal debt and the probability of default in a
simple example in which profitability is persistent across regimes.

Proposition 21 Suppose that  ( (0 )   ()) is uniform on [ ( ()) −   ( ()) + ],33
where   0 and 0  0 ( ())  1.

    Proposition 21 implies that the introduction of stable persistence across regimes in the
case of a uniform distribution has diﬀerent eﬀects depending on whether the tradeoﬀ the-
ory is operative or the borrowing constraint is binding. When the borrowing constraint
is binding, an increase in current profitability increases the value of the firm and hence in-
creases the optimal amount of debt, and increases the instantaneous conditional probability
of default, which is the same counter-intuitive result that holds with profitability is i.i.d.
across regimes.34 However, when the tradeoﬀ theory is operative, an increase in current
profitability reduces the optimal amount of debt and hence reduces the leverage ratio, which
reinforces the major result of this paper that profitability and leverage are negatively related
when the tradeoﬀ theory is operative. In addition, when the tradeoﬀ theory is operative, an
increase in current profitability reduces the instantaneous conditional probability of default.

8    Concluding Remarks
The model of debt choice developed and analyzed here is simple enough to be analytically
tractable yet rich enough to include situations in which the tradeoﬀ theory is operative as
well as situations in which it is not operative. This model points to factors, such as the
tax rate and the level of profitability, that determine whether or not the tradeoﬀ theory
is operative. To the extent that optimal behavior diﬀers depending on whether or not
the tradeoﬀ theory is operative, one could potentially use such diﬀerences in behavior to
empirically test the tradeoﬀ theory.
    The equality of the marginal tax shield resulting from interest deductibility and the
marginal cost of increased exposure to default associated with increased debt is the defining
feature of the tradeoﬀ theory of debt. The mere presence of interest deductiblity and
deadweight costs of default is not suﬃcient to ensure that the tradeoﬀ theory is operative. I
have demonstrated three situations in which the tradeoﬀ theory is not operative despite the
presence of interest deductibility and deadweight default costs. First, if the tax rate is very
low (Scenario I), the marginal benefit of the interest tax shield associated with an additional
dollar of debt is completely overwhelmed by the marginal cost associated with increased
exposure to default resulting from an additional dollar of debt. In this case, the firm will
take advantage of the tax shield oﬀered by interest deductibility, but will only borrow as much
as it can without exposing itself to any possibility of default. Thus, the tradeoﬀ theory is not
operative for tax rates that are suﬃciently low. Second, if the tax rate is suﬃciently high
(but not so high as to violate conditions for concavity of the value function), the marginal
benefit of the interest tax shield associated with an additional dollar of debt completely
overwhelms the marginal cost associated with increased exposure to default resulting from
an additional dollar of debt. In this case, the firm borrows as much as lenders are willing
to lend. The tradeoﬀ theory is not operative because the borrowing constraint is strictly
binding so the marginal benefit of the interest tax shield fails to equal the marginal cost of
increased default probability. Third, even if the tax rate is neither too low nor too high,
the tradeoﬀ theory will fail to be operative if the current value of EBIT is lower than the
critical value, denoted by ∗ in the model. In this situation, a low value of EBIT implies
that the current value of firm is low, which implies that the constraint on how much the
firm can borrow is strictly binding. In this situation, the marginal benefit of the interest


                                              38
tax shield exceeds the marginal cost of increased default probability, so, again, the tradeoﬀ
theory is not operative. The only situation in the model in which the tradeoﬀ theory is
operative is when the tax rate is neither too low nor too high and the current value of EBIT
is higher than the critical value ∗ . In this case, the optimal value of debt equates the
marginal benefit of the interest tax shield and the marginal cost of increased exposure to
default. In the baseline stochastic specification in which EBIT is i.i.d. across regimes, the
optimal value of debt is invariant to the contemporaneous value of EBIT when the tradeoﬀ
theory is operative.
    The relationship between profitability and optimal borrowing depends on whether the
tradeoﬀ theory is operative. Table 1 summarizes the impact on optimal borrowing of an
increase in profitability. In this table are two measures of leverage–the amount of debt
issued and the market leverage ratio–and two measures of profitability–current EBIT and
the unconditional distribution from which new values of EBIT are drawn. Two major lessons
emerge from this table. First, when the tradeoﬀ theory is operative, the leverage ratio is a
decreasing function of current EBIT; and provided that the unconditional density function
of EBIT does not slope upward too steeply, a rightward translation of the unconditional
distribution of EBIT reduces both the level of optimal debt and the optimal leverage ratio.
This finding that an increase in profitability leads to a reduction in the leverage ratio is
consistent with empirical analyses of this relationship. The second lesson is that provided
the firm faces a positive probability of default, the optimal leverage ratio is negatively related
to profitability only if the tradeoﬀ theory is operative. So the empirical finding of a negative
relationship between borrowing and profitability is not consistent with the alternatives to
the tradeoﬀ theory in this model.
    I will conclude by describing four potential extensions of the analysis in this paper. First,
the stochastic specification for EBIT can be generalized in various ways. For instance, the
arrival rate of new regimes, , can be a random variable. In particular, the arrival of a new
regime could be specified as a new realization of the vector (   ) drawn from a distribution
 (   ). If the realizations of (   ) are i.i.d. across regimes, the analysis of this paper
is easily extended, and would allow an added dimension of cross-sectional heterogeneity
across firms35 An alternative generalization of the stochastic structure would be to allow
for persistence in EBIT across regimes, as in Section 7. The analysis in Section 7 suggests
  35
       I thank an anonymous referee for pointing out this extension.


                                                      39
that persistence across regimes strengthens the appeal of the tradeoﬀ theory, at least in
the example in which the conditional distribution of EBIT is uniform. In that case, when
the tradeoﬀ theory is operative, the optimal amount of bonds is decreasing in profitability,
which reinforces the finding that the leverage ratio is decreasing in profitability, consistent
with empirical findings. In addition, when the tradeoﬀ theory is operative, the probability
of default is decreasing in profitability.
    Second, an important extension of the current model is to incorporate the capital invest-
ment decision. In ongoing work (Abel 2016), I develop and analyze a model in which a firm
can accumulate (or decumulate) physical capital subject to convex costs of adjustment. In
that framework, it continues to be the case that the optimal leverage ratio is a declining
function of profitability when the tradeoﬀ theory is operative.
    A third type of extension is to include flotation costs for bonds. Footnote 23 outlines a
simple extension with flotation costs specified as a convex function of the amount of bonds.
In that case, the tradeoﬀ theory is easily extended to a "modified tradeoﬀ theory." Future
research could analyze a broader variety of flotation costs, including perhaps a fixed cost
component of these costs.
    Fourth, the assumption of instantaneous maturity of bonds is analytically convenient
and, in fact, seems appropriate for overnight repos and commercial paper. However, future
research could examine bonds of longer maturity and address the optimal maturity of bonds.

Proof. of Proposition 2. Assume that 2  1 . Suppose, contrary to what is to be
proved, that    b (2 ) ≤  b (1 ). Therefore,      b (2 ) ≤   b (1 ) ≤  (1 ) ≤  (2 ) so both
b (1 ) and  b (2 ) are feasible both when  = 1 and when  = 2 . Since             b (1 ) is chosen
                                ³         ´      ³         ´
by the firm when  = 1 ,        b (1 )       b (2 ) because  () is strictly concave. Since
                                                    ³         ´      ³         ´
b (2 ) is chosen by the firm when  = 2 ,        b (2 )       b (1 ) because  () is strictly
concave, which is a contradiction. Therefore,         b (2 ) ≥  b (1 ) (Statement 1). To prove that
b ( ()) is non-decreasing in time, it suﬃces to prove that for any 2  1 where 1 and
2 are in consecutive regimes,      b ( (2 )) ≥  b ( (1 )). Suppose, contrary to what is to be
proved, that    b ( (2 ))  b ( (1 )). Since,    b ( (2 ))  b ( (1 )) ≤  ( (1 )), the firm
chooses   b ( (1 )) in preference to  b ( (2 )) when both are feasible. It would only choose
b ( (2 )) in preference to  b ( (1 )) when  =  (2 ) if    b ( (1 )) were not feasible, that is,
   b ( (1 ))   ( (2 )). In this situation, the firm would default on its debt, 
if                                                                                              b ( (1 )),
when the regime changes and  changes from  (1 ) to  (2 ) (Statement 2).
Proof. of Proposition 3. To prove the first inequality, 0   (Φ ), observe that a feasible
policy would be for the firm to never issue any bonds and to stay in operation forever, because
the assumption Φ  −   {} in equation (2) implies that  (Φ )  0. If  () = Φ
and the firm followed this all-equity policy forever, its value would be  (Φ ). Therefore,
 (Φ ) ≥  (Φ )  0. To prove the second inequality,  (Φ ) ≤       b ( ()), observe that if
the firm’s outstanding bonds are 0   (Φ ), there no possibility that the firm will choose
to default on the debt. In this case,  (0 ) =  0 , so that (1 −  )  () +  +  (0 ) =
(1 −  )  () +  +  0 . If 0   (Φ ), then (1 −  )  () +  +  0  (1 −  )  () +
 +   (Φ ), so 0   (Φ ) cannot be optimal. Therefore,  (Φ ) ≤          b ( ()). The
third inequality,  b ( ()) ≤  (Φ ), is a direct consequence of the borrowing constraint,
 ≤  (Φ ), and the fact that  () is strictly increasing (Proposition 1), so that  ( ()) ≤
 (Φ ).

                                                        . The definition of  () in equation (10)
implies  ( (Φ )) ≡  ( + )  (Φ ) − [ +  (1 − )] . Substituting this expression

Proof. of Lemma 14. Since,  1 =  1 = 0, equation (20) implies  ( ) = 0. Since
 (Φ ) ≤ ∗ ≤  (Φ ) and  () is strictly increasing in , there is a unique ∗ ∈ [Φ  Φ ]

Proof. of Proposition 15. The proof proceeds by presenting, for each scenario, the value
of ∗ that satisfies the first-order condition in equation (20) and the values of  1 and  2 that,
along with ∗ , lead to satisfaction of the complementary slackness conditions in equations
(21) and (22). Because the maximand in equation (19) is strictly concave in , a value of
 that satisfies equations (20), (21), and (22) is the unique value of ∗ .
     (I) Assume that     . Suppose that ∗ =  (Φ ),  1  0, and  2 = 0. Since ∗ =

the complementary slackness condition in equation (22) is satisfied. Since  2 − 1  0, the
first-order condition in equation (20) implies that 0 (∗ )  0. Thus, it suﬃces to show that
0 ( (Φ ))  0. Diﬀerentiating  () in equation (10) with respect to  and evaluating
the derivative at  = ∗ =  (Φ ), and using ∗ =  −1 (∗ ) =  −1 ( (Φ )) = Φ , yields

the first-order condition in equation (20) implies that 0 (∗ ) = 0. Thus, it suﬃces to show
that 0 () = 0 for some  ∈ [ (Φ )   (Φ )]. The proof will proceed by showing that if

ution,  (), is no higher than under the original distribution, 0 (). (2) if  () ∈

            () since  () ≡  0 () is non-decreasing. Therefore, the continuation value un-
der  () exceeds the continuation value under 0 (), and hence  ( () ; )   ( () ; 0)
for   0. Finally, because the continuation value of the firm for any given  () is higher
under  () than under 0 (), the default premium under  () is no higher than under
0 ().                                                                       h                i

the third inequality follows from the facts that  ( ) is non-decreasing in  and that
 ( (0 )  2 ) first-order stochastically dominates  ( (0 )  1 ). Therefore  maps non-
decreasing functions into strictly increasing functions.

   It remains to prove that 2 ( )−1 ( ) ≥ 0 when 1 ()   ≤ 2 (). Observe that
when 1 ()   ≤ 2 (), 2 ( ) − 1 ( ) = 2 () − [  + (1 −  ) (1 − ) 1 ()]

the left hand side of this first-order condition is decreasing in . An inrease in  () reduces
the first term on the left hand side, which is the marginal interest tax shield. Therefore, the
value of  must fall to satisfy the first-order condition. Hence,             b 0 ( ())  0 (Statement
1a). Since       b 0 ( ())  0 and from Proposition 20  ( ()) is strictly increasing in  (),

                                               is strictly decreasing in  () (Statement 1b). With

                                         regardless of whether the tradeoﬀ theory is operative or the
borrowing constraint is binding.             If the                                b0

increase in  () reduces  −1         b ( ()) . An increase in  () increases  ( ()). Therefore,

because  −1   b ( ()) decreases and  ( ()) increases, the probability of default,  ( ())
falls. (Statement 1c).
    Now consider the case in which the borrowing constraint is binding in a neighborhood of
 (). Therefore,  b ( ()) ≡  ( ()), and hence Proposition 20 implies that   b 0 ( ()) 
                                                                   ³          ´
0 (Statement 2a). Since      b ( ()) ≡  ( ()), we have  −1   b ( ()) =  (), so the
expression for  ( ()) can be written as  ( ()) = ()−(())+

   0
1− (())
   2
            0, where the inequality follows from the assumption 0  0 ( ())  1 (Statement
2b).

C           Closed-Form Solutions:  = 1 and  () is Uniform
          on [Φ Φ ]
In this online appendix, I derive closed-form solutions for optimal debt and shareholders’
equity in the special case in which (1)  = 1, so that default completely destroys the value
of the firm; and (2) the unconditional distribution  () is uniform. The assumption that
 = 1 simplifies the solution of the shareholders’ problem in Scenario II by permitting the
                    b ( ()), and  ( ()) for  () ≥ ∗ without having to simultaneously
calculation of ∗ , 
calculate  ( ()) for values of  ()  ∗ .37
    It will be convenient to represent the uniform distribution on [Φ  Φ ] by the mean
                                                                              −+ 12 

    Proposition 12 contains closed-form solutions for    b ( ()),  ( ()), and  ( ()) in
Scenario I for the more general case in which 0   ≤ 1 and  0 () ≥ 0, which includes the
uniform distribution as a special case. This Appendix presents closed-form solutions that
apply in Scenario II and Scenario III in the special case with  = 1 and uniform  ().

To distinguish situations in which ∗ falls in response to a rightward translation of  ()
from situations in which ∗ increases in response to a rightward translation of  (), consider

                  on the support [Φ  Φ ]. Assume that  ≥ 0,40 so that  0 () =  () ≥ 0,
which ensures that  () is concave. With this distribution function, the function  ()

            ³      ´
    Since  1 +   0, Corollary 23 indicates that a rightward translation of the truncated
exponential distribution will reduce ∗ for small   0, as well as for the uniform distribution
( = 0). In order to get the opposite result, that is, to get ∗ to increase in response to
a rightward translation of  (),  must be suﬃciently large, that is, the density function
must have a suﬃciently steep upward slope.
