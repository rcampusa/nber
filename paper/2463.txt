             Pension Backloading, Wage Taxes, and Work Disincentives


                                    ABSTRACT

    The Federal Government is actively involved in encouraging the formation and
growth of private pensions and in regulating their behavior. The primary form of
encouragement is the government's tax subsidization of pensions. A primary
attribute of pension plan provisions is an implicit tax on employment after
certain ages. The primary form of pension regulation is through ERISA, the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The government's involvement in
encouraging and regulating private pensions appears to reflect its desire that
workers have a secure source of old age income which will lessen their reliance on
Social Security. In recent years the government has reacted to demographic
changes, and their effects on Social Security funding, and the increase in early
retirement by also using its pension and Social Security tax and regulatory
policies to encourage workers to delay their retirement decision.

     This paper examines the structure of pension plans with two questions in
mind. First have government pension backloading regulations aimed at assuring
future pension benefits been effective? and, second, has the structure of old age
pension accrual at the end of the workspan, an implicit tax, greatly limited the
effectiveness of government policy in reversing the trend to early retirement?
The answers to these questions are important for assessing the benefits of the
government's tax subsidization of pensions, as they are currently structured.

     The principal findings of this study are:
     (1) ERISA regulations notwithstanding, a significant proportion of defined
          benefit plans exhibit severe backloading. Indeed, backloading is an
          inherent property of defined benefit pension plans.

     (2) A large fraction of defined benefit plans embed very substantial old age
          work disincentives, through an implicit tax on wage earnings.

     (3) These pension retirement incentives are often much greater than Social
          Security's retirement incentives.

     (4) Evidence from one large Fortune 500 firm indicates that pension
          retirement incentives can greatly increase the extent of early
          retirement.

I.   Introduction

     The Federal Government is actively involved in encouraging the

formation and growth of private pensions and in regulating their

behavior. The primary form of encouragement is the government's tax

subsidization of pensions. Workers are not taxed on their pension

benefits when they accrue, but rather when they are received, at which

time their tax brackets may be much lower. In addition, pension saving

accumulates tax-free interest. The primary form of pension regulation is

through ERISA, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The

government's involvement in encouraging and regulating private pensions

appears to reflect its desire that workers have a secure source of old

age income which will lessen their reliance on Social Security. In

recent years the government has reacted to demographic changes, and their

effects on Social Security funding, and the increase in early retirement

by also using its pension and Social Security tax and regulatory policies

to encourage workers to delay their retirement decision. What appears to

have received limited recognition is the extent of recent declines in the

labor force participation of older workers, and that while the proposed

increase in the Social Security retirement age is introduced to prolong

work, the provisions of private pension plans encourage early retirement.

     This paper examines the structure of pension plans with two

questions in mind. First have government pension backloading regulations

aimed at securing workers' their future pension benefits been effective?

and, second, has the structure of old age pension accrual at the end of

the workspan greatly limited the effectiveness of government policy in
                                       4

reversing the trend to early retirement? The answers to these questions

are important for assessing the effects of the government's tax

subsidization of pensions, as they are currently structured.



A.      Government Concern with Pension Backloading and the Labor Supply of
        the Aged

        Over the past two decades the government has been concerned with the

backloading (delaying) of the accrual of vested pension benefits.

Limiting the backloading of pension benefit accrual is an important

objective of ERISA, the 1974 Employee Retirement Income Security Act, as

well as subsequent legislation. The government's main concern with

pension backloading, reflected in ERISA's vesting and minimum benefit

accrual requirements, appears to be to insure that older workers are not

terminated, either intentionally or unintentionally, just in advance of

accruing significant pension benefits. Senator Bentsen expressed this

concern in introducing ERISA to Congress: "There are instances where

workers have not received pension benefits that they have earned through

years of long hard labor. Their dreams of financial security after

retirement have been shattered." Although the legislation appears

intended to limit the extent of backloading in defined benefit pension

plans, it seems not to recognize that backloading is inherent in the

benefit formulae of most defined benefit plans; it cannot be legislated

away.

        Another reason for concern about excessive pension backloading and,

more generally, the pattern of pension benefit accrual, involves

retirement incentives. If most pension benefits accrue before a
                                      5


particular age, say the age of early retirement, beyond which additional

accrual is negligible, or possibly negative, workers will have an

incentive to remain with the firm up to early retirement1 and then leave

the firm. In effect, pension provisions often impose a tax on earnings

after a particular age; wage earnings are offset by loss in pension

wealth. This implicit tax could thus be a major explanation of the trend

toward early retirement, a trend that the government is seeking to

reverse through planned increases in the age at which Social Security

benefits are received.

     Although the backers of the ERISA legislation were apparently

prompted by the potential avoidance of pension liabilities through

layoff, backloading of pension accrual has much more general implications

for worker mobility. Job change, by itself, reduces pension benefits.

Even if it involves no change in future wage earnings and even if the

provisions of the pension plans on the old and the new jobs are the same,

workers who change jobs will typically have much lower pension benefits

at retirement age than those who remain with the same employer. Thus

pension provisions may inhibit worker mobility, and therefore, adjustment

to changing economic circumstances.

     The 1980s have witnessed a marked shift in government policy toward

promoting the labor supply of the elderly. The government has virtually

eliminated mandatory retirement, and scheduled a gradual increase in

Social Security's retirement age. It has limited somewhat Social

Security's earnings test that reduces Social Security benefits for

"retired" workers earning more than an "exempt amount"; it has eliminated
                                    6


the earnings test after age 70, and is increasing the actuarial incentive

to delay the receipt of Social Security benefits beyond age 65. The

government has also required that pension plans provide continued pension

benefit accrual for workers who remain with the firm beyond the pension

plan's normal retirement age.



R.   Demographic Change Meets the Trend Toward Early Retirement

     The change in government policy toward the labor supply of the

elderly is responsive to the major demographic swing currently underway,

with its important implications for retirement finances in the next

century. The elderly (those over 64), who now constitute about one-fifth

of all adults, will constitute about two-fifths of all adults by 2040.

Given Social Security's pay-as-you-go method of finance, the projected

increase in the ratio of beneficiaries to contributors means either

significant cuts in future benefits or significant future increases in

Social Security's payroll tax rate. While the 1983 Social Security

legislation provides a plan for dealing with the baby boomer's

demographic bulge, there is real concern that the plan will not be fully

implemented; and if it is fully implemented, there is concern that it

will not be sufficient.

     Reversing the trend toward early retirement represents an important

alternative for addressing the demographic transition. Additional labor

supply of the elderly would relieve Social Security's finances as well as

offset a potential shortage in the supply of labor relative to that of

other productive factors. Despite recent changes in government policy,
                                    7

the early retirement trend remains quite strong. Table 1 presents the

labor force participation rates of men between the ages 40 to 64 since

1967. In 1967 the labor force participation rate of men age 55 to 59 was

90.1 percent; it was 81.9 percent in 1980 and 79.0 percent in 1986. For

males 60 to 64 the 1986 labor force participation rate was 54.9 percent,

down from 61.0 percent in 1980 and 77.6 percent in 1967. The

participation rate of men over 65 fell from 35 percent in 1960 to below

20 percent in 1980 (figures not shown in the table).



C.   Are Pension Plans the Major Old Age Work Deterrent?

     While economists have pointed to Social Security as well as general

increases in living standards as the key explanations for increased early

retirement, there has been little attention given to the retirement

incentives associated with private pension plan provisions. Our analysis

of a recent Bureau of Labor Statistics cross section survey of pension

plans indicates a large proportion with substantially backloaded pension

plans; these plans typically have very sizable accrual as the age of

either early or normal retirement approaches and often have more lower,

or even negative pension accrual, thereafter. Such accrual profiles

engender very large implicit taxes on labor supply beyond the age at

which the significant pension accrual occurs. These old age pension work

disincentives often exceed those arising from the effect of Social

Security provisions on Social Security accrual, and from the effect of

the Social Security earnings test. In addition to fostering early

retirement, such accrual profiles raise the concern, voiced by Senator

Bensten, that workers may be terminated, or change jobs for other

reasons, immediately prior to accruing the great majority of their

pension benefits.



D.   Organization of the Paper

     Before presenting the new evidence on pension backloading practices,

we briefly discuss in the next Section a possible economic rationale for

pension backloading as well as the potential economic problems arising

from the government's regulation of the pattern of pension accrual and,

more generally, its anti-age discrimination policy.

     Section III introduces the concept of pension accrual and

demonstrates how in many instances it imposes an implicit tax on wage

earnings; sometimes it increases total compensation, other times it

reduces it. Illustrative graphs indicate that defined benefit pension

plans are typically severely backloaded. Section IV discusses ERISA's

anti-backloading rules and suggests why they are ineffective in limiting

backloading. Section V presents findings on the accrual of pension

benefits based on the 1979 Bureau of Labor Statistics Level of Benefits

Survey (BLS-LOB). This survey of 1469 establishments with 3,386,121

pension participants, provides extremely detailed information concerning

vesting, early and normal retirement benefits, supplemental early

retirement benefits, and Social Security offset formulae, each of which

are crucial inputs to the calculation of pension accruals.

     Section VI examines the retirement response of workers in a large

Fortune 500 company to the pattern of pension accrual. The pension
                                      10

accrual profile for this firm exhibits very substantial backloading with

disproportionate benefit accrual at the age of early retirement and only

modest accrual thereafter. This pension accrual profile appears to

substantially increase the early retirement of the firm's employees. We

estimate that the firm's accrual profile increases from 14 percent to 44

percent the probability that a worker age 55 will leave employment prior

to age 60. The last Section of the paper briefly summarizes our findings

and raises some questions relevant to pension policy.



II. An Economic Rationale for Pension Backloading

     In recent years the traditional spot market view of the labor

market, in which compensation equals productivity at each point in time,

has given way to a contract view. According to the contract view,

workers and firms enter into long term relationships, that may be

explicit or implicit, in which there is a relationship over time between

compensation and productivity, but not necessarily an equality between

the two at any given point in time.

     The economic rationale for long term labor contracts as opposed to

short term spot market arrangements is that firms can structure

compensation over the workspan to improve worker incentives. For

example, by paying workers less than they produce when young and more

than they produce when old, the firm provides the worker with an enhanced

incentive to remain with the firm. It may also provide an incentive to

work harder; the cost of shirking becomes not only the loss of one's

current salary, but also the lost opportunity to earn more than one
                                    11

produces in the future. This carrot-stick age-related structure of

compensation is not only potentially beneficial to employers, but to

workers as well. By reducing worker turnover and increasing effort, the

firm can afford to pay workers a higher present value of compensation.

Such higher present value payments to workers do not reflect the

benevolence of employers, but instead the outcome of a competitive

contract market in which firms compete with each other in hiring

workers.

     While the long term contract view of labor arrangements implies that

the firm will compensate the worker in excess of his or her productivity

after an initial period in which the reverse is true, the length of time

during which compensation exceeds productivity cannot be unlimited. The

firm's competitive interest is in reimbursing the worker when old for

earning less than he or she produced when young. But not in paying the

worker more than is necessary to balance the account. Hence, the firm's

interest is in fixing the length of time in which compensation exceeds

productivity. As pointed out by Lazear (1979), mandatory retirement

provides a convenient mechanism for limiting this time period.

     Compensation can be paid as wage earnings or as pension accrual.

Therefore, one mechanism for paying deferred compensation at certain

ages, and for reducing compensation at subsequent ages, is to provide

significant positive pension accrual prior to a critical age, and small

or even negative pension accrual thereafter.

     In eliminating mandatory retirement the government may have reduced

one important mechanism by which employers were able to limit the amount
                                      12

of deferred compensation. If Congress were also to proscribe abrupt

changes in the age-profile of pension or any other form of compensation,

firms might find it even more difficult to structure deferred

compensation efficiently.

      In addition to potential assistance in providing work incentives,

the age-profile of pension accrual may represent a graceful mechanism to

lower the wages of older workers if, as seems likely (see Kotlikoff,

1987), they become less productive with age. As described below, pension

accrual after early and/or normal retirement ages is often quite small,

if not negative.



III. Pension Benefit Accrual Formulae and Implicit Tax on Wage Earnings

      Vested pension benefit accrual at age a, 1(a), equals the difference

between pension wealth at age a+l, Pw(a+l), and pension wealth at age a,

Pw(a), accumulated to age a+l at the nominal interest rate r, i.e.,


(1)        1(a) = Pw(a+l) —   Pw(a)(1+r)

Pension accrual is thus the increment to pension wealth in excess of the

return on the previously accumulated pension bank account. Pension

wealth at age a is defined as the expected value of vested pension

benefits discounted to age a. The term "expected" refers to the use of

mortality probabilities to assess the chances that the worker will be

alive at future ages when benefits are available. Intuitively, Pw(a) can

be thought of as the worker's pension bank account. If 1(a) equals zero,

the worker continuing employment with the plan sponsor at age a has
                                   13

exactly the same pension wealth at age (a+l) as an identically situated

worker who terminates employment at age a. He receives no compensation

in the form of increased future pension benefits.

     Figure 1 presents the age-profile of accrued pension benefits

divided by wages for a hypothetical plan under different assumptions

about real wage growth and nominal interest rates. The top profile, for

example, is based on a 3 percent rate of real wage growth and a 9 percent

nominal interest rate. The inflation rate assumed in each profile is 6

percent. The plan provides 100 percent vesting at ten years of service

and calculates normal retirement benefits as 1 percent of average

earnings over the last 5 years of service times the number of years of

service. The plan's early and normal retirement ages are 55 and 65,

respectively. Workers can retire early and receive early retirement

benefits which equal normal retirement benefits reduced by 3 percent for

each year that retirement precedes the normal retirement age.

     There are two significant discontinuities in the profiles. One

occurs at age 40 when the worker becomes vested; clearly in going from

age 39 to age 40 the worker's vested pension wealth changes abruptly from

zero to a positive number explaining the jump in the profile. The second

discontinuity occurs at the age of early retirement. It arises because

the 3 percent per year early retirement reduction factor is much more

generous than an actuarial reduction. By retiring a year earlier, the

worker gains a year's benefit with only a modest, 3 percent, payment for

that delay. To understand more clearly why there is a discontinuous fall

in pension accrual at early retirement, consider the case in which the

early retirement reduction factor is zero. In this case by working an

additional year after age 55 the worker loses that year's benefit

entirely. While it is true that his (her) future benefit will likely be

larger because of an additional year of service and possibly an increase

in the earnings base, the loss of this year's benefit may significantly

offset or even outweigh, in present value, this benefit increase,

implying a small or negative pension accrual during the period after

early    retirement.
       The diagram indicates roughly a halving in the accrual ratio between
ages   55 and 56. Beyond age 55 the accrual ratio declines gradually. If

one assumes a sufficiently high interest rate, the accrual after age 55

is negative. According to the three curves, total compensation is

roughly 8 percent lower, ceteris paribus, at age 65 than at age 55. The

diagram also indicates that much of the accrual of vested pension

benefits occurs in the ages immediately preceding age 55. Figure 2 shows

the effect of the lower than actuarial reduction for early retirement on

the hypothetical plan's accrual profile. It compares the top profile of

Figure 1 with the profile that would occur if the reduction factor were

actuarial, or, what is equivalent, if workers were forced to wait until

the normal retirement age to collect benefits. Notice that the

discontinuity at age 65 disappears. Also note that the backloading in

the "Retirement at 65 Only" profile is even greater than that in the

profile with the early retirement option. This is inherent in the

defined benefit formula, with the benefit at age a typically given by

B(a) =   k.W(a).T(a),   where W(a) is the wage at age a, T(a) is years of

service at age (a), and k is a multiplier often between .01 and .02. If

k=.02, the worker's benefit, in nominal dollars, is 2 percent of his

final wage for each year of service; after working 30 years, the pension

would equal 60 percent of the final wage.



A.   The Accrual Profile for a Large Fortune 500 Firm

     The profiles presented in the first two diagrams, while indicative

of a considerable degree of backloading, are based on a hypothetical plan

with rather simple features. But if one thing is true of private pension

plans it is that there is enormous variation among them. Figure 3

presents the pension accrual profile of male managers hired at age 20 in

the Fortune 500 firm whose retirement behavior is discussed in Section

VI. The diagram also includes the estimated age-wag profile in absolute

1985 dollars for the managers as well as the age-accrual profile of

Social Security benefits.

     In addition to having ten year "cliff" vesting, a two step

earnings-related normal retirement benefit formula, this plan has a

Social Security offset, a supplemental early retirement benefit, and

special early retirement benefit reduction factors. The supplemental

early retirement benefit and the less than actuarially fair reduction

factors are available only to workers who remain with the firm through

age 55, the early retirement age. Workers who leave at age 54 or earlier

can start collecting their vested benefits at age 55, but these benefits

are actuarially reduced. In addition, such pre-early retirement

terminators receive benefits that are immediately reduced by the Social

Security offset. In contrast, for workers retiring at age 55 or later,

the Social Security offset does not occur until age 65; hence, the

supplemental early retirement benefit corresponds to the Social Security

offset for each year between the age of retirement and age 65.

     Thus there are two important reasons for the accrual spike at early

retirement in figure 3. The first is the non-actuarial early retirement

reduction factors, and the fact that they are available only to those

remaining with the firm until age 55; the second is the delay in the

Social Security offset which is also only provided to workers remaining

through early retirement.

     Now that we understand the source of the large accrual spike in

figure 3, let us consider its size and implications. First the spike at

age 55 is very large -   - over   one and one half times a year's earnings.

Second, between age 55 and 60, accrual, while small in comparison with

the spike at 55, is still quite important. However, after age 60 accrual

is negative, becoming significantly negative by age 65. Clearly, this is

an extremely backloaded pension plan that provides workers with a strong

incentive to remain with the firm through early retirement and a strong

incentive to leave the firm thereafter. For workers who quit or

otherwise lose their jobs at, for example, age 54, there is a very

substantial loss in benefits compared with remaining on the job through

age 55. In its effect accrual profiles of this kind recreate the

situation of some plans prior to ERISA in which workers could be

terminated immediately before they accrued the bulk of their potential
                                   20

pension benefits. There is clear evidence that this does not happen in

this firm, however.



IV. How Firms May Circumvent ERISA's Anti-Backloading Rules

     ERISA stipulates that defined benefit pension accrual must satisfy

one of three provisions. The first is a 3 percent rule that says that a

worker's accrued benefit must exceed his years of service times 3 percent

of the normal retirement benefit he would have if he had begun service at

the earliest possible age of participation and had remained with the firm

until normal retirement. That is, for each year of employment pension

accrual must be at least 3 percent of the amount the worker will have if

he stays until normal retirement. The second is a 133 percent rule that

says that future projected annual pension accrual cannot exceed 133

percent of current annual pension accrual. The third provision

stipulates that the terminating worker's benefit be not less than his

projected normal retirement benefit times the ratio of actual completed

service to the service the worker would have if he remained with the firm

through early retirement. That is, if the worker leaves after 20 years

and normal retirement would be after 40 years, his benefit must be 50

percent of what he would have if he worked 20 more years.

     Each of these three provisions specifies that the projection of

future normal retirement benefits and future pension accrual be

determined by assuming that a worker's future wage equals his current

wage. But if there is wage inflation future wages may be much greater

than current wages, and the real value of current accrual may be quite
                                    21

low. Thus even a modest rate of wage inflation could permit a quite

backloaded plan that, nonetheless, meets one of the three

anti-backloading provisions. The choice of other assumptions in the

accrual calculation, such as the interest rate, also give firms

additional latitude in deferring pension accrual.

     However, the main method of backloading that does not appear to be

ruled out by the three ERISA rules, involves early retirement

provisions. The accrual rules pertain to normal retirement benefits,

rather than early retirement benefits. Extra benefits arising from

supplemental early retirement benefits or from less than actuarial

reductions of early retirement benefits do not appear to be considered in

the three anti-backloading rules. Thus a firm could structure its plan

to have small normal retirement benefit, but to have substantial early

retirement benefit, for example. It could easily conform its accrual of

the small normal retirement benefit to one of the three ERISA rules, but

yet remain free to specify quite large early retirement benefits which

only accrue if the worker stays with the firm through a critical age.

Recall the example of the large firm considered here; this firm provides

extra early retirement benefits in the form of (1) a waiver until the age

of normal retirement in their offset of benefits due to Social Security

and (2) less than actuarial early retirement reduction rates.



V.   Pension Accrual in the BLS-LOB Data

     In this section we examine accrual ratios for earnings-based defined

benefit plans from the BLS-LOB survey. Earnings based plans account for
                                        22

approximately 80 percent of BLS-designated usable plans from the survey

and about 65 percent of plans weighted by pension coverage. Each of the

earnings-based plans we examine stipulates cliff-vesting at 10 years, but

the plans have different normal and early retirement ages. Other

earnings-based plans with different vesting ages have accrual profiles

similar to those that we shall describe, but for convenience of

exposition we have not included them in our analysis here. Of the 1,183

earnings-based plans we examine, 508 are integrated with social security

under an offset formula. The accrual profiles were calculated assuming a

6 percent nominal wage growth up to age 65, after which nominal wage

growth is assumed to be zero. We also assume a 9 percent interest rate.

Our calculations are based on the industry-occupation-age-earnings

profiles reported in Kotlikoff and Wise (1987).



A.   The Decline in Pension Wealth Accrual at Early and Normal Retirement
     Ages

     Age profiles o,f the average ratio of pension accrual to the wage for

the percent of earnings plans with 10-year cliff vesting are shown in

table 2 by early and normal retirement ages. Three of these average

profiles, corresponding to plans with the respective early and normal

retirement ages --   55-55,   55-65, 65-65 --,   are graphed in figure 4. The
55-55 and the 65-65 profiles show a considerable degree of backloading,

the first with disproportionate accrual as age approaches 55, and the

second as age approaches 65. In addition, each of the graphs show very

substantial declines in the rate of pension wealth accrual at several

critical ages. The first is the age of normal retirement, which equals
                                   23

the age of early retirement for plans with no early retirement option.

Second, there is a sharp decline in the rate of accrual at the age of

early retirement, but this decline is substantially lower than the

decline at the normal retirement age. Third, there is a very substantial

decline between ages 65 and 66 in the average accrual rate no matter what

the ages of early and normal retirement. This age 65 decline would,

however, be smaller under current law which mandates continued

participation in the plan's benefit formula after the plan's normal

retirement age. This 1986 legislation was not incorporated in these

accrual analyses because the law postdates our information on the pension

plans. The new law may have temporarily altered the post normal

retirement accrual pattern. But, if the patterns depicted here were

chosen for a specific reason, and there is little evidence that they were

or that they were not, plans could add additional features that will

restore the pre-1986 decline in pension accrual after normal retirement.

     The declines in average accrual rates at the critical ages indicated

in table 2 are highlighted in table 3. The ages of early and normal

retirement are identical in columns 1, 4, 6, and 8 of the table with

respective retirement ages of 55, 60, 62, and 65. At these ages the

accrual rate as a percent of wages declines from .26 to 0, .27 to —.06,

.25 to —.13, and .21 to —.19 respectively. Thus, total annual

compensation (wage plus pension accrual) from working declines at these

ages by 21 percent, 26 percent, 30 percent, and 33 percent respectively.

Surely the incentive beyond these ages to continue work with the current

employer is very substantially reduced.

        In instances where early and normal retirement ages do not coincide,

there is also a very substantial decline in the average ratio of pension

accrual to the wage at the age of normal retirement. For example, among

plans with early retirement at 55 and normal retirement at 60 the average

decline is from .14 to —.09. There is also a decline at the age of early

retirement for these plans, although it is considerably less than the

decline at the age of normal retirement. For example, of plans with
         .-.

55 is from .10 to .07, while at 65 the average decline is from .04 to

—.15.

        The figure and the table also show a large variation in average

pension accrual at 40, the age of cliff vesting. It is highest, on

average, for plans with early and normal retirement at 55 and lowest, on

average, for plans with early and normal retirement at 65. As mentioned,

because the early retirement reduction is typically less than actuarially

fair, pension wealth - -       the   present value of the future stream of benefit

payments -   - is   generally greatest if benefits are taken at the age of

early retirement. Thus the accrued wealth at the age of vesting is

usually calculated by discounting benefits from the age of early

retirement, assuming that the worker could begin to collect benefits at

that age. Figure 4, for example, shows an average vesting spike of

almost 25 percent of earnings for 55-55 plans, 7 percent of earnings for

55-65 plans, and about 4 percent of earnings for 65-65 plans.

B.       Variation Among Plans

         Even among plans with the same early and normal retirement ages

there is wide variation in accrual rates at each age, particularly after

the age of early retirement. Consider the accrual ratio at age 55.

While the average ratio for this subsample is .097, the maximum is .405,

and the minimum is 0. The ratio at the lowest fifth percentile is 0,

while it is .208 for the highest fifth percentile. There is a similarly

70.      Weighted average accrual rates together with upper and lower 5

percentile levels are graphed in figure 5. While the average accrual

rates between ages 55 and 65 are positive, for many plans the rates prior

to age 65 are very negative. Thus it is very important not to base

judgments about the labor force participation incentive effects of

pensions simply on the basis of average accrual rates.

         Additional evidence of the variability of pension accrual profiles

and the possibility of severely backloaded plans is obtained by comparing

profiles of particular plans. Figure 6 plots the accrual profiles of

four of the sample's largest plans. Plan 1 exhibits a 29 percent vesting

spike, a reduction of 30 percentage points in the accrual ratio at age 55

and a further major reduction at age 65 from —.063 to —.351. In contrast

the vesting spike is only 4 percent for plan 2 in the figure. This plan

also exhibits no major reduction in the accrual ratio after early

retirement and only a minor reduction at normal retirement. Plan 3's

vesting spike is much less than that of plan 1, but the drop in accrual

at age 55 is very much larger than that in plan 1. This plan also

exhibits extremely sharp changes in accrual ratios at ages 60, and 63.

Plan 4 exhibits even greater discontinuities in the accrual profile and

more backloading then plan 3.   It shows little accrual before age 55,

accrual at 55 equivalent to about 75 percent of the wage, little accrual

at ages 56 through 59, accrual at 60 almost twice as large as wage

earnings, then negative accrual at ages 61 through 63 equivalent to about

50 percent of the wage. Clearly, the plans' incentive effects on labor

force participation also vary widely.



C.   Accrual Ratios by Industry and Occupation

     Holding fixed the early and normal retirement age, there is little

difference in average accrual profiles across industries or occupations.

But since these retirement ages differ, on average, particularly across

industries, a typical worker faces a much greater incentive to leave the

labor force early in some industries than in others. For example, a

large proportion of workers covered by pensions in transportation would

experience a 27 percent reduction in effective compensation by continuing

to work between 55 and 56. While at 55, pension accrual would be

equivalent to about 27 percent of wage rates for many workers in this

industry, if the worker continued in the labor force until age 66, his

annual loss in pension wealth would be equivalent to 30 percent of wage

earnings at 66. A large proportion of workers in manufacturing have

plans with early retirement at 55 and normal retirement at 65. In this

case, the accrual at 55 averages about 9 percent of the wage at 55 and

only declines to about 7 percent of the wage by 65. But then the accrual
                                    32

rate becomes negative, and if the worker were to continued in the labor

force between 65 and 66, the decline in pension accrual would amount to

an effective reduction in compensation of about 21 percent.



D.   The Possible Impact of the 1986 Age Discrimination Act on Pension
     Accrual

     Table 4 isolates the potential impact of the 1986 legislation

requiring continued participation in the pension formula after the planes

normal retirement age. The table presents the accrual ratios for percent

of earnings plans with early retirement at 55 and selected normal

retirement ages calculated first assuming that all of the plans had a

provision to credit fully post normal retirement service and second,

assuming that all the plans had no such credit provision. The table

indicates that the effect of crediting service after normal retirement

depends importantly on the age of normal retirement. For plans with a

normal retirement age of 55, negative accrual ratios are larger in

absolute value under no crediting prior to age 66 and smaller in absolute

value thereafter. A similar pattern, although less pronounced, is

observed after age 62 for plans with normal reitrernent at that age. The

least effect is found for the most common plans, those with normal

retirement at 65 (and early retirement at 55). If pension plans do not

alter some other features to reproduce the pre-1986 retirement

incentives, the 1986 legislation will have a nontrivial affect on

postpones retirement until the normal retirement age. The typical early
retirement supplement provides an addition to benefits if retirement

occurs after the age of early retirement. Retirement supplements, which

are not available to workers who leave prior to reaching specified ages,

thus provide a potentially powerful mechanism for pension backloading.

        The average accrual rates for percent of earnings and flat plans

with supplements, with 10-year cliff vesting, and with early and normal

retirement at 55 and 65 respectively, are shown in table 5 by type of

supplement. There are just two plans in the category with only normal

retirement supplements, but, nonetheless, the effect of the supplements

cn be seen in the first column of the table. The accrual rate jumps

from about 8 percent of the wage at age 64 to 60 percent of the wage at

age 65. Thus the supplement generates substantial backloading and

provides a relatively strong incentive to remain with the firm until age

65, but thereafter there is a sharp drop in the accrual rate to —18

percent.

       Accrual rates for plans with early retirement supplements are shown

in the second column of the table. In this case there is a sharp

increase in the average accrual rate from 12 percent of the wage at age

54 to 44 percent at age 55, with a sharp drop thereafter. Again, the

provision increases backloading and provides a substantial incentive to

remain with the firm until the age of early retirement, with a very

substantial disincentive to remaining thereafter. Accrual rates for

plans with both types of supplement are shown in the last column of the

table. In this case there is a rather large spike at the age of early

retirement, equal to 62 percent of the wage in that year, with a smaller,

but still noticeable spike at about the age of normal retirement.

     Accrual rates for percent of earnings and flat plans with either

type of supplement are shown in table 6 for selected early and normal

retirement ages. The spikes in the accrual rates are highlighted with

dashed lines. Consider, for example, plans with early retirement at age

55. The spike created by the early retirement supplement is from .22 at

age 54 to .39 at age 55 for plans with normal retirement at 55, from .12

at age 54 to .50 at age 55 for plans with normal retirement at 60, and

from .11 at age 54 to .48 at age 55 for plans with normal retirement at

65. Of the 56 plans with normal retirement at age 60, the pension

accrual rate at that age is, on average, equivalent to 100 percent of the

wage rate.

     Similar discontinuities in the accrual ratios are evident for plans

with other early and normal retirement ages. For example, of plans with

early and normal retirement at age 60, the accrual rate at that age is

equivalent to 64 percent of the annual wage for persons aged 60. Thus

these special supplements create very significant one-time additions to

remain with the firm until the age that the special supplement is

awarded. The special supplements also further dramatize the wide

variation in the incentive effects implicit in the provisions of private

pension plans.



VI. Pension Accrual and Retirement in a Large Firm

     This section considers the relationship between pension accrual and

retirement in the Fortune 500 firm whose plan is described in section

III. The data are the employment and earnings histories between 1969 and

1984 of all workers who were employed by the firm in any of years between

1980 and 1984. There are five sex-occupation groups: male and female

office workers, male and female salesworkers, and male managers. The

provisions of the firm pension plan are such that different workers face

very different pension accrual profiles and, thus, pension compensation.

As a consequence, different workers face very different incentives for

continued work versus retirement.

     To illustrate these provisions, pension accruals and predicted wages

(see Kotlikoff and Wise, 1987) for managers with different birth and hire

years are shown in tables 7 and 8, respectively. Those born in 1940

reach age 55 in 1995, and for each of these groups there is a

discontinuous increase in pension wealth in that year. It is $29,639 for

those with 15 years of service in that year and $82,953 for those with 25

years of service. Comparable jumps occur in 1985 for those born in

1930. Accruals are often negative for persons over 60. The differences

in accruals because of different amounts of service indicated in the

table reflect the fact that the benefit formula and early retirement

reduction factors are service-dependent.

     Pension accruals provide a large incentive for some groups to stay

in the firm for another year and strong incentive for others to leave.

For example, staying with the firm in 1985 brings pension accrual of

$72,527 for 55 year old managers with 25 years of service (born in 1930

and hired in 1960), but a loss of $14,936 for 65 year olds with 35 years

of experience (born in 1920 and hired in 1950). Thus there is enormous

variation across older workers in the effective compensation for

continued service. One might expect, therefore, that some groups would

be much more likely than others to retire in a given year.

     The pension accrual profiles for other employee groups look very

much like those for male managers. Accrual is minimal during the first

years of service. There is a very substantial discontinuous increase in

pension wealth at age 55. And accrual typically becomes negative after

30 years of service, sometimes before that. Social Security accrual

becomes negative after 65. The major differences among the groups stem

from different age-earnings profiles. An illustration of the similarity

and difference is provided by comparing figure 3, which depicts accrual

profiles for male managers, with figure 7, which depicts profiles for

salesmen.

A.   The Retirement Response to the Pattern of Pension Accrual

     Table 9 presents annual departure rates, the proportion of workers

who leave the firm before the end of the year, cross tabulated by age and

years of service. Several aspects of the data stand out. There is

substantial turnover in the first 9 years of employment, especially

during the first five years. On average, about 15 percent of those

employed five years or less leave in a given year. The table shows rates

only for employees 40 and older. The departure rates are somewhat higher

for younger workers, 16 or 17 percent for those employed 5 years or less

and 10 to 12 percent for those employed 6 to 9 years. There is a sharp

decline in departure rates at 10 years of service, when employees are

about to become vested in the pension plan. Before the early retirement

age, 55, the typical decline is from 8 or 9 to 4 or 5 percent. After 55,

when vesting carries with it eligibility for early retirement, it is much

sharper, often from 10 percent or more to 3 percent or less.

     The availability of early retirement benefits at 55 apparently has a

substantial effect on retirement. Before 55 departure rates are

typically around 2 percent over a broad spectrum of age-service

combinations. At 55, they jump to 10 percent or more. It is important

to notice that the departure rates stay at that level until age 60, when

there is another jump in the rate of departure. The jump at 60

corresponds to the age at which pension accrual becomes negative for many

employees.

     To understand the potential importance of the early retirement

benefits, suppose that if it were not for this inducement, the departure

rates would remain at 3 percent until age 60, instead of the 10 or 12

percent rates that are observed. (Notice that the departure rates for

employees aged 55 to 61 who are in their tenth year of service- -not yet

vested and hence not eligible for early retirement benefits- -are also two

or three percent on average.) Departure at 3 percent per year would mean

that 14 percent of those who were employed at 55 would have left before

age 60. At a departure rate of 11 percent per year, 44 percent would

leave between 55 and 59. Such a difference, even if only for a small

proportion of all firms, can have a very substantial effect on aggregate

labor force participation rates.

     The jump in departure rates at 60, especially noticeable for persons

with 25 or more years of service, was mentioned just above. There is

another sharp increase in departure rates at 62 when Social Security

benefits are first available. The increase at 62 is also noticeable for

employees with less than ten years of service and not yet vested in the

firm's pension plan. They can take Social Security benefits, of course.

    Finally, there is a very sharp increase in the departure rate at age

65. For many workers the total reward for working after age 65 is close

to zero, due to negative pension and Social Security accruals. It is

important to keep in mind that the large departure rates before 65 mean

that most employees have left well before that age. Thus high annual

departure rates at 65 indicate only that a large proportion of the few

that continue work until 65 retire then. This point is highlighted in

table 10 below that presents the cumulative fraction remaining with the

firm from age 50 to each specified age.
                                   48

     Note first that departure rates of employees who have been in the

firm for only 8 to 10 years, and are not yet vested, are very low at

every age, as emphasized above. And again, the increase in the departure

rates at 55, 60, 62, and 65 stands out. Based on the 1981 and 1983

departure rates, only 48 percent of those employed at 50 would still be

employed at 60, and then 17 percent of these would leave. Only 10

percent would remain until age 65 and then about 50 percent of these

would leave.

     The data also show the effect of a special early retirement

incentive that was in effect in 1982 only. The incentive program

provided a bonus to employees who were eligible for early retirement in

1982; that is, those who were vested and were 55 years old or older. The

bonus was equivalent to three months salary for 55 year old employees and

increased to 12 months salary for 60 year olds. At age 65, the bonus was

12 months salary for employees with 20 or fewer years of service and

declined to 6 months salary for those with 30 to 39 years of service.

     It is clear that the effect of the incentive was large. The

departure rates for 1981 and for 1983 are virtually identical. But the

rates were much higher in 1982. For example, the departure rate for 60

year olds was 17 percent in 1981 and in 1983, but 32 percent in 1982.

For those age 63, the departure rate was 37 percent in 1981 and in 1983,

but 54 percent in 1982. Of those employed at age 50, 40 percent would

still have been employed after age 60 based on the 1981 and 1983

departure rates. Only 27 percent would remain after age 60 based on the

1982 rates.

     A great deal of effort has been devoted to estimating the effect of

Social Security provisions on labor force participation. In particular,

Hausman and Wise [1985], Burtless [1986], and Boskin and Hurd [1984] have

attempted to estimate the effect on labor force participation of the

increases in Social Security benefits during the early l970s. It would

appear from the results here that the effects of these across the board

increases in Social Security benefits are likely to be small relative to

the effects of the private pension provisions. For example, it seems

clear that shifting the age of early retirement in the firm plan from 55

to 60 would have a very dramatic effect on departure rates. Leaving the

early retirement age at 55, but eliminating negative pension and Social

Security accruals, thereafter, would apparently also have a substantial

effect on retirement rates.



VII. Summary and Conclusions

     Most defined benefit plans are strongly backloaded, notwithstanding

ERISA legislation aimed at limiting it. For a sizable fraction of

defined benefit plans, the special shape of pension accrual profiles

produce significant incentives to remain with one's current employer

prior to at least early retirement. After the age of normal retirement,

and, often, early retirement, pension accrual profiles typically provide

substantial incentives to leave employment. They impose a large implicit

tax on employment. These retirement incentives appear large when

compared, for example, with the retirement incentives arising under

Social Security. Hence, the structure of private pensions may be
                                    51

contributing substantially to the very high rates of early retirement

currently observed in the United States.

     Under the contract view of labor markets, pension accrual profiles

might be thought of as carrot and stick incentives to continue working

diligently to some age and to retire at a subsequent age. This presumes

that pension accrual profiles are well-understood by both employers and

workers. In our view this is unlikely. The great complexity of pension

provisions makes it quite difficult for either employers or workers, in.

the absence of assistance from actuaries, to calculate correctly their

accrued pension benefits. While a few firms, including the large FIRM

examined here, provide accrual information annually to their workers,

most, apparently, do not. It also appears that many firms with access to

actuaries do not have their actuaries calculate worker-specific accrual.

     It is important to understand the effects of pension plan provisions

on the labor force participation of older workers. But the contract view

of the labor market also makes it clear that evaluation of pension

accrual is best considered in conjunction with age-wage compensation

profiles. If, for example, legislation were to prevent the reduction in

the compensation of older workers through pension plan provisions, such

reduction might be sought through reduction of wage and salary earnings,

to conform to age-productivity profiles. In this case, what constitutes

age discrimination, and the potential effects of age discrimination

legislation, must also be considered. A partial view of the whole may

yield decisions with unforeseen and unintended consequences. Pension

plan provisions may provide a graceful way of making adjustments in a
                                   52

firm's labor force, and, in particular, in releasing older workers from

the labor force. On the other hand, the decision to continue work at

older ages is not, now, a neutral one. In the words of tax analysts, the

playing field is far from flat. Should individual preferences for work

versus retirement be constrained by the implicit wage tax structure of

pension plans?

     The backloading of pension accrual in the presence of limited worker

and employer understanding of such backloading raises a variety of

important questions. Do workers over- or under-value their accrued

vested pension benefits? Do workers over- or under-save because they

under- or over-value their pensions? Are workers who leave highly

backloaded firms prior to the age of early retirement, at which age

accrual is often very substantial, aware of the often substantial pension

costs of their actions? Is accrual backloading raising the economic

costs of early disability, because workers who become disabled prior to

the age of early retirement receive less generous pensions then those who

remain through early retirement? Should employers be required to provide

workers with annual statements detailing accrued vested benefits as well

as the time path of future projected pension accrual? These and related

questions may need to be asked by employers, workers, the United States

Congress.

1. The origins of the "bonding" model in which future compensation in

excess of productivity binds the worker's performance date from the work

of Becker and Stigler (1974) and Lazear (1979, 1981). More recently,

efficiency wage models of the labor market have appeared which also

stress the need to provide an extra incentive for enhanced worker

behavior (e.g., Stofft, 1984; Yellen, 1984; Stiglitz and Shapiro, 1984;

and Bulow and Summers, 1985). While several of these models ignore

dynamic aspects of the worker-employer relationship, the efficiency wage

literature as a whole seems to reinforce the view that deferred

compensation can be an important incentive mechanism.
