We study the geographic distribution of military supply contracts during World War II. This is a
unique case, since over $3 trillion current day dollars was spent, and there were concerns that the
country's future hinged on the war outcome. We find robust evidence consistent with the
hypothesis that economic factors dominated the allocation of supply contracts, and that political
factors---or at least winning the 1944 presidential election---were at best of secondary
importance. General industrial capacity in 1939, as well as specialized industrial capacity for
aircraft production, are strong predictors of contract spending across states. On the other hand,
electoral college pivot probabilities are at best weak predictors of contract spending, and under
the most plausible assumptions they are essentially unrelated to spending. This is true not only
for total contract spending over the entire period 1940-1944, but also for shorter periods leading
up to the election in November 1944, as well as for new facilities spending. That is, we find no
evidence of an electoral cycle in the distribution of funds.

1         Introduction
During the Second World War, the federal government assumed an unprecedented degree of
control over the U.S. economy. At the peak, the share of federal government expenditures
in GNP soared to 44 percent, a level never attained before or since. (Figure 1 shows the
level has not even exceeded 25 percent in the post-World War Two era.) In addition to
enrolling 16.4 million Americans—about one-eighth of the 1940 population—in the armed
forces, the federal government spent $196 billion between June 1940 and June 1945 on
military supply contracts and $31 billion on investments in new production facilities. In
2014 dollars, this is equivalent to roughly $3.1 trillion. Although this war effort (coined
the “Arsenal of Democracy” by President Roosevelt) probably represented the largest single
economic intervention by the federal government in U.S. history, the political economy of
these spending flows has been subject to relatively little systematic scholarly investigation.1

        This paper uses state-level economic and political data to investigate the relative im-
portance of political and economic factors in accounting for the geographic allocation of
World War II-era military spending, both for major war supply contracts and for new facil-
ity projects. More specifically, we study the allocation of supply contracts and new facilities
across all U.S. states during the period September 1940 thru October 1944. The temporal
pattern of contract spending in per capita terms is shown in Figure 2.2
        Following an extensive empirical and theoretical literature on distributive politics in the
    1
     U.S. munitions output played a crucial role in supplying Allied nations and in winning the war. William
Knudsen, a business executive who played an important role in war spending decisions, said “We won because
we smothered the enemy in an avalanche of production, the like of which he had never seen, nor dreamed
possible” (quote from Somers (1950), 8).

     This figure omits spending on new facilities, but this was only one seventh of total spending.

U.S., we focus on one of the incumbent party’s main goals—winning the next presidential
election (we also consider other political-based mechanisms in the robustness checks and in
the conclusion).3 To measure the electoral importance of each state we employ a model
similar to that in Strömberg (2008). Simulations based on this model yield estimates of
the relative probability that each state would be pivotal in the electoral college in the 1944
presidential election. The model incorporates four key elements: (i) How close the average
two-party vote in each state is to 50 percent; (ii) How variable the two-party vote is in each
state; (iii) How many electoral votes the state has per capita; and (iv) How correlated the
two-party vote shares are across states. We use pre-war voting patterns together with the
model to establish a distribution of 1944 election outcomes, and then simulate how frequently
some level of spending in a state will change both its and the overall electoral college winner
(the pivot probability for each state is the proportion of simulations in which spending
tips the outcome in the state and overall). One indication that this pivot probability is
superior to alternatives from the literature is that it is much more highly correlated with the

distribution of presidential campaign visits than other measures. Since candidates allocate
their scarce time just before the election to increase their chance of winning, these visits
provide a revealed-preference ranking of the relative electoral value of different states.
   To measure the economic importance of each state we use estimates of industrial capacity
at the beginning of the war. States such as Connecticut, Michigan, and New Jersey already
had large factories producing automobiles, trucks, airplanes, ships, steel, and so on. These
states also had a large stock of human capital ready to do work—many thousands of workers
with many years of experience in factory work. Converting this physical and human capital
to wartime production was generally much cheaper than building factories from scratch.
Perhaps even more importantly, conversion was typically the fastest way to get production
up and running, which was crucial for the war effort.
   Our findings are easily summarized. We find robust evidence consistent with the hy-
pothesis that economic factors strongly influenced the allocation of supply contracts, and
that political factors—or at least winning the 1944 presidential election—were at best of
secondary importance. General industrial capacity in 1939, as well as specialized industrial
capacity for aircraft production, are strong predictors of contract spending across states.
For example, pre-existing manufacturing capacity alone can explain over 60 percent of the
inter-state variation in contract spending over the course of the war. On the other hand,
electoral college pivot probabilities are at best weak predictors of contract spending, and un-
der the most plausible assumptions they are essentially unrelated to spending. (As discussed
below, a key free parameter is how responsive votes are to spending—we use values based
on estimates which relate voting preferences in Gallup polls to both World War II and New
Deal spending.) This is true not only for total spending over the entire period 1940-1944,
but also for shorter periods leading up to the election in November 1944. Thus, in addition
to finding no overall effect of pivot probabilities, we also find no evidence of an electoral
cycle in the distribution of funds.
   There is additional evidence of the limited scope of political targeting. We find no evi-
dence that spending on new military and industrial facilities was targeted towards politically
pivotal states. New facilities also constituted a much smaller share of federal war spending
than supply contracts. If political allocation was the driving factor, this share would be
higher since it was easier to place new facilities in any location (such as electorally valuable
areas) while supply contracts generally required using pre-existing manufacturing plants.



                                               4
With respect to congressional considerations, we find no significant relationship between
the distribution of spending and states’ representation on key military or appropriations
committees. Nor do we find evidence that war spending is directed to states with closely
contested senate or gubernatorial elections.
       Finally, utilizing early opinion polls from Gallup and the Office of Public Opinion Re-
search (OPOR), we investigate whether military spending in a state appears to have influ-
enced voter support for Roosevelt (OPOR surveys have not been previously analyzed in the
literature). The results show that the impact of spending on voter support was not large.
This might be one reason we find little evidence of targeting.
       A potential concern is that the 1944 presidential election was a foregone conclusion, and
so there was little need for politically-motivated allocation of war funds. However, there was
significant uncertainty about the outcome. Based on contemporaneous prediction market
odds (Rhode and Strumpf (2004)), even in the weeks before the election there was a 25%
chance that Dewey would win the presidency. Roosevelt’s voter approval numbers (in the
Gallup Polls) also dropped steadily by ten percentage points over 1943, and the substantial
Republican victories in 1942 (when they gained 46 House seats and 9 Senate seats) were
viewed as a lack of confidence in the president. Nor were wartime leaders ensured of re-
election, as Churchill’s loss in 1945, just two months after VE Day, illustrates. This should
have provided plenty of incentive to allocate war funds for political gains. Moreover the
prediction market odds were comparable to those from 1936, when there was evidence of
Roosevelt allocating New Deal spending at least in part to increase his electoral chances
(Wright (1974)).
       It is possible, of course, that pragmatic concerns related to winning the war dominated
narrow distributional concerns because of the enormous stakes involved.4 As Churchill fa-
mously argued as the Battle of Britain began, “Upon this battle depends the survival of
Christian civilization... If we fail, then the whole world, including the United States, in-
cluding all that we have known and cared for, will sink into the abyss of a new Dark Age.”
It might not be surprising, therefore, to find the U.S. government acting as if it placed an
extremely high value on social welfare—the “public good” of defeating Germany and Japan.
   4
     There are other ways in which war-time spending might be different. Specially created agencies played
a central role in military procurement policies, and the leaders of these organizations were typically civilian
business executives rather than politicians. Private production also fell sharply, as some war spending was a
reallocation from civilian to military manufacturing. And finally voters might be less responsive to spending
during a war as they are focused on other issues and the economy is approaching full employment.


                                                      5
       This same focus on winning the war could also have an electoral benefit. A number
of political economy models incorporate both public goods and distributive goods.5 One
(unsurprising) result in these papers is that elected officials will provide public goods rather
than distributive goods if the public goods are valued enough by voters relative to the
distributive goods. In these circumstances, it is difficult to distinguish a concern for social
welfare from a concern for votes.6
       We find mixed evidence for this hypothesis. On one hand, in OPOR surveys, as the war
proceeded respondents became more confident that the war would end more quickly if the
Democrats remained in power than if the Republicans held power. This suggests that the
war effort increased voter support for Roosevelt. On the other hand, in Gallup and OPOR
polls, voters reported that they would be more willing to support Republicans in 1944 if the
war was over before the election. This suggests that electoral considerations favored a “slow
but steady” approach to the war effort.
       At a minimum, our evidence suggests that models which focus exclusively on “tactical”
distributional politics—e.g., Lindbeck and Weibull (1987), Dixit and Londregan (1995, 1996),
McCarty (2000), Strömberg (2008), Primo and Snyder (2008)—might do poorly at predicting
government behavior during times of national crisis.
       In some ways our results might be expected, but in other ways they are surprising. Given
the threat to western democracies, one would expect that war monies would be allocated as
efficiently as possible. On the other hand, political influence might not noticeably dimin-
ish the chance of winning the war but rather delay it. Inefficient spending (e.g., building
new facilities in a politically valuable location rather than using pre-existing manufacturing
capacity) does not imply that materiels are not made, just that it will take longer. We
know various offensives were postponed until adequate munitions were made, most famously
the D-Day invasion which was delayed until adequate landing ships could be manufactured.
Given the possible trade-off– political gains against the costs of a delayed victory in the war–
and the vast sums of monies involved, one might expect that politics would influence the
allocation of war spending at least on the margin.
       More broadly this paper contributes to the empirical distributive politics literature, which
is discussed in the next section and is decidedly mixed about whether monies are allocated

   6
     See also Becker (1983), which predicts that under “pluralism,” in which a large number of interest groups
compete for influence, we should also expect relatively efficient outcomes.

with the goal of influencing future elections. The paper advances the literature by overcoming
two important empirical challenges. Typically one must model and control for pre-existing
spending. This is not a significant concern here since military spending was quite small
in the 1930s. It is also often hard to measure efficiency, but here pre-war private sector
manufacturing capacity is a natural candidate since it was easy to re-purpose for military
production. And while we make some methodological advancements in terms of how to
evaluate the political value of different states, the small role for electoral concerns in World
War Two munitions spending is of independent interest. It is perhaps surprising given that
New Deal spending, which Roosevelt also oversaw, had a political element in its geographic
allocation, and the vast size of war spending left ample room for political targeting. In the
conclusion we discuss some possible reasons for our findings.


2     Previous Research on Distributive Politics
In a series of influential papers, Lindbeck and Weibull (1987), Dixit and Londregan (1995,
1996), and others develop models where electoral competition drives political parties to
target divisible resources towards groups or regions with relatively large numbers of “swing”
voters. Colantoni, Levesque and Ordeshook (1975), Snyder (1989), Strömberg (2008), and
others develop related models in the context of allocating campaign resources.
    The evidence on the allocation of campaign resources tends to strongly support the swing
voter models. In particular, a number of papers find that battleground states—i.e., those
with an expected Democratic vote share near 50 percent—receive a disproportionate share of
the advertising in U.S. presidential campaigns (Colantoni, Levesque and Ordeshook (1975);
Nagler and Leighley (1992); Shaw (2006); Strömberg (2008), Huang and Shaw (2009)).
Strömberg (2008) is especially important for us. He develops a model that incorporates not
only the expected vote, but also the volatility of each state’s vote, as well as the number of
votes each state has in the electoral college, in order to predict how likely each state is to
be pivotal in the presidential election. He finds a strong relationship between the predicted
pivot probabilities and the allocation of campaign expenditures in 2000 and campaign visits
in 2000 and 2004. We follow his approach closely below.
    The evidence on government expenditures is more mixed. Some studies of New Deal
spending, federal grants, and federal employment find that states with presidential vote
shares nearer to one-half, or more volatile presidential vote swings, or states that are more


                                               7
“productive” in terms of electoral votes, receive more federal aid—e.g., Wright (1974); Wallis
(1987, 1991, 1996, 1998); Fleck (1999).7 Studies of spending in more recent time periods,
however, such as Larcinese, Rizzo and Testa (2006) and Larcinese, Snyder and Testa (2013),
find no evidence that states receive more federal funds if they have closer presidential races,
more frequent presidential partisan swings, or a larger percentage of self-identified indepen-
dent or moderate voters.8
       The only previous studies of World War II spending, Rhode (2000) and Bateman and
Taylor (2003), also fail to find support for the swing-voter or swing-state hypotheses. Rhode
(2000) is the first paper to analyze the determinants of World War II spending. Rhode is
most interested in the case of California so his analysis of spending across states is limited.
He does, however, consider both political and economic factors, as we do below. Bateman
and Taylor (2003) conduct a similar analysis, and largely replicate Rhode’s results. We build
on these papers in several ways. First—and this is our main contribution—we use a more
rigorous and theoretically grounded measure of each state’s relative influence in the electoral
college. Second, we analyze the timing of spending in addition to overall levels, to check for
electoral cycle effects. Finally, we go beyond the aggregate data and examine individual-level
survey data on (i) the degree to which voting decisions in the 1930s and 1940s appear to
be influenced by the distribution of federal spending, and (ii) the degree to which voting
decisions during World War II appear to be influenced by U.S. efforts to win the war.
   7
      While most papers on the New Deal Deal find some role for politics, there is some debate on its magnitude
and the role of other factors. Strömberg (2004) shows that the statistical significance of these estimates
vanish when state fixed effects are included, suggesting that the results might be spurious and the result of
omitted-variable bias. Wallis (1998) finds that the results depend on the specification used and the set of
states included. Fishback, Kantor and Wallis (2003) study New Deal spending at the county level and find
mixed evidence for pivotal politics—for some programs the distribution of spending appears to be related to
electoral volatility or turnout at the county level, while for other programs it is not.
    8
      The literature on distributive politics is vast, and includes several other branches. A number of papers
study the distribution of spending across districts or counties, rather than states—e.g., Stein and Bickers
(1994), Berry, Burden and Howell (2010), and Dynes and Huber (2015). Other studies consider the hy-
pothesis that government expenditures flow disproportionately to areas with more “core” or “loyal” party
voters—Levitt and Snyder (1995), Larcinese, Snyder and Testa (2013), and Dynes and Huber (2015). Other
researchers focus on institutional factors such as committee structure, the distribution of party and committee
leadership positions, legislative seniority, majority party membership, malapportionment, and universalism
norms—e.g., Anderson and Tollison (1991) and Berry and Fowler (2016). Most relevant for us because of
its historical nature, Anderson and Tollison (1991) find that New Deal spending was significantly higher
for states with representation on the Senate Appropriations Committee, but they find mixed results for the
House Appropriations Committee, and no significant relationships with either House or Senate seniority.
Finally, there are many studies of distributive politics in countries other than the U.S..

3     Background on World War II Spending
The military procurement system used in the Second World War provided ample opportunity
for political gains or economic efficiency. During this period, the federal government assumed
an unprecedented degree of control over the U.S. economy. Various government bureaus–
newly created during the war and run by leading civilian business executives– set the level,
type and allocation of this spending. While efficiency was supposed to guide these bureaus,
political pressure was explicitly and implicitly applied to shape their decisions and production
speed was prioritized over competitive bidding. The push to get local spending stemmed
in part from the desirable employment it created, with a significant pay premium for war-
related jobs. Nonetheless an astonishing level of armaments were manufactured, but at the
same time there were also glaring examples of inefficiencies which could be consistent with
political meddling. The remainder of this section details these points.
    The federal government spent $196 billion between June 1940 and June 1945 on military
supply contracts and $31 billion on investments in new facilities. Relative to the 1940 total
population, per capita spending over this five-year period averaged $1,813 in current dollars
or almost $24,800 in 2014 purchasing power. In real annual per capita terms, domestic
procurement spending during World War II was about four-and-one-half times higher than
the New Deal era spending which has attracted so much scholarly attention.
    In the interwar period, the U.S. government spent only 1-2 percent of GDP on the
military. Most money for supplies and arms was allocated according to rigidly specified
competitive procedures. Procurement officers would advertise for clearly defined quantities
and qualities for a specific item, invited bids, and award the contract to the lowest quali-
fied bidder. The federal government also imposed profit limits on aircraft and shipbuilding
contracts under the 1934 Vinson-Trammel and 1936 Merchant Marine Acts. The tiny size
of the military prior to the war helps alleviate concerns that the distribution of pre-existing
manufacturing capacity—at least that most suitable for military production—might be en-
dogenous.
    These operating principles changed following the outbreak of full-scale war in September
1939. Recalling Figure 1, defense spending rose steadily to over 40 percent of GDP in 1945
(real spending in 1945 was 34 times larger than in 1940). Table 1 offers a condensed timeline
of the evolution of government agencies in charge of procurement and industrial mobilization
over the 1939-45 period. The expediting acts of June 28 and July 2, 1940 allowed negotiated,


                                               9
cost-plus-a-fixed-fee contracts and payment before delivery; while procurement authorities
continued to use competitive bidding for small contracts, the vast majority of procurement
contracts shifted to a negotiated basis. The new contracts allowed greater production speed,
since it avoided the need to develop engineering plans prior to the bid as would be needed
under traditional process, though imposed little incentive for firms to reduce costs. In
October 1940, the federal government also eliminated profit ceilings on defense contracts,
using excess-profit taxes in their place. The contracts typically tied spending to specific
locations: they listed specific items made at specific plants.
       A series of civilian-run bureaucracies were created to facilitate the war production effort.
These agencies were created within the executive branch, and their top officials were selected
by and reported directly to the president. They were given broad powers and discretion to
decide war production and procurement, including converting civilian manufacturing plants
to military production and in directing new infrastructure building.9 In May 1940, Roo-
sevelt used his war powers to establish Advisory Commission of the Council for National
Defense (NDAC). The NDAC begat the Office of Production Management (OPM) which
begat the War Production Board (WPB) which begat the Civilian Production Administra-
tion (CPA). An additional layer of bureaucracy, first the Supply Priorities and Allocations
Board (SPAB) and later the Office of War Mobilization (OWM), was imposed on top of
these agencies. Although the agency names changed, the leading actors did not. These
included William S. Knudson, president of General Motors, Donald M. Nelson, an executive
at Sears-Roebuck, and Sidney Hillman, a former union chief. Other principals were Henry
Stimson and Frank Knox, two Republicans that Roosevelt had appointed Secretaries of War
and Navy, respectively, in the summer of 1940.
       The commissions were specifically tasked with trying to produce efficiently. In particular
they were instructed to locate new facilities in areas where there were adequate nearby
resources, but not so dense as to lead to congestion.10 They also were supposed to ensure
   9
     As an example of the former a fifth of all U.S. munitions (including most B-24 bombers, aircraft engines,
tanks, and trucks) was made in automobile plants, with non-military car production shutdown in 1942.
Foreshadowing results later in the paper, this production was widely dispersed (the automobile industry was
spread over 44 states and 1375 cities).
   The agencies also had other powers. They centralized control of raw materials, and they also influenced
the level of production. For example, in 1942 the commissions convinced military leaders to reduce their
munitions demand from a level which would damage the country’s long-term manufacturing capacity.
  10
     The OPM, which set plant locations early in the war, was to use as guiding principles, “Such factors as
availability of labor, transportation facilities, housing, waterpower, community services and attitude, sources
of raw materials and destination of the finished products, and the general relation of the new plants to the

that specialized labor was available in the case of complicated and precise manufacturing.11
    Nonetheless, there is an extensive record of political meddling in the process.12 Most
histories of the agencies and officials involved in contracting note that the spending process,
especially plant location decisions, induced a torrent of lobbying from politicians and business
and community leaders. For example, Nelson, who headed the OPM plant location efforts
in 1941, observed: “We were operating in a democracy which was still at peace and subject
to the pressures of politics. Platoons of Senators and Representatives stimulated by their
constituents, descended upon us. Hundreds of briefs were submitted by towns all over the
United States, and, since we were thinking about defense only, I suppose that our selection
of sites pleased nobody.”
    Placement authorities responded to such complaints by creating Plant or Site Location
boards. This counter-move of addressing the problem by adding more bureaucracy is clear
in the case of the Maritime Commission. Criticism of its site selection process received a full
airing in the hearings of the Truman Committee on June 3 and July 9, 1941. (Lane (1947),
152-54.) Within a few weeks, the Commission established the Shipyard Site Planning Com-
mittee to “determine the suitability of projects from the standpoint of geographical position,
availability of labor, power, and transportation, and the financial and technical experience
of the applicants...” The OPM responded even earlier. In early 1941 “a movement arose in
Congress to establish by legislative action a Plant Site Board to pass upon the location of
over-all distribution of manufacturing facilities in the country were carefully examined. The board was
anxious to avoid, if possible, the building of plants in already highly industrialized and congested areas”
(U.S. Civilian Production Administration, Bureau of Demobilization (1945), 56). “The Plant Site Board
did endeavor to locate new facilities away from highly industrialized areas. In part the location of new
facilities was determined by strategic reasons... According to Nelson, supply contracts followed the location
of industry; but new facilities were planned to follow at least partial decentralization” (58).
   The OPM’s Plant Site Board “was aware on the undesirability of further concentrating aircraft facilities
in southern California, of expanding plant facilities in the Detroit area, of enlarging shipbuilding plants
around Camden, New Jersey, and of locating more plants at Bendix, Philadelphia, Rochester, and other
highly industrialized centers” (60-61). It acted primarily as a “negative planning unit” which frequently
initially vetoed proposed sites and urged the procurement officials to look in less congested areas. “In view
of the urgency for speeding up production, however, the Plant Site Board was reluctant to exercise this
(veto) power for fear of impeding the defense effort” (59-61). The Plant Site Board and other civilian
authorities generally allowed the military procurement officers to contract where they pleased, and in turn,
the procurement authorities allowed their manufacturing suppliers to produce and invest where they saw fit.
  11
     The OPM’s Plant Site Board had a policy called for preserving “the area north of the Mason-Dixon line
and east of the Mississippi River for defense manufacturing requiring highly skilled labor, such as aircraft
engines, and indicating that approval for other types of facilities in this area would, in general, be given only
in exceptional circumstances.”
  12
     It is unclear if having executives from manufacturing and retail firms created a self-dealing problem with
the various agencies.



                                                       12
plant sites for Government defense facilities in order to bring about a greater decentraliza-
tion of industry (U.S. Civilian Production Administration, Bureau of Demobilization (1945),
40).” Noting the “disadvantages of Congress rigidly fixing standards,” Knudsen suggested
the OPM take preemptive action. On 17 March, the Office established a Plant Site Commit-
tee “to review and approve or disapprove proposed locations for additional plant or facilities
required for the national defense.” The Committee, which was converted into a more per-
manent Board on May 6, 1941, was to work in close cooperation with representatives of the
Ordnance Department, the Army Air Corps, and the Navy Department (pages 40-42).
   Politics or peacetime objectives played crucial roles in some decisions. In 1938, the U.S.
Maritime Commission received congressional permission to grant contracts to shipyards in
the South and West despite their higher cost structures (Lane (1947), 102-104). Although
the performance of southern shipbuilders remained below eastern levels in the early 1940s,
the Commission followed the administration’s wishes by granting some wartime contracts to
southern yards. Costs and productivity on the West Coast did reach parity with the east by
the early 1940s, leading to the placement of a large share of contracts there during the war.
But the pre-war West possessed no modern integrated steel plants and hence no capacity to
produce ship plates locally. In response, Roosevelt had the federal government help finance
two new steel plants (at Geneva, UT and Fontana, CA).
   In addition, there were numerous accusations of influence peddling, kickbacks, and con-
flicts of interest regarding defense spending. Notable contracting scandals involved Thomas
Corcoran, a New Deal political operative, General Bennett Meyers of the Army Air Crop,
Representative Andrew May of Kentucky, chair of the House Committee on Military Affairs,
and Senator Theodore Bilbo of Mississippi.
   As these points suggest, voters valued local war spending. This might be surprising,
since as the war commenced jobs were plentiful and there were also private-sector industry
jobs. War-related employment was truly a premium job. Between 1939 and 1943, it paid
between 30-40% more per hour and 40-60% more in total annual compensation than non-
war industries. It was also superior to all manufacturing jobs, paying 15% more per hour
and 20% more in annual compensation of the same period (U.S. Department of Commerce,
Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce (1943)). And as we discussed earlier, voters
urged their Congressmen to try to get spending in their towns. There was active lobbying
to influence the geographic allocation of war spending, which would only happen if spending



                                             13
was perceived as benefiting the area where it is located.
    With this as a backdrop, how did production proceed? The goal of serving as the Arsenal
of Democracy was met, with a vast output of every kind of munition. Over the course of the
war, 300,000 military airplanes (including 100,000 each of bombers and fighters) were made,
7,000 large ships and 65,000 landing ships were built, 88,000 tanks were produced (over three
times what Germany made), 2.5m trucks, and tens of millions of guns. Production costs also
fell and speed increased over the course of the war (that is, there were learning economies
or economies of scale in production). In their first two years of production, the time to
build Liberty cargo ships fell by three-fifths and destroyers shrunk by three-fourths. The
cost of building fighter planes (dollars per pound) fell by a quarter over the course of the
war, and bombers costs fell by two-thirds. One reason for this was the emphasis on using
pre-existing manufacturing capacity (rather than building new facilities), since this took less
time, leveraged the local specialized labor force, and avoided new construction costs.
    At the same time there were many glaring examples of inefficiencies. For example, there
were regional bottlenecks in production due to manpower shortages. While the War Man-
power Commission was specifically tasked to aid in worker allocation, in 1943 there were
extreme shortage of workers on the Pacific Coast which had large boat and aviation pro-
duction plants and at the same time there was a surplus of farm workers or those in higher
paying but non-essential industries; it took over a year for the commission to ameliorate this
and reduce production delays. One reason for the delay was the political influence of the
farm bloc—agricultural workers were deferred from the draft over much of the war, so many
workers moved to or stayed on farms to maintain their deferral status. Similarly, each year
during the war there were thousands of labor strikes resulting in millions of lost man-days.


4     Data and Summary Statistics
The analysis employs data collected from a variety of primary and secondary sources. The
state-level monthly (approx.) military spending variables—contract and facilities spending—
are from various economic reports published by the National Industrial Conference Board,
hearings of the U.S. House Select Committee Investigating National Defense Migration, and
the U.S. War Production Board, Statistics of War Production. The Data Appendix, Sec-
tion 10.1 lists the specific sources and provides details on how the variables are constructed.
    For economic efficiency we consider pre-war capacity measures. The manufacturing em-

ployment variables, including the number of wage-earners in total, in aircraft (SIC 372) and
shipbuilding (SIC 373) in 1939 are from U.S. Bureau of the Census, Census of Manufactures:
1947, Vo. 3, Area Statistics (Washington, DC: GPO, 1950). The state-level data on elec-
tions for U.S. president, U.S. senator, and state governor are from ICPSR study number 2
(Candidate Name and Constituency Totals, 1788-1990).
    Table 2 presents key summary statistics—mean, median, standard deviation—used in
the state-level survey analyses below. One important point is that the dependent variables
of interest are not massively skewed. Table 3 presents summary statistics for the variables
used in the individual-level analyses. The next section discusses these variables, and how
they are used, in more detail.

5     Spending and Votes: Gallup
The next two sections frame our analysis for how political motivation (vote-seeking) would
shape the geographic distribution of World War II spending. We focus on state-level allo-
cation decisions and their connection to the presidential election. This section provides an
empirical estimate of one of the key factors in this decision, how such spending would alter
voting. The following section develops a formal framework for identifying which states would

  These tables will help in interpreting the regressions of votes on spending (discussed
  in Section 4). Spending panel: these are statistics based on matching spending to
  Gallup Poll respondents, so larger states will receive more weight. The bottom rows
  present values conditional on the availability of the listed voting variable. Voting
  panel: V = 1 means intend to vote/approve Roosevelt (FDR), V = 0 means intend to
  vote against/not approve FDR (there are also respondents who have no preference).
  4V (2-point scale) and 4V (4-point scale) are defined in Note 14, and they reflect how
  intentions/approval of FDR differ relative to how the poll respondent voted in 1940
  (the more positive the values, the more the voter is changing their vote in favor of
  FDR). The Data Appendix lists the specific Polls which are used.

provide the greatest political return from spending. This in turn is based on how “pivotal”
each state is: how likely the spending will change the state presidential election outcome and
whether that change will alter the electoral college winner.

5.1    Background
A central issue for the pivot probability calculation discussed in the next section is the
responsiveness of votes to spending. The more elastic are votes, the more attractive it will
be to allocate funds for political gain. We will consider specifications of the form

                                       Vist = βSst + ist                                   (1)

where i is an individual voter living in state s at time t, V is a measure of voting, and S is a
measure of spending (we will also consider various additional controls discussed below). We
are primarily interested in the estimated parameter β.
   Estimating this effect is challenging for several reasons. First a suitable measure of voting
with geographic granularity is needed. Second we need to deal with the potential endogene-
ity of the observed spending allocation, namely that it might be targeted to areas which
have voters of certain characteristics or at times when voters are especially responsive. For
example, if spending is targeted to areas which have more responsive voters, then regressing
votes on spending will yield estimates which overstate the average responsiveness of votes.
Finally, what actually matters for the allocation decision is politicians’ expectations of the
responsiveness, which might differ from the actual ex post measure.
   We can deal with each of these issues to some degree. For the voting data we use
Gallup Polls archived at the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research (see Data Appendix,
Section 10.2 for full list of studies, sample sizes, and field survey dates). Gallup was among
the first to conduct scientific polling of representative samples of likely voters, who were
asked about vote intentions, vote preferences, retrospective voting, demographics, state of
residence and other questions such as opinions about the war. The first Gallup poll available
at Roper is from 1936, and new polls of roughly 3,000 respondents were conducted roughly
every two weeks (though the same questions are not asked in all polls, and in particular
vote questions are often omitted). Gallup data is non-panel, with new respondents in each
wave. This means we cannot use actual voting and at the same time exploit the rich time
variation in spending discussed earlier. Instead we use various measures of vote intentions
or candidate approval and see how these are influenced by contemporaneous spending. To

                                              17
do this we match the Gallup polls to various spending programs at the state-date level
(1941–1944 for war spending, and earlier polls for other spending discussed below).
       The second issue of spending endogeneity is more difficult. Contracts might be allocated
based on some characteristic, such as demographic information or local economic conditions
like unemployment which in turn are related to how people vote, or at times when individuals
are deciding how they will vote, say right before the election. That is, spending is not random
but may be targeted to places or times when it is most effective at changing votes. We can
partly address this by taking differences and including state fixed effects, both of which
will account for time invariant heterogeneity, as well as including time fixed effects, which
accounts for temporal targeting in spending. This leads to the following alternative to (1):

                                    ∆Vist = β∆Sst + νs + ωt + 0ist                                     (2)

Here ∆Vist ≡ Vist −Vis0 where the latter term represents the actual vote in the last presidential
election (recall the vote data is from a non-panel source so vote preference is unobserved,
but Gallup does ask about retrospective voting), ∆Sst is the level of spending in the state
in period t (non-differenced spending is the cumulative spending), and νs and ωt are fixed
effects. This specification exploits the fact that we have many different Gallup polls at
different times. Thus, for example, we can compare voters who live in the same state, one
who is interviewed before a large inflow of spending in the state and one who is interviewed
after the spending has occurred.
       There remains the possibility that voter responsiveness to spending varies over time, and
that politicians understand this and target spending to the most responsive periods-locations.
This would require that politicians have a large amount of fine-grained information. But if
true, our difference-in-differences specification will likely overstate the effectiveness of spend-
ing. We therefore view our estimates as an upper-bound of the true effect.13
       On the final issue, while it is not possible to literally measure politician expectations
we instead consider multiple spending programs. In addition to the World War II military
spending, we also consider New Deal spending. New Deal spending is helpful since it is also
quite large, sustained over several years, and occurs shortly before the War and so politicians
are likely familiar with its magnitude and its resulting impact on voting patterns (here we
  13
    Spending could also be allocated for other political goals. For example, it could be targeted to areas
with loyal voters, and this would have an ambiguous bias (while loyal voters are less likely to change their
votes, the money could induce turnout and this approach would motivate relatively few loyalists of the other
party).

                                                    18
use polls over the period 1936-40). The New Deal spending data is from Price Fishback.

5.2       Estimates
In this section we present estimates of the main specification (2). Most of the results focus on
World War II contract spending over the period 1941-1944, and consider its relation to the
evolution of voter preferences for the 1944 presidential election between Roosevelt (FDR)
and Dewey. Table 3 contains the summary statistics from the Gallup file as well as the
associated spending variables.
       Table 4 presents the main estimates of Equation (2) which focuses on WWII contract
spending per capita. We use the voter’s stated vote in the 1940 presidential election for
Vis0 , and we consider two versions of the differenced vote variable.14 Gallup asks different
vote-type questions and so there are two separate sets of results, one based on voter approval
of FDR (available in 1941-1943) and a second based on a voter’s intended vote in the 1944
election (available in 1942-1944). In the top panel which presents results for voter approval,
the first two columns focus on cumulative spending. A one thousand dollar per capita
increase in cumulative contract spending (equivalent to over $100 billion in spending and a
bit more than either the mean or standard deviation over the entire war for this variable)
leads to a 0.08 shift in votes to the Democrats on the two point scale (which omits previous
non-voters and ranges from -1 to 1) and 0.15 on the 4-point scale (which ranges from -2 to
2). Under a simple model of preference distribution this would correspond to a 4 percentage
point increase in FDR’s percent vote in a state, a non-trivial amount but relatively modest
considering the magnitude of funds involved (and again recall this is an upper bound effect,
and the second value is not statistically significant).15 The estimates in the next two columns
  14
     The two vote difference variables treat non-voters in the previous period differently. In the two-point
scale, we omit previous non-voters and ∆Vist ∈ {−1, 0, +1} with -1 indicating a previous Democrat voter who
now votes Republican, +1 a previous Republican voter who now votes Democrat, and 0 someone who does not
change their vote. In the four-point scale we include the previous non-voters, and ∆Vist ∈ {−2, −1, 0, +1, +2}
where -2 is a previous Democrat voter who now votes Republican, -1 is a previous non-voter who now votes
Republican, 0 is a voter who does the same as in the last elections, etc.
  15
     Consider first the 2-point scale which ignores non-voters. Suppose voters have ideal points, x, which are
uniformly distributed along the unit interval, and that they vote for the Democrats if x < X where X is a
cut-point that accounts for non-policy valence (X = 0.5 if the candidates are equally attractive for non-policy
reasons). The estimates suggest that spending shifts each ideal point to the left by 0.04 after taking into
the scaling of the dependent variable, and will change aggregate FDR vote by the same amount. With the
4-point scale, suppose that individuals only vote if they have strong preference between the candidates so
voters with X1 < x < X2 abstain where the Xi are the cut point for voting for the Democrat or Republican.
The same reasoning for the 2-point scale and recalling the larger scale here implies that spending again will
increase FDR’s vote share by 0.04.


                                                      19
show that a $250 per capita increase in annual contract spending (again about $100 billion
over the all years, and twice the mean or standard deviation) leads to a shift in voters to
the Democrats that is only about half as large.
   The bottom panel of Table 4 repeats this using vote intentions as the dependent variable.
Here there are no positive and significant results, and some of the values are even negative.
In all cases the economic effects are much smaller, suggesting a very limited voter response
to war spending.

       As a robustness check we considered various modifications of these specifications as well
as all two-way permutations of these modifications, and in all cases we continue to find
small economic effects (these estimates are omitted). These include looking at spending in
level rather than per capita terms, using new facilities spending, using non-differenced voting
rather than netting our previous vote patterns (and estimate using either a linear probability
model or a logit), omitting various combinations of fixed effects, including both cumulative
and annual spending to allow for diminishing returns (voters respond primarily to the first
increment of spending), and interacting spending with individual-level demographics such
as age, race, religion, parent’s country of origin, urban location, occupation, education, and
phone- or car-ownership (wealth proxies). The latter is especially important since it is a
more direct control for geographic-targeting of funds based on local characteristics.
       Table 5 examines New Deal spending over 1936-1940, which might reflect information
politicians had when they started allocating the war spending monies. We repeat the speci-
fications and approach from the previous table. We use the voter’s stated vote in the 1936
presidential election for Vis0 , except the very first poll which occurs before that election and
so the vote in 1932 is used there. Except in one case the parameters are not statistically
different from zero, though the standard errors are modest as the sample size is relatively
large. We begin again with voter approval (unlike with the war polls, the voting variables
are evenly spread across the sample period). Using the point estimates and the same model
from the last paragraph, a two hundred and fifty dollar increase in annual spending per
capita increases FDR’s vote share by three and a half to five and a half percent. This is
quite close to the values from war spending. Cumulative spending per capita has a negative
association, with a thousand dollar increase associated with about a one to four percent
reduction in FDR votes. If instead vote intentions are used, the estimates in the final four
columns indicate the effect on FDR votes is about twice as large for annual spending and
about the same (negative) effect for cumulative spending. Echoing the earlier results, there
is little evidence that spending yields large positive shifts in voting, and again the estimates
here are likely upper bound effects.16
       Overall, there is little support from either the World War II spending or New Deal
spending that votes are highly responsive to government resource allocations. For example,
  16
    These results are consistent with previous research that finds mixed evidence regarding the impact of
New Deal spending on local economic conditions. See, e.g., Fishback, Horrace and Kantor (2005), Fishback
(2017).

the top panel of Table 4 suggests that if all of the war spending arrived in one burst, then
the effect on FDR’s approval would only be about half as large as the “rally around the
flag” increase which followed the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor (see Figure 9 below). It
suggests that politically strategic allocation of war monies is unlikely to be successful at
shaping electoral outcomes. Still, this is just one input in the allocation calculus, and we
return to the importance of politics in the allocation process in the next section.


6        Pivotal States in the Electoral College
We now turn to a formal model of election-motivated spending allocation decisions. We focus
on how to distribute spending across states with the goal of maximizing the probability of
winning the presidential election. This in turn is equivalent to determining which states have
the highest return: spending there has the greatest chance of swinging the overall election
winner. We will use the estimates from the previous section regarding the impact of spending
on vote outcomes to help choose a key parameter.

6.1        Calculating Pivot Probabilities
Our procedure for estimating the political value, or “pivot probability” of each state in the
1944 presidential election, is similar in spirit to that in Strömberg (2008). The goal is to
answer the following question: For each state i, how likely is it that a marginal change
in supply contract spending state i (either up or down) would change the electoral college
outcome? Note that we focus on the incumbent party’s allocation decision. This is because
it is not clear what assumptions to make regarding voters’ beliefs about what the challenging
Republican party would do in power. The Republicans had not held power nationally for
more than a decade, and had no previous record governing during a crisis similar to WWII
since the Civil War.
       First, for each state we calculate the Democratic share of the two party vote in all elections
for U.S. president, U.S. senator, and state governor that took place between 1932 and 1943.17
Denote this by Dijt , where i indexes states, j indexes offices, and t indexes years. Next we
  17
    We drop cases in which a third party candidate received more than 15% of the total vote. We also drop
cases where the Democratic share of the total vote was less than 5% or greater than 95%. We also ran the
analysis dropping the elections held in 1942 and 1943, and the results are quite similar to those presented
below.




                                                    23
estimate the following model, using OLS:

                                          Dijt = αi + θt + ijt                                          (3)

where αi denotes a vector of state-specific fixed-effects and θt denotes a vector of year-specific
fixed-effects (national shocks). This yields the “normal Democratic vote” in state i (α̂i ), and
the “idiosyncratic electoral variability” in state i (standard deviation of the residuals ˆijt for
state i). Call these Dimean and Disd , respectively. Also, let Ei be the number of votes state i
has in the electoral college, and let Pi be state i’s population.
       The next step is to calculate how spending would change vote outcomes, and in turn
whether these changes would alter the election outcome compared to the no spending case.
We must make an assumption about two parameters. The first is the expected national
electoral shock or “national tide” in the 1944, which we denote DN (positive values being in
favor of Democrats and negative values being against).18
       The second is the effect of military spending on the share of votes won by the Democrats
in 1944. As noted above, the standard deviation of contract spending per capita was about
$1,000, and the average was also about $1,000. The average state population was about
2.7 million. So, we consider changing a state’s total contract spending by $2.7 billion. How
does that translate into votes? This depends on voter behavior—how sensitive voters are
to spending in their state when deciding how to vote—which we denote V m (In order to
avoid parameter values with many decimals, we measure contract spending in thousands of
dollars).19
       For each choice of these parameters—discussed shortly—we simulate 1 million elections,
as follows (steps (i) through (iv) summarize a single election iteration):

 (i) Draw an idiosyncratic shock ηi for each state i from a distribution that is N (0, (Disd )2 ).

 (ii) Let Vi = Dimean + DN + ηi be the Democratic vote share in each state i.

 (iii) Calculate the electoral college winner given the vector of Vi ’s (there were 531 members
  18
     This is akin to the fixed effect θt from the estimates of (3), but those values cannot be used because
they are for earlier periods.
  19
     Note that V M takes on two roles: it measures both vote sensitivity to money and the amount of spending.
That is, doubling its value could mean the amount of spending doubles and vote sensitivity stays constant.
For our purposes focusing on vote sensitivity is reasonable since we have calibrated the spending level to
match the actual amount during the war.

 (iv) In the case of a Republican Win, loop through the set of states with Vi < .5 (the
         states won by Republicans) one state at time, and add V m × (2700000/Pi ) to Vi while
         holding all other states’ voting outcomes fixed. If doing this changes the electoral
         college outcome to a Democratic win, then call state i Pivotal .20

         In the case of a Democratic Win, loop through the set of states with Vi > .5 (the
         states won by Democrats) one state at time, and subtract V m × (2700000/Pi ) from Vi
         while holding all other states’ voting outcomes fixed. If doing this changes the electoral
         college outcome to a Republican win, then call state i Pivotal .

 (v) Let Pivot Probability i be the fraction of times that state i is Pivotal out of the 1 million
         simulated elections.

       Choosing a range of values for the national tide, DN , is relatively straightforward. The
median presidential vote swing over the period 1920-1944 was about 3%, and historically
swings larger than 5% are relatively rare. To keep things simple we consider three values,
DN ∈ {−.03, 0, .03}.
       Choosing a range of values for V m is trickier. It should represent the impact of the
overall size of War spending on the Democratic vote share. Our best benchmarks are from
the World War Two and New Deal spending estimates in Section 5. Recall that we consider
two versions of spending (cumulative and per year) as well as four versions of vote change
(omitting and including previous non-voters, and vote intention versus vote approval). As
discussed in that section, in each case we can convert the parameter values into the change in
  20
    Note that for state i to be pivotal, two changes must occur. First, Vi + V m × (2700000/Pi ) must be
greater than .5 (the injection of funds must change the outcome in state i from a Republican majority to a
Democratic majority). Second, state i must have enough electoral college votes so that changing the state
from Republican to Democratic changes the outcome in the electoral college. The first change will tend to
happen more often in small states, but the second change will tend to happen more often in large states.

Democratic vote share from total war spending.21 For the World War Two spending (Table 4)
the average imputed V M value is 0.012 with a maximum of 0.041. For New Deal spending
(Table 5) the average is 0.013 and the maximum is 0.118. In addition, when V m = .0621801,
the average vote shift caused by military spending is equal to the average (across states)
of the within-state standard deviation of vote share across years and offices. We examine a
range of possible V M , but we think the most plausible value is around 0.05 or 0.06.
       We consider V m ∈ {.01, .02, .03, .04, .06, .08, .10, .12, .15, .20, .25}. We include the high
values in our analyses to show what the model would predict if politicians believed that
military spending was highly effective at winning votes.
       We ran 33 separate simulations, one for each combination of DN (×3) and V m (×11).
       Figures 3a - 3d show how the pivot probabilities vary across states, for four values of
V m —.01, .03, and 06 (“reasonable” values), and .20 (probably implausibly large). The maps
suggest that the pivotal probabilities are plausible. While the probabilities vary with V m ,
the ordering of the states is relatively stable (while not shown here, they are also stable
over DN ) . States with high pivot probabilities—such as New York, West Virginia, Illinois,
Indiana, Missouri—are those which are not strongly aligned with one party, while those with
pivot probabilities of zero—North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama,
Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, Texas—tilt heavily towards Democrats. In fact, the states
of the Solid South are essentially never pivotal.
       The results also differ from simpler and more naive approaches. For example one could
see which states have the most volatile historical votes. This would be an unsatisfactory mea-
sure since it ignores both the baseline partisanship of the state and the state’s size. In fact
historical volatility has little correlation with any of the state-level pivotal probability mea-
sures (results available upon request).22 A more formal comparison of the pivot probability
and some leading alternatives from the literature is presented in the next sub-section.
  21
      The estimated spending parameters β̂ from (2), like V M , are denominated in thousands of dollars per
capita. The parameter then must be divided by certain factors depending on the combination of spending
and vote variable being used. For cumulative spending roughly a thousand dollars matches the overall war
total (F1 = 1) while for per year spending the amount is two hundred and fifty dollars (F1 = 4). For the
vote scale the values should be mapped into the unit interval to give vote shares which can be applied to
the 2-point (F2 = 2) and 4-point (F2 = 4) scales. Finally, to convert to expected voting we use a common
factor for vote intentions and vote approval (F3 = 1). The vote approval factor in principle could differ
(since it is not literally how an individual plans to vote), but using data from OPOR surveys and regressing
vote intention on vote approval shows that for the observed range of approval values that little adjustment
is needed (regression available upon request). So to map the parameter estimate into a fitted V M value we
take β̂/(F1 × F2 × F3 ).
   22
      Volatility is the residual standard error from (3).

6.2       A Test: Pivot Probabilities and Campaigning in the 1944 and
          1948 Elections
This section provides empirical support for our measure of state political value. We conduct
a horse race between Pivot Probability and other possible contenders from the literature.
The approach is to look at an alternative ranking of state political attractiveness based
on parties’ spending scarce resources: campaign visits by presidential candidates (while
our discussion in the last sub-section focused on spending, the model can be applied to
any resource which shapes voting behavior). States visited more frequently have greater
perceived electoral importance, since these trips are primarily set with the goal of winning
the election. We show that campaign visits by presidential candidates are very strongly and
positively associated with Pivot Probability for reasonable parameter values and much less so
with measures used in the literature (there is also additional evidence from political betting
markets supporting our preferred measure).23
       We study two elections, 1944 and 1948. We collected the 1944 (Roosevelt versus Dewey)
campaign visits data ourselves from newspaper reports.24 The 1948 (Truman versus Dewey)
data are from Runyon, Verdini and Runyon (1971). These are interesting races to consider
since they include periods within and outside our main sample, outcomes that are close and
lopsided, and cases where one or both candidates campaign.
       Before turning to the analysis, it is worth noting an important difference between cam-
paign visits and war spending. Campaign visits to a state have the flavor of a public good,
because each visit generates widespread publicity via newspaper and radio coverage, discus-
sion by politicians and local political elites, and so on. When Dewey travels to St. Louis to
give a major speech, the message conveyed is “Dewey cares about the people of Missouri.”
Newspapers and radio stations across the state magnify the impact of the visit—probably,
roughly linearly as a function of total circulation and the number of listeners—so the visit is
  23
     An alternative test is compare the various measures against market estimates of the political value of
different states. We consider the odds shortly before the 1944 election from political betting markets (New
York Times, 29 Oct 1944), which Rhode and Strumpf (2004) show already had an almost century long record
as the best available forecast of elections. While the betting markets are based on a slightly different outcome
(who will win the state), it should have a high overlap with our focus (whether spending will both change
the state election and also the overall winner). Our pivot probabilities have a correlation of 0.6-0.7 with the
betting market probabilities on the underdog, which is twice as high as the correlation for the alternative
measures.

     For 1944 we also conducted an analysis for Dewey alone, because Roosevelt did little campaigning due
to his poor health. The estimates are similar to those reported here. The newspaper sources include, e.g.,
the Washington Post, July 31, 1944; Sept. 28, 1944; Oct. 7, 1944; Oct. 21, 1944.

“consumed” by more than just those who actually see Dewey, shake his hand, or have their
babies kissed (spending in contrast has smaller geographic spillovers: a new plant or more
spending at an existing plant has primarily a local and private benefit, the jobs which get
created). Thus, rather than dividing by total population as in part (iv) in the procedure
above, it probably makes more sense to divide by some much smaller percentage, or perhaps
not to divide by population at all.25 What this means is that higher values of V m might be
more reasonable than lower values. There is some tentative evidence that campaign visits
have a higher public goods component than does war spending.26
    Table 6 presents a series of bivariate regression results, with Log(V isits + 1) as the
dependent variable. Each row shows the point estimate and standard error of the independent
variable, as well as the R-square. To facilitate comparisons across rows we standardize all
variables to have a standard deviation of 1.
    For high values of V m , such as .20 and .25, the correlation between Log(V isits + 1) and
Pivot Probability is above 0.7, which is quite high and nearly as high as the correlations
reported by other scholars for recent elections.27 . Even for lower values of V m , such as .10,
the correlation between Log(V isits + 1) and Pivot Probability is relatively high, around 0.6.
    A second important point is that Pivot Probability outperforms other measures used
in the literature. In his seminal study of New Deal spending Wright (1974) studied a
Political Productivity index, as well as a combination of three intuitive measures—electoral
votes per capita, the closeness of the predicted vote to 50-50, and the historical variability
of the vote measured as the standard deviation around the trend.28 In his study of WWII
   25
      Of course, military spending might also generate goodwill via favorable newspaper or radio coverage of
the incumbent, but the most important benefits—relatively high-paying jobs for workers, sales and profits
for firms—are almost surely private or at least local.
   26
      We examined California, which is an interesting test case both because there is significant spending in
both northern and southern California and because the Republican candidate in the 1944 election separately
visited San Francisco and Los Angeles (Roosevelt’s health prevented him from visiting the state). Using
ProQuest Historical archives for The Los Angeles Times, we find that 32% of the newspaper’s articles
covering Dewey’s 1944 visit focused on stops outside of the Los Angeles region, while only 21% of the articles
on war spending through the 1944 election covered areas outside of Los Angeles. This is consistent with the
hypothesis that campaign visits have a larger geographic spillover then spending.
   27
      Strömberg (2008) estimates that the correlation between visits and his measure of pivotality was 0.8
in both 2000 and 2004. Nagler and Leighley (1992) study the 1972 presidential election and find that
expenditures were higher in states where the election was expected to be close and in states that were more
likely to be pivotal.
   28
      The index is [(Electoral Votes)/(.01 Votes Cast)] × [Φ((D̂−.5+.01)/σ̂(D)) − Φ((D̂−.5)/σ̂(D))] where D
is the Democratic share of the presidential vote, D̂ is the predicted value of D based on a linear regression
of D on Y ear, σ̂(D) is the mean squared error of the regression residuals, and Φ is the standard normal
cumulative distribution function.



                                                     29
spending Rhode (2000) updated Wright’s measures, adding the elections between 1932 and
1944. Bateman and Taylor (2003) use an Electoral Vote Competition index proposed by
Grier, McDonald and Tollison (1995).29
       As Table 6 shows, Electoral Vote Competition is positively associated with campaign vis-
its in both years, but statistically significant only in 1948 and the correlation in 1944 is just
0.17. On the other hand, Political Productivity appears to be uncorrelated with campaign
visits in both years. Note that we examine two versions of this index, one that follows
Wright and includes all elections back to 1896 (Political Productivity 1 ) and one that in-
cludes only the elections back to 1932 (Political Productivity 2 ). We consider the second
variable to make sure that results are not due to measurement error from using mainly elec-
tions prior to the New Deal electoral realignment.30 The Std Deviation of Vote is essentially
unrelated to campaign visits in 1944 and in 1948 the correlation is negative. The simple
and intuitive “battleground state” measure, Closeness to 50 −50 is positively and signifi-
cantly correlated with visits and clearly outperforms both the Std Deviation of Vote and the
Vote Competition Index .31 However, except for the lowest values of V m , the Pivot Probability
variables are even more highly correlated with visits than Closeness to 50 −50 . This is be-
cause the Pivot Probability measure also incorporates the number of votes each state has in
the electoral college, and (though less important, at least judging from the data) each state’s
electoral volatility.


7        Main Results on Spending
This section presents the main estimates explaining the spatial distribution of spending
across states. The focus is on determining the relative contributions of political incentive
and economic efficiency mechanisms (For politics this section concentrates on presidential
election concerns while a sub-section considers the role of Congressional influence.). We
begin with a short motivational approach which gives preliminary evidence of the limited
role of political factors. We then present the formal analysis. We first consider supply
  29
      The index is (Electoral Votes)×Std Dev(D)/(|D−.5|) where D is the Democratic share of the presidential
vote.
   30
      Since Political Productivity 2 is based on just 3 or 4 elections, we do not de-trend D to compute D̂ and
σ̂(D).
   31
      Following our construction of the Pivot Probability variables, for 1944 we use all elections between 1932
and 1942 to compute Std Deviation of Vote, Vote Competition Index , and Closeness to 50 −50 . For 1948 we
use all elections between 1932 and 1946.

contracts which are the largest component of war spending, and then focus on new facilities.
Facilities spending is only one-seventh of total outlays, which is evidence against political
allocation since it should be easier to geographically target to politically beneficial states
than contract spending which is tied to pre-existing manufacturing capacity. The regression
estimates indicate political incentives play almost no role, and that economic efficiency is
important both relative to politics and also in absolute terms.

7.1    Motivation
Before turning to the estimates, it is helpful to visualize the data. Figure 4 shows at the
state-level how aggregate vote-changes (discussed in Section 5) compare with World War II
spending levels over the period 1940–1944. There is a slight positive relationship between
spending and votes (correlation = .32), although this seems driven in large part by a few
states in the South, which shifted votes away from FDR and also received relatively few
military contracts.

  Figure 4: Change in Democratic Vote Share vs. Supply Contract Spending Per Capita

   It is also useful to visualize the data spatially. Figures 5 and 6 show the annual and overall
allocation of per capita contract spending across states. Spending is heavily concentrated in

                                                                                             32
the Northeast, Industrial Midwest, West Coast, as well having relatively high values in the
Plains. This ranking is also relatively stable over time. While these patterns could reflect
a politically motivated allocation since many of these states have high pivot probabilities
(Figure 3), there are important deviations. For example, West Virginia is pivotal but it
does not receive extraordinary spending. New England, Upper Midwest, Plains and West
Coast states receive substantial spending and yet are not particularly pivotal. And then
there is the South, which is never pivotal, and yet receives spending. Economic efficiency
is a more consistent explanation for the allocation pattern. High spending states all have
significant pre-existing industrial capacity (Figure 8, discussed further below). In particular,
economics can explain the politically anomalous cases of high spending in less pivotal states
(New England, Upper Midwest, West Coast, and South) and low spending in pivotal states
(West Virginia).32




  32
     The high spending in many of the Plains states stems from their aircraft manufacturing facilities (Fig-
ure 8b).

                             Figure 6: Contract Spending Per Capita: Periods of Interest
   Figure 7 shows the distribution of new facilities spending per capita. In contrast to
contracts spending, this money is relatively uniformly allocated. One exception is Nevada,
where a large number of military bases (mainly army airfields) and mining facilities were
built, and the population was low. Comparing to the far lumpier pivot probability maps in
Figure 3, it seems unlikely that political calculus drove this allocation.
   Figure 8 shows the distribution of the two key economic independent variables—total
manufacturing employment per capita and aircraft manufacturing employment per capita—
across the U.S. states. Two features stand out. First, manufacturing had important con-
centrations in the Northeast, the Industrial Midwest, and to a lesser extent the West Coast
and portions of the South—the Carolinas, Georgia and Virginia (these points partly reflect
the spatial distribution of the auto industry, see note 9). Second, aircraft manufacturing
employment was highly concentrated in a few states, reflecting the need for specialized labor
and plants.

       Figure 9 shows the temporal pattern of aggregate national spending per capita and voter
support for FDR during the period between the 1940 and 1944 elections.33 Spending was
highest at the onset of the war in 1942, and slows down substantially just before the 1944
election. This is inconsistent with the politically strategic allocation of spending for two
reasons. First, it is the period just before the election when many voters make their final
choice between candidates and so spending would be most efficient at this time in gaining
votes. Second, spending is smallest during the periods when FDR was most vulnerable to
not getting re-elected and so political-based allocation would be most attractive (spending
changes slightly lag approval changes, but they reinforce rather than offset political support).
Comparing the two series, we see spending and approval move in a similar fashion—in fact,
the correlation coefficient is 0.80 for the two series. Both series surge following the attack on
Pearl Harbor—with FDR approval rising first—and then both dissipate and largely bottom
out in the months leading up to the 1944 election. So long as these swings in voter support
were largely driven by external factors such as patriotic response to the initiation of the War,
this suggests political strategy was not central to the timing of war spending which would
have been more beneficial in the later years where FDR’s support had diminished.34

7.2       Estimates: Contract Spending
We now estimate the contributions of presidential-motivated politics and economic efficiency
in explaining the distribution of war spending. Our political measure is based on whether
spending in a state is likely to alter its election and then in turn change the overall winner,
the pivot probability discussed in the last section. This sub-section focuses on the allocation
of contract spending, which is the bulk of the war monies (about 86% of federal spending on
the war), and the next sub-section considers new facilities spending.
       We focus on the following cross-sectional model,

   Spending i = β0 + β1 Pivot Probability i + β2 Total Manuf i + β3 Aircraft Manuf i + i                 (4)

where i represents states.35 Several versions of this specification will be estimated using OLS,
  33
      Appendix 10.3 presents the spending time series annotated with key war events. FDR approval data is
from Gallup.
   34
      An alternate to using presidential support is to look at the partisan composition of Congress. Following
the 1940 election the Senate was 68% and the House 61% Democratic. After the 1942 mid-term elections,
the Senate and House Democratic share had fallen to 61% and 51% respectively. This suggest a larger drop
in voter support than in the figure, which makes the continuing drop in war spending harder to reconcile
with an election-based calculus.
   35
      We also estimated several alternative models (which are omitted here for brevity). First we consider

                                                     39
                   Figure 9: FDR Approval and Contract Spending, 1941–1944


based on different time periods and constructions of the variables. The goal is to compare
the economic and statistical significance of the political and economic channels (β1 versus
β2 , β3 ) and their contribution to explaining the variation in monies across states (using R2 ).
For each type of spending, we consider various measures for Spending. To represent political
factors we consider each of the 33 separate Pivot Probability vectors, representing different
assumptions about voter responses to spending and of the aggregate partisan leanings of the
electorate, discussed in the last section. The Manuf covariates are measures of pre-existing
(pre-war) manufacturing capacity—employment per capita in 1939—and capture the role of
economic efficiency. To ease interpretation we standardize both the dependent variable and
the covariates to have mean 0 and standard deviation 1, that is for each variable we subtract
the mean (which has no substantiative effect since the constant term is of little interest and
a specification that included pre-existing shipbuilding capacity. However, this variable is never statistically
significant, and including it does not affect the other coefficients. Second, as noted above, to the extent
possible military production was supposed to be located where it could not easily be attacked by enemy
forces. Thus, we also estimated models that included dummy variables indicating coastal states and border
states. These variables were never positive and statistically significant. Third, we use other politics measures
in the literature—Political Productivity or Electoral Vote Competition—in place of Pivot Probability. The
estimated coefficients for these variables are never statistically significant while the estimated coefficients for
the manufacturing variables, Total Manuf and Aircraft Manuf , remain large and highly significant.

there are no interaction terms) and then divide by the standard deviation. After this change,
the parameters indicate the standard deviation change in the dependent variable from a one
standard deviation change in the covariate. We present our estimates graphically in order
to show several specifications at once, with some of the underlying estimates in Section 11
in the Appendix.
       Figure 10a shows the point estimates for total per capita spending from June 1940 thru
November 1944, i.e., up to the 1944 presidential election, for each of the different values
of the money shift parameter V m and for DN = 0 (neutral national tide).36 Figure 10b
shows the R-square of the regression that includes all variables, as well as the R-square of a
regression that includes only the Pivot Probability variable, and the R-square of a regression
that includes only the manufacturing variables, Total Manuf and Aircraft Manuf . Figure 10c
shows the point estimates and 95% confidence intervals for the Pivot Probability variable, for
the same specifications. Figure 10d shows the point estimates and 95% confidence intervals
for the Total Manuf variable, for the same specifications.37
       The patterns are clear. Recall that we standardized all variables. So, Figure 10a shows
that the estimated effects of the variables Total Manuf and Aircraft Manuf are both much
higher than the estimated effect of the Pivot Probability variable, for all values of V m . Figure
10b shows that the variables Total Manuf and Aircraft Manuf account for almost all of the
regression R-square, and the contribution of Pivot Probability is minimal. Figure 10c shows
that the estimated effect of Pivot Probability is not statistically significant at the .05 level
even for rather high values of Vm . By contrast, Figure 10d shows that the estimated effect
of Total Manuf is always highly significant at the .05 level.38
       It is possible that although overall spending was not clearly targeted at pivotal states,
spending closer to the election of 1944 was. In fact, this is not the case.39 Figures 11a-11d
are analogous to Figures 10a-10d, but the dependent variable is for contract spending only in
1944 (January through October). The overall patterns are quite similar: the estimated effect
  36
      In the interest of brevity we do not present the estimates for DN = .03 (pro-Democrat national leaning)
or DN = −.03 (anti-Democrat national leaning). The pattern of results reported below continue to hold in
those cases.
   37
      As shown in Appendix Table 10, for very high values of V m the coefficient on the Pivot Probability is
larger and statistically significant. These values seem implausibly high however, both instinctively and also
in light of the evidence presented in Section 5. These values are omitted from the figure.
   38
      We also conducted analyses dropping the South (the eleven former Confederate states) and the pat-
terns are similar. In fact, the estimated coefficients on Pivot Probability are smaller and never statistically
significant while the estimated coefficients on the manufacturing variables remain large and highly significant.
   39
      As further evidence, recall from Figure 2 that little spending occurs right before the election.


                                                      41
of the Total Manuf variable is much higher than the estimated effect of the Pivot Probability
variable (though this is no longer the case for the Aircraft Manuf variable); the variables
Total Manuf and Aircraft Manuf account for almost all of the regression R-square, and the
contribution of Pivot Probability is minimal; the estimated effect of Pivot Probability is never
statistically significant at the .05 level, even for the highest values of Vm ; and the estimated
effect of Total Manuf is always highly significant at the .05 level.
      Figures 12a-12d zero in even closer to the election, examining the distribution of con-
tract spending in the four months just prior to the election—July thru October 1944.40
The bottom line is again the same. There is little evidence that contracts were allocated
disproportionately towards pivotal states.41
      Finally, Figures 13a-13d search for evidence of electorally-related targeting from a slightly
different point of view, by studying the share of money spent in a state during the 2 or 4
months prior to the election, as a percentage of the total amount of money spent in the state
over the whole war, or over the whole year 1944. In all figures we focus on the estimated
coefficient and standard error of Pivot Probability. Figures 13a and 13b consider the 4-month
period leading up to the November 1944 election (July through October), while figures 13c
and 13d consider an even shorter 2-month period (September through October). In all cases
the bottom line is the same: the estimated effect of Pivot Probability on the share of money
spent during the election campaign is never statistically distinguishable from zero.
      Overall, we find robust evidence that war contract spending is not allocated to enhance
the president’s electoral chances. Economic efficiency is a far more important determinant.
Moreover, economics is important in absolute terms and just one variable (pre-existing man-
ufacturing capacity) can explain sixty percent of the inter-state variation in such spending.




 40
      In these regressions we drop the Aircraft Manuf variable.
 41
      Other intervals, two, three, or five months leading up the election exhibit similar patterns.

7.3     Estimates: New Facilities Spending
We next turn to new facilities spending, both military and industrial. Such spending is more
amenable to political manipulation than supply contracts, since it does not depend on any
pre-existing items, like manufacturing plants, which might not be coterminous with political
needs (While one might imagine that new facilities would have to be located near up- and
down-stream suppliers, there are many examples of plants located virtually in the middle of
nowhere. Some leading examples include the Basic Magnesium plant set up in Henderson,
Nevada, and the Manhattan project plants constructed in Clinch River, TN and Los Alamos,
NM). Given this, the far smaller scale of facilities spending– 14% of federal spending on the
war– is prima facie evidence against the role of political factors. Still it is interesting to see
whether this relatively limited spending is allocated to politically pivotal states.
    We analyze new facilities spending and also total spending on supply contracts plus
facilities. We show results for spending over the whole war and spending just in the election
year. The key results are shown in Figures 14a-14d.
    The bottom line is again simple. With facilities spending as the dependent variable the es-
timated coefficient on the Pivot Probability variable is always small and in most specifications
negative (see Figures 14a and 14b). In most cases the estimate is statistically insignificant,
and it is significant only when the point estimate is negative. This is true whether or not
the Total Manuf and Aircraft Manuf variables are included (the latter results are not shown
in the figure). The manufacturing variables are never statistically significant. Thus, new
facilities were not placed disproportionately near existing manufacturing areas, nor does it
appear that they were used to develop under-developed areas.
    Note that none of the variables in our models strongly predicts the geographic distribution
of new facilities spending. This is a puzzle that we leave for future research.
    With total spending (contracts plus new facilities) per capita as the dependent vari-
able the results are, not surprisingly, similar to those for contract spending alone (see Fig-
ures 14c and 14d). For the more plausible values of V m the estimated coefficient on the
Pivot Probability variable is small and statistically insignificant.42 As with the regressions
for supply contracts in the previous section, the manufacturing variables are always positively
related to total spending and statistically significant.

  42
     For very high values of V m the estimated coefficient is larger and statistically significant at least when
the Total Manuf and Aircraft Manuf variables are excluded (the latter results are not shown in the figure).

While not the focus of this paper, we also ran specifications that include variables to check
for congressional influence over the distribution of spending.43 More specifically, we con-
structed several indices of “institutional power” for each state and checked whether states
with more powerful delegations received contract dollars. To construct the indices we use
the following House and Senate positions: Speaker of the House, Majority Leader, Minority
Leader, member of the House Ways and Means committee, member of the House Appropri-
ations committee, member of the House Rules committee, member of the Senate Finance
committee, member of the Senate Appropriations committee, member of the House Military
Affairs committee, member of the House Naval Affairs committee, member of the Senate
Military Affairs committee, and member of the Senate Naval Affairs committee. Let H&S
be the set of all of these positions, let H be the set of all positions from the House, let S be
the set of all positions from the Senate, and let M be the set of the four positions involving
defense-related committees plus the two Appropriations committees.
       The broadest index, which we denote House and Senate Overall Power , is constructed as
follows: For each state i count the total number of positions in the set H&S held by the state’s
House and Senate delegation in year t. The chamber-specific indices, House Overall Power
and Senate Overall Power are constructed similarly but each index considers only the po-
sitions in H and S, respectively. Finally, the more jurisdiction-specific index, House and
Senate Military Power is constructed by counting only those positions in M . For each index
we then divide by state population. Note that the indices will therefore reflect the Senate
malapportionment that gives small states more representation per person than large states.
       We present the estimates of interest in Table 7. In the table we present the results for
separate regressions for the different power indices. If we include both indices together the
results are similar.44 The bottom line from the regression results is simple. None of these
variables is statistically significant in any specification, the point estimates are more often
negative than positive (all of the point estimates in Table 7 are negative), and in all cases the
point estimates are substantively small.45 Importantly, including these variables also does

     This section considers how senior congressmen influence spending allocation. An alternative approach
(and one that parallels the presidential-election objective) is to consider how spending could be used to elect
specific congressmen or to maintain control of the two chambers. The latter objectives would require looking
at spending distribution at a finer level (within-state), and we return to this point in the conclusion.
  44
     As with all other variables we standardize these so they have a variance of 1.
  45
     We also ran models with the separate chamber-specific variables as regressors. These are never positive

not substantially change the estimates on the other key variables. The estimated coefficients
on Total Manuf and Aircraft Manuf remain large and highly significant, while the estimated
coefficients on Pivot Probability are small and statistically insignificant except for extremely
high values of V m . If anything, adding the congressional power indices sometimes causes the
estimated coefficient on Pivot Probability to fall and become statistically insignificant even
for high values of V m .
    We also investigated whether supply contracts in 1942 were targeted more towards states
with more competitive Senate or gubernatorial elections in 1942. We find no significant
relationships for either office, using either the actual or the predicted vote. An analogous
exercise for 1944 produces similar (non) findings.46
    Finally, we find no systematic evidence of a bias in favor of small states, as one might
expect due to their over-representation in the Senate (these estimates are omitted). If any-
thing, the correlation between supply contracts per capita and population (in logs) is always
positive and often statistically significant. The correlation between population and new fa-
cilities spending per capita is negative but this is due entirely to Nevada. The correlation
between total spending and population is generally positive and statistically insignificant
(although when Nevada is dropped the correlation often becomes significant).


8     Votes and the War Effort
Another possibility is that politicians might gain votes not by channeling the monies to
selective places, but instead in using them to most effectively prosecute the war. The idea
here is that voters are primarily concerned about winning the war, and so they would reward
politicians who are successfully conducting the war. Efficient spending of money is then the
optimal choice of vote-seeking politicians. We investigate this possibility below. In short we
find the opposite effect: voters become more attached to the incumbent party as the war
effort gets mired down, likely reflecting a preference for continuity (the conventional wisdom
of not switching horses in the middle of the race).
    We consider two aspects of this mechanism: how perceptions of the war status influence
votes, and how the party in power is perceived to influence the status of the war. Both of
and statistically significant (the variable Senate Overall Power is sometimes negative and significant).
  46
     We predicted the 1942 vote in each state using previous election results for all president, governor and
U.S. senator between 1930 and 1941. For 1944 we used all elections between 1930 and 1943.

these topics can be analyzed using questions from the Gallup polls discussed earlier.47
       The results (cross-tabs) are summarized in Table 8.48 The first values look at how voter
behavior is related to beliefs about the war status. We use the Gallup polls which asked
voters how they would vote conditional on the war continuing and on the war ending. The
bottom two panels show that having the war persist leads about 10-15% of voters to shift
to Democrats relative to how they would vote if the war was to end. In addition a heavy
majority of voters do not change their voting based on the war status, and that these effects
are comparable for those who voted Democrat or who Republican in the 1940 election.
       One challenge of interpreting these estimates is that there are two reasons that the war
status could influence voter support for the president. A standard argument is that voters
prefer continuity in their politicians so long as the war is continuing, and are more open
to a change in peace time. But if the war continues for a while that might also mean the
  47
      We cannot evaluate an intermediate step, namely how spending relates to the chance (or perceived
chance) of winning the war. To do this we would need to estimate a spending production function which
maps spending levels and allocations across geography into war outcomes. There is not enough variation in
the data to adequately estimate such a function.
   48
      An implicit assumption in the analysis is that the poll questions refer to favorable war outcomes: “war
ending” and “speedier prosecution of the war” implies the Allies are victorious. This is a reasonable assump-
tion given the context of relevant Gallup polls.



                                                      51
president is doing a poor job fighting the war. We explore this second possibility next by
examining whether voters believe switching parties will lead the war to wind down faster.
       Table 9 presents results on how voters believe the party in power will influence how
quickly the war will be prosecuted. Voters believe Republicans will be slower at ending the
war, and this tilt becomes more prominent as we approach the 1944 election. Still about
half of all voters believe the party in power has no effect on how quickly the war will be
completed, and there are clear partisan differences with prior Democrat voters being far more
skeptical of the efficacy of Republicans. But more importantly the conclusion is that voters
believe a Democrat government will more quickly end the war, so they seem comfortable in
FDR’s performance.49


9        Conclusion
The bottom line from our analysis is straightforward. First, we find evidence consistent with
the hypothesis that supply contracts during WWII were awarded to states that had high
industrial capacity already in place in 1939—most likely, states with industrial plants that
could be modified relatively quickly and cheaply to produce needed war supplies. Second, we
do not find consistent evidence that supply contracts were awarded to states that were es-
pecially likely to be pivotal in the 1944 presidential election. We also find little connections
between new facilities spending and politics. These results are robust to adding controls
for membership on key committees of a state’s congressional delegation, and we show that
spending that successfully impacts the war effort is not likely to directly translate into addi-
tional votes. Thus, the evidence suggests that the distribution of World War Two spending
was driven more by practical concerns than by calculations of how to win future elections.
This conclusion is rather surprising given the vast scale of the spending here, which would
leave ample room for political meddling. Given that this conflicts with other empirical dis-
tributive politics papers, a priority going forward is to determine conditions which diminish
political influence over allocations. Some leading possibilities include high stakes spending
  49
    Further support for this comes from The Office of Public Opinion Research (OPOR) which ran a number
of surveys during the war. One survey (No. 6) conducted April 2-7, 1943 included questions on whether
the individual would support FDR for a fourth term if the war were over, whether he or she recalled voting
for Roosevelt (vs. Willkie) in 1940, and whether the United States was doing all it possibly can to win the
war. Even after controlling for backing Roosevelt in 1940, there was a positive and statistically significant
relationship between reporting the United States was strong and supporting a fourth term if the war was
over (regression omitted).

(fighting a significant threat to national security rather than, say, infrastructure spending),
external oversight (the civilian advisors in the programs discussed here), crowd-out (some
government spending displaced private manufacturing, such as the full conversion of civilian
auto plants to war-time use, and voters respond to the net change in public plus private
production), or specific environmental factors (voters might be less responsive to spending
in the midst of a war than, say, during a depression).
   There are several avenues to further explore World War II spending. First, it is possi-
ble that other political factors were at play, including inter-party competition for control
of Congress, re-election concerns of individual congressional incumbents (such as powerful
senior members or vulnerable junior members), or allocating funds to areas where Democrats
had more supporters to reward loyalists and increase turnout of friendly voters. To do this
money would have to be steered to the jurisdictions of individual congressmen or specific
areas in the state. Similarly, one could generate local measures of pivot probabilities with
respect to presidential, gubernatorial or Senate elections to examine the within-state allo-
cation of war spending. Second, another objective of the war spending was to locate plants
where they could not easily be attacked by enemy forces. This would push spending far
from borders and coasts, both between and within-states. Third, we could get a more local-
ized measure of the economic incentive to allocate spending. Proximity to pre-war military
bases, pools of under-employed and unemployed workers (which likely vary by city), might
increase the efficacy such spending. Finally, what were the long term consequences of such
extensive federal spending? One could examine whether this led to higher levels of income
or industrial development say twenty or thirty years later (a challenge would be to account
for the endogeneity of such spending, since we have seen it tends to be located near pre-
existing manufacturing plants). This would contribute to the growing literature which seeks
to measure such local multipliers of government programs, but typically must consider far
smaller outlays. A careful investigation of each of these topics requires more fine-grained
data (spending at the congressional district or county-level), and we leave this for future
work.
   While the limited role of political allocation may seem surprising, the same may hold with
some contemporary major defense projects. For example, the F-35 is the fifth generation
combat plane which is planned to be the focus of manned aircraft for the Air Force, Navy
and Marines for the next several decades. As of this writing, the cost of building is expected



                                              55
to be $350b and a lifetime cost of $1.5t making it the most expensive military weapons
program in US history (additional spending will accrue to manufacture planes for other
countries). Conventional wisdom holds that the primary contractor, Lockheed-Martin, is
allocating assembly across states in a way to gain political support. The evidence on this
point is actually mixed. While the main contractors did give over $10m in donations over
two election cycles to key members of Congressional committees overseeing the program,
the spending is actually concentrated in non-pivotal states (half the jobs are in Texas and
California), many swing states (including Missouri, Virginia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania,
and Wisconsin) are not even in the top twenty among jobs created, and eleven states get no
or almost no spending.50 In short the spending seems to be allocated across states in large
part due to non-political factors such as pre-existing manufacturing capacity though there
may be a role for supporting senior Congressmen.

10.2      Gallup
In analyzing the connection between spending and voting, we considered all Gallup studies
over the period 1936-1944 (all codebooks and data files are available from The Roper Center,
https://ropercenter.cornell.edu). We then limited the studies to those which had information
about voting (either vote intentions or voter approval), or had specific questions related to
other topics we focus on such as how war status influenced voting. Some studies listed below
are omitted in certain analyses when they are missing key variables, or in some cases only a
portion of the sample can be used (the studies often use two different forms, and respondents

     Projected orders to GOCO excluded, foodstocks excluded. Text Dec. 1942, p, 14 “Supply data include
prime awards over $50,000 reported to the WPB by the Army, Navy, Maritime Commission and Treasury
Department since June, 1940 and by the British Empire and other foreign purchasing missions since Septem-
ber, 1939. Treasury Contract cover defense aid awards of the Procurement Division. Awards for foodstuffs
are excluded. Project orders issued to Government-operated establishments are excluded, but awards made
by those establishments to private industry are included. Contracts for which work location is not known
are included in the ‘off-continent and undesignated’ total.”
