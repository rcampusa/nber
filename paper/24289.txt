The Comparative Advantage of Medicare Advantage

                                         ABSTRACT

We ascertain the degree of service-level selection in Medicare Advantage (MA) using individual
level data on the 100 most frequent HCC’s or combination of HCC’s from two national insurers
in 2012-2013. We find differences in the distribution of beneficiaries across HCC’s between TM
and MA, principally in the smaller share of MA enrollees with no coded HCC, consistent with
greater coding intensity in MA. Among those with an HCC code, absolute differences between
MA and TM shares of beneficiaries are small, consistent with little service-level selection.

Variation in HCC margins does not predict differences between an HCC’s share of MA and TM
enrollees, although one cannot a priori sign a relationship between margin and service-level
selection. Margins are negatively associated with the importance of post-acute care in the HCC.
Margins among common chronic disease classes amenable to medical management and typically
managed by primary care physicians are larger than among diseases typically managed by
specialists. These margin differences by disease are robust against a test for coding effects and
suggest that the average technical efficiency of MA relative to TM may vary by diagnosis. If so,
service-level selection on the basis of relative technical efficiency could be welfare enhancing.

        As is well known, competitive insurance markets can be inefficient from sorting by individuals on

either price or covered benefits in the case of fixed contracts and also, in the case of endogenous

contracts, from service-level selection by insurers, meaning differential shadow prices for individuals

with different conditions (Rothschild and Stiglitz 1976; Cutler and Reber 1998; Frank, et al. 2000; Breyer,

et al. 2012). 1 To mitigate inefficiency from service-level selection, policy uses tools such as risk

adjustment, mandates, subsidies, and reinsurance (Layton, et al. 2015; Geruso and McGuire 2016;

Layton, et al. 2016; Azevedo and Gottlieb 2017; Geruso and Layton 2017; McGuire and van Kleef 2017).

Risk adjustment addresses service-level selection by attempting to make individuals who vary in their

expected spending equally profitable to the insurer, thereby limiting the insurer’s incentives to structure

the insurance contract to attract certain beneficiaries and not others (Geruso and Layton 2017). 2


        Medicare’s initial risk adjustment scheme mostly relied upon age and sex and was notably

unsuccessful in preventing favorable sorting of beneficiaries into MA (Congressional Budget Office

1997).3 About a decade ago Medicare introduced two reforms to reduce the favorable sorting into MA.

It added diagnoses as a risk adjuster to the demographic risk adjusters it had previously employed, a

method it termed Hierarchical Coexisting Conditions (HCC’s), and it required beneficiaries to remain in

their chosen plan for several months, i.e., a lock-in period, whereas previously there had been no lock-

in. 4 These reforms markedly reduced the favorable sorting into MA (Newhouse, et al. 2013; Newhouse

and McGuire 2014; Newhouse, et al. 2015). 5 There remains the question of whether service-level

selection exists within Medicare Advantage (MA), and that is the question we address in this paper.

Note that such selection could be socially efficient if MA plans differentially attract beneficiaries with

conditions that they are technically efficient in treating relative to TM. We thus go beyond the

economics literature cited above in not assuming either the same cost function in MA and TM or

alternatively a uniform reduction in cost across all MA beneficiaries relative to TM. 6
        Under the current MA risk adjustment method, payments to insurers for an individual

beneficiary are proportional to the relative weight the risk adjustment scheme assigns to that

beneficiary (Pope, et al. 2004). The relative weight is based on predicted TM spending from a regression

of individual level TM spending on a number of demographic characteristics and a beneficiary’s

diagnosis or diagnoses. 7 As a result, an MA plan’s revenue for one type of beneficiary relative to

another approximately equals the ratio of how much TM spends on each type of beneficiary. The

variation in plan margins across HCC’s is therefore in part a measure of the average technical efficiency

of MA relative to TM for the various HCC’s or combinations of HCC’s.


        In an earlier paper (Newhouse et al., 2013) we used actual revenue and medical cost data from

one insurer for 48 unique HCC’s or combination of HCC’s to explore selection across HCC’s or

combination of HCC’s and differences in insurer margins across HCC’s. We had four main findings:


        1) We saw negligible differences in the distribution of MA enrollees and TM enrollees across the

48 HCC’s in the sample, or no evidence of service-level selection. We also found no relationship

between the observed margin and the difference in MA and TM enrollee shares.


        2) This was so despite large differences in margins by HCC; the range of margins from the most

to the least profitable was 160 percentage points.


        3) We could not calculate standard errors for the estimated margins because we were not given

individual level data, only aggregate revenue and cost for each of the 48 HCC’s. As a result, we could not

determine how much of the variation in margins across HCC’s to attribute to sampling error.


        4) Nevertheless, there was a pattern in the data; certain types of HCC’s were relatively more

profitable on average, which suggested that not all the observed variation was attributable to sampling

error. In particular, common chronic diseases typically managed by primary care physicians (PCP’s) and
for which successful medical management might prevent a potentially expensive acute episode were

relatively more profitable; examples included diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),

and chronic heart failure (CHF). At the other extreme, chronic diseases often managed by specialists

tended to be markedly less profitable than those typically managed by PCP’s; examples included cancers

of various sites and rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, the one acute HCC among the 48 HCC’s in the

sample, unstable angina and acute ischemic heart disease, was the least profitable of all, perhaps

because there was little opportunity for medical management by the insurer. We interpreted these

findings as suggesting that MA had greater relative technical efficiency in the HCC categories with higher

margins.


        This paper revisits both the theoretical and empirical work of the earlier paper with better data

that permit several improvements. Most importantly, we now have data on revenue and cost at the

individual member level so that we can estimate sampling error. Second, we use data from two insurers

rather than one, and the data are somewhat more recent, coming from calendar years 2012 and 2013. 8

Third, in this work we have data on roughly twice as many HCC’s or combinations of HCC’s as in the

earlier work, namely the 100 most frequent HCC’s or combination of HCC’s from each insurer for each

year. Although there is substantial overlap, the top 100 HCC’s are not necessarily the same 100 HCC’s

for each insurer in each year. Fourth, in the earlier work we only had data for those with at least one

coded HCC; in these data we also know those not coded with an HCC, who are by far the largest group in

our sample. Finally, in these results we control for geography.


        We have three main findings:


        1) We now find some evidence of service-level selection across HCC’s, though the main

difference in the distribution of the MA and TM samples across HCC’s is a markedly lower MA share with
no coded HCC, consistent with more intensive diagnosis coding in MA. The differences in shares among

those with a coded HCC or combination of HCC’s are small in absolute value.


        2) There is substantial variation in margins across HCC’s, even after accounting for sampling

error. We again find that common chronic diseases usually managed by PCP’s have higher margins than

chronic conditions typically managed by specialists, consistent with MA plans’ having greater average

technical efficiency for those conditions. We carry out one test of whether our finding of differential

margins by HCC is robust to coding effects and find that it is.


        3) In our earlier paper we assumed that MA plans would attempt to select beneficiaries in high

margin HCC’s and interpreted the observed lack of selection as it being too costly for plans to do so. In

the next section of this paper we show that this assumption is theoretically incorrect; one cannot sign a

priori a relationship between the profit margins we observe and a plan’s incentive to attract

beneficiaries in a given HCC without making restrictive assumptions. Fundamentally this is because a

plan’s incentive to select beneficiaries with a specific HCC is a function of revenue and cost conditions at

the margin and the various HCC profit margins we observe give information on average revenue and

cost.


        As a condition of obtaining the data, we agreed to keep the names of the two insurers and their

actual margins confidential. We have done so by subtracting the same arbitrary constant from each

calculated margin shown below.


        The paper is organized as follows. In the next section we discuss whether one can sign a

relationship between the margin in an HCC and the difference in the shares of beneficiaries in the HCC in

MA and TM. Following that we turn to our empirical work. We describe our data, methods, and results

and conclude with a discussion.
        Profit Margins and Selection Incentives in Medicare Advantage


        The margin is the gap between price and cost, measured in absolute or percentage terms, as in

the case of the Lerner Index of market power. Although the relative price for an HCC in the MA market

is set by regulation and so is regarded as fixed by the MA plan, coding intensity notwithstanding, the

level of spending to treat a disease or groups of disease is partly chosen by the plan’s actions, for

example its network, formulary, and cost sharing choices, which determine its profit margins in

equilibrium. As a result, observed margins are endogenous.


        It may seem intuitively appealing that a test of across-HCC or service-level selection by MA plans

is whether there is a positive association between the margin in an HCC and the MA share in that HCC

relative to TM. Indeed, Newhouse et al. (2013) assumed this was the case since it is what one would

expect if MA plans specialized in disease categories in which they had a production advantage, and

Newhouse, et al. (2013) interpreted larger profit margins in certain HCC’s as indicating production

efficiency in MA relative to TM. Selection incentives, however, relate to conditions at the margin, and

the observed profit margins across HCC’s relate to the average beneficiary in each HCC. There is thus no

necessary link between observed profit margins and selection incentives.


        In particular, a number of factors in addition to production efficiency affect the relationship

between profit margins and the share of plan enrollees in MA relative to TM. Consider the simple case

of one profit-maximizing MA plan competing against a passive TM alternative for beneficiaries in various

diagnosis groups. The MA plan decides how much to spend on each group to maximize profit given the

set level of payment for the group. Payment to the plan might be high in relation to the plan’s costs for

services if the MA plan is technically efficient relative to TM for a particular diagnosis group.


        But relative technical efficiency is not the only factor at play. The MA plan in this hypothetical

example has market power and a monopolist maximizes profit by restricting output. Here with a fixed
price, the MA plan restricts output (spends less) according to the elasticity of enrollment demand in a

group with respect to the level of service spending. This elasticity of demand could differ across HCC

groups in unknown ways, leading to no signed correlation between margin and share.


        Yet another factor is adverse or favorable selection within a group. If the MA plan suffers

adverse selection within a group, higher enrollment would lead to lower average cost, as in the standard

Einav-Finkelstein model of a health insurance market (Einav, et al. 2010; Einav and Finkelstein 2011). On

the other hand, if the MA plan enjoys favorable selection within a group in relation to TM, the average

cost of members goes up with higher enrollment, implying lower margins with higher enrollment.

Although there now appears to be only a small amount of favorable selection overall in MA (Newhouse,

et al. 2013, 2015), selection patterns could differ across disease groups.


        Finally, the model of one MA plan competing against TM does not represent our data. The plans

we study are two national plans that compete not just against TM but also against each other and

against other national plans and local plans that may be more or less efficient than our plans in some

disease areas and so contribute to any pattern of favorable or adverse selection into the plans we study.


        In short, one cannot derive predictions about the relationship between profit margins and the

relative share of MA to TM enrollees by HCC without making additional assumptions that seem overly

restrictive to us. We can get somewhat further, however, by looking at characteristics of certain disease

groups and asking why MA plan cost functions relative to TM cost functions might differ across HCC’s.

As a preliminary remark, enrollment in MA tends to persist; about 90 percent of MA enrollees remain

enrolled in the same plan the following year (Medicare Payment Advisory Commission 2015). 9 Because

of this persistence, MA insurers have a financial incentive to increase the likelihood that their members

with chronic diseases comply with prescribed medications, are examined at frequencies that treatment

guidelines specify, whereas TM does not offer the same financial incentive. 10 MA insurers, for example,
may encourage members to purchase Part D by keeping premiums low, and they have an incentive to

optimize the use of drugs to reduce medical costs, an incentive not present in TM. MA plans also have

an incentive to discourage low-value care. At a given level of enrollment, therefore, cost functions of

MA plans for a variety of chronic disease HCC’s may lie below those of TM. By contrast, in the case of

acute conditions or chronic conditions for which treatment is considered non-discretionary or

customarily follows a certain protocol, cost functions in MA and TM may be more similar.


        One aspect of medical management that MA plans can implement is more judicious use of post-

acute care, a key driver of geographic variation in TM cost (Newhouse and Garber 2013). We test

whether the intensity of post-acute care in an HCC relates to the observed margin. 11 We use the

proportion of TM spending on post-acute care in an HCC as a measure of post-acute intensity.


        Cost functions may also differ for certain HCC’s if, relative to other HCC’s, they are

disproportionately treated by specialists or at hospitals with greater market power, since MA plans

negotiate price whereas TM sets a take-it-or-leave-it price. Cancer in particular is often managed by an

oncologist or a hematologist and may be treated at a specialty cancer hospital. Such hospitals are much

less numerous than general hospitals and thus may have greater market power. 12


        Not only specialty hospitals, but also specialist physicians are likely to have more market power

than the more numerous PCP’s. In commercial insurance fees relative to TM are higher for both medical

and surgical specialists than fees for PCP’s, consistent with greater market power of specialists (White,

et al. 2013; Baker, et al. 2014; Austin and Baker 2015; Cooper, et al. 2015; Clemens and Gottlieb 2017).

Although MA fees for all physicians are less than commercial fees – otherwise MA plans would have

difficulty competing with TM – a differential between MA specialist fees and MA primary care physician

fees relative to TM may hold as well; indeed, White, et al. (2013) show this is the case in the 13 markets

they studied. 13
        The foregoing highlighted production efficiency and possibly input prices as sources of

difference in MA and TM margins and cost functions, but margin functions may also differ across HCC’s

because of differential coding intensity between MA and TM. Because payment under the MA risk

adjustment system relies on diagnoses coded on encounter forms, MA insurers have an incentive to

code all diagnoses. TM gives hospitals a similar coding incentive, since their payment also depends on

coded diagnoses. TM payment to physicians, however, does not depend on diagnosis, although

Medicare asks physicians to record diagnoses on the claims form. Presumably because physician

reimbursement is unaffected by coding intensity, physician claims in TM are incomplete with respect to

diagnosis, and coding intensity is greater in MA (Medicare Payment Advisory Commission 1998; Kronick

and Welch 2014; Geruso and Layton 2015). To adjust for greater coding intensity, CMS has made annual

downward adjustments in overall MA plan payment since 2010. 14 Before 2014, the period from which

our data come, these adjustments were uniform across HCC’s. 15


        MA plans may use various mechanisms to maximize coding. One is the use of Health Risk

Assessments carried out during a home health visit. Information from such Assessments can be used to

assign HCC’s. This mechanism is not used in TM. Another is to contact a physician to verify that a

beneficiary still has a specific diagnosis or may have a more complex version of the same diagnosis.


        CMS uses prospective risk adjustment, meaning that the diagnoses used to assign HCC’s are

those from the prior year. Not all MA patients with HCC’s assigned from Health Risk Assessments or

calls to physicians have medical claims in the prior year. Such patients would thus appear in the no-HCC

group in TM but would have an HCC coded in MA. If these MA patients who are assigned an HCC in MA

but not in TM are of lower cost in the current year than other patients in the HCC group to which they

are assigned, margins in that HCC group would increase. Such an increase, however, would be unrelated
to relative technical efficiency. We test the sensitivity of our results to omitting those with an HCC but

no medical claim in the prior year.


        Data


        As mentioned above, the data we analyze come from two national insurers and include the

revenues they received as well as the medical and drug cost they paid on behalf of their MA

membership for 2012 and 2013 for the 100 most frequent HCC’s or combination of HCC’s for each

insurer and year. The profit margins we calculate are gross margins that exclude the insurers’

administrative cost and profit. The denominator of the margin is thus simply the medical and drug cost

the plans paid. The numerator includes all revenue the plans received on behalf of an individual

enrollee, including the plans’ bid, any premium the enrollee paid for the medical or the drug plan, and

any risk adjustment revenue less medical and drug cost. 16 The first two elements of the revenue are the

same for each enrollee in a county. As a result, the variation in margins across HCC’s that we observe is

dominated by two elements: the relative weight for that HCC in the risk adjustment scheme, which is

approximately proportional to TM spending for that HCC, and the MA insurer’s medical and drug cost

for that HCC. 17 Thus, HCC’s with higher margins could indicate greater technical efficiency in MA relative

to TM. We assigned HCC’s using the v12 model, which was in effect in 2012 and 2013.


        MA enrollees may be individual or group, the latter coming from an employer with retiree

health benefits where MA is available to all qualified retirees from that employer. In the case of group

enrollees, drug cost and revenue are not always available because the employer may contract with

another insurer or a pharmacy benefit manager for the drug benefit. Our main results therefore rely on

only individual MA members, who constitute the large majority of the sample (and the large majority of

all MA enrollees). For the individual members we include all medical and drug revenue and cost. In an

appendix we show results including group members; these are shown with just medical costs for the
entire sample (individual plus group) and also for medical and drug costs for the subset of members for

whom we have drug cost. The inclusion of group MA members does not change our conclusions.


          The data we have do not include enrollment dates, so persons in our sample may participate for

only part of a year or for a full year. Thus, we effectively assume persons enrolled for part of a year are

distributed at random across HCC’s. Any bias from violations of this assumption should be small given

the large persistence of enrollment from year to year described above. 18 We did, however, exclude the

0.2% of persons who switched plans within the same insurer within a year. 19 We also excluded MA

beneficiaries who were under 66 (9% in our sample), who are largely the disabled, as well as

institutionalized beneficiaries (1%) because selection mechanisms and cost functions may differ for

those groups. We also excluded new Medicare enrollees (4%), because HCC’s are not available for them

(prior year claims are lacking) and therefore CMS uses only demographic variables to risk adjust

payment for them.


          Statistical Methods


          We began by testing for the degree of service-level HCC selection. To do so we compared the

distribution of MA enrollees across HCC’s or combinations of HCC’s with the distribution of TM enrollees

across the same HCC’s or combination of HCC’s. 20 We corrected for the geographic distribution

differences between MA and TM enrollment using inverse probability weights applied at the age,

gender, and Hospital Referral Region (HRR) level; that is, we weighted the proportion of the MA sample

in HCCi to resemble the age, gender, and geographic distribution of the TM sample using the weight

[∑𝑖𝑖 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 / ∑𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ]/[∑𝑖𝑖 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 / ∑𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ], where i indexes the HCC, j indexes the

beneficiary, k indexes the HRR, m indexes age, and n indexes gender.
         We then turned to estimating margins by HCC and first determined the similarity of margins

across the two insurers and two years. To do so we computed a correlation matrix of the margins for

the two firms and two years. 21


         To gain precision at the HCC level our next step was to pool the data from both plans and years

and estimate margins and their associated standard errors for each HCC or combination of HCC’s.

Margins at the individual level, however, are very skewed because some individuals in HCC’s with high

reimbursement have little spending in a year. As a result, estimated standard errors were large, even

with substantial trimming. Consequently, we proceeded indirectly by first estimating cost for each HCC

or combination of HCC’s and then using predicted cost to estimate a margin. More specifically, we

estimated adjusted cost from a mixed model with a random effect for each HCC or combination of

HCC’s:


                 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝛽𝛽 + 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖 + 𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖        (1)


where 𝐶𝐶𝑜𝑜𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the cost for the jth individual with the ith HCC or combination of HCC’s, 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖 is a random

variance component, and 𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is a randomly distributed error term; 𝑢𝑢 and 𝑒𝑒 are assumed to be

distributed N(0, σu2) and N(0, σe2), respectively, and uncorrelated with each other. The 𝑋𝑋 vector includes

indicator variables for age (in 5 year bins with a top group of 85+), gender, age*gender, the original

reason for Medicare eligibility (disability, end stage renal disease, or age), Medicaid status, and indicator

variables for Hospital Referral Region (HRR), year, and insurer.


         We next calculated a predicted cost for each HCC or combination of HCC’s as 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝛽𝛽̂ + 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖 , where

𝛽𝛽̂ is the estimate of 𝛽𝛽 and then calculated an adjusted margin for HCCi as:


                    1         𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅
                 � � [∑𝑗𝑗 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 − 1]         (2)
                   𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑖                                 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖
where 𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑖 is the number of beneficiaries in HCCi.


Standard errors for margins calculated using equations (1) and (2) were bootstrapped using 100

replications of the process just described; that is, we re-estimated equation (1) 100 times and used the

results to calculate (2). Because we control for geography at the level of the HRR, our method of

estimation suppresses across-county variation in revenue within HRR, but that should be modest

relative to the variation at the individual level in medical and drug cost in the denominator.

As a result, our estimated standard errors have a downward bias that is probably small.


        The HCC model that CMS uses for risk adjustment is mainly additive in disease groups or HCC’s

with few HCC*HCC interactions (Pope, et al. 2004). In Newhouse, et al. (2013) we found that margins

varied with the number of HCC’s. This could stem from too few disease-disease interaction terms in the

CMS-HCC model, from efficiency differences as the number of HCC’s increases, or from differential

coding intensity across HCC’s. We have repeated that test with these newer data.


        As mentioned above, to test for the importance of coding we exploit MA plans’ ability to code

diagnoses that are ascertained on Health Risk Assessments (HRA’s) during home health visits. MedPAC

has raised concern about diagnoses found in HRA’s that were not followed up by any physician claim

(Medicare Payment Advisory Commission 2016). Because the HCC’s established by such visits are

thought to be an important source of the additional coding intensity in MA, we compare margins using

all the claims with those computed by excluding beneficiaries with an HCC code in 2012 but no medical

claim in 2011 and similarly for the pair of years 2012 and 2013. For this group we infer the HCC code in

2012 came from an in-home visit in 2011 and similarly for 2013 and 2012. We can therefore test the

robustness of our results to omitting this group.
        In Appendix A we describe another test of coding effects that we carried out using results from

Kronick and Welch (2014). The results of that test, however, left us unable to distinguish coding effects

from production efficiencies.


        Results


        Figure 1 shows differences in the distributions of MA and TM beneficiaries across HCC’s and

combinations of HCC’s. Although not shown in Figure 1 to avoid compressing the scale, by far the

largest difference between the two distributions is the group with no coded HCC; 65 percent of the TM

group has no coded HCC but only 52 percent of the MA group has no coded HCC, consistent with more

intensive coding in MA (Kronick and Welch 2014).


        As one can see in Figure 1, among coded HCC’s the absolute differences in percentage shares

are small. Other than the 13 percentage point difference in the no coded HCC group, a majority of

remaining differences are less than 0.1 percentage point and almost 90 percent are less than 0.25

percentage points (Table 1).


        We now turn to profit margins at the HCC level. Table 2 shows the correlation matrix of

unadjusted margins for each insurer-year, weighted by the proportion of spending in each HCC or

combination of HCC’s. The n shown is the number of common HCC’s for that pair of insurer-years.

Within year, the correlation coefficients between the two firms are 0.29 in 2012 and 0.48 in 2013 for the

87 and 91 HCC’s or combination of HCC’s that are common across the two insurers in those years,

respectively. Within insurer the correlation coefficients are 0.67 and 0.73 across the two years. The

larger correlations within insurer reflect the stability of enrollees in each plan over time, but that all the

correlations are well below 1.0 indicates the magnitude of random error from the right-skewness of

health care spending. To improve precision, the remainder of our results pool across the two insurers

and two years.
        Appendix Table B1 gives margins for all 117 HCC’s or combinations of HCC’s in our data, but to

simplify presentation for the reader Table 3 gives the margins (minus an arbitrary constant) for just the

HCC’s with the ten largest and ten smallest margins. 22 Margins with 95% confidence intervals that

exclude zero are bolded.


        Like the results in Newhouse, et al. (2013), the margins of the various HCC’s or combination of

HCC’s span a wide range.23 The range of the unadjusted (raw) margins is 166 percentage points from

the most profitable HCC, disorders of immunity, to the least profitable, a combination of congestive

heart failure with comorbidities of angina pectoris/old myocardial infarction, heart arrhythmias, and

vascular disease. Using the adjusted margins, the range is somewhat less but still large, 129 percentage

points. Overall, the adjustments do not much change the estimated margins; the Pearson correlation

coefficient between the adjusted and unadjusted margins is 0.98. The modest effect of the adjustments

implies the standard errors of the adjusted margins are mainly driven by the error variance rather than

the variance explained by the covariates in the 𝑋𝑋 vector.


        The results shown in Table 3 and Appendix Table B1 are for the insurers’ individual MA business.

In Appendix Table B2 we show the results including their group MA business, with drug claims for that

portion of the group business for which there are data and with medical claims only for the entire

sample. 24 Our conclusions are not materially changed by including data from the group MA plans.


        We found in Newhouse, et al. (2013) that diabetes, chronic heart failure (CHF), and chronic

obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diseases capable of medical management and typically managed

by PCP’s, had notably higher margins than diseases typically managed by specialists such as cancer and

rheumatoid arthritis. 25 In the earlier paper we simply assumed the type of physician that managed the

various conditions; Table 4 confirms that the earlier assumption about which type of physician managed

which disease was correct. Using the 20% random sample of TM Part B, it shows the percent of all Part
B charges and the percent of all outpatient charges generated by primary care providers in 2012 and

2013 for six diagnoses. 26 We have added inflammatory bowel disease to the group of diseases typically

managed by specialists used in the earlier paper; this disease was not in the earlier sample of 48 HCC’s.

One can reject the hypothesis of no difference between the proportion of the charges allowed from

PCP’s for each of the three diseases usually managed by primary care providers and each of the three

managed by specialists at the 0.001 level.


        That the three diseases typically managed by PCP’s and capable of medical management have

higher margins than those commonly managed by specialists can be seen in Table 5, which summarizes

the results in Appendix Table B1 for the diseases shown in Table 4. For example, of the 117 HCC’s or

combinations of HCC’s shown in Appendix Table B1, 39 involve diabetes. Table 5 shows that those 39

diabetes HCC’s, when weighted by their frequency of occurrence, are 7.3 percentage points (= -0.268 - (-

0.341)) more profitable than the weighted average of all HCC’s. 27 The 21 HCC’s that involve COPD are

6.1 percentage points more profitable than the weighted average, and the 19 that involve CHF are 13.9

percentage points more profitable. As in the earlier work, the 17 various cancer HCC’s as well as

rheumatoid arthritis are less profitable than average, 6 and 5 percentage points respectively.

Inflammatory bowel disease is much less profitable than average.


        Taken as a group, the three diseases managed by PCP’s and capable of medical management

have a 13.7 percentage point higher profit margins than the group of three diseases commonly

managed by specialists (Table 6).


        In the earlier study the one acute disease in the sample of 48 HCC’s, unstable angina and other

ischemic heart disease, was the least profitable. The current sample has two acute conditions, unstable

angina and other acute ischemic heart disease and hip fracture/dislocation. The point estimates of their

margins show they are both less profitable than average, 2 and 16 percentage points respectively, but
those differences do not statistically differ from the overall average (Table 5). Interestingly, given the

well-known results of Frank, Glazer, and McGuire showing incentives for service-level selection against

mental health services in a Medicaid population (Frank, et al. 2000), the five HCC combinations involving

Major Depressive, Bipolar, and Paranoid Disorders are among the most profitable conditions, 17

percentage points more than average (p = 0.06).


        MA plans do appear to achieve savings by reducing spending on post-acute care. Table 7 shows

TM diagnoses with greater proportions of spending on post-acute care have higher margins in MA.


        As discussed above, one cannot sign the relationship between the margin and an HCC share.

Empirically, however, we found no association between the MA share and the margin. When we

regressed the difference between the MA and TM share in an HCC or combination of HCC’s on the

margin for that HCC or combination of HCC’s, the estimated effect size is effectively zero and is not

significant at the 5% level (Table 8). More specifically, a 1 percentage point increase in the margin in a

given HCC is estimated to result in only a 0.0043 percentage point increase in the MA share, with the

limits of the 95 percent confidence interval equal to -0.006 and +0.014 percentage points.


      Our earlier results suggested that margins were higher on those with fewer comorbidities. The

current results show the opposite; margins rise with the number of comorbidities and by a substantial

amount (Table 9). This result could stem from having data from an additional plan. It is consistent both

with MA production efficiencies among those with more comorbidities (though any such efficiencies did

not appear in the earlier data) and also with more intensive coding in MA.


        Table 10 shows results when deleting the 5 percent of MA beneficiaries with HCC’s in the

following year but with no medical claim in the prior calendar year. 28 Comparing Tables 5 and 10, one

can see that margins for diabetes, COPF, CHF, cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, and rheumatoid

arthritis change only by around a percentage point. 29 The point estimate of the overall weighted margin
falls 1.1 percentage points, which is the expected direction if the Health Risk Assessments are profitable,

but the change is within sampling error.


                                                     Discussion


        We reject the hypothesis that the distribution of beneficiaries across HCC’s or combination of

HCC’s is the same between MA and TM. But by far the largest difference in the two distributions in

absolute terms is the 13 percentage point greater proportion of MA beneficiaries with an HCC code; the

difference in shares among those with a coded HCC are small, with close to 90 percent of them less than

0.25 percentage points and the largest 0.70 percentage points. The larger proportion with an HCC code

in MA almost certainly reflects greater coding intensity, and the modest differences in shares among

those with specific HCC codes is consistent with little service-level selection.


        We have shown that our earlier result of differences in average profitability across HCC’s is not

attributable to sampling error. Even allowing for sampling error, substantial differences in margins

across various HCC’s or combinations of HCC’s remain. Although intuitively it may seem as if high

margins should motivate plans to engage in service-level selection efforts, we have shown that the

relationship between margins and the relative share of MA and TM enrollees in an HCC cannot be signed

without additional assumptions since the observed profit margin in an HCC is an average and incentives

for selection depend on conditions at the margin. Empirically there appears to be little relationship

between profit margins and shares.


           We replicated a result from the earlier data that common chronic diseases that are typically

 managed by PCP’s such as diabetes, COPD, and CHF are more profitable in MA than chronic conditions

typically managed by specialists such as cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel diseases.

This pattern is suggestive of production efficiencies in MA in diabetes, COPD, and CHF relative to cancer,

rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease, although we cannot rule out other explanations.
Furthermore, the differences in margins among these six conditions are not much affected by excluding

claims from beneficiaries who had an HCC established through an in-home Health Risk Appraisal but had

no subsequent medical claim. We also showed that HCC’s with a higher proportion of spending on post-

      acute care in TM have higher margins in MA, consistent with efficiency from better medical

  management in MA or with more favorable selection in those HCCs. Further progress on assessing

relative production efficiencies across HCC’s is likely to require more detailed clinical data. Finally, that

20 percent of MA beneficiaries had an HCC code from an in home visit and no subsequent medical claim

 indicates that subsequent research comparing MA and TM that uses HCC codes or risk scores derived

                from claims data needs to consider potential biases from coding effects.

*The MA distribution has been reweighted using inverse probability weights to reflect the age, gender, and
geographic distribution of the TM sample. More specifically the weight for a TM or MA beneficiary i in HCC j in
HRR k in age group m (65-69,70-74,75-79,80+) and gender group n is: [∑𝑖𝑖 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 / ∑𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ]/

*This analysis used the 20% Part B Medicare carrier office and outpatient hospital claims files with a place
of service code of 11 or 22. Primary care providers have specialty codes of internal medicine, family
medicine, general practice, and geriatrics. Specialty providers are all non-primary care physician
specialties; we excluded allied health providers such as nurse practitioners and physician assistants.

*Post-Acute Care is defined as the proportion of all TM Parts A and B charges that are from Skilled Nursing
Facilities, home health, Inpatient Rehabilitation Facilities, and Long-Term Care Hospitals. These results are
weighted by the number of beneficiaries in the HCC. This relationship is robust if the observations are not
weighted and also if beneficiaries with an HCC but no medical claim are deleted from the sample.

1
  The availability of in-network specialists in one type of disease, for example, might be greater, the more
attractive are patients with that type of disease to the insurer.
2
   In practice these policy tools are imperfect; for example, the ACA’s exchange contracts for the under 65 have
placed drugs used by some disfavored classes of patients on a high tier.
3
  Medicare does not use reinsurance except in Part D. Medicare Part A is free to individuals who qualify for Social
Security benefits. Although Parts B and D require a premium, they are sufficiently subsidized that selection into
the insured pool (as opposed to not purchasing Parts B and D) is not a serious problem.
4
  The initial lock-in period in 2006 was the last six months of the calendar year, but that has now been extended to
the last 10.5 months of the year. In commercial insurance the lock-in period is almost always a calendar year.
5
  These findings are not without controversy. (Brown, et al. 2014) find that diagnosis-based risk adjustment
increased within-HCC selection, but Newhouse et al. (2015) show that Brown, et al.’s findings do not hold up in a
larger sample with additional years and that the within-HCC degree of selection did not appreciably change from
before to after the reforms.
6
  The health services research literature starting with Luft (1981) has typically assumed a uniformly lower cost of
treatment in health maintenance organizations or empirically shown lower utilization in the aggregate, for
example, a lower rate of inpatient admissions.
7
  In addition to diagnoses, the characteristics accounted for are age, sex, Medicaid status, institutional status, and
original reason for Medicare eligibility (age, disability, end stage renal disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), plus a
small number of interactions. Unlike risk adjustment in the exchanges for the under 65, which is zero-sum among
participating insurers, risk adjustment in Medicare is normed on Traditional Medicare (Newhouse 2017).
8
  One of the two insurers here is the same as in the earlier paper. In the earlier work we also obtained margin data
from a second insurer for 2006 and 2007, but that insurer calculated its margins with its administrative cost
allocated to individual HCC’s. Thus, the margins of the two insurers were not directly comparable although they
were positively correlated (r = 0.39, p < 0.003), probably because 80-85 percent of the insurer’s costs are medical.
Most administrative costs are joint across HCC’s and many are also joint across other lines of business, so any
allocation of those costs to HCC’s introduces an arbitrary element into the margin.
9
  Of the 10 percent that switch, 8 percent switch to another MA plan and 2 percent switch to TM. Some switches
are involuntary because the MA plan withdrew from the local market.
10
   For a discussion of low-value services see (Schwartz, et al. 2014).
11
   Specialty drugs represent a variant of the market power argument, because the pharmaceutical firm has market
power for single source drugs. For diseases or indications in which a specialty drug is both the dominant treatment
choice and a substantial share of the cost of treatment, MA plans would have little competitive advantage; in
contrast, for indications in which there is a large price range in treatment substitutes or for which appropriate
treatments for many patients could involve substitution of less expensive drugs, MA plans could have cost
advantages when compared to TM. We tested whether margins were higher in HCC’s with greater use of Part B
drugs, which are often single source and expensive, but found no relationship.
12
   There are 47 National Cancer Institute designated comprehensive cancer hospitals. Examples include M.D.
Anderson and Memorial Sloan-Kettering. A complete list can be found at https://www.cancer.gov/research/nci-
role/cancer-centers .
13
   Commercial fees are about 25 percent above TM fees (Medicare Payment Advisory Commission 2011).
14
   Cumulatively the adjustments have been substantial; 3.41% in 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013, 4.91% in 2014 and
2015, 5.41% in 2016, and 5.66% in 2017 (Medicare Payment Advisory Commission 2016).
15
   In 2014 CMS introduced a new set of HCC weights that adjusted down some weights in HCC’s that it suspected
were being more aggressively coded (Medicare Payment Advisory Commission 2016).
16
   The calculated margin is thus the reciprocal of the Medical Loss Ratio at the HCC level.
17
   There is also some variation from the different geographical distribution of MA enrollees by HCC relative to TM
enrollees. We have corrected for this by controlling for the Hospital Referral Region. We also ignore any variation
in reinsurance payments from Part D. These are not separately identified in the data, but should be small relative
to other elements of across-HCC variation. Note many cancer drugs are covered under Part B where there is no
reinsurance.
18
   Deaths are not random across HCC’s, but the distribution of deaths across HCC’s in MA should approximate the
distribution of deaths across HCC’s in TM, and so this lack of randomness should not much affect our results.
Spending of decedents is included for the part of the year they were alive.
19
   These were persons with two plan identification numbers.
20
   For this purpose we only used TM beneficiaries enrolled in both Parts A and B because Medicare Advantage
enrollees are required to enroll in both Parts A and B.
21
   We show Pearson correlation coefficients below; Spearman correlation coefficients are very similar.
22
   Although we had data on the 100 most frequent HCC’s or combination of HCC’s for each insurer-year, these
HCC’s and combinations were not the same across insurers or years, so there are 117 unique HCC’s or combination
of HCC’s across the four insurer-years.
23
   The data in Table 2 are averages of ratios whereas the data in Newhouse (2013) were ratios of averages.
Although these quantities will in general differ, the similar qualitative results are reassuring.
24
   The margins with drug claims are always lower than with medical claims only because the revenue for the Part D
drug plan is included in revenue in both columns in Table B2.
25
   In Newhouse (2013) we treated multiple sclerosis as a disease typically managed by specialists that it is not in
the top 100 HCC’s in the current sample if we restrict the sample to only individual MA business. It does appear
when we add the group business to the sample (Appendix Table B2). In that sample using the adjusted results it is
among the ten most negative margin HCC’s.
26
   The percentages are lower for all outpatient settings since specialists are more often providing inpatient care.
27
   We calculate average margins in this fashion rather than a regression of beneficiary spending on a main effect
only model for two reasons. First, any selection by diagnosis has to be done at the individual level where
diagnoses are bundled. Second, we do not wish to assume no interactions among comorbidities.
28
   The proportion of beneficiaries with an HCC but no medical claim in the subsequent year varied by HCC, from 0%
to 20%.
29
   We subtracted the same constant from Tables 3 and 6.
