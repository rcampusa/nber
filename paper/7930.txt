Introduction

        The High-Tech sector in Israel has turned in the course of the last decade into a
striking economic success story, both by local and by international standards. In fact,
Israel stands as one of the most prolific innovating economies, and as one of the few
‚ÄúSilicon Valley‚Äù types of technology centers in the world. There is no doubt that
Government policy was key to the emergence and early success of the sector, a policy
embedded for the most part in the programs and budgetary resources of the Office of the
Chief Scientist (OCS) at the Ministry of Industry and Trade. However, the very success
of the sector and its relentless dynamism call for the periodic revision and reexamination
of those policies. Moreover, the policy impasse of the late 1990s (due to tight government
funding at a time of growing demand for R&D grants) brought to the surface basic
tensions that were built into the policies, and that could no longer be ignored.


        Interest in R&D Policy as an area of research has experienced recently a marked
upsurge within mainstream economics (see for example Klette, Moan and Griliches,
1999, David and Hall, 2000, Jones and Williams, 1998, etc.). This probably reflects the
perception that technical advances in Information Technologies (IT) and related areas
have had a noticeable and sustained impact on productivity growth in recent years
(contrary to the previous uneasiness in that respect vividly articulated in ‚ÄúSolow‚Äôs
Paradox‚Äù). Since R&D is driving the relentless flow of innovations that fuel IT and the
‚ÄúNew Economy‚Äù, policies that affect R&D have thus become an attractive field of
inquiry. Moreover, advanced economies other than the US, and in particular European
countries, see it as a major goal to partake in the processes associated with the current
wave of innovations, and therefore their interest in R&D Policy is immediate and
pragmatic.    So it is for Israel, where early recognition that its comparative advantage
resides in its highly skilled labor and world-class academic resources (contrasted to its
relatively poor endowment in natural resources) led the Government to actively promote
commercial R&D for the past three decades.


        The main goal of this paper is to provide the basic ingredients for the
understanding of R&D policy in Israel, and to critically assess it in light of recent


                                                 3
developments. It consists of a descriptive first part, whereby the various programs of the
OCS are laid out in some detail, and a second chapter where we examine the outstanding
policy issues. Following a brief account of the functioning and history of the OCS, we
review in section I.2 the OCS main programs, including their mission, mode of operation,
budget and composition. Section I.2.1 describes the standard R&D Grants Program,
followed by the ‚ÄúMagnet‚Äù Program, and the Incubators Program; section I.2.4 touches on
International Cooperation, including the BIRD Program. Section I.3 presents quantitative
indicators of OCS activities over time, including budgets and projects by size of firms,
followed in section I.4 by a review of econometric studies on the contribution of the
OCS, and an overview of the rise of the High-Tech sector in Israel with the aid patent
data.

        Part II opens with a discussion of allocation schemes for the regular OCS Grants
Program in view of a rigid budget constraint, followed by an examination of possible
ways of departing from the principle of ‚Äúneutrality‚Äù. Section II.2 deals with a host of
related issues, such as the payback system, the conditionality of production in Israel, and
the need for ongoing economic assessment of the various programs. Section II.3 attempts
to assess the ‚ÄúMagnet‚Äù program for the support of consortia engaged in generic R&D,
and raises the question of the desirability of supporting it versus the regular commercial
R&D projects. In section II.4 we review the difficulties in setting a policy target for R&D
spending, and lastly we ask in section II.5 whether government policy should be aimed
also at the supply side (of the market for R&D personnel), thus shifting away from the
present exclusive focus on the demand side.


        It should be emphasized once again that this paper is meant to be first and
foremost a descriptive account of ongoing R&D government programs in Israel, with the
goal of providing a suitable framework for a much needed discussion on outstanding
policy issues. Hopefully, these issues are of relevance not just for Israel but also for any
economy contemplating active government involvement in R&D.

     Government Support for Industrial R&D in Israel: An Overview1

I. 1 Background
         The beginning of government support for industrial (civilian) R&D in Israel dates
back to 1968: a government commission, headed by Prof. Kachalsky, recommended the
creation of the Office of the Chief Scientist (OCS) at the Ministry of Industry and
Commerce, with the mandate to subsidize commercial R&D projects undertaken by
private firms. Support was confined until then to National R&D Labs, and to academic
R&D, in addition to the weighty resources that were devoted to defense-related R&D and
to agricultural research. And indeed, industrial R&D rose rapidly following the
establishment of the OCS. Between 1969 and 1987 industrial R&D expenditures grew at
14% per year, and High-Tech exports grew from a mere $422 million in 1969 (in 1987
dollars), to $3,316 million in 1987 (Toren, 1990).


         The next key development was the passing of the ‚ÄúLaw for the Encouragement of
Industrial R&D‚Äù in 1985 (it has been revised several times since). This is the main piece
of legislation that has defined the parameters of government policy towards industrial
R&D ever since. The stated goals of the legislation, to be implemented by the OCS, are to
develop science-based, export-oriented industries, which will promote employment and
improve the balance of payments.            In order to do this, the legislation was supposed to
provide the means to expand and exploit the country‚Äôs technological and scientific
infrastructure, and leverage its high-skilled human resources. The 1985 Law may soon
undergo a significant revision, in view of the changes undergone by the High-Tech sector
in the course of the last decade, and the budgetary restraint of the late 1990s that has
resulted in excess demand for R&D grants under the present system.


         At the heart of the law is a program of financial incentives. Companies ‚Äì whether
big corporations or small startups ‚Äì which meet certain eligibility criteria, are entitled to

1
  As the title indicates, we confine ourselves to civilian, industrial R&D. Both defense R&D and academic
R&D have played all along a pivotal role in Israel‚Äôs overall research enterprise, and fueled to some extent
the growth of High Tech via a variety of spillovers, but these are beyond the scope of this paper.


                                                     5
receive matching funds for the development of innovative, export-targeted products. The
OCS funds up to 50 percent of R&D expenses in established companies, and up to 66
percent for start-ups. The OCS supports and administers a wide range of additional
programs, the main ones being: (i) ‚ÄúMagnet‚Äù, a program to encourage pre-competitive
generic research conducted by consortia; (ii) a program of technological incubators; (iii)
various programs involving bilateral and multilateral international R&D collaboration.
We review these programs here in some detail. Other, relatively minor programs aimed at
specific stages along the innovation cycle or at particular segments in the progression
from an innovative idea to a full-fledged commercial enterprise are described in
Appendix 1. In section I.3 we present quantitative indicators of the various programs.


I.2 A Review of OCS Programs 2
I.2.1 Support for Standard R&D Programs
        This is by far the largest program, and administering it constitutes the main
activity of the OCS. The way it works is as follows. Qualifying firms submit grant
applications for specific R&D projects, these are reviewed by a Research Committee, and
if approved (about 70% are) the applicants receive a grant of up to 50% of the stated
R&D budget for the project. Successful projects (i.e. those leading to sales) are required
                                                                                                 3
                                                                                                     up to
the dollar-linked amount of the grant. Recipients of the R&D grants have to abide by the
following conditions: (1) the R&D project must be executed by the applicant firm itself;
(2) the product(s) that emerge from the R&D project must be manufactured in Israel; (3)
know-how acquired in the course of the R&D may not be transferred to third parties.4




2
  We draw for this section from a variety of material from the OCS (see Israel Ministry of Industry and
Trade, 1994, 1999a, 1999b and 1999c), as well as from personal involvement with the OCS, in particular
with the Magnet Program.
3
  Actually the original payback schedule was as follows: 3 % of revenues from sales of the products
developed for the first 3 years; 4% in the next three years, and 5% from the seventh year onwards. This
schedule has been revised a few times, and the Treasury has long been pressuring the OCS to increase these
percentages, and even impose interest payments.
4
  The Research Committee may grant exemptions to requirements (2) and (3), but as far as I have been able
to establish, this has rarely happened.


                                                    6
        The Research Committee, chaired by the Chief Scientist, is responsible for
defining the conditions for granting aid (within the confines of the 1985 Law), and for
reviewing the applications and selecting the recipients. The committee is staffed both by
qualified government officials and by public representatives, but it relies on (outside)
professional referees and advisers to review the applications. Decisions of the Research
Committee can be appealed before an Appeals Committee.


        Grants of (up to) 50% of the total R&D costs are given to projects that ‚Äúlead to
know-how, processes or systems for manufacturing a new product/process or
substantially improving existing ones.‚Äù5 Grants covering 30% of R&D costs are available
for projects leading to improvements in existing civilian products, and 20% for
improvements of military products. Start-up companies qualify for grants of up to 2/3 of
R&D costs, with a ceiling of $250,000 a year for two years. Products aimed at the
military (export) market qualify for grants of up to 30%.


        Israel has a long-standing policy of encouraging the development of an industrial
base in peripheral areas (away from the main urban centers), which is reflected also in the
R&D support programs. Thus, R&D projects performed in the preferential peripheral
areas (‚ÄúGrade A Development Areas‚Äù) are entitled to additional 10% grants: for civilian
projects that means grants of up to 60% (rather then 50% for the others), and military
projects are entitled to grants of up to 40% (rather than 30% for the others).


I.2.2 The ‚ÄúMagnet‚Äù Program
        Notwithstanding the rapid growth of the High-Tech sector in Israel from the late
1960‚Äôs onwards, it became clear by the early 1990s that the industrial landscape in Israel
was too fragmented, and Israeli industrial companies were too small to be able to
shoulder the escalating costs of developing new technologies in cutting edge fields.
Moreover, Israel boosted world-class research universities, but they operated largely in
isolation from surrounding industrial developments and needs, and hence the vast


5
 In the early 1990‚Äôs the 1985 Law was amended so as to place the software industry on an equal footing
with other industrial sectors, so that software development projects qualify for the same type of aid.


                                                    7
economic potential embedded both in the highly qualified academic manpower and in
university research remained largely untapped.6


         Against this background the OCS established in 1993 the ‚ÄúMagnet‚Äù Program7 , to
support the formation of consortia made of industrial firms and academic institutions in
order to develop generic, pre-competitive technologies.8 These consortia are entitled to
multi-year R&D support (usually 3 to 5 years), consisting of grants of 66% of the total
approved R&D budget, with no recoupment requirement. The consortia must be
comprised of the widest possible group of industrial members operating in the field,9
together with Israeli academic institutions doing research in scientific areas relevant to
the technological goals of the consortia.


         Mindful of possible conflict with anti-trust provisions, consortia members must
pledge to make the products or services resulting from the joint project available to any
interested local party, at prices that do not reflect the exercise of monopoly power.
Keeping with the mandate to encourage pre-competitive technologies, support to the
consortia ceases once the equivalent of the ‚Äúpilot plant stage‚Äù is reached. That is, the
additional R&D required for the actual commercialization of the products is not
supported by Magnet, but the member companies may then apply for regular grants from
the OCS.      Contrary to the regular OCS support to industrial R&D projects, the Magnet
program operates on a competitive basis, that is, it is open to any number of proposals for
the formation of new consortia, and it selects only those that merit support on the basis of
a ranking system.

         By the end of 1999 there were 18 consortia in operation, commanding a budget of
about $60 million, and four additional consortia in various stages of gestation. These



6
  Israeli universities have proved also to be highly capable of generating innovations having economic
potential (as manifested for example in the large number of US patents assigned to them ‚Äì see Trajtenberg
1999), but once again weak links with industry have prevented the extensive exploitation of such potential.
7
  ‚ÄúMagnet‚Äù is the acronym (in Hebrew) for ‚ÄúGeneric, Pre-Competitive Research‚Äù.
8
  Magnet supports also the integration of advanced technologies into industry via users‚Äô associations, but
that is a secondary activity.
9
  Participation is limited to Israeli-based companies, or Israeli subsidiaries of foreign companies.

electronics, biotechnology, and energy. Table 1 shows the complete list.


I.2.3 The Incubators Program10
         Technological       incubators      are    support      organizations      that    give     fledgling
entrepreneurs an opportunity to develop their innovative technological ideas and set up
new businesses in order to commercialize them. The program was introduced in the early
1990s, when immigration from the former Soviet Union had reached its peak. Many of
these immigrants were scientists and skilled professionals that came to Israel with highly
valuable human capital as well as with plenty of ideas for innovative products. However,
they were lacking in virtually all other dimensions required for commercial success, from
knowledge of the relevant languages (e.g. Hebrew and English) and of commercial
practices in western economies, to managerial skills and access to capital. Even though it
targeted new immigrants, the program is open to all.


         The goal of the incubators is thus to support novice entrepreneurs at the earliest
stage of technological entrepreneurship, and help them implement their ideas and form
new business ventures. The premise is that the technological incubator would
significantly enhance the entrepreneur‚Äôs prospects of raising further capital, finding
strategic partners, and emerging from the incubator with businesses that can stand on
their own. Of course, this initial stage is the riskiest, and certainly in the early 1990s there
were virtually no other sources of finance in Israel for such ventures. Since the mid-1990s
there has been a growing influx of venture capital, and hence it may well be that the
purely risk-sharing function undertaken by this program may be less critical at present
than what it was at its inception.


         Each incubator is structured so as to handle 10 ‚Äì 15 projects simultaneously, and
provides assistance in the following areas: determining the technological and marketing
applicability of the idea, drawing up an R&D plan and organizing the R&D team, raising


10
  In addition to the sources already mentioned, we drew material for this section from the internet site of
the program, www.incubators.org.il


                                                     10
capital and preparing for marketing, provision of secretarial and administrative services,
maintenance, procurements, accounting, and legal advice.11


         To qualify, projects must be aimed at developing an innovative idea with export
potential. The R&D team is to be made of 3-6 workers, and the stay at the incubator is of
up to two years. The expectation is that by the end of the period there would be a
prototype and an orderly business plan, and the project should be ready for further
commercial investment and/or the involvement of a strategic partner. The budget for each
project is of about $150,000 per year, for two years at most.12 As with the regular OCS
program, the ensuing products have to be manufactured in Israel, and if successful the
entrepreneur has to eventually repay the grant through ‚Äúroyalties‚Äù on sales.


         Since its inception in 1991 and up to end of 1998, the incubators have managed
close to 700 projects, of which about 200 were still running as of December 1998 in 27
incubators across the country. Current projects employ about 900 professionals, 70% of
them recent immigrants, all with academic training and many with high degrees. Of the
500 ‚Äúgraduating‚Äù projects, the success rate was about 50%, i.e. half managed to continue
on their own, the remaining half were discontinued. About 200 projects (out of the
successful half) managed to attract additional investment, ranging from a mere $50K, to
several $ million. There are no pre-determined technological areas for the submission of
projects. The actual distribution of projects by fields has been as follows: Electronics
27%, Software 20%, Medical instrumentation 17%, Chemistry 27%, Miscellaneous 9%.


I.2.4 International Cooperation
         The relative advantage of Israel‚Äôs High-Tech sector manifests itself primarily in
its technological prowess in the R&D stages. However, Israeli High-Tech companies

11
   Each incubator is an autonomous not-for-profit organization. Day to day operations are run by a
professional (salaried) manager, and next to her operates a projects committee that selects and monitors the
projects. These committees are composed of professionals from industry and academia, e.g. corporate
executives, R&D managers, professors, etc. Committee members volunteer their time and expertise and do
not receive any financial compensation.
12
    The budget for the incubator‚Äôs administration is of $175,000 per year. This includes the incubator
manager's salary, administrative expenses, outlays for sorting and studying of ideas, and organizational
expenses for project commercialization and marketing.


                                                    11
suffer from serious difficulties in marketing abroad, primarily because of geographic
distance from the target markets, and their relatively small size. Thus, cooperation with
foreign companies active in the target markets is likely to increase the ability of Israeli
technology and products to penetrate global markets. In that spirit, the Israeli government
has signed in recent years a number of bilateral R&D cooperation agreements with
foreign governments. These are meant to encourage contacts between Israeli and foreign
companies leading to joint R&D, manufacturing and marketing. Foreign companies are
expected to benefit by gaining access to advanced Israeli technology, and they are also
likely to derive commercial advantages from Israel‚Äôs simultaneous free trade agreements
with the U.S. and the European Union (few countries enjoy both).


       Joint ventures between Israeli and foreign companies, authorized by the relevant
authorities in the respective countries, are entitled to aid from both governments
according to the regulations prevailing in each. Bilateral agreements exist already with a
number of countries, including the U.S., Canada, France, Holland and Spain; their
implementation is the responsibility of the Chief Scientist, assisted by ‚ÄúMATIMOP‚Äù
The Israeli Industry Center for R&D.


       The BIRD Program
       The Israel-U.S. Binational Industrial Research and Development Foundation was
founded in the early 1980s under a convention signed by both governments. Its objective
was to ‚Äúpromote and support joint, non-defense, industrial research and development
activities of mutual benefit to the (private sectors of the) two countries.‚Äù The Foundation
has an independent legal status and its main office is in Israel. Its Board of Governors is
comprised of representatives of the U.S. and Israeli governments.


       BIRD participates in the funding of joint R&D via ‚Äúconditional grants‚Äù amounting
to 50 percent of the project costs, up to a maximum of $1.5 million per project. If a
project succeeds, BIRD receives royalties ‚Äì a pre-tax expense to the payer ‚Äì up to a
maximum of 150 percent of the conditional grant. Only in cases where a project fails and
there are no sales are the companies exempted from repaying the grants. BIRD also helps



                                              12
Israeli or American companies identify partners in order to enable them to submit joint
R&D programs for funding by the Foundation.


I.3 Quantitative Indicators of OCS Support Programs
         Systematic data on the OCS are hard to obtain, and in fact there are virtually no
‚Äúofficial‚Äù statistics on the activities and budgets of the OCS since its creation in 1969.
The lack of data has been detrimental to the functioning of the OCS and has surely
impaired the formulation of R&D policy at all levels. The OCS has long been aware of
the problem, and efforts are being made to remedy it in a fundamental way. The data
presented here are based on reports supplied to us by the OCS in January 2000,13 but
there still remain question marks regarding some of the figures, and hence these should
be seen as tentative data, which require further scrutiny.


         The dollar figures in tables 2 - 4 are all in current dollars; in order to transform
them into constant dollars one would have to construct an appropriate R&D deflator, of
which the main component would be of course the wages of R&D personnel (see section
II.4.2 for a detailed discussion of such deflators in the Israeli context). Lacking at present
a reliable deflator, and rather than using ready-made but potentially misleading price
indices, we opt here to leave the figures in current dollars.14 Thus, all statements
henceforth implying comparisons of dollar figures across time need to be qualified, since
these figures are not really in the same units.


         Table 2 shows the OCS budget since 1988, as well as paybacks, and the amounts
allocated to the Magnet and Incubators program. Total R&D grants administered by the
OCS increased steeply since 1988 and up to the mid 1990s, then increased slightly until
1997, and have changed little since. Paybacks rose very fast throughout the whole
period,15 and in fact their weight in the OCS budget has increased dramatically from a
mere 7% in 1988 to 32% by the late 1990s. What this means is that about 1/3 of the


13
   The data comes from the office of Lidia Lazens of the OCS, and was supplied by Shai Goldberg.
14
   A common practice is to deflate just by the rate of inflation in the US, but such deflator is in fact
irrelevant for the case at hand.
15
   The projections for 2000 indicate that paybacks may have stabilized by now.


                                                       13
present OCS budget just constitutes ‚Äúrecycling‚Äù of funds within the High-Tech sector,
and not Government subsidy to R&D. The net subsidy is given in column 4 under ‚ÄúNet
Grants‚Äù: these peaked in 1995, and have since declined slightly (certainly more so in real
terms). Furthermore, if we subtract the funds allocated to the Magnet and the Incubators
programs, we can see that the net subsidy to the regular OCS Grants program has
declined very substantially since 1995 (by about 25% up to 1999, in nominal terms).


         Table 3 shows the number of firms applying to the OCS for grants, total as well as
first timers. Both peaked in 1994 and have declined substantially since. The decline
includes, quite surprisingly, also start-ups that applied for the first time.16 Given the rapid
growth in the overall number of startups throughout the economy,17 the decline in the
number of first-time startup applicants may well reflect a change in their funding
strategy, that is, more of them may prefer to rely on venture capital funds rather than on
the OCS (without ‚Äústrings attached‚Äù in terms of production in Israel or the eventual sale
of the firm to foreign corporations).18 It is worth noting that in the course of the 1990s a
total of 2,380 firms applied for support from the OCS for the first time. This is a large
number by any standard, and offers further indication of the prominent role that the OCS
has played in fostering the High-Tech sector.


         Tables 4 (a) ‚Äì (c) show the distribution of projects and grants by size of firms.19,20
The annual number of projects supported averaged 1,300 for the past 5 years, declining
from a high of 1,500 in 1995 to 1,200 in 1999.21 On the other hand the average $ amount
per project increased from $227,000 in 1995 to $368,000 in 1999 (in nominal terms).


16
   Start-ups are defined by the OCS as firms of up to 3 years of age.
17
   There are no official figures in that respect, but all indications are that startups have mushroomed in
Israel since the mid 1990s. In fact, a recent newspaper report based on the number of startups that hired the
services of accounting firms claimed that in 1999 alone 1,500 new startups were formed.
18
   This might also reflect a change in the technology mix of the newcomers, with more of them in Internet
applications that represent novel business models rather than novel technology, and hence that may not
qualify for support from the OCS.
19
   ‚ÄúLarge firms‚Äù are defined by the OCS as those with over $100 million in sales; startups refer to firms of
up to 3 years of age.
20
   In table 4 some dollar series are aggregated into 5-year totals: these sums obviously don‚Äôt mean much
since the figures are in nominal $, but may still be useful as ballparks to compare across firms of different
sizes.
21
   This figure refers to projects approved. In fact, the average number of projects applied for is about 1,800.

whereas that of small and medium firms increased a great deal. Large firms commanded
about 40% of grants (in $ terms) for most of the period, but their share of the budget
declined steeply in 1999, to 23%.22,23


I.4 The OCS and the Rise of the High-Tech Sector
        So far we have described the structure and programs of the OCS, and presented
quantitative indicators of its activities over time. The natural questions that one would
like to pose now are those related to the impact of the OCS, e.g. to what extent has the
OCS fulfilled the goals envision by the 1985 Law? What effect have the various OCS
programs had on the High-Tech sector and on the economy at large? And so forth. We
review first existing econometric studies, we then discuss some economic indicators
contrasting R&D-intensive sectors to traditional ones, and lastly we present an overview
of the rise of the High-Tech sector in Israel with the aid patent data.


I.4.1 Review of Econometric Studies
        The consensual view in Israel is that the OCS played indeed a key role in the
emergence and development of the High-Tech sector, a role that went beyond the mere
administration of grants. There have been various studies in Israel examining inter alia
the impact of R&D expenditures on productivity at the firm level (Bregman, Fuss and
Regev, 1991, Griliches and Regev, 1995, Bregman and Merom, 1998). They all find that
the returns to R&D have been high, and in particular significantly higher than
investments in physical capital. However, these studies do not address the effect of
government support per se.


        If one could assume that OCS grants brought about higher total R&D outlays (this
is commonly referred to as ‚Äúadditionality‚Äù), then the findings of high returns to R&D
would imply also positive returns to government support. Capital markets were extremely

22
   This was a conscious policy decision by the OCS, meant to cope with the excess demand for support in
view of the budget cap imposed by the Treasury.
23
   A report prepared for the OCS in 1999 claimed that large firms commanded 56% of the OCS budget
during the period 1985-94. If so there is a declining trend, beyond the one-time policy shift in 1999.
However, the figures are not strictly comparable, and hence we cannot assert this with certainty.


                                                   18
limited in Israel during the early stages of development of the High Tech sector in Israel
(i.e. in the 1970s and 1980s), and hence it is very unlikely that R&D grants supplied by
the OCS would have crowded out private R&D funds back then. Later on though internal
reform as well as international openness greatly increased the availability of funds to
industry, bringing back to the forefront the additionality issue, certainly for the 1990s.


        The basic conundrum posed by additionality is the obvious lack of counterfactuals
(i.e. ‚Äúwhat would the recipient firm have done had it not received an R&D subsidy?‚Äù),
which effectively means the lack of appropriate controls (i.e. data on non-recipients that
are otherwise similar to the recipients). Several recent papers have tried a variety of
approaches to deal with it (see for example Busom, 2000, and Wallsten, 2000), but the
jury is still out both on method and on ‚Äústylized facts.‚Äù24 Feldman and Kelley (2000)
come closest to having an appropriate control group: they followed both winners of ATP
grants, and applicants that failed to receive grants. Surveying both types of firms, they
find prima facie evidence of additionality, e.g. non-awardees tend not to pursue the
proposed projects by themselves, awardees are more successful in seeking additional
funding for the projects, etc.


        Lach (2000) carefully examines this issue for a sample of Israeli manufacturing
firms that performed R&D during the period 1991-95, and finds that the R&D subsidies
granted by the OCS in fact stimulated long-run company-financed R&D expenditures.
According to his estimates, an extra dollar of R&D subsidies increases long run
company-financed R&D by 41 cents (evaluating the effect at the mean of the data). Thus,
total R&D outlays increase at the margin by 1.41 dollars: the full amount of the subsidy,
plus the additional, induced effect of 41 cents. However, it is not clear to what extent
those results are robust, both to the choice of specification and of instruments; in fact, in
other specifications Lach finds little or no additionality. The problem resides mostly in
the paucity of the data (i.e. there are not many firms with any given set of characteristics



24
  David, Hall and Tool (1999) survey a body of recent empirical studies, but do not find robust patterns
that could be generalized. On the other hand, using a cross-country, macro economic model, Guellec and
Van Pottelsberghe (2000) find evidence of significant additionality effects for 17 OECD countries.


                                                    19
at any point in time that can serve as controls for those receiving subsidies), and in the
difficulty in finding appropriate instruments.


        Taking a different track, Griliches and Regev (1999) examine whether the source
of R&D funds per se (private vs. OCS grants) makes a difference on productivity (once
again in a panel of firms), regardless of additionality. They find that it does: government-
funded R&D appears to be significantly more productive than privately- financed R&D,
by a surprisingly large margin. The reason may be rooted in the ability of the OCS to
‚Äúpick winners‚Äù, and/or in the fact that the very process of applying for grants may compel
firms to self-select projects, use more structured pre-assessment and planning techniques,
etc.   Finally, an unpublished study commissioned by the OCS itself examined the
contribution of OCS grants to sales, exports, and the like, relying on detailed data from
the OCS and on an extensive survey of firms (Michlol, 1999). The study finds very high
‚Äúmultipliers‚Äù per dollar of OCS support, higher for small firms than for large ones;
however, the study is careful to point out to its limitations, particularly given the lack of a
suitable control group.


        The evidence thus far available from these studies provide then econometric
support, albeit limited, to the presumption that OCS grants have had a positive and
significant impact on productivity in R&D-intensive sectors, and through them on the
economy as a whole. Still, there is a long way to go in that respect, if only because a
major ingredient of the rationale for government support to R&D, namely spillovers, has
not been investigated at all. Beyond the aforementioned studies, we present now some
evidence on the development of the High-Tech sector itself, with the implicit
understanding that the OCS was one of the main drivers behind the raise of this sector.
We do that in two ways: first, we briefly recount reports from the Bank of Israel on the
performance of technological advanced sectors vis a vis traditional ones; second, we
present an overall view of innovation in Israel, relying on comprehensive and highly
detailed information on Israeli patenting in the US.

I.4.2 Aggregate Sectorial Indicators 25
           Responding to the rapid changes in the composition of industry, and in particular
the raise of the High-Tech sector, the Research Department of the Bank of Israel
introduced in the mid 1990s a new classification of the manufacturing sector: it was
divided into ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù, ‚Äútraditional‚Äù and ‚Äúmixed‚Äù sectors, according to the quality and
composition of the labor force (e.g. the percentage of scientists and engineers), the
quality of the capital stock, and the relative size of the R&D stock.26 Table 5 presents
selected indicators according to this classification.


           The advanced sectors outperformed the two other categories in virtually all
dimensions during the reported period (1995 ‚Äì 98). The differences between them
increased substantially in 1997 and 1998, a period characterized by a rather severe
recession. During those years the advanced sectors grew at a rate of 6% per year, whereas
the others remained stagnant or declined. Similarly, exports from advanced sectors grew
at a stunning 18.5% per year, whereas the mixed sectors exhibited an anemic 3% growth,
and the traditional sectors declined 1.4%. Thus, it is clear that Israeli manufacturing is
shifting away from traditional industries and into technological advanced, export oriented
sectors.




25
   See also Israel CBS (1999a) for further detailed statistics on ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù versus traditional sectors.
26
   Thus the advanced sectors include for example electronics and electrical, the mixed sectors construction -
related industries, and the traditional ones textiles and apparel.

I.4.3 Innovation in Israel: Patent Indicators 27
         Patent-based statistics are often used as indicators of innovative activity. Indeed,
their very wide coverage, long time series and richness of detail make them a unique and
compelling data source for the study of technical change. There are also limitations: not
all innovations are patented, both because of failure to meet patenting requirements, and
because of strategic considerations. We present in this section an overview of innovation
in Israel based on all patents awarded to Israeli inventors in the US, during the period
1968 - 97 (over 7,000 patents), as well as patents of comparison countries. Given that the
High-Tech sector in Israel is overwhelmingly export-oriented, and that the US is a prime
destination for those exports, there is reason to believe that Israeli patents issued in the
US are representative of the main technological trends and patterns in Israel.


         Figure 1 shows the number of successful Israeli patent applications in the US over
time, starting in 1968. The growth in the annual number of patents has been very
impressive, starting from about 50 in the late sixties, to over 600 in the late 1990‚Äôs.
However, the process was not smooth, but rather it was characterized by big swings in
growth rates. Particularly striking are the two big jumps that occurred in the second half
of the period: from 1983 to 1987 the number of patents doubled, and then they doubled
again from 1991 to 1995.28 Figure 2 shows industrial R&D expenditures (in constant
1990 $) along with patents.29 There is clearly a (lagged) co-movement of the two series,
as manifested for example in the following simple Pearson correlations:30




27
   This section consists of excerpts from Trajtenberg (1999).
28
   The in-between ‚Äúflat‚Äù period of 1987-91 (which represents R&D activity done circa 1985-89)
presumably reflects the big macro adjustment and micro restructuring that followed the stabilization
program of 1985.
29
   The R&D figures are from Griliches and Regev (1999), table 1. Since these refer to industrial R&D, it
may be more appropriate to relate them to Israeli corporate patents than to t otal patents. In practice the two
patent series move pretty much in tandem, and hence the correlations with R&D of either series are
virtually the same.
30
   Patent applications reflect (successful) R&D conducted prior to the filing date, with lags varying by
sector. Thus, the number of patents in a particular year should be attributed to investments in R&D carried
out in the previous 1-2 years at least, and in some sectors further back.

            with Log(R&D)



        Thus, patents lead R&D by 2-3 years, and the correlation is stronger in rates (i.e.
when using logs) than in levels. Looking in more detail, there is a striking run up in R&D
from 1981 to 1986 (in particular, R&D expenditures more than doubled between 1980/81
and 1984/85), followed by the doubling of patents between 1983 and 1987. This is the
period that saw the emergence of the High-Tech sector, and that is well reflected in both
series. In 1986-88 we see a decline in the level of R&D spending, and the concomitant
flattening of patenting in 1987-91, and then again a sustained increase through the early-
mid nineties that anticipates the second big jump in patenting.


        Although we do not have ‚Äúofficial‚Äù figures for R&D grants from the OCS prior to
1988, available figures indicate that the behavior of the time series for grants move very
closely to that of total R&D industrial spending (see for example Griliches and Regev,
1999, table 6). In particular, from 1981 through 1986 OCS grants also doubled, they
flattened during 1986-88, and they grew fast again up to the mid 1990s (see Table 2 for
the latter). It is clear then that industrial R&D expenditures are closely linked (with a
reasonable lag) to patents, and so are R&D grants awarded by the OCS. Further research
is needed to unravel the joint dynamics.


        International Comparisons
        We resort to international comparisons in order to put in perspective the overall
level and trend over time in Israeli patenting. We do that with respect to 3 different
groups of countries: (1) The G7: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, UK and USA;




                                                25
(2) a ‚ÄúReference Group‚Äù: Finland, Ireland, New Zealand and Spain; 31 and (3) the ‚ÄúAsian
Tigers‚Äù: Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan.


         Figures 3-5 show the time patterns of patents per capita for Israel versus each of
the above groups of countries. We normalize the number of patents by population, simply
because this is a widely available and accurate statistic that provides a consistent scale
factor.32    Figure 3 reveals that Israel started virtually at the bottom of the G7 (together
with Italy), but by 1987 it had climbed ahead of Italy, UK, and France and was in par
with Canada. In the early-mid nineties it moved ahead of Canada and (the unified)
Germany, thus becoming 3d after the USA and Japan. Using civilian R&D as deflator for
these countries show a similar result. Thus, there is no question that Israel had surged
forward and placed itself in the forefront of technological advanced countries, at least in
terms of (normalized) numbers of patents.


         The comparison with the Reference Group reveals that the only country that is
‚Äúgame‚Äù is Finland, which has followed a pattern virtually identical to Israel. The other 3
countries are well behind, and have remained at the bottom without any significant
changes over time. As to the Asian Tigers, we can see immediately that Taiwan has
grown extremely rapidly since the early eighties, actually surpassing Israel as of 1997.
And indeed, Taiwan is widely regarded today as a High-Tech powerhouse, after being
associated with low-tech, imitative behavior for a long time. South Korea seems to be
embarked on a similar path. By contrast, Hong Kong and Singapore remain well behind.


         Comparisons based on normalized patent counts notwithstanding, many aspects
of the innovation process require a ‚Äúcritical mass‚Äù, and for those purposes it is the
absolute size of the innovative sector that counts, as proxied here by the (absolute)
number of patents. Israel has still a long way to go in those terms: it stands well below all

31
   The Reference Group was chosen according to their GDP per capita in the early 1990‚Äôs, that is, we chose
the 4 countries that had at that time a level of GDP per capita closest to that of Israel (in ppp terms). Notice
that, except for Spain, the other 3 countries in this group are very similar to Israel also in terms of
population.
32
   Another normalization of interest would be R&D expenditures, but except for the G7, the figures for the
other countries are far from satisfactory

of the G7 countries, and is about ¬º the size of Taiwan and South Korea. The question is
whether there are forces in the Israeli economy capable of keeping the momentum going
for the High-Tech sector, bringing it up to the size required and ensuring its long-term
viability. The stagnant budgets awarded in recent years to the OCS are not a good omen
in that respect.


        The Technological Composition of Israeli Patented Innovations
        The US Patent Office has developed over the years an elaborate classification
system by which it assigns patents to some 400 main patent classes, and over 150,000
patent subclasses. We have developed recently a new classification scheme, aggregating
these 400 patent classes into 6 main categories: Computers and Communications,
Electrical and Electronics, Drugs and Medicine, Chemical, Mechanical and Other. Figure
6 shows the shares of these categories over the decade 1985-94, for Israel and for the US.
Up until the early 1980s the picture was quite stable in the US: the shares of Mechanical
and Other were highest (over 25% each), whereas Drugs and Medicine and Computers
and Communications accounted just for a tiny fraction, up to 5% each. Starting in the
early 1980s this static picture starts to change: the 3 top fields decline, whereas the
bottom two surge forward, with Computers and Communications accounting by 1994 for
over 15% of all patents.


         The pattern for Israel is similar, except that the changes are more abrupt. The
most striking development is the surge of Computers and Communications from about
5% in the 1970‚Äôs (as in the US), to a full 25% by 1994 and beyond. Likewise, Drugs and
Medicine doubles its share from 10% to 20%. The flip side is the much more pronounced
decline in the traditional categories, with Chemicals exhibiting by far the sharpest drop,
from 40% at the beginning of the period, to less than 10% by 1996. The composition of
innovations has thus changed dramatically in Israel, and seemingly in a healthy way, in
the sense that they are in tandem with worldwide changes in technology, except that
Israel is experiencing them at an accelerated rate.

        Who owns, and who benefits from israeli patented innovations?
        The patent-based indicators mentioned so far suggest that Israel‚Äôs innovative
performance has been quite impressive. However, the question arises as to whether the
Israeli economy can take full advantage of the innovations generated by Israeli inventors,
in view of the composition of the patent assignees, i.e. of the owners of the intellectual
property rights to those innovations. In fact, just about half of all Israeli patents granted in
the last 30 years are owned by Israeli assignees (corporations, universities or
government): the rest belongs to private inventors (‚Äúunassigned‚Äù patents) or to foreign
assignees. This percentage is lower than most of the comparison countries, certainly
much lower than the corresponding figure for the G7 countries except Canada (local
assignees made 74% of patents in the US, 96% in Japan). The presumption is that (local)
economic gains from innovation are correlated with this figure, and furthermore, that they
are correlated with the percentage of patents owned by local corporations (just 35% in
Israel). The trend is encouraging though: the percentage of patents that belong to Israeli
corporations has been raising steadily, and stands now at close to 50%.


        The overall picture that emerges from these patent indicators is thus mixed: on the
one hand Israel exhibits a rapidly growing and vibrant innovative sector, that has
achieved an impressive international standing. On the other hand, the Israeli economy has
still a way to go in order to achieve ‚Äúcritical mass‚Äù and to realize the economic benefits
embedded in those innovations.

                       R&D Policy in Israel - A Reassessment33

           After having described the programs and basic ingredients of R&D policy in
Israel towards the industrial sector, we now undertake to examine the contents of such
policy. Unfortunately, the lack of rigorous empirical research in this area hampers the
formulation of sound, long term and well-grounded policies. Nevertheless, we shall
scrutinize the policies currently in place and their implementation mechanisms, and
evaluate proposals for changes in them that are called forth by recent developments. This
should be seen just as an opening salvo, aimed primarily at fostering public debate in this
area (see also Teubal, 1999, who lays out a detailed proposal for an R&D strategy for
Israel).


           First, we look at the system by which grants are allocated: with the recent
imposition of a rigid budget constraint on the OCS, the present system is basically
untenable, and hence we examine various alternatives that will incorporate this new
reality. Second, we examine a series of policy issues that go beyond the allocation of
funds: the payback system, the conditionality on production in Israel, etc. Third, we look
in detail into the Magnet program, and the rationale for supporting it versus the regular
OCS grants. Forth, we review the difficulties in setting a policy target for R&D spending,
and lastly we ask whether government policy should be aimed also at the supply side (of
the market for R&D personnel), rather than just keep subsidizing the demand side.

II.1 Rethinking the Rules of the Game in View of a Rigid Budget Constraint
II.1.1 Background
           The R&D Law in Israel does not address the thorny issue of how to allocate a
(rigid) budget for R&D support if the demand for such support exceeds the budget
provision. That is, the OCS support program was not meant to be competitive, and in


33
   As mentioned in the Introduction, a great deal of research on R&D policy has been done recently. Aside
from the references mentioned there, see also David et al (1999), Hunt and Tybout (1998), Klette and Moen
1998a and 1998b.


                                                   32
principle it should provide with R&D subsidies to all projects that pass the eligibility
criteria.     The latter are based on technological and commercial feasibility, and other
procedural considerations. Projects are judged one by one, and there is no attempt to rank
them or establish otherwise a funding priority. The paramount principle of ‚Äúneutrality‚Äù
that has been a cornerstone of R&D Policy in Israel since the late 1960s precludes also
picking projects according to fields or any other such consideration.


            In 1997 the projected demand for R&D support greatly exceeded the budget
provision (by about 50%, i.e. some $200 million), and the Treasury refused to consider
any substantial increase to the OCS budget to accommodate such demand.34                     An impasse
ensued, bringing a great deal of uncertainty to the working of the OCS and to the High-
Tech sector as a whole. A committee was formed to try to find a way out of the crisis.
After months of deliberations the committee could not reconcile the conflicting forces at
play: on the one hand the imperatives of the existing law, the expectations of the High-
Tech sector based on it, and the perceived need to expand the R&D support budget in
order to accommodate and foster the success of the High-Tech sector; and on the other
hand the sudden imposition of a rigid budget constraint, that did not allow for any growth
of demand.


            The result has been ad hoc tinkering both with the OCS budget and its way of
operation, in order to keep the system running without solving the underlying issues.
More importantly, this protracted crisis made it clear that the R&D law as is, and the
implementation mechanisms in place, are in need of extensive revision in view of the
explosive growth of the High-Tech sector (as well as the rapid changes that took place
within the sector), and the pressure that puts on the R&D support budget in an era of
fiscal restraint.35 Following is a discussion of the set of policy issues that lie at the core of
this conundrum. The basic premise underlying the discussion is that, if current procedures



34
   Apparently this was the first time in the history of the OCS that demand exceeded the budget provision
by a substantial amount.
35
   Indeed, in January 2000 the Government initiated a move aimed at revising the R&D Law, in view of this
fundamental conflict, as well as of the dramatic changes that have taken place in the High-Tech sector.


                                                    33
are left unchanged, demand for R&D support will exceed present level budgets by wide
margins,36 and hence there is an urgent need to design a suitable allocation mechanism.


           There are essentially two ways to go about allocating a fixed budget to projects
that request support in excess of available resources. The first is to depart from the
principle of neutrality in some dimension, the second to design an allocation mechanism
that would do the job. Of course, the two are not mutually exclusive, and one could have
a combination of both. We consider each in turn, starting from the latter.


II.1.2 Allocation schemes for the regular OCS program of R&D grants
           Until now the system has been such whereby all eligible projects are supposed to
be supported, and in principle the support should be equal across projects (in percentage
terms). The eligibility criteria entail checks of technological and commercial feasibility
(or ‚Äúviability‚Äù), the good standing of the applicants, and other administrative criteria.
There are three main options to move away from such system: (i) to adjust every time the
support rates or the eligibility criteria so as to meet the budget constraint; (ii) to
implement a competitive/ranking system; (iii) randomization.


           The first option entails adjusting the support rates or the eligibility criteria with
every new budget so as to meet the budget constraint. The major drawback is of course
the uncertainty that such a policy shift will introduce, greatly impairing the ability of
firms to plan ahead (certainly long term). In addition, this would make the whole support
system vulnerable to political manipulation.


           The second option simply means that projects would have to compete against
each other for scarce support funds (as happens with the ‚ÄúMagnet‚Äù program). There will
be a ranking system, and the funds will be allocated from the top down until the budget is
exhausted. A serious issue that will almost certainly arise in such context is whether or
not such system is compatible with neutrality, in view of the fact that any ranking system
will be extremely hard to implement across fields, and the ranking would have to be done

36
     Some projections indicate that would be true even if the budget were increased substantially.


                                                       34
primarily within fields.37 However, it may be that in any case the system will have to
move away from neutrality (see below).


         The last option is some sort of randomization, that is, to chose at random from the
set of projects that pass some eligibility threshold (as in the present system), up to the
point where the budget constraint is met. We shall not analyze this option in any detail,
simply because it would seem that it is (at least at present) politically unfeasible.38 Thus,
it seems that the only viable alternative at this point is to implement some sort of
ranking/competitive system, as suggested above, and tie it with a conscious departure
from neutrality.


II.1.3 Departures from Neutrality
         As already mentioned, one of the hallmarks and basic premises of the OCS
support programs has been all along neutrality, that is, the OCS does not select projects
according to preferred fields or any such criteria, but responds to demand that arises
spontaneously from industry. It is fair to say that such policy has been eminently
successful, since it basically reinforced existing competencies and emerging comparative
advantage. Moreover, it avoided one of the main potential dangers of any industrial
policy, namely, the ‚Äúpicking of winners‚Äù by government officials.


         However, the fiscal constraint on the overall support budget implies that the OCS
may have to depart from neutrality in any case, in which case it is certainly better to do it
explicitly as a result of serious analysis, and not by default. There are at least two
dimensions along which the OCS could opt for non-neutral allocation policies: according
to fields, and according to type (or rather size) of firms.39 As already suggested, such


37
   It is quite likely that the present system in actuality is not neutral either, but the lack of neutrality is
disguised. In a ranking system the issue rises to the surface and will have to be addressed head on.
38
   It is interesting to note that there is a great deal of interest in this policy both in the US and in Europe,
and it would seem that at some point some version of randomization will be implemented. One of the great
advantages (in the long run) of such a policy is that it allows for methodologically sound assessment studies
of the efficacy of government support (since the ‚Äúcontrol sample‚Äù is built in).
39
   In fact, it would seem that, while formally neutral, actual support policies favored particular
technological areas, primarily electronics, and until the mid 1990s large firms over smaller ones (see
below).


                                                      35
departures could be made part of a revamped allocation scheme (e.g. adopting a ranking /
competitive system).


           Departing from neutrality in terms technological fields is always dangerous, since
it implies outguessing future technological and/or market developments, and deciding ‚Äúby
committee‚Äù what is better left to the market. Thus, one should avoid it except if there are
some glaring market failures that need to be remedied. There is room to believe that may
be the case at present in Israel with the field of biotechnology. Israel has a very talented
and plentiful scientific workforce in Life Sciences. Yet, this pool of human capital in one
of the most dynamic technological areas at present, and potentially one of the most
important future growth areas, has yet to make a mark on industry (i.e. in biotech). Thus,
there is room to consider taking a more active and entrepreneurial attitude towards this
sector (not necessarily by channeling more funds to it) but that requires further study. The
second possible departure from neutrality is differential support to firms of different
sizes. We discuss this option now in more detail.

II.1.4 Departing from neutrality: Large vs. small firms
           In principle, the support policies of the OCS do not make any distinction among
types of firms in terms of eligibility for the existing flat rate of support (50% of the
approved R&D budget).40 In practice though and as described in Part I, the support for
large firms during the past two years has been reduced, reversing the previous trend
whereby a handful of very large firms (large by Israeli standards) accounted for a large
proportion of the total support dispensed. However, this de facto change has been
essentially an ad hoc response to budgetary pressures (and hence is likely to be
temporary), and not a well formulated policy reassessment. Thus, we still have to
examine whether the principle of equal support to all firms regardless of size is a
reasonable policy. In other words, the question is whether the rationale for R&D support
(in terms of market failures etc.) holds equally for small and large firms. A brief review
of the basic economic rationale for support to R&D reveals that indeed there is room to



40
     Except for the incubators program, as described in Part I.


                                                        36
(re)consider the prevailing policy, and reduce the rate of support to large firms versus
smaller ones.


        First, the larger is the firm, the more able it is to internalize the spillovers that it
generates, and hence the smaller would be the divergence between the social and the
private rate of return on the R&D that it performs. One of the main goals of government
support to private R&D is precisely to bridge the gap between the two rates of return:
absent that support firms will do too little R&D (relative to the socially desirable level),
and hence the support is meant to encourage them to increase that amount, pass what is
profitable according to the private rate of return on it. However, the more a firm manages
to capture the spillovers that stem from its R&D projects, the less there is room to
subsidize it on that basis. Size matters in that respect: small firms are hardly able to
capture the externalities that they generate, but that ability increases as they grow larger.


        A further rationale for government support of R&D has to do with risk and risk
taking. First, the degree of risk of an R&D project from an economy-wide point of view
may be lower than that perceived by private firms; or, closely related, the risk premium
demanded by private investors may be higher than ‚Äúwarranted‚Äù because of asymmetric
information. Second, the degree of risk aversion by private investors may be higher than
the social rate. As a result, the market may provide for too little risk taking in R&D, and
hence government support would encourage firms to move in the socially desirable
direction.


        The point in the present context is that there might be substantial differences in
this respect between small and large firms. First, problems of asymmetric information are
usually more acute for younger/smaller firms, and hence the risk premium that smaller
firms are required to pay is often much higher. Second, R&D projects undertaken by
small firms are, ceteris paribus, riskier than if done by larger firms, even if they are
exactly the same in terms of technological goals. This is so because younger/smaller
firms are disadvantaged relative to large firms in terms of a wide range of competencies
and experience that are complementary to R&D, be it in marketing, pure management,



                                                 37
access to complementary know how, etc. Thus, there is more room to subsidize risk
taking by small firms than by larger ones.


         Lastly, imperfections in capital markets usually affect small firms more than large
firms. First, the availability of internal financing, which has been shown to be important
in the context of R&D, is normally less constraining for older/larger firms than for
smaller ones. Second, access to global capital markets is easier/cheaper for larger firms.
Thus, government support to R&D meant to bridge over those imperfections ought to be
channeled more towards small firms than to larger ones.


         These considerations suggest that there is room to consider supporting small firms
at higher rates than larger firms. One could envision the following support structure:
Going start-ups (up to 5 M$ sales):41 66%; small to medium-sized firms (5 ‚Äì 100 M $
sales): 50% (as at present); large firms (over 100 M $): 33%. This is of course just an
example ‚Äì a serious proposal would have to pay a great deal of thought to the cut-off
levels, the implications for the budget, etc.


II.2 Further Policy Issues
II.2.1 The payback scheme (‚ÄúRecoupment‚Äù)
        At present the policy is that successful projects (i.e. projects that eventually lead
to sales) are required to pay back to the OCS the amount of support received, but the
payback cannot account for more than a small percentage of annual sales.42 The idea is
that this way the OCS shares the risk of the R&D projects (effectively lowering the risk
premium that private firms have to pay), and overcomes possible imperfections in capital
markets by offering easily accessible finance. Moreover, it subsidizes R&D both in that it
demands zero interest on the conditional loan, and in the sense already mentioned of
lowering the risk premium. There are, however, serious drawbacks to such a system:


41
  By start-ups we mean young, small ongoing firms, not those that are still in the ‚Äúincubator‚Äù phase.
42
  The percentage was set at 3%, but there have been several attempts by the Treasury to raise it further (to
4.5%), and even to charge interest on the principal. In fact, the Treasury has been promoting the idea that
the grants should turn into a conditional loan, which will serve as a way of overcoming financial constraints
by R&D firms, but not as a straight R&D subsidy.


                                                     38
  ‚Ä¢      Since the payback obligation applies to sales that stem directly from the projects
      supported, this immediately creates moral hazard problems in terms of how projects
      are defined, and all sort of pernicious incentives as to how to relate products/sales to
      projects.
  ‚Ä¢      The previous issue implies that the OCS and the firms supported find themselves
      engaged in an antagonistic/confrontational situation, that is detrimental to the efficient
      functioning of both.
  ‚Ä¢      As we have seen in Part I, the weight of payback funds in the overall OCS budget
      is growing steeply over time, and there is a real danger of ‚Äúpolitical opportunism‚Äù in
      this respect, namely, that the commitment to R&D support may diminish but in the
      short run that could be disguised by the increased reliance on payback funds in order
      to support new projects.


         Beyond those issues, the payback scheme may have had the unintended
consequence of blurring the real intent of the R&D law, obscuring the true extent of the
support budget, and hence the commitment of the government to R&D. As we have seen,
such support is warranted for good economic reasons, that call indeed for a subsidy to
R&D. Contrary to some widely held perceptions, the intent and rationale of the R&D law
is not for the Government to assume just a financing role, in view of imperfections in
existing financial markets in Israel. The main intent is to bridge the gap between the
social and the private rate of return to R&D, and that calls for a straight subsidy. The
recent availability of venture capital, and the opening of the Israeli economy to foreign
capital markets may reduce the effective cost of capital and perhaps also the risk
premiums to Israeli High-Tech firms. However, that has nothing to do with the fact that
these same firms generate spillovers to the Israeli economy that they can only partially
appropriate, a fact that calls for subsidizing R&D.


         Thus, there is room to consider the phasing out of the payback scheme, or at least
the offering of an alternative track consisting of a lower subsidy rate but without a
payback proviso. If the payback scheme is eliminated, the R&D grants given by the OCS




                                               39
would become strictly and overtly what they were set out to be, namely, a straight
subsidy, hence doing away with the hazards of political opportunism.


II.2.2 The conditionality of production in Israel
        The R&D Law stipulates that if the OCS extends support to an R&D project, the
innovation resulting from it should be produced in Israel. In fact, the Law states as one of
its goals to increase employment in such a way. It should be clear that such conditionality
might lead to serious allocational inefficiencies. Denote by    cI the costs of producing in
Israel, by cA the costs of producing abroad, and by S the R&D subsidy. It is trivial to
show that, if cI - cA < S, the firm will choose to take the R&D subsidy, execute the project
in Israel and produce there even though production in Israel is more costly than abroad. If
the inequality is reversed then the project will be carried out abroad altogether (including
the R&D). Denote the cost disadvantage by S‚Äô= cI - cA . In the case where cI - cA < S , we
can see that the R&D subsidy is in fact composed of two parts: S = S‚Äô + (S ‚Äì S‚Äô). The
first part, S‚Äô, is then a subsidy to production, not to R&D, and only the second part is a
true R&D subsidy. The larger is the gap between production costs in Israel versus those
abroad, the more the R&D grants are in fact subsidizing inefficient production, that quite
likely would not be otherwise located in Israel.


        Thus, there is room to consider the elimination of this provision of the law: there
is no strict economic rationale for it, and it leads as said to production inefficiencies.
Israel presumably has a comparative advantage in R&D, not in the assembly of ‚Äúboxes‚Äù
containing the sophisticated innovations produced there. It should be clear also that if this
conditionality is repealed, then the effective R&D subsidy could be increased without
increasing the actual amount of funds disbursed. Denote by SN the new subsidy, then one
could have     (S ‚Äì S‚Äô) < SN < S . Of course, the Government can legitimately try to
encourage local employment, and see the R&D Law as one of the means to do so. In that
case though it should be clear that part of the grants constitute in fact an employment
subsidy, and should not be counted as R&D support.




                                                   40
II.2.3 Policy changes and support to large firms
        We suggested above that the rate of support to large firms could be set a lower
level than that to smaller firms. However, we envision the implementation of these policy
changes as a comprehensive package. In that case, while lowering the rate of ‚Äúnominal‚Äù
support to large firms, the effective rate may actually increase, both because of the
phasing out of recoupment, and of the conditionality to produce in Israel. This latter
provision is likely to affect larger firms more than smaller ones, since for larger firms the
options and opportunities to produce abroad are much more extensive. As to the payback
scheme, it is also likely that the percentage of successful R&D is higher for them, and
hence that the payback burden is also disproportionally higher for larger firms. On both
accounts then larger firms stand to gain from the repeal of these provisions, thus
compensating for the lower support rate.


II.2.4 Ongoing economic assessment and policy making
        The drawing of sound economic policies towards R&D, innovation and the High-
Tech sector is of paramount importance for the Israeli economy. At present though there
is no body in charge of setting such policies, and hence things happen in a rather
haphazard way, in response to point-wise pressures and developments. What is needed is
an economic policy unit, probably at the OCS, with the following mandate: (1) to collect
and organize in a comprehensive and coherent way the data needed for policy making;
(2) to set procedures for the ongoing evaluation of the effectiveness of the OCS policies;
(3) to evaluate, research and discuss long term policies. It is interesting to note that the
Advanced Technology Program in the US, which is the closest to the OCS in terms of
intent, has such a unit as integral part of its mission and mandate.


II.3 The Magnet Program versus the Regular OCS Fund
        As already mentioned, the Magnet program supports consortia of industrial firms
and academia, aimed at developing ‚Äúgeneric, pre-competitive technologies‚Äù common to
the members of the consortia. Magnet finances 2/3 of the R&D budget of the consortia
with straight grants, and there is no payback obligation. Contrary to the regular program




                                                 41
of the OCS, Magnet selects consortia on a competitive basis, and allocates in this manner
a budget of about 60 million $/year to the winning consortia.


         One of the phenomena that underlies the need for the Magnet program is the fact
that R&D efforts in the Israeli High-Tech sector have been rather fragmented. That is,
this sector is characterized by the existence of a very large number of small to medium
firms, a handful of large ones (but none with sales of over 1 billion $), and a great deal of
turnover.43 There is no question that the vitality, daring and some spectacular successes of
the sector owes in no small measure to these features, that provide favorable conditions
for an accelerated Darwinian process. On the other hand, these same features call into
question the ability of the sector, and of the Israeli economy as a whole, to reap the long
term economic benefits from its own success. The recent sales of a series of highly
successful Israeli companies to foreign corporations is just one of the manifestations of
this syndrome.


         Fragmentation was perhaps unavoidable, certainly in the initial stages of
development of the High-Tech sector, since the overwhelming majority of High-Tech
firms grow out of start-ups established by single technological entrepreneurs. Moreover,
most of them aim (at least initially) at narrowly defined market niches. As the sector
moves on though size matters: in order to tackle larger markets and contemplate
accordingly longer term projects, there is need for larger entities, and that in turn calls for
various forms of cooperation, joint ventures, mergers and acquisitions. However, for
reasons that we do not profess to understand, too little seems to be happening in that
respect internally (i.e. within Israel). In fact, we witness time and again not only failures
of cooperation, but even serious informational failures, in the sense that potential partners
are unaware of the existence of each other, and/or of the potential for mutually beneficial
cooperation. 44

43
   Consider that the OCS have dealt with R&D projects of about 3,000 firms in the past 15 years, and keep
in mind that, as said before, the whole industrial R&D of Israel amounts to that done by the number 28th
R&D spender in the US, 3M (see Table 6).
44
   I am a member of the Board of Directors of Magnet, and in that capacity I have witnessed many times
this sort of ‚Äúfailures‚Äù, not only between firms but also between firms and academia. One of the most
striking was the case of the digital printing consortium: the main players involved were unaware until the


                                                     42
         Given this background, the importance of Magnet may lie not so much in its
formally stated mission (i.e. supporting generic R&D), but in the fact that it fosters
cooperation, it facilitates the creation of larger (sometimes ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù) entities, it
disseminates information about possibilities for joint ventures, and it encourages
individual firms to seek such information. Contrary to deeply-rooted belief, one cannot
just assume that if there are profitable opportunities for cooperation they will necessarily
be realized - the institutional framework definitely has an impact in that sense.


         It is therefore quite certain that the economic rationale for government support to
R&D is stronger for a program such as Magnet, both because of the aforementioned
reasons, and because of more traditional (but equally important) motives, namely, that it
deals with ‚Äúgeneric‚Äù projects and strongly emphasizes the sharing and dissemination of
information. Thus, there is room to consider the expansion of Magnet as a policy
instrument, perhaps increasing the share of the overall R&D support budget that it
administers. There are a host of specific issues having to do with the way the Magnet
Program is implemented, but that is beyond the scope of this paper.



II.4 How Much Support to R&D?
II.4.1 Is there a basis for setting a policy target?
         As we have seen in section I.3, the budget of the OCS has stabilized since 1997 at
a level of about $400 million per year, following a decade of rapid growth. The High
Tech sector has been lobbying for further increases, claiming that OCS grants play a key
role in lowering R&D costs and hence in fueling innovation, in making Israeli companies
more     attractive     to    foreign     investors,     and     in    compensating        for    geo-political
                 45
disadvantages.        The government has refused, arguing that the massive influx of Venture
Capital and other forms of financing in recent years (primarily IPO‚Äôs in Nasdaq) prove


formation of the consortium of crucial research on properties of ink that was being conducted at some
academic institutions in Israel (virtually ‚Äúnext doors‚Äù).
45
   The High Tech sector is actually split in this respect: on the one hand the traditional electronics sector
demands bigger budgets for the OCS; on the other hand, Internet-related ventures and some of the new
software developers lobby instead for favorable tax breaks, particularly with regard to capital gains.


                                                       43
that there is hardly a need for further R&D subsidies, and that in fact there may be room
to reduce them. The result has been an impasse in policy making towards this sector, and
the concomitant uncertainty has probably had a detrimental effect on it.


        Stepping out from the political economy aspects of the issue, the question is, how
should we think about setting a desirable level of R&D support? Is the current level of
$400 million ‚Äúappropriate‚Äù, and if not what sort of policy gradient should the government
pursue? As we shall see, these questions pose serious conceptual and empirical
difficulties that are well beyond the scope of this paper. Thus, we shall content ourselves
just with outlining these difficulties, in the hope that they will soberly inform the policy
debate and prompt further, much needed research.


        The basic premise underlying the sort of ‚Äúneutral‚Äù, across-the-board R&D
subsidies that the OCS dispenses is that, left to its own, the market will undertake too
little R&D. If so, the question of how much R&D subsidies should the government give
out amounts to asking how much of its resources should a country (in this case Israel)
allocate to R&D? If this ‚Äúoptimal‚Äù R&D allocation exceeds the actual one, the R&D
support budget should then be set so as to close the gap between them. Thus, there are
two distinct problems to tackle: assessing the presumed gap between actual and optimal
R&D spending in the economy, and devising ways to bring the economy to the desired
level (and perhaps mix) of R&D spending through a subsidy program such as that of the
OCS. Notice that the latter necessitates first and foremost a reliable estimate of the
‚Äúadditionality‚Äù factor.


        Unfortunately, existing literature provides little guidance regarding the assessment
of the gap, be it in modeling or in empirical implementation. One notable exception is
Jones and Williams, 1998: they take the social rates of return to R&D estimated in a
series of studies by Griliches and others (e.g. Griliches 1994, Scherer, 1982), and use
them (as well as their own estimate) in the context of a Romer (1990) growth model to
derive the optimal R&D to GDP ratio. Jones and Williams find that the US devotes far
too little resources to R&D, and that even taking a lower bound of 30% for the social rate



                                               44
of return to R&D, the optimal R&D/GDP ratio may be 2 to 4 times higher than the
present one of about 2.2%.


         It is not clear though whether the results of Jones and Williams and the
concomitant policy implications can be readily extended to other countries. First, the
optimal R&D/GDP ratio depends critically on the ratio of the social rate of return to
R&D, to the economy-wide real rate of return (e.g. the long term return on the stock
market). On both accounts a country such as Israel may differ substantially from the US.
Second, Jones and Williams consider R&D in the context of a close economy; in an open
economy, whereby some of the benefits from own R&D spill over to other countries (see
for example Coe and Helpman, 1995), the notion of a ‚Äúsocial‚Äù rate of return is far less
clear.


         Eaton, Gutierrez and Kortum (1998) provide further support to the notion that
countries may be underinvesting in R&D. They laid out a detailed model of the R&D
process and of the transmission of research outcomes across countries (based on Eaton
and Kortum, 1996), and proceed to calibrate it for the European Union countries, and to
simulate its responsiveness to various policy levers. One of their conclusions is that
increasing research activity in most European countries could make a substantial
contribution to productivity levels not only in the EU but throughout the OECD.
However, Eaton, Gutierrez and Kortum stop short of endorsing the channeling of
additional resources into R&D, and they certainly do not attempt to compute an
‚Äúoptimal‚Äù R&D/GDP ratio that could serve as an actual target for policy in any specific
country. Still, their conclusions are congruent with a policy gradient of increasing
R&D/GDP ratios, at least for most European countries.


II.4.2 R&D Ratios as Yardsticks for Policy
         Much of the discussion in the literature on R&D policy is cast in terms of various
R&D ratios, particularly in terms of the ratio of total civilian expenditures on R&D to
GDP (in short, R&D/GDP). Countries compare each other in terms of these ratios, and
often set targets based on averages for various reference groups (e.g. the European Union,



                                             45
the OECD, etc.) This is so not only because the amount of resources devoted to R&D
obviously cannot be divorced from total resources available, but also because there is
indeed a great deal of uncertainty in this respect, and hence political feasibility and
expedience often requires such linkages.46 Israel is no exception, and indeed Israel‚Äôs
standing vis a vis other countries in terms of R&D/GDP ratios figures prominently in the
current debate. While they surely may play a useful role in informing policy making, we
would like to argue that these ratios should be considered with great caution as yardsticks
for policy, both because of measurement problems, and because of the importance of
‚Äúcritical mass‚Äù in the R&D context.


         The measurement of R&D expenditures poses serious challenges to statistical
agencies, both because it is very difficult to delimit the scope of what counts as R&D,
and because of difficulties in computing appropriate deflators. Ever since the publication
and widespread adoption of the Frascati Manual in the 1980‚Äôs, there has been remarkable
progress in achieving international harmonization in terms of what constitutes R&D.
However, the changing nature of innovative activities poses renewed problems at every
turn, as is the case for example with many types of software development and Internet-
related innovations.47 Prompted by the sense that existing data collection procedures
failed to account for substantial portions of R&D activities, the Israeli Central Bureau of
Statistics (CBS) introduced in the late nineties a new and much more detailed survey of
Business Sector R&D (BSRD), that resulted in drastic revisions of previously available
estimates. Thus for example the newly computed BSRD for 1997 was 44% higher than
the previous estimate, and as a consequence the R&D/GDP ratio jumped up by about half
a percentage point to 3.1 for that year, reaching 3.5 in 1999.48




46
   Thus, advocating a move towards the mean R&D/GDP ratio of a ‚Äúrelevant‚Äù group of countries is
politically easier to justify than persistent divergence from such reference ratios.
47
   Regarding the Internet, it is often hard to distinguish between developments that are purely the result of
entrepreneurship as opposed to being the outcome of R&D as traditionally defined.
48
   These are the latest (and still preliminary) ratios computed by CBS for international comparisons. CBS
(1999) reports a R&D/GDP ratio of 2.3 for 1996, the latest such official figure there. The revisions put the
figure for that year at 2.8, so the increase in the ratio due to the new survey is at least of half a percentage
point.


                                                       46
        The revision that the CBS has undertaken exemplifies the difficulties of setting
policy according to these ratios: until the publication of the revised figures, existing
estimates indicated that Israel‚Äôs R&D/GDP was about average relative to the OECD, and
moreover, that Israel‚Äôs BSRD constituted a significantly smaller proportion of total R&D
than in other countries (about 50-55%, compared to a median of 62% for the OECD).
Thus, if these ratios were used as yardsticks for policy, it would have been reasonable to
advocate further support to BSRD so as to increase its share, a move that would have
resulted also in a moderate increase in the R&D/GDP ratio.49 The current figures put
Israel at the upper end of OECD countries in terms of R&D/GDP ratios, and about
average in terms of BSRD/R&D. Thus, international comparisons of this sort would
render at present very different policy recommendations.


        The second measurement problem is that of devising appropriate deflators for
R&D expenditures. The practice at the CBS has been to compute for each R&D-
performing sector an index based on the average wages in the sector on the one hand, and
the costs of materials and capital outlays on the other hand (each component weighted by
its appropriate share in R&D). However, a survey of wages conducted separately by the
CBS (as part of its general survey of labor and wages), indicates that wages for R&D
personnel in the business sector rose much faster than average wages in the sector. Thus,
computing a deflator based on these wages renders a very different picture, as can be seen
in the following comparison (see below for further discussion on the new index):


                   Annual Average Rate of Growth of BSRD: 1994 ‚Äì 1999
                     (using revised figures based on new CBS survey)50

                  In nominal Israeli Shekels                                  21%

                  Deflated by the CPI                                         12%

                  Deflated by the CBS R&D deflator (1994-                      7%
                  98, prior to revision)

49
  See for example an earlier version of this paper, Trajtenberg (2000).
50
  We inflated the old 1996 figure by a factor of 1.44 (recall that the new estimate for BSRD 1997 was 44%
higher than the previous one) in order to compute the rate of change for 1996-97. From then on we used the
new figures.


                                                    47
                 Deflated by new index based on wages of           ~ 3%
                 R&D personnel in business sector*
                 *Provisional computations, hence figure is approximate only


        The impressive growth of BSRD in the past half-decade (12% per year, CPI-
adjusted) is thus greatly attenuated when deflating it by the new and still provisional
index, i.e. just about 3% per year. Of course, the R&D/GDP ratio would be significantly
lower as well if we were to compute it on the basis of these ‚Äúreal‚Äù magnitudes. Once
again, these disparities are just meant to illustrate the extent to which the figures that
might serve us as guideposts for policy are sensitive to the way we treat these
measurement issues.


        The second problem with international comparisons of R&D ratios for policy is
that of critical mass. Contrary to other areas where the relative amount of resources may
constitute a good enough yardstick (such as in health or education), what determines the
impact of R&D on the economic performance of the economy is in many cases the
absolute and not the relative amount invested. That is so basically because there are
substantial indivisibilities in R&D both at the micro and macro levels. At the level of
individual projects and/or firms, a wide range of technological areas require the
commitment of relatively large amounts of R&D in order to make these projects at all
feasible (in other words, the minimum efficient scale of projects in such areas is large).
Thus, the development of communication satellites requires R&D budgets of hundreds of
millions of dollars, and so do new ethical drugs.


        At the economy-wide level, the conduct of R&D requires a vast array of
supporting infrastructure and services, the availability of adequate manpower (not only
scientists and engineers but also supporting personnel of various sorts), and of financial
institutions and markets. All of these would come into being only if ‚Äúenough‚Äù R&D is
being carried out to justify the emergence of the required infrastructure, venture capital
institutions, etc. Moreover, the ability of firms conducting R&D to capture the spillovers
generated by others in the same region/country depend as well on the existence of a
sufficiently large nearby R&D sector. This latter factor can be critical for the chances of



                                                48
the high sector in the country to become a ‚ÄúSilicon Valley‚Äù. Thus, it is hard to compare
R&D/GDP ratios for countries that vary a great deal in size, particularly when the
differences are so extreme as between the US or Japan and Israel. 51


        Furthermore, the extent to which comparisons of R&D ratios are informative (and
potentially telling from a normative point of view) depend inter alia on the growth
strategy that the countries being compared have chosen. Israel has embarked long ago in
a growth path that relies heavily upon the promotion of High-Tech, export-oriented
sectors, reflecting its perceived comparative advantage in high-skilled labor. By contrast,
countries such as Spain or New Zealand, while comparable to Israel in terms of current
GPD per capita, have chosen a very different path (recall Part I, and Figure 4). Thus,
while a R&D/GDP ratio of about 1% for Spain might be adequate given its growth
strategy, Israel‚Äôs much higher ratio may still be below mark.


        In order to gain further perspective on the issue of absolute versus relative size of
expenditures in R&D, consider Table 6, where we list the leading industrial R&D
performers in the US, and compare them to Israel as a whole. Thus, in 1997 the absolute
amount of resources allocated to civilian R&D in Israel was $3,129 million, of which
$2,006 million was business sector R&D. 52 That same year eight of the leading industrial
R&D performers in the US spent over 2 billion $ in R&D, each of them more than
Israel‚Äôs industrial sector as a whole. To put it differently, all of Israel‚Äôs business sector
R&D amounted to the R&D done by Pfizer, and was slightly less than the R&D done by
Johnson and Johnson. If we took instead Israel‚Äôs total civilian R&D, that would place
Israel as number 4, just in between IBM and Lucent. These gaps are well reflected also in
patent statistics (see Trajtenberg, 1999): Israeli inventors were granted in 1997 a total of
653 patents, of which slightly less than half went to Israeli corporations, i.e. about 320
patents. By contrast, that same year IBM was granted 1,758 patents, Motorola 1,151, Intel
407, Hewlett-Packard 537, General Electric 667, and so forth.

51
   If one could compute an optimal R&D/GDP ratio for different countries, chances are that it would be a
concave, decreasing function of size.
52
   These figures are based on the revised estimates produced by the CBS on the basis of their new survey.
The previous estimates placed Israel much lower in that scale: 16th in terms of BSRD, and 7th in terms of
total R&D.

II.5 Prop up demand, or stimulate supply?
         As mentioned in Section I, the basic premise underlying Israeli R&D Policy has
been all along that Israel enjoys a comparative advantage in high-tech, science-based
industries, because of the abundance of high-skilled labor and scientific personnel. This,
coupled with the presumption that the market is likely to underinvest in R&D, provides
the rationale for the direct subsidization of industrial R&D, as done through the OCS
programs. Viewed from the vantage point of the market for scientists and engineers, such
policy is one that stimulates demand, implicitly assuming that supply is sufficiently
elastic so as to provide the additional personnel called forth by the government supported
R&D.


         Figure 7 casts serious doubts on this set of premises: wages of R&D personnel in
the business sector have risen extremely fast in the second half of the 1990‚Äôs, much faster
than economy-wide wages (by 1999 the index of wages in R&D had risen 54% more than
all wages). Clearly, the dramatic increase in R&D outlays by the Business Sector during
the same period fueled the inflation in wages of R&D workers.53 Mirroring these
developments, there is plenty circumstantial evidence of severe shortages in computer
scientists and engineers, software developers, and related personnel.54 The picture that
emerges is thus of a very inelastic supply curve for qualified R&D workers in recent
years, which implies that any additional financial resources channeled into BSRD would
achieve little increase in real R&D in the short run, and instead would keep fueling wage
inflation (see Goolsbee, 1998, for a similar argument regarding the effect of Government-
supported R&D in the US).


         Shortages of highly skilled personnel in cutting edge technologies seem to be a
pervasive, worldwide phenomenon in recent years, certainly in the US as well as in



53
   The series for BSRD depicted in Figure 7 is not entirely consistent, in that the figures for 1997 onwards
are those of the new survey of R&D in the Business Sector, which as said showed a large increase in the
scope of R&D done by the sector. Thus, while the increase from say 1993-94 to 1997-98 is plausible, the
path of the series in between is not necessarily accurate.
54
   As reflected for example in statistics of job openings, as well as the frequent reports of increasing
difficulties of existing companies in retaining R&D personnel.

leading     European      countries.55    Romer      (2000)     suggests     that    existing    institutional
arrangements in the US higher education system limit the ‚Äúsupply response‚Äù to these
market signals, and hence necessitate corrective policy changes. In essence, the incentive
system within universities is not necessarily conducive to the timely supply of graduates
in fields of high demand, both in terms of the number of students admitted to different
fields, the mix of courses offered, the channeling of graduate students into lengthy, often
dead-end post-doc positions, etc.56 Thus, Romer advocates a shift of focus in government
policy towards R&D, from the traditional subsidization of R&D itself that stimulates the
demand for scientists and engineers, to programs that would directly encourage the
supply of newly trained qualified manpower. In light of the trends depicted in Figure 7, it
is clear that government policy towards R&D in Israel ought to address both sides of the
market: the relative abundance of qualified manpower is no longer to be taken for
granted, and there are plenty of institutional rigidities and frictions in the educational
system to cast doubt on its ability to respond by itself in a timely fashion to market needs.


          One specific problem in Israel in this respect, is that there are relatively large
groups of the population that have acquired significant levels of ‚Äúgeneral‚Äù human capital,
but not the skills that are required for the High Tech sector, and that essentially do not
participate in the relevant labor markets. These are primarily ultra-orthodox Jews, Israeli
Arabs, and residents in the ‚Äúdevelopment towns‚Äù located in the geographically more
distant areas. The impediments to their partaking in the job opportunities offered by the
‚ÄúNew Economy‚Äù are numerous, ranging from cultural barriers to geographical isolation.
It is clear that tapping their potential could alleviate the shortages alluded to, and at the
same time improve the economic standing of these groups.57 This would involve
providing the appropriate training, setting up an institutional framework that would allow


55
   One of the related, hotly debated policy issues in many countries is the extent to which foreign high tech
workers should be allowed in. This has become also a highly controversial issue in Israel.
56
   Romer‚Äôs view would seem to contradict Rosenberg‚Äôs (1999, 2000), who has persuasively argued that one
of the key sources of strength underlying the technological and scientific prowess of the US has been the
responsiveness of Universities to market needs and new technological developments. However, it could
well be that what had characterized universities throughout most of the 20th century does not quite hold in
recent years, and/or that the pace of change has accelerated, and hence the response of universities seems
more sluggis h now.
57
   These are mostly in the lowest income brackets, and account for a large fraction of the unemployed.


                                                     53
their employment in the High Tech sector without violating their cultural sensitivities,
and investing in infrastructure to bring them closer to the centers of economic activity.


        The case of Bangalore in India exemplifies the wide range of possibilities opened
in terms of employing skilled labor in R&D-related activities from the distance, without
the workers having to migrate and adapt to the environment of the employer. Indeed, as
documented in Arora and Arunachalam (2000), a large part of the burgeoning software
sector in India does subcontracting development work for US-based firms. It would seem
that a similar model could be applied within Israel vis a vis the population groups
mentioned above, that is, provide them with training in situ, and employ them in their
communities via subcontracting employment relationships. There seem to be a host of
coordination failures that prevent that from happening without intervention, and hence
there is room for the government to undertake a facilitating role.


        Developments in the labor markets associated with High Tech have of course
wider implications. In fact, one of the most striking trends in the Israeli economy of the
past two decades has been the rapid rise in pre-tax income inequality. Attempts by the
government to keep a lid on after-tax inequality have necessitated a dramatic increase in
the share of the budget (and of GDP) going to welfare, a trend that seems unsustainable.
The rapid rise in the relative wages of workers in the High Tech sector has undoubtedly
contributed to the growing income gap in recent years. Clearly, policies that shift up the
demand for these workers would further increase inequality, at least in the short run,
whereas policies that stimulate the supply response would presumably do the opposite.
This is obviously a normative issue, and hence it lies well beyond the scope of this paper.
However, what is becoming increasingly clear is that, as the sectors and activities
associated with advanced technologies gain in importance throughout the economy,
policies towards them would have to be guided by a wider set of considerations,
including their distributive implications.

                    Additional Support Programs of the OCS


       Beyond the main programs described above (the ‚Äúregular‚Äù R&D Grants, Magnet,
and the Incubator Centers), the OCS offers a variety of additional assistance programs,
aimed at specific stages along the innovation cycle or at particular segments in the
progression from a innovative idea to a full-fledged commercial enterprise. Although
much smaller in terms of budget, these programs may play an important role in making
sure that potentially viable projects don‚Äôt fall in between the cracks along the hazardous
way towards successful commercial implementation. Following is a concise description
of some of these programs.



  1.   Bridging Aid
       This program offers support for the transition between R&D and manufacturing
and marketing. The intention is to enable companies that have completed the R&D stage
to manufacture a number of prototypes for installation on the premises of potential
clients, especially abroad. In the case of chemical innovations, the program supports the
setting up of a pilot plant, enabling the manufacturer to obtain feedback on the
performance of the new product or process.


       Companies with sales of up to $6 million may receive a grant of 50% for these
purposes, whereas larger ones (with annual sales of up to $30 million) are eligible for
30% grants. Total approved spending may not exceed $600,000 over a 30-month period.
Recognized ‚Äútransition period‚Äù expenses generally include:
  q    Construction of prototypes;
  q    Adaptation to standards in foreign countries;
  q    Registration of the product for marketing abroad;
  q    Operation of a pilot plant, not including construction costs;
  q    Patent registration fees.



                                                58
  2.   Aid in Establishing Industrial Incubators
       The goal of this program is to encourage established companies to develop
cooperative start-ups in new technological areas, taking advantage of the companies‚Äô
existing infrastructure, finance and management.     The OCS grants 66% of the approved
R&D outlay, up to a ceiling of $300,000 annually for a maximum of two years.
Thereafter the projects would qualify for standard R&D grants. The program is aimed at
scientific entrepreneurs (including new immigrants), who are required to create a
cooperative framework with an established Israeli industrial company, having previous
R&D experience and annual sales of at least $5 million.


  3.   Sub-contracting Industrial R&D
       This program supports the carrying out of civilian R&D projects for foreign
companies, by Israeli enterprises acting as subcontractors.   The goal is to initiate joint
ventures with foreign partners, so as to help Israeli companies market their
technologically advanced products abroad.       The OCS grants up to 20 percent of the
approved R&D costs. The Israeli subcontractor must be an industrial company with
annual sales of up to $100 million, and the R&D project must be in a new area for the
Israeli company.


  4.   Exploratory Studies for Industrial R&D Projects
       This program supports studies of the market potential for new technologies, prior
to the investment of large sums in the R&D stage. It is intended primarily for start-up
companies, or those with limited R&D experience. However, established companies
interested in exploring new subjects not included in their current areas of activity are
eligible as well. The program extends grants of 50% of approved costs, up to $30,000.
The studies are to be carried out by experienced, external consulting companies,
authorized by the OCS.
