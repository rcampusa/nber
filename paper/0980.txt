                    MONETARY   POLICY WITH A CREDIT AGGREGATE TARGET



                                        Abstract


            The principal criteria for the selection of an intermediate target

for monetary policy are (1) that the target be closely related to the

nonfinancial objectives of monetary policy, (2) that it         contain   information

about      the future movements of those relevant aspects of the nonfinancial
economy, (3) that it be closely connected to the instruments over which
the central bank can exert direct control, and       (4)   that data on it be
readily available on a timely basis.
                    presented in this paper indicates that, on each of
           The evidence

the four criteria considered, total net credit is just as suitable as
any   of   the monetary aggregates to serve as an intermediate target for
monetary     policy in the United States. As long as the Federal Reserve

System continues to use an intermediate target procedure, this evidence

is consistent with adopting a two—target framework based on both money and

credit, thereby drawing on information from both sides of the public's

balance sheet for the set of signals that govern the systematic response

of monetary policy to economic events.

            MONETARY POLICY WITH A CREDIT AGGREGATE TARGET

          Monetary policy procedures typically have short life spans.
Some basic elements endure, of course, but experience suggests
that central banks frequently overhaul the specific operating
procedures they use to implement monetary policy. These adaptations,
which occur at irregular intervals, can be responses to changes
in    the underlying economic and   financial   environment, to   shifts in
policy   objectives, or even to advances in economic science.

          In the United States the past decade or so has been an

especially fast—moving period from, this perspective. The emergence

of rapid and volatile price inflation in the late 1960s had made

nominal interest rates, which the Federal Reserve System had

emphasized since world War II, clearly less reliable as a focus

for monetary policy) At the beginning of the l970s, therefore,

the   Federal Reserve shifted to a policy framework based on monetary
aggregates as intermediate targets.2 During most of the l970s
interest rates remained an important part of the policy process,
but   primarily as the instrument used to influence the growth of the

targeted monetary aggregates. In a widely pub1iized action in

October 1979, however, the Federal Reserve abandoned interest

rates altogether and adopted new procedures based on controlling

the monetary aggregates via the quantity of bank reserves. In the

meanwhile, a series of innovations in financial institutions and
                               —2—




practices during the 1970s had progressively blurred the meaning

of "money." Early in 1980, therefore, the Federal Reserve implicitly

changed its operating procedures once again, this time by redefining

the monetary aggregates used as the intermediate targets.

       As is nearly always the case when central banks change

operating procedures, these most recent changes —to a reserves

instrument instead of an interest rate instrument, and to new

monetary aggregate intermediate targets — have raised new questions

and revived old ones. Indeed, as a measure of its own active

concern with these questions, the Federal Reserve Board in 1981

published a two—volume study, New Monetary Control Procedures,

consisting of thirteen staff papers on various aspects of the subject.

Although these studies addressed a broad range of specific topics,

the main focus was on the same issues that have always been central

to the analysis of monetary policy procedures under an intermediate

target strategy: what aggregates to target, what instruments to

use to achieve those targets, and what variation of both instruments

and intermediate targets to seek (or tolerate) over time. Apparently

these basic issues are as open today as they have been at any time

in the past.

       The object of this paper is to consider the evidence bearing

on the most central of these choices determining monetary policy

procedures under the intermediate target approach —the selection

of the intermediate target itself — and to do so in the context of

a specific alternative to the current exclusive reliance on the

monetary aggregates. In particular, in a series of recent papers
                                   —3—




 (Friedman 1981, 1982a, 1982b) I have documented the stability of

the relationship between credit and income in the United States,

and have gone on to suggest several implications of this regularity

for both monetary arid fiscal policies. The chief implication for

monetary policy is that the available empirical evidence On the

relative stability of the credit-to-income and money-to-income

relationships does not support a special role for money over credit

in formulating and implementing monetary policy. Since there is

nothing special about (inside) money from an a priori perspective

either, there is therefore little basis for monetary policy procedures

which focus on target growth rates for specific measures of the

money stock with little if any attention paid to credit measures.

         Although a close and reliable relationship to nonfinancial

economic activity is perhaps the most important factor determining

the suitability of a financial aggregate as an intermediate monetary

policy target, it is hardly the only consideration. A second

important   criterion is that the relationship of an intermediate
target to   nonfinancial activity must go beyond mere contemporaneous

correlation, so that current movements of the target contain

information   about future movements of the relevant aspects of the
nonfinancial economy. A    third   criterion is that an intermediate
target   must also be closely related to the instruments under the

central bank's direct control —      in   the United States under current

procedures the stock of nonborrowed reserves, or alternatively a

short—term interest rate. Finally, a fourth criterion is that data

on an intermediate target must be readily available on a timely basis.

Although special strength in some areas may compensate for weakness

in others, gross failure on any one of these grounds would render

any variable unsuitable as an intermediate target for monetary

policy.

          This paper presents evidence for the United States comparing

total net credit, the credit aggregate that displays the most

stable relationship with income, to the major monetary aggregates

on each of these four criteria. Section I reviews and updates

the evidence showing that the stability of the credit-to-income

relationship is comparable to that of the money—to—income relation-

ship. section II presents evidence on the degree to which current

movements of either credit or money signal future movements of

nonfinancial economic activity. Section III turns to the question

of whether    the Federal Reserve   could actually   meet predetermined
credit    growth targets, and presents evidence on the relationship

of total net credit and the monetary aggregates, respectively,

to nonborrowed reserves and to the federal funds rate. Section IV

focuses on the timing and reliability of the available credit

data by presenting some preliminary results based on monthly

credit series. Section V briefly summarizes the main conclusions

reached in the paper and highlights their implications for monetary

policy.

          The evidence presented in this paper indicates that, on

each of the four criteria considered, total net credit is just

as suitable as any. of the monetary aggregates       to serve as   an

intermediate    target   for monetary policy. As long as the Federal
                                 —5—




Reserve continues   to use an intermediate target procedure, this

evidence is consistent with adopting a two—target framework based

on both money and credit, thereby drawing on information from

both sides of the publics balance sheet for the set of signals

that govern the systematic response of monetary policy to economic

events.

I.   The Stability of the Credit-to-Income Relationship3

         The intermediate target procedure for monetary policy

involves specifying some financial variable Cs) —     in   the United

States today, the monetary aggregates — to stand as proxy for

the real economic targets at which monetary policy ultimately

aims, such as economic growth, price stability, employment, and

international balance. The result is, in effect, a two—step

procedure.     The central bank first determines what growth of the
intermediate target is most likely to correspond to the desired
ultimate economic outcome.     It   then sets some operating instrument
over which it can exert   close control — in the United States
either   a short—term interest rate or, since October 1979, the

quantity of bank reserves — so as to achieve that growth rate for

the intermediate target itself.

         The first, and most obvious, criterion for selecting a

suitable intermediate target is that the targeted measure must be

closely and reliably related to the nonfinancial objectives of

monetary policy. Despite the proven seductiveness of discussions

about whether any given monetary aggregate will or will not be

within the announced target range on some chosen date, it is

important   never to lose sight of the simple truth that any such
aggregate   has no policy significance in and of itself. What
matters is the effect of monetary policy on the nonfinancial
economy,    and intermediate targets not reliably related to that
effect   have no role at all to play in the monetary policy process.

         Results based on a variety of methodological approaches

consistently indicate that total net credit in the United States —
                                —7--




 that is, the aggregate outstanding indebtedness of all U.S.

 nonfinancial borrowers — bears as close and as stable a relationship

 to U.s. nonfinancial economic activity as do the more familiar

 asset aggregates like the money stock (however defined) or the

monetary base. Moreover, in contrast to the familiar asset

aggregates, among which there seems to be less basis for choice

from this perspective, total net credit appears to be unique in

this regard among major liability aggregates. Unlike the asset

aggregates, the stability of the relationship for total net credit

does not just represent the stability of a sum of stable parts.

       The U.S. nonfinancial economy's reliance on credit, scaled

in relation to economic activity, has shown almost no trend and

but little variation since World War II. After falling from 156%

of gross national product in 1946 to 127% in 1951, and then rising

to 144% in 1960, total net credit has remained within a few

percentage points of that level ever since. (The yearend 1981

level was 143%.) Otherwise it has exhibited a slight cyclicality,

typically rising a percentage point or two in recession years

(when gross national product, in the denominator, is weak) and

then falling back. Although the individual components of this

total have varied in sharply different directions both secularly

and cyclically, on the whole they have just offset one another.

In brief, the secular rise in private debt has largely mirrored

a substantial decline (relative to economic activity) in federal

government debt, while bulges in federal debt issuance during

recessions have mostly had their counterpart in the abatement
                                     —8—




of    private borrowing.

          The first four columns of Table 1 summarize the stability

of the ratios to gross national product of six financial aggregates

— total    net credit and      five others — by   showing the coefficient

of variation (standard deviation normalized by mean) for each

ratio computed from both annual and quarterly U.S. data over the
                           4
1959—80 sample period.         In each case the table shows the coefficient

of variation computed from raw data, and also computed from detrended

data. Total net credit consistently displays the smallest coefficient

of variation among the six aggregates, and by a substantial margin,

regardless of whether the data are annual or quarterly, or raw or

detrended.

         What matters for monetary policy, of course, is not just

the absence of a time trend, and not even stability at each

individual moment of time, but stability in a dynamic sense.

Simple ratios of precisely contemporaneous observations may

therefore fail to capture what is important in the relationship

among variables that move over time with some general lead or

lag pattern between them. The remaining columns of Table 1 present

the   respective standard errors, coefficients of determination and
Durbin—Watson statistics of six estimated regression equations, in
each case relating the growth of nominal gross national product to
a moving average of the growth of one of the six financial aggregates
listed   in the table, plus a moving average of a fiscal policy

measure. The equations are estimated, using quarterly data for

1959—80, in    the familiar form

where Y is gross national product, F is any               of   the six financial

exhibits     a closer relationship to nominal income than does any
of   the   other aggregates except the narrow money stock.6

           In part   because   of the extent to which regressions of the

form (1) have been discredited by a variety of criticisms, researchers

examining the money—to—income (or, here, credit—to—income) relation-

ship have increasingly turned to methods that allow for a richer

dynamic interaction by relating the variation of income not to

the entirety of the variation of money but only to that part of

it which cannot already be deduced either from the past history

of money itself or from the joint past history of both money and

income.7 In this context a key indication of the stability of the

relationship    to income of any         financial   aggregate is the behavior
of that relationship following just such an "innovation," or
unanticipated       movement, in the aggregate (or in income). A more

general representation of (1) that is consistent with this interpreta-

tion (but that omits the fiscal variable, so as to keep the order

of the system small) is the vector autoregression

         The upper panel of Table 2 summarizes simulations of (4),

estimated in the form (1) using 1959—80 quarterly data for nominal

gross national product and each of the six financial aggregates

from Table 1, with eight quarters of lags on each variable in each

equation. For convenience the table reports the response of F/Y

rather than the individual responses of F and Y separately. Each

column in the table presents values, for the initial quarter and

then for the final quarter in each of the first five years,

indicating the time path followed by F/y (for the definition of

F indicated) in response to a 1% innovation in F.9

         Although it is impossible to interpret these simulation

results in other than a descriptive way, th.e responses suggest

quite different degrees of dynamic stability among the six aggregate-

to—income relationships. By construction, Y remains unaffected

contemporaneously, so that in the initial quarter each F/y ratio

rises by 1%. Thereafter the bulge disappears from most of the

ratios as Y rises or F declines, or both. The time pattern by

which it disappears varies from one aggregate to another, however.

The   Ml money stock ratio quickly returns to (and remains approximately
at) the initial base line, and the M2 and total net credit ratios
do also, albeit with some delay. By contrast, the bank credit
and M3 ratios show little tendency to decline until after two years.

The monetary base ratio over—corrects and then remains persistently

negative. Overall, Ml exhibits the most stable dynamic relationship

          A further aspect of the tendency in recent research to

avoid simple nominal income regressions of the form (1) has been

a reluctance to ignore the distinction between the real and price

components of nominal income variation. The lower panel of Table 2

summarizes simulations that are analogous to those shown in the

upper half of the table but based          on the moving—average respresenta—

where X   is   real gross national product and     P    is. the price deflator

(both in natural logarithms). Here the total net credit and Ml

ratios are the two that quickly return to, and remain nearly at,

the initial base line. Once again, the stability of the total net

credit ratio is comparable to that of any         of    the monetary aggregates.11

       Finally, it is useful to point out that the stability of

the credit—to—income relationship is a phenomenon in no way

restricted to the United States in the post World War II period.

The U.S. nonfinancial economy's reliance on credit relative to

economic activity has shown essentially no trend not just over the

past thirty years but over the past sixty. (The 1921 level was

142%.) Nonfinancial borrowers' outstanding debt rose

significantly in relation to gross national product only during
                                —13—




the depression years 1930—33, when the economy was deteriorating

rapidly and many recorded debts had defaulted de facto anyway.

Otherwise the postwar stability in the United States appears to

be a continuation of a pattern that dates back at least six decades.

Among foreign economies, empirical research thus far has demonstrated

a similar comparability of the credit-to-income arid   money-to-
income relationships in Britain, Canada, Germany   and Japan.
       In   sum, there is ample ground for believing that total net
credit, measured by the total outstanding indebtedness of all of
the economy's nonfinancial borrowers, is as closely related to
nonfinancial   economic activity as are the monetary aggregates

which are so central to today's monetary policy framework.

II. The Information Content of Money and Credit

          The   essence of the intermediate target procedure is that,
under it, the central bank is required to respond quickly (and fully)
to any information reflected in the movements of whatever the
intermediate target happens to be. Under the current framework
in the United States, with monetary aggregates used as the interme-
diate   targets, any movement    in the public's money holdings therefore
creates   a presumption that the Federal Reserve System should

react. In principle the Federal Reserve is always free to change

the money growth targets, of course, but in practice it is typically

reluctant to do so. The intermediate target strategy instead

calls   for actions   aimed at regaining the stated targets, so that

the economic signals contained in thovements of the monetary

aggregates create a presumption of immediate response. By contrast,

the presumption of this strategy, strictly implemented, is that

there will be no response to signals arising from other sources

but not reflected in the intermediate targets.

         This procedure makes sense only if the relationship of the

intermediate target to the nonfinancial objectives of monetary

policy is more than just that of a mirror providing a reflection.

Targeting a financial aggregate that merely moved in step with

nonfinancial activity, without signaling subsequent non financial

outcomes,   would provide no advantages over directly targeting
some aspect of nonfinancial activity itself.12 Instead, current
movements of the intermediate target must contain information
about   the future movements of nonfinancial monetary policy objectives.

Hence   the finding that the credit-to—income relationship is as
                                  —15—




regular and   as   stable as the money—to—income relationship would

be of little interest in a policy context if the economic behavior

underlying these results were such that money "causes" income

while income in turn "causes" credit, in the sense of causality

that, as Granger (1969) and Sims (1972) have shown, corresponds

to econometric exogeneity.

         Table 3 summarizes the evidence on the interrelationships

among money, credit, income and prices, based again on quarterly

data for 1959-80. The top panel of the table presents F-statistics

for the test of the null hypothesis that all of the eight coefficients

in each respective polynomial are zero, in each successive equation

in   the trivariate   autoregression (5) in which the financial

aggregate variable is defined as the Ml    money stock. The middle
panel presents     analogous F—statistics for   the corresponding
trivariate autoregression    in which the financial aggregate is total

net credit.

        These results are not consistent with any simple proposition
that money "causes" income while income "causes" credit. If anything,
they suggest the opposite. Past credit innovations contain more
significant information about    the variation of either real income

or prices than do past money innovations. Similarly, both real

income innovations and price innovations are highly significant

in the money equation in the top panel, but only the price innova-

tions are (marginally) significant in the credit equation in the

middle panel. Moreover, the corresponding results shown in the

bottom panel of the table, for the four—variable analog to (5)

are also inconsistent with any simple money—then—income—then—credit
             13
reasoning.

         It is also possible to examine in greater generality the

extent to which movements of money and credit contain information

about the subsequent movements of nonfinancial economic activity.

Table 4 presents a dynamic decomposition of the respective variances

of real income and prices, based on the moving—average representation

of the four-variable autoregression (including both money and

credit as well as real income and prices) underlying the bottom

panel of Table 3. Specifically, Table 4 shows, for both real

income and prices, and for time horizons extending from one

quarter to two years, the percentage of variance accounted for by

innovations in each of the four variables in the system (including,
                                              14
of course, the variable under study itself).       Because the

results of a variance decomposition (unlike the exogeneity test

results presented in Table 3) clearly depend on the ordering imposed

in orthogonalizing the moving—average system,15 the table presents

corresponding sets of results for four different orderings: for

the two financial aggregates ordered either before or after real

income and prices, and for money ordered either before or after

credit   within the pair of financial variables.
         The variance decomposition results shown in Table 4   indicate

that   the comparisons based on statistical significance in Table 3

generally carry over to comparisons based on quantitative significance.

en ordered first, the financial aggregates together account for

one—third or more of the variance of real income after the initial

quarter. If money is ordered before credit, the division between

the two aggregates depends on the time horizon, with money appearing

more   important than credit for a year, and vice versa thereafter.
By contrast, if     credit   is ordered before money, it   appears   more

important throughout. When ordered after the nonfinancial variables,
the financial aggregates together account for less of the variance
of real income, in a pattern that slowly builds toward one-fifth
of   the total. The division between money and credit again depends

on the time horizon if money is ordered before credit, and           again
favors credit throughout if credit is ordered before money.

           surprising aspect of these results is that the two
         One

financial variables together consistently account for a smaller
fraction of the variance of prices than of real income. When the

financial aggregates are ordered first, that share barely exceeds

one—tenth, even after two years. When the financial aggregates

are ordered after real income and prices, the corresponding share

is almost negligible. Within these smaller amounts, credit usually

(but not always) accounts for more of variance of prices than does

money.

         Because   these results change importantly according to not

just the ordering among the variables but also the sample period

used, it would be unwise to rely heavily on them in any very

specific way.16 A conservative interpretation of the results

presented in Tables 3 and 4 is to conclude that current movements

of financial aggregates do contain information, which is at least
                              —18—




potentially of quantitative importance, about future movements of
nonfinancial economic activity, and that the information about
nonfinancial activity contained in total net credit is at least
comparable to that contained in the narrow money stock. More
generally, yet another mode of analysis that potentially could
indicate a more important role for money than for credit as an
intermediate target variable does not do so.

III. Controlling Money and Credit

       The criteria that determine the suitability of any financial

variable as an intermediate target for monetary policy include

a relationship not Only to the nonfinancial objectives of policy

but also to the operating instruments that the central bank can

control directly —    in   the U.S. context, once again, either reserves

or a short—term interest rate. For example, although common

stock prices in the United States are a well known leading indicator

of business activity, there is little evidence to suggest that the

Federal Reserve could exert sufficiently close control over the

stock market to make it a good monetary policy target.17 There

would be little point in having an intermediate target that the

central bank could not expect to affect reasonably closely, within

some plausible time horizon (like a calendar quarter or a half—year)

determined by considerations of what matters for the economy as

well as what provides political accountability.18

       The broader the scope of any financial aggregate — on

either the asset or the liability side of the economy's balance

sheet — and the greater the variety of institutions and individuals

involved   in supplying and demanding it,   the   more problematic at
the a priori   level is the connection between that aggregate and

the instruments under the central bank's direct control. Even

in the case of the narrow money stock, the number and complexity

of the linkages relating its movements to movements of reserves

(or the monetary base) are fairly burdensome at either the analytical

or the operational level)9 This problem is likely to be more
                                          —20—




 severe   for the broader monetary aggregates; and, at least in

 principle, total net credit could turn out to be even harder to

 relate to reserves than M2 or M3. In the end, however, the

 potential controllability of any such aggregate, either narrow or

 broad, depends on a diverse set of substitution responses character-

 izing the behavior of many           different     kinds of individual and

 institutional portfolios.

          The top panel of Table 5 provides summary statistics for

the estimation, using quarterly data for 1959-80, of the relationship

three sets of distributed lag coefficients constrained to lie
along respective third-order polynomials with the implied

total   net   credit) performs better on an overall basis than does
that   for any of the three monetary aggregates. The credit equation

has a quarterly standard error of 0.4%, or 1.4% per annum. By

contrast, the Ml and M2 equations both show standard errors of

2.5% per annum, and the M3 equation's standard error is 2.6%
              21
per annum.

         It is always possible,         of course, that a close      overall

fit in a relationship like (6) may reflect only the closeness of

the   aggregate's relation to income,                    without any       implication   at
all   of a connection to the reserves instrument. The top two panels

of Table 6 show the full sets of estimated coefficients for the

credit and Ml equations summarized in the top panel of Table 5.

Although credit is more closely related to the income terms in the

equation than is Ml, as a comparison of the t-statistics on the

respective          values and their sum indicates, it is not the case

that credit lacks any connection to the reserves instrument. A

comparison of the t-statistics on the respective S                            values   shows

that the connection to reserves is somewhat weaker for credit

           Except for the case of Ml, the Du.rbin—Watson statistic for

each of the estimates of (6) shown                    in   the top panel of Table 5

including a distributed lag (estimated analogously to the others) on

the lagged dependent variable. To the extent that recent movements

of an aggregate contain information that the Federal Reserve can

use in setting the growth of nonborrowed reserves so as to achieve

the targeted growth for that aggregate, (7) is a more reliable

guide than (6) to the accuracy to be expected on a quarter—to—

         The Federal Reserve System has used the quantity of

nonborrowed reserves as its operating instrument since October

1979, but there is no assurance that it will always do

Hence it is useful to know whether the results found by estimating

(6) and (7) carry over to an alternative choice of instrument.

statistics   for estimating, again using quarterly data for 1959-80,

the analogous relationships

Although the specific results vary somewhat in comparison to
those shown in the two panels above, the superior performance
of the equation for total net credit continues as before, with
standard   errors again equal to 1.4% and 1.1% per annum without

and with the lagged credit values, respectively.

        The final two panels of Table 6 show the full sets of

coefficients   estimated for (8)      using total net credit and Ml as

the   financial aggregate. Here the t—statistics on the estimated
5   values show that the connection between credit and the federal
funds rate instrument is somewhat more significant than that for

instrument. Even so, the t—statjstjcs on the respective coefficient

sums   are   small (in absolute value) for both credit and       24
        The overall conclusion suggested by this evidence on the

quarterly relationships is that the connection between          total net
credit ai-id   either   a reserves or an   interest   rate monetary policy

instrument is roughly comparable to the relationship for the

monetary aggregates.

Iv.    Using Monthly Data on Money and Credit

         The analysis in Section III in effect proceeds as if the

Federal Reserve System, in seeking to control its money and/or

credit growth targets over a calendar quarter, would decide on

the growth of nonborrowed reserves (or the level of the federal

funds rate) at the beginning of that quarter and then take no

further action until the beginning of the next quarter. Such

a procedure would be sensible only if data describing the within-

quarter movements of money and credit were either not available

at all or were sufficiently "noisy" to be useless. In fact, data

on both money and credit are available on at least a monthly

basis (weekly for Ml). The noisiness of these short—run data,

as indicated by subsequent revisions, is well known (especially

for the weekly Ml series); but there is no reason to believe that

the incoming monthly data are so poor as to be of no use at all

in   making within-quarter adjustments 25
         Although the standard vehicle   in which the Federal Reserve

System publishes data on the total net credit aggregate is the

flow—of—funds accounts, a publication which appears only once per

quarter, the great bulk of the underlying data is actually a

available monthly. Indeed, the Federal Reserve currently maintains,

on an unpublished basis, a monthly credit data file. As of

yearend 1980, the total net credit measure for the United States

was $3,907.5 billion, of which $3,436.1 billion, or 88%, consisted

of items regularly reported each month and included in the Federal

Reserve's   monthly   data file. Somewhat ironically, many of the items
                                  —25—




not included in this monthly data file represent the lending
activities of various components of the federal government itself.26
Of the $471.4 billion of 1980 yearend total net credit not included

in the monthly data file, $290.7 billion represented credit

advanced directly by the U.S. Government or by its sponsored credit

agencies and mortgage poois. If the Federal Reserve were merely

to collect from the relevant agencies of the federal government

the kind of data it already has on the private sector, therefore,

more than 95% of the total net credit aggregate would be available

monthly.

       Even   without any   extra data reporting on the government's

part, however, the information contained in the 88% of total net

credit which is currently included each month is hardly without

value for monetary policy. For the 1963-77 sample period (the

longest interval for which seasonally adjusted credit series now

exist in the Federal Reserve's monthly data file 27), the correlation

between the total net credit series reported in the flow—of-funds

accounts   and the quarterly   "total" net credit series formed by

using only the end-of-quarter months of the corresponding monthly

series is .99985. Moreover, the relationship between nonfinancial

economic activity and this quarterly "total" net credit series is

fully comparable to that shown for the actual total net credit

series in Section I.

      Table 7 presents summary statistics for monthly analogs to

the quarterly relationships (6) and (8) in the form

V. Summary of Conclusions

       The principal criteria for the selection of an intermediate

target for monetary policy are (1) that the target be closely

related to the nonfinancial objectives of monetary policy, (2)

that it contain information about the future movements of those

relevant aspects of the nonfinancial economy, (3) that it be

closely connected to the instruments over which the central bank

can exert direct control, and (4) that data on it be readily

available on a timely basis.

       The empirical evidence considered in this paper supports a

positive conclusion — at least in comparison with the major

monetary aggregates — about the potential use of total net credit

as an intermediate target variable on each of these four criteria.

First, the relationship between total net credit and aggregate

measures of nonfinancial economic activity, judged by several

different methodological approaches, is as stable and reliable as

the corresponding relationship for any of the monetary aggregates

(or the monetary base). Second, dynamic analysis based on exogeneity

tests and decomposition of variance shows that the information

about subsequent movements in nonfinancial activity contained in

total net credit is at least comparable to that contained in the

Ml money stock. Third, relationships between total net credit

and either the quantity of nonborrowed reserves or the federal

funds rate are roughly comparable to the corresponding relationships

for the principal monetary aggregates. Finally, data for a close

approximation to total net credit are available on a monthly basis,
                               —29—




and the relevant relationships based on the monthly data are also

roughly comparable to the corresponding relationships for the

monetary aggregates.

        These conclusions consistently support the use of total

net credit as an intermediate target for monetary policy, either

together with or instead of one of the monetary aggregates —

as long as the Federal Reserve System continues to operate within

the   intermediate target framework, It is important to note
explicitly, however, that the interpretation of empirical results
throughout   this paper is entirely relative in context. The essential

question asked, in each case, is whether or not total net credit

meets a specific criterion at least as well as any or all of the

more familiar monetary aggregates, and in each case the answer is

yes. These results therefore bear importantly on what intermediate

targets the Federal Reserve should use, as long as it uses any

at all; but they leave open the more fundamental question of

whether the intermediate target framework itself is the best

way to conduct monetary policy in the current environment.

*   I am grateful to Richard Clarida for research assistance and
    many helpful discussions; to Robert Rasche, Carl christ and

    other   conference participants, as well as to Stephen Taylor,

    for useful comments on an            earlier     draft; and    to   the National

    Science    Foundation (grant SES81—12673) and the Alfred P. Sloan
    Foundation for research support.
1.      In the early post—war years, the Federal Reserve was obligated

       to   peg bond     prices. After the 1951 Treasury-Federal Reserve

       Accord, u.s. monetary policy followed a "free reserves"

       strategy that was essentially equivalent to setting nominal

       interest rates; see, for example, Davis (1971). During the

       late 1960s monetary policy was focused on short—term nominal

       interest rates directly.

2. It is difficult to be precise about when the Federal Reserve

       began focusing on monetary targets in an important way.
       Congress     did not ask the Federal Reserve to announce its

       monetary     targets in advance until 1975, but the Federal

       Open Market Committee started including a monetary growth

       target in its monetary policy directives in 1970. For evidence

       on   the importance of monetary aggregate targets in Federal
       Reserve policymaking during these years, see De Rosa and Stern
       (1977),     Diggins (1978), Feige and McGee (1979), and Lombra
       and Moran (1980).
3. This section draws heavily on my earlier papers, especially

   Friedman (1981, 1982a); see those papers for more complete

   descriptions of the data and more complete sets of empirical

   results.

4. The three monetary aggregates all follow the Federal Reserve's

   new (post-1980) definitions. The reason for including bank

   credit is that the Federal Reserve currently includes a

   bank credit target, along with the targets for the monetary

   aggregates, in its semi—annual reports to Congress.

5. This   is the specification originally made popular by the
   Federal    Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Its use here is intended

   to facilitate ready comparisons. Even so, the precise details

   of the specification do not matter much. For example, the

    standard errors for the estimation of (1) subject to no

    constraints at all on the    and y coefficients are .00738 for

    total net credit, .00863 for bank credit, .00709 for Ml,

    .00820 for M2, .00835 for M3, and .00825 for the monetary

   base, changing the lag length apparently does not matter

   much either.

6. The estimated values also look about as plausible for

    total net credit as for the monetary aggregates. The estimated

    values (and associated t—statistics) for total net credit are

    .958 (4.0), .541 (4.0), —.097 (—0.4), —.349 (—2,7) and —.155

    (—0.6), with sum .899 (5.0). The corresponding values for Ml,

    for example, are .437 (3.8), .437 (5.9), .245 (2.6), .043

    (0.6) and —.056 (—0.5), with sum 1.106 (6.3). The sum of
    coefficients is near unity in both cases, as expected, while
    the   individual coefficients on total net credit decline more

    rapidly than do those on Ml and           even   show one significant

   negative value, thereby suggesting a more complicated response

   pattern of income.

7. 2xnong the most important criticisms of the St. Louis approach

   have been those of Goldfeld and Blinder (1972), Sargent (1976),

   and Modigliani and 2ndo (1976). The methodology underlying

   the tests described below is due largely to Granger and Sims;

   see especially Sims (1980).

8. The orthogonization procedure is

   for 7, =                                This orthogonalization is
              cov(p1,p2)/var(.i1).
   equivalent to placing F last in the pairwise causal ordering

   of   y and F. The   alternative ordering placing F first, which

   follows    from transposing the X (or —A) and the zero elements,
   gives results that are close to those reported below, indicating
   that the arbitrarily selected ordering of the orthogonalization
   does   not matter much here. See Friedman (1981)            for the full
   set of results based on both orderings.
 9. Analogous simulations, showing the dynamic response of

     each respective F/Y ratio to a 1% innovation in Y, showed

     little difference from one definition of F to another; see

     Friedman (1981).

10. The full set of results presented in Friedman (1981) showed

     sharply unstable relationships for other credit aggregates,

     including measures either narrower or broader than total net

     credit. Similar instability for these other credit measures

     appeared in simulations of the trivariate systems corresponding

     to those shown in the bottom half of Table 2.

11, Analogous simulations, showing the dynamic response of each

    respective F/(X'P) ratio to a 1% innovation in either x or

    P, showed more limited differences from one definition of F

    to another; see again Friedman (1981).

12. An exception,    which is probably not of much practical importance,
     is the case in which data on the aggregate are available before
     data on income. The data—lag case has received a good deal
    of attention in the literature, primarily because it is
     isomorphic   to the more relevant case of structural economic

     lags; see Friedman (1975).

13. The exogeneity test results shown in Table 3 differ in several

    interesting respects from those based on the pre—1980 Ml

    definition and a 1953—78 sample period in Friedman (l982a),

    which indicated more fully parallel roles for money and

    credit. For example, the F—statistics corresponding to the

    four-variable    system shown in the bottom panel were (by
     rows, as in Table 3) 10.77*, 2.42**, 2.47**, 2.l4**; 0.28,

     59•53*, 1.35, 0.55; 2.50**, 2.67**, 107.11*, 0.92; 1.01,

     1.71, l.95***, 161.10*. Here, in contrast to the results

     shown    in Table 3,    both money and credit are significant in

     the    real    income equation, while neither is (individually)

     significant in the price equation.

14. To recall, the moving-average representation, analogous to

     (2),    expresses all movement in each variable in terms of the
     history    of innovations corresponding to itself and other

     variables in the system.

15. see again footnote 8. The orthogonalization procedure for

     the    four—variable system is analogous. The simple correlations
    of the estimated innovations (before orthogonalization) are
     .58, p =        .33,     = —.03,       =             = —.10 and MC =    -.21.
16. See     again   footnote 13.
17. Shiller (1980) has also questioned the central bank's ability
     to influence real interest rates. Although most economists
    have accepted the central bank's ability to control short-
    term interest rates, at least over short time horizons and
    in nonpathological circumstances, doubt about the ability to
    control long—term interest rates is of long standing.
18. Even in the absence of any                 at all, however,
                                        controllability

    a variable could serve as a monetary policy "information
    variable" in the sense of Kareken et al. (1973) and           Friedman

     (1975)
19. See, for example, the work of Johannes and Rasche (1979,

    1981) and Tinsley et al. (1981).

20. Equations of this form have become standard since the work

    of Davis and Shadrack (1974). As in the case of the St.

    Louis equations presented in Section I, the use of the

    Davis—Schadrack form here is intended to facilitate ready

    comparisons. n additional variable included by Davis and

    Shadrack, the quantity of government deposits, is omitted

    here and in (7) - (11) below because preliminary experimenta-

    tion indicated that its coefficent was never significantly

    nonzero. Experimentation not reported here also indicated

    that the nature of the constraint imposed on the respective

    distributed lags had no noticeable implications for the results.

21. Interpretation of these relationships is subject to the usual

    caveats     regarding whether they are true reduced forms; even
    if   so,   whether the underlying behavior would remain invariant
    to   systematic changes in the conduct of policy; and whether

    the use of within—quarter corrections, based on incoming

    data, would significantly matter. Although a structural

    approach like that implemented in Friedman (1977) or Sivesind

    and Hurley (1980) would be preferable, in that it would at

     least address the first of these potential problems, such

    an effort lies beyond the scope of this paper. The results

    presented in Section IV below bear on the issue of within-

    quarter corrections.
22. One    contrast   between the estimated 5   values   shown for credit

     and   those   shown for Ml in the top two panels of Table 6 is

     that   the implied polynomial for credit has an unstable root
     while that for Ml does not. Single—minded use of the reserves
     instrument    to control a credit target, without any     allowance
     for the uncertainty associated with the estimated coefficient

     values, would therefore lead to "instrument instability"

     in the sense outlined by Holbrook (1972). The relevance of

     this result is dubious, however, since credit would probably

    not    be the sole intermediate target, and since the optimal
    policy    would allow for uncertainty in the manner shown by

    Brainard (1967) in any case.

23. Indeed, as of the time of writing there is some debate over

    whether it is still doing so.

24. The 5 values shown in the bottom two panels of Table 6 indicate

    unstable polynomials with a federal funds       rate   instrument

    for    both credit and Ml.   See again footnote 22.

25. A potentially useful exercise, which lies beyond the scope

    of this paper, would be to compare the relative extent to

    which the monthly credit data and monetary aggregate data,

    respectively,  are subject to revision.
26. In practice the bulk of the credit data is gathered from
    reporting by lenders. In principle, of course, the relevant
    information could be gathered from either lenders or borrowers.
27. After    1977 the Federal Pserve ceased performing seasonal
    adjustments to its monthly credit data file. The Federal
     Reserve staff is currently developing a seasonally adjusted
    monthly credit data file that will be up to date. Once these
    new data are available, it will be straightforward to carry
    out the empirical work presented below on a current sample.
28. For example, the coefficient of variation of the ratio of
    quarterly       "total" net credit to gross national product over

    1963—77 is .016 on the basis of the raw data and .010 on

    the basis of the detrended data, The summary statistics

    for    the nominal income equation (1), estimated for the

    1963—77 sample period, are SE = .00762,      2 =      23 and

    DW =    2.25.    These results are comparable to the results for

    total net credit (and superior to those for the monetary

    aggregates) for the experiments in Table 1 redone for the

    1963—77 sample.

29. Use of the business sales variable, in the absence of monthly

    data on the gross national product, again follows Davis and

    Schadrack (1974).

30. Because they tend to be more volatile than credit (or Ml)
                                                     2
    on a monthly basis, M2 and M3 show larger            values despite

    the larger standard errors.

31. As in the results based on quarterly data, the estimated

    values indicate an unstable polynomial for credit (though not

    Ml) with a reserves instrument, and for both credit and Ml

    with a federal funds rate instrument.
