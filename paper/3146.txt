              REAL WAGES, MONETARY ACCOMMODATION, AND INFLATION


                                       ABSTRACT

      We     analyze    the     dynamics     of      inflation in an economy

characterized by        a     forward-looking,         staggered,       price and

wage determination           process, and         by monetary accommodation.

In our model,     inflation reconciles the conflicting claims of

workers and      firms.        The model      is capable          of generating a

positive association between real                 wages     and     inflation, of

the   type     that    has     been     observed      in some high-inflation

countries.      It generates          a price-wage        spiral but     does not

result in inflationary inertia.
