                                          ABSTRACT

In 2008, Uganda granted hundreds of small groups $400/person to help members start individual
skilled trades. Four years on, an experimental evaluation found grants raised earnings by 38%
(Blattman, Fiala, Martinez 2014). We return after 9 years to find these start-up grants acted more
as a kick-start than a lift out of poverty. Grantees' investment leveled off; controls eventually
increased their incomes through business and casual labor; and so both groups converged in
employment, earnings, and consumption. Grants had lasting impacts on assets, skilled work, and
possibly child health, but had little effect on mortality, fertility, health or education.

1       Introduction
To reduce poverty, governments and nonprofits commonly grant cash, livestock, or equipment
to poor people who propose to start very basic businesses. These programs not only vary in
the kinds of capital they grant, but also by whom they target, funding conditions, and what
other services are bundled with the business capital. But the same assumptions underlie
most grant-focused programs: that many of the poor have high returns to capital, but face
constraints on their ability to borrow, save, or mitigate risk.1 If true, then a one-time grant
of capital may help the poor overcome financial imperfections, start microenterprises (like
livestock-raising or petty trading), and raise their incomes.
    Broadly speaking, evaluations 1–4 years after these programs typically show that recipi-
ents raised their incomes compared to randomized control groups.2 Results vary, of course,
and some programs show no impacts at all. But on the whole, these short- and medium-term
results have bolstered the view that poverty, combined with start-up costs and imperfect fi-
nancial markets, hold many poor people below their potential.
    This includes the Youth Opportunities Program (YOP) in Uganda, the focus of this
paper. YOP granted one-time cash grants to small groups that planned to set their members
up as craftspersons. In an earlier follow-up, we found that 4 years after the intervention YOP
increased average earnings by 38% and consumption by 10% (Blattman et al., 2014). This
    1
      Banerjee and Duflo (2011) give one of the most comprehensive summaries of this evidence. Other recent
summaries include Cho and Honorati (2014); Blattman and Ralston (2015); McKenzie (2017).
    2
      In post-conflict northern Uganda, a program giving women $150 grants, basic training and follow-up led
to large income gains 18 months after the grants (Blattman et al., 2016). Other studies show that grants of
cash and in-kind capital to less poor, existing entrepreneurs in Sri Lanka, Ghana and India lead to sustained
increases in earnings 1–5 years later (de Mel et al., 2012; Fafchamps et al., 2014; Hussam et al., 2017). And
cash grants to poor farmers in Mali raised farm inputs and incomes after 1 and 2 years (Beaman et al.,
2018). Across seven countries, multifaceted programs that give grants of livestock alongside basic training
and temporary income support show sustained increases on the incomes and consumption of the poorest
rural households four years after grants (Banerjee et al., 2015; Bandiera et al., 2013, 2017). Most conditional
cash transfer programs do not target (or measure) investment an earnings, but there is some evidence from
a Mexican national program that cash relieves important financial constraints and leads to higher income
after 1–2 years (Gertler et al., 2012; Bianchi and Bobba, 2013). Of course the effects of capital grants are
not universally positive. Fiala (2018) fails to find income effects from cash grants to existing businesses in
Uganda. In one of the multifaceted livestock programs, in Ghana, a grant of goats alone (without other
program components) has no effect on incomes after 2 or 3 years (Banerjee et al., 2018). A cash grant
programs to young men living on the streets of Monrovia and engaged in petty crime also had very short-
lived impacts (less than one year) on enterprise and earnings, potentially due to the unusual instability
and risk of their existence (Blattman et al., 2017). Karlan et al. (2014) find that cash grants to Ghanaian
farmers had not effect without insurance, also because of the constraints from imperfect insurance. And in
Kenya, a multifaceted “microfranchising” program that includes capital finds earnings gain in the first nine
months but not after 1.5 years (Brudevold-Newman et al., 2017). We omit for the moment a discussion
of unconditional cash transfer programs that are not designed to support business plans and raise incomes.
The framing, targeting, and packaging with other conditions or services distinguishes these enterprise capital
programs. We will discuss these other programs and their results below.

paper returns to examine impacts 9 years after the grants.
    While programs like YOP are often styled as a “lift out of poverty”, theory tells us
to be more cautious. In a standard model of occupational choice with financial market
imperfections, one-time grants could have either temporary or lasting effects. It largely
depends how serious the constraints and frictions that hold people back in the absence of
grants are. For example, if credit-constrained poor people increase their work hours or
have the means to save and invest some portion of their earnings over time, eventually they
will be able to start similar businesses and will converge to the same level of income and
investment as a grant recipient. In this case, the main question is, “how long before the
control group converges?” Convergence will slow down if wages are low, saving is costly, if
there are especially high start-up costs, if people are impatient or myopic, or if there are
other market failures or social constraints that limit people’s earnings and investment.
    With enough frictions and constraints, it is possible that poor people stagnate without
grants. If so, programs that grant cash, livestock or equipment could indeed be powerful tools
for lifting people out of poverty. But this may be a relatively special case. In our illustrative
model, for instance, a failure to converge requires extremely low initial assets, very low
labor productivity in the traditional sector, and/or an inability to save. The world’s poorest
may face such constraints, and so it is possible that grants have lasting effects on income.
So far, however, the empirical development literature has failed to find many instances of
household-level poverty traps (Banerjee and Duflo, 2011; Kraay and McKenzie, 2014). Long
run evidence on enterprise capital grants, from multiple sites and programs, is thus crucial
information.
    Long run results speak to another important empirical question: whether higher incomes
have positive effects within the household over time, such as increasing children’s health
and education or (as we observed in the 4-year follow-up of YOP) more political engagement
(Blattman et al., 2018). Even temporary income gains could have long-lasting effects through
these channels.
    With YOP, the Government of Uganda invited groups of about 20 poor young people
to submit grant applications of roughly $400 per person—an amount slightly greater than
their annual incomes (using 2008 dollars and market exchange rates). Groups pre-specified
how they would use the grants to hire their own vocational trainers, buy start-up tools and
materials, and set themselves up as individual tradespersons. If selected, they received a
one-time grant of roughly $8000 into a community bank account and were left to themselves
to make bulk purchases or otherwise share the funds, free of supervision or future follow-up.
    YOP targeted small towns and villages in the poorer and underdeveloped periphery of
the country. The districts in our sample were not directly affected by some of the region’s


                                               2

long-running conflicts, but they were close to unstable regions. With peace in these nearby
areas, the entire region was growing economically.
     We worked with the government to set YOP up as as a randomized trial, with more than
12,000 people in 535 eligible groups, 265 of which were funded. We attempted to follow a
random subsample of five people in all 535 groups after 2, 4 and (in this paper) 9 years.
Effective attrition is 14% in the most recent round.
     Nine years after the grants were delivered we see convergence in the income and employ-
ment of treatment and control groups. Figures 1 and 2 show the progression of average weekly
work hours and monthly self-reported earnings over time, by treatment status. The earnings
figure also reports earnings residuals after accounting for district fixed effects (necessary for
causal identification) and baseline controls (which improve precision and help account for
selective attrition and mild imbalance).
     Our assessment is that YOP operated more like a “kick start” for underemployed young
people, rather than a sustained solution to poverty. The start-up grants helped youth with
little capital to test their skills and luck in micro-entrepreneurship. But in the absence of
this start-up capital, control group members eventually saved and accumulated enterprise
capital and expanded their earnings opportunities. YOP’s main lasting impacts after 9 years
are a slight increase in fixed assets and a sustained increase in the likelihood of engaging in
a skilled trade.
     Four rounds of panel data and treatment effects, described in this paper, largely support
this narrative. At baseline, the average person in our sample was 24 years old and had just

11 hours of work per week. After 9 years, however, both groups reported roughly 45 hours
of income-generating work per week in the past month.
    In the beginning, YOP recipients invested some of their grant in skill acquisition but
mostly they bought tools and materials. Treatment helped people quickly boost hours of
work in a skilled trade, one generating more hours of employment and cash earnings. After
4 years, the treatment group reported 38% greater earnings and 11% greater consumption
than controls. These income gains appear to come largely from more work hours. The
income gains were small in relative terms—roughly $0.75 a day in purchasing power parity
terms (PPP). But given that the sample only earned about PPP $2 a day, that extra 75
cents could be the difference between having two and three meals a day, or medicine for a
sick child.
    However, by the 4-year mark we were already seeing evidence of capital stocks converging,
even if employment and incomes had not. On average, YOP grant recipients had stopped
growing their capital stocks. We also observed the average control group member slowly
accumulating capital and using it to start microenterprises, especially in petty trade and
other business rather than skilled trades.
    Between year 4 and 9, work hours and real incomes in the treatment group continued
to grow, but control hours and incomes grew at a slightly faster rate. After 9 years, the
treatment and control groups have identical work hours. Measures of income flow have
also more or less converged: treatment group earnings are just 5% larger than the control
group, and treatment group consumption is just 1.4% greater. None of these differences are
statistically significant.
    The most persistent economic effects of YOP are on assets and occupational choice. YOP
recipients have 0.12 standard deviations greater household assets such as home quality or
livestock. Grant recipients are also slightly more likely to be in skilled trades rather than
petty business. If we interpolate annual program effects on earnings with a 5% discount rate,
we estimate a present value of total earnings gains of roughly $665—almost twice the size of
the grant (excluding administrative costs, which are unknown).
    Of course, these temporary earnings gains and greater assets can be a victory against
poverty if they lead to investments in health or education, especially better outcomes for
children. Yet we see relatively limited health and education effects on the YOP recipients
or their children.
    We asked study participants about child enrollment and grade attainment, the general
health of each child, their physical functioning along a number of dimensions, and rates
of miscarriage and child mortality. These parent-reported data are error-prone and noisy,
especially when men live away from their children or have had children with multiple partners


                                             5
(a major reason why it is costly and difficult to survey the children directly). We expect this
to affect the precision of treatment effects rather than bias impacts, however, since we see
few reasons the measurement error should be correlated with treatment.
    We see no program impact on the number, age, composition, or survival of children. We
also see little change in child school enrollment or grade attainment. Children born after
the YOP grant, however, have about 0.08 standard deviations greater physical functioning.
This seems to be concentrated almost entirely among women assigned to YOP. They report
children with 0.17 standard deviations greater functioning (versus 0.036 for men). Thus
there is slight evidence of long run gains from the temporary income boost.
    Despite the proliferation of evaluations of capital grants, such long run data are rare. Our
findings, however, are consistent with a recent study in Ethiopia. Blattman et al. (2018) find
that cash grants of $300 plus basic business consulting raised incomes by a third in the first
year, but that employment and earnings converged within 5 years.3 Another example, in
Bangladesh, is more ambiguous. Bandiera et al. (2017) find that a multifaceted program of
livestock grants plus skills and other services have 4-year impacts strikingly similar to YOP.
After 7 years, some of their evidence suggests that the gains persist, though this estimate is
complicated by half of the control villages beginning to be treated.
    The patterns identified in this paper are consistent with our own model of investment and
occupational choice, as well as more elaborate structural models and program simulations
by Buera et al. (2015, 2014). In the absence of extreme frictions or poverty traps, these
models all predict that the positive economic impacts of entrepreneurship capital grants can
be short-lived if the returns to capital are diminishing and people can acquire capital in
absence of the program.
    These models also suggest that the largest and most sustained impacts come from tar-
geting people with high entrepreneurial productivity and low initial wealth. For example,
Hussam et al. (2017) also show that Indian microentrepreneurs and their communities have
good private information about entrepreneurial productivity and returns to capital, and these
returns are extremely heterogeneous. Beaman et al. (2018) also see substantial heterogeneity
in returns to capital among Malian farmers, and high productivity credit constrained farmers
select into loans when they become available.4 Note that, by design, YOP took many efforts
   3
     Studying a multifaceted “microfranchising” program in Nairobi, Kenya, Brudevold-Newman et al. (2017)
see income gains after 9 months but none after 1.5 years. This could imply rapid convergence, though the
authors interpret the results as evidence of a savings constraint, implying that the participants’ did not have
high returns to capital (or, more specifically, this multifaceted program).
   4
     In villages where farmers were eligible for loans, those who did not take out loans did not have high
returns to subsequent grants, while farmers in villages ineligible for loans did have high average returns. The
evidence is not always so clear; Karlan et al. (2014) experiment with cash grants to farmers in Ghana, and
find some evidence that insurance market imperfections are great enough that the returns to capital alone



                                                      6
to target this promising demographic of capital-poor, high-ability, high-initiative poor young
people. More research on the effectiveness of targeting strategies could be of value.
    Yet while these standard models give us many reasons to eventually expect temporary
gains, it is striking how few policy analyses and papers on these programs dwell on conver-
gence—including our own 4-year evaluation of YOP (Blattman et al 2014). We, like many
others, implicitly framed the grants program as a potential solution to poverty and failed to
weigh what briefer impacts would imply for theory and practice.
    Convergence is especially relevant for high-cost programs. Some common intervention
components—including beneficiary targeting, physical asset delivery, or skills training—can
be expensive to deliver relative to the very low earnings of most microenterprises. For
example, programs to deliver livestock, training, and income support to ultrapoor households
in 6 countries estimated that the 3-year impacts would have to persist or grow for at least
a dozen more years in order for consumption gains to outweigh program costs (Banerjee
et al., 2015). Persistent gains are plausible given that the ultrapoor have such limited ability
to save, and low counterfactual earnings. But clearly the pace of convergence is a first-
order question for any program model that spends large sums on targeting or other program
components. (Though this was not an issue for YOP. Cumulative earnings of participants
equaled program costs by the 4-year follow-up, and likely grew afterwards.)
    Another strain of anti-poverty programs, not discussed so far, provide unconditional cash
transfers (UCTs) to the poor. Two evaluations find short-term increases in consumption and
assets, as recipients spend the money, but they find no evidence of investment or income gains
over 2–4 years.5 These differ from programs like YOP in many ways, but one hypothesis
that income gains are much more likely in programs that target people with high returns to
investment, stated investment plans, or compulsions to invest.6
are not high.
    5
      Baird et al. (2017, 2011) look at small monthly conditional cash transfers (CCTs) and UCTs to adolescent
girls in Malawi, sustained over three years, where the CCT is conditioned on school attendance. At the end of
this program of transfers, and 2 years afterwards, they see little effect on incomes. They also see convergence
after early gains in teen pregnancy, early marriage, and sexually transmitted infections. Haushofer and
Shapiro (2016, 2018) evaluate UCTs from GiveDirectly in Kenyan villages after 9 months and 3 years, and
find sustained increases in assets between treatment and control villages, but no consumption impacts. They
do find consumption differences between treated and “spillover” households within treated villages, but it is
not clear if this evidence of an income gain or an adverse spillover.
    6
      Yet another common program has been to give poor people access to cheap finance. In principle micro-
loans should solve the credit market imperfections that constrain microentrepreneurs. But lending and
banking such small sums of money for so many people can be expensive. Also, it is hard to improve
institutions that reduce the loan market’s information and collection problems. As a result, interest rates on
micro-loans tend to be very high. That and the short time periods for repayment of most micro-loans can
make them poor vehicles for business investment. This potentially one reason why some recent micro-lending
experiments show little or no impact on the earnings of most loan clients. See for example Banerjee (2013);
Banerjee et al. (2015). Of course, better targeted, cheaper microfinance with longer repayment periods could



                                                      7
    Tentatively, one might conclude that some of the poor have high returns to capital and
face financial market imperfections, and grants help them start successful microenterprises.
This might be especially true for the young, the poorest, in the places with the worst access
to credit, and growing local economies (though these conditions are fairly speculative). If
so, then the important policy and theoretical questions are in identifying who these people
are, what precise constraints bind, and how to make the most difference.


2     Setting
Uganda, a small landlocked country in east Africa, is poor but with a stable and growing
economy.7 By the mid 2000s, however, most of that growth had been concentrated in the
capital and southwest of the country. One of the government’s highest priorities has been to
develop the northern half of the country.8
    The north is more distant from trade routes and, as an area of early opposition support,
received less public investment from the 1980s onward, especially for power and roads. Partly
because of this marginality, there was also virtually no access to credit for business invest-
ment in 2008. Formal insurance was unknown and the north had almost no formal lenders.
Most villages had no active microfinance organizations. While village rotating savings and
credit associations (ROSCAs) were commonplace, loan terms seldom extended beyond three
months, with annual interest rates of 100 to 200%. Because of high banking fees, real in-
terest rates on formal savings are negative. In 2006 the government estimated that nearly
two-thirds of northern people were unable to meet basic needs, just over half were literate,
and most were under-employed in subsistence agriculture (Government of Uganda, 2007).
    The north was also held back by nearby insecurity. From 1987 to 2006 a low-level
insurgency destabilized districts in north-central Uganda—districts that were not part of
this study, but nonetheless depressed trade and development in the north more broadly.
stimulate the same kinds of entrepreneurship as grants (see for example Feigenberg et al., 2013).Thus we view
microfinance as operating under the model and assumptions as these other entrepreneurship programs. The
theory and evidence of success from the Thai Million Baht Village Fund program is one example (Kaboski
and Townsend, 2011).
    7
      Shortly before the program, in 2007, it had a population of about 30 million and GDP per capita of
roughly $330. Real gross domestic product grew 6.5% per year from 1990 to 2007, inflation was under 5%,
and poverty rates were falling Government of Uganda (2007). This growth puts Uganda’s GDP per capita
slightly above the sub-Saharan average.
    8
      Northern development served at least two government objectives. One was economic, as the government
tried to maximize growth and minimize poverty. The other is political. As multiparty elections become more
and more competitive, and as ruling party support in the capital waned, the ruling National Resistance
Movement appeared to be interested in building a broader base of political support in areas such as the
north. To do so, they pursued a set of broad-based and relatively non-politicized programs such as the one
studied in this paper.


                                                     8
Moreover, wars in Sudan and Democratic Republic of Congo also led to mild insecurity
in the northwest. Finally, cattle rustling and armed banditry were unusually high in the
northeast.
    In 2003, peace came to Uganda’s neighbors, and Uganda’s government increased efforts
to pacify and develop the north. By 2006, the military pushed the rebels out of the country
and began to disarm cattle-raiders. The government also began to improve northern infras-
tructure and South Sudan began to grow rapidly. With this political uncertainty resolved,
by 2008 the northern economy began to catch up to the rest of the country.
    From 2003 to 2010, the centerpiece of the government’s northern development and secu-
rity strategy was a decentralized development program, the Northern Uganda Social Action
Fund, or NUSAF. NUSAF was Uganda’s second-largest development program, after the na-
tional agricultural extension service. Starting in 2003, communities and groups could apply
for cash grants for various purposes: various community infrastructure construction and live-
stock for the very poorest. Since the government wanted to do more to boost non-agricultural
employment, in 2006 it introduced a third NUSAF component: YOP.


3      The Youth Opportunities Program (YOP)
YOP invited groups of young adults, aged roughly 16 to 35, to apply for cash grants in order
to start a skilled trade such as metal fabrication, carpentry or tailoring. The program had
five key elements.

    1. People had to apply as a group. One reason was administrative convenience—it was
       easier to screen and disburse to a few hundred groups rather than thousands of people.
       Another reason is that officials hoped groups would be more likely to implement pro-
       posals rather than waste the cash. Finally, groups could take advantage of economies
       of scale in purchasing tools or hiring trainers (see below). But officials were not aiming
       to create cooperatives. In general, they expected that recipients would set themselves
       up as independent businesses, although they might share some tools or collaborate.
       Groups in our sample of applications ranged from 10 to 40 people, averaging 22, mostly
       from the same parish (a collection of villages). Half the groups existed already, often
       for several years, as farm cooperatives, or sports, drama, or microfinance clubs. New
       groups formed specifically for YOP were often initiated by a respected community
       member (e.g. teachers, local leaders, or existing tradespersons) and sought members
       through social networks. In our sample, 5% of groups are all female and 12% are all
       male, but most groups are mixed—about one-third female on average.


                                                9
2. Groups had to submit a written proposal. The proposal outlined how they would use
   the grant for non-agricultural skills training and enterprise start-up costs. Groups
   could request up to $10,000 (in 2008 market exchange rates). The proposal specified
   member names, a management committee of five, the proposed trade(s), and the assets
   to purchase. Decisions were made by member vote, and nearly all members report
   they had a voice in decisions. Most groups proposed a single trade for all, but a third
   of groups proposed that different members would train in different trades. Females
   and mixed groups often chose trades common to both genders, such as tailoring or
   hairstyling. Males and a small number of females often chose trades such as carpentry
   or welding.
   In preparing the proposal, groups identified their own trainers, typically a local artisan
   or small institute. These are commonplace in Uganda (as in much of Africa) and there is
   a tradition of artisans taking on paying students as apprentices. Most of these artisans
   and institutes had been in existence more than five years, and most took students
   previously. In our sample, few were located in the village but the median artisan or
   institute was within 8 kilometers. Groups would travel to be closer to trainers, or paid
   transport and upkeep for trainers to come to them.

3. Proposals had to receive formal advising. Many applicants were functionally illiterate,
   so YOP also required “facilitators” (usually a local government employee, teacher, or
   community leader) to meet with the group several times, advise them on program
   rules, and help prepare the written proposals. Groups chose their own facilitators, and
   the NUSAF office paid facilitators 2% of funded proposals (up to $200).

4. Several levels of government bureaucracy screened applications. Villages or parishes
   typically submitted one application, and that privilege may have gone to the groups
   with the most initiative, need, or connections. Village officials passed applications up
   to districts, which verified the minimum technical criteria (such as group size and a
   complete proposal) and were supposed to visit projects they planned to fund. Districts
   said they prioritized early applications and disqualified incomplete ones, but unob-
   served quality and political calculation could have played a role. We do not observe
   this process. Most of the applications were made two years before their actual selection.

5. Groups received a lump sum grant. Successful proposals received the full cash transfer
   to a bank account in the names of the management committee, with no government
   monitoring thereafter. In our sample, the average grant was UGX 12.9 million Ugandan
   shillings (UGX) per group, or $7,497 (all figures in the paper are quoted in 2008 UGX


                                           10
      and dollars). Per capita grant size varied across groups due to variation in group
      size and amounts requested. 80% of grants were between $200 and $600 per capita,
      averaging $382.

Generally, YOP applicants did not come from the “ultra poor”. For extremely poor and
“vulnerable” groups, NUSAF had a separate program of group cash grants for livestock
purchases. YOP was targeted to young people with at least some education and prospects
for starting a skilled trade. However, most YOP group members can not be considered well
off, even by international standards.


4     Conceptual framework
We model the effects of grants on employment and income using a simple Ramsey model
of investment with occupational choice and heterogeneous individuals. We summarize the
basic intuition here, and Appendix A outlines the full model. More general models and
simulations, such as that by Buera et al. (2015, 2014), reach similar conclusions.
    Consider the case where there are two riskless sectors: traditional labor-intensive work
(such as subsistence agriculture) and capital-intensive small enterprise. Both use labor as an
input, and production depends on a person’s innate, sector-specific abilities. The enterprise
sector also uses capital (physical and human), and may have a discontinuity in the production
function, such as a fixed cost of start-up. People vary in their initial wealth and can either
consume, save or invest their current earnings and wealth. They can also borrow and save
at the market interest rate.
    In this simple model, a credit-constrained young person with no start-up capital would
be unable to start an enterprise. She would only work in the traditional sector. Someone
with high entrepreneurial ability, or high enough local market returns, will have an incentive
to save some of her earnings from traditional work. She would invest in the enterprise once
she has saved the minimum capital requirement. She is less likely to save and invest in
enterprise if she has low entrepreneurial ability, or is impatient, time-inconsistent, or savings
constrained (e.g. has a negative interest rate or cap on savings). She will also be less likely to
save or invest in enterprise if she is risk averse, has limited access to insurance, and enterprise
and traditional returns are positively correlated.
    Thus, credit constraints interact with initial poverty and other constraints to limit some
people from entering the entrepreneurial sector, even high ability people who would enjoy
high returns to capital in that sector. Under these constraints, we could expect a cash grant
to be invested in an enterprise. Investment and the optimal level of capital will be lower the
lower someone’s entrepreneurial ability, patience, time inconsistency, or tolerance for risk

                                                11
are. If the returns to capital are high enough, we would expect to see more labor allocated
to enterprise, higher incomes, and potentially more employment hours overall.
    People with low enough entrepreneurial ability will not have an incentive to invest an
unconditional grant. If the grant comes in the form of in-kind transfers or restricted funding,
then there may be some kind of “flypaper effect” such that capital stocks are “sticky” and
cannot be divested immediately. This will force people to produce above their efficient scale
temporarily. But over time, if it is possible to shift capital out of the enterprise, people will
divest (or depreciate) until their returns to enterprise fall to the optimal level (which may
be zero).9
    Consequently, the effects of a grant program like YOP depends on the population’s re-
turns to capital, the market imperfections people face, and the composition of the recipients.
If YOP applicants have a mix of high and low ability, then we would expect to see the higher
ability maintain or even grow the initial investment, and the others to divest over time.
Adverse shocks that knock someone below the minimal capital requirement could also lead
to a sustained or permanent exit from enterprise.
    Longer term differences between the people who do and do not receive a grant depend on
what constraints the control group faces. If people are sufficiently time inconsistent, impa-
tient, or savings constrained then they may take a long time to start enterprises, especially
if the minimum capital requirement is high. Otherwise we should expect convergence over
time.


5       Experimental design and data
Northern Uganda’s high levels of youth unemployment and poverty meant that YOP received
a large number of proposals. Thus, the program was vastly oversubscribed. We worked with
the government to randomize funding among a set of screened and eligible grant proposals,
and track a selection of group members over time.


5.1     Sample selection and randomization procedure
YOP launched in 2006 and thousands of groups submitted proposals. The government
funded hundreds of proposals in 2006-07, prior to our study. By 2008, 14 of the 18 NUSAF-
eligible districts had funds remaining for YOP. Figure 3 maps these study districts. None
    9
    Note that, while there was no official monitoring after recipients received funds, we cannot consider YOP
to be fully unconditional as there was the initial condition of people needing to prepare proposals for the
funds. The groups may have also acted as enforcement devices.




                                                     12
of the most war-affected districts (Gulu, Kitgum, and Pader) had the organization or funds
remaining to participate in the final round.

       Figure 3: Eligible districts and total number of study communities per parish




    In 2007, the central government asked district governments to nominate 2.5 times the
number of groups they could fund. The districts submitted roughly 625 proposals to a central
government office. Based on our discussions with district officials, each district reviewed only
a small fraction of the thousands of proposals they received. Most said they tried taking
a “first come first serve” approach. Others described other ad hoc criteria. Local political
considerations might also have come into play, although we heard very few accusations of
“political pork” or favoritism.
    To minimize chances of misuse and corruption, the central government reviewed proposals
for completeness and validity. They also sent out audit teams to visit and verify each group.
The government disqualified about 70 applications, mainly for incomplete information or
ineligibility (e.g. many group members over 35 years, or a group size more than 40). The
government also asked that 22 groups of underserved people (Muslims and orphans) be
funded automatically.
    In January 2008 the government provided us with a list of 535 remaining groups eligible
for randomization, along with district budgets. These 535 groups contained nearly 12,000

                                              13
members. In February 2008, we randomly assigned 265 of the 535 groups (5,460 individuals)
to treatment and 270 groups (5,828 individuals) to control, stratified by district. Spillovers
between study villages were unlikely as the 535 groups were spread across 454 communities
in a population of more than five million. Figure 3 displays a map of groups per parish.10
    In February and March 2008 the Uganda Bureau of Statistics, with the direction of
the researchers, conducted a baseline survey of all 535 groups. They gathered all group
members in one place, created a full group roster, and randomly sampled five people per
group to survey. This established a panel of 2,675 people. The government disbursed grants
between July and September 2008.




  10
     Gaps in administrative data mean that 20 villages are linked to a district but not a parish. Of the 26
parishes with three or more groups per parish, just six parishes have 4 or more groups.

5.2     Survey data and attrition
As there is no administrative data in Uganda, all outcomes are based on survey self-reports.
The national statistics agency conducted the baseline survey, and Innovations for Poverty
Action (IPA) and private survey firms conducted all endline surveys. The 2-year endline
was conducted between August 2010 and March 2011, 24 to 30 months after disbursement,
a 4-year survey between April and June 2012, 44 to 47 months after disbursement, and a
9-year endline between March and May, 2017 — 103 to 106 months after disbursement.
    Table 1 reports survey response rates and sample size at each round. At baseline, enu-
merators and local officials mobilized group members to complete a survey of demographic
data on all members as well as group characteristics. Virtually all members were mobilized.
Enumerators could not locate 13 groups (3% of the sample). Unusually, after the survey
it was discovered that all 13 had been assigned to the control group. We investigated the
matter and found no motive for or evidence of foul play. District officials, enumerators, and
the groups themselves did not know the treatment status of the groups they were mobiliz-
ing. We were only able to find one of the 13 at endline. While we cannot confirm what
happened in the other 12 groups, “ghost projects”, which are fake projects developed by a
local or national official with the goal of taking all of the money transferred to an account
for themselves, are a common concern in such programming in Uganda. An anti-corruption
experiment conducted on the second NUSAF program, which came immediately after the
end of this program, found similar rates of missing projects (Fiala and Premand, 2017).
    YOP applicants were young and mobile. 30–40% of respondents had moved or were away
temporarily at each endline survey. To minimize attrition, we used a two-phase tracking
approach (Thomas et al., 2001). Table 1 summarizes the phases. In Phase 1, we attempted
to interview all 2,675 people in their last known location. We did not find 37% in 2010, 39%
in 2012, and 29% in 2017. Most had migrated away from their original home. In Phase 2, we
selected a random sample of the unfound—53% in 2010, 38.5% in 2012, and 36% in 2017.11
We made at least three attempts to find this subset in their new locations.
    We found 75% of the selected sample in 2010, 59% in 2012, and 74% in 2017. Those
found in Phase 1 receive unit weight, those selected in Phase 2 are weighted by the inverse of
their selection probability, and those not selected in Phase 2 are dropped. Fewer than 2.5%
of people refused to answer. Our response rate was 97% at baseline, and effective response
rates at endline (weighted for selection into endline tracking) were 90.7% in 2010, 84% in
2012, and 87% in 2017.
    Overall, our attrition levels are similar to other panels of young adults in rural Africa
  11
    The proportions mainly varied according to our available resources. The Phase 2 randomization stratified
by district and by the proportion unfound in the group.


                                                    16
(Baird et al., 2015; Friedman et al., 2011; Baird et al., 2016), though higher than some
panels of existing entrepreneurs, who are typically urban, less mobile, and in some cases are
screened for attrition before the experiment (de Mel et al., 2012; Udry and Anagol, 2006).
    Of potentially greater concern is correlation between attrition and treatment. Largely
because of the 13 “never found” control groups, attrition in 2012 and 2017 is higher among
controls. If we ignore this source of non-response, there is a negligible association of treat-
ment and attrition in 2017. If these “never found” controls had particularly high potential
outcomes, we would overstate the impact of the intervention.
    There is also some correlation between attrition and potential indicators of economic
success. If so, and uncorrected, selective attrition could bias our treatment effects upwards.
Appendix Table B.1 reports baseline correlates of attrition (excluding the 3% not found at
baseline). Arguably, people with slightly more entrepreneurial potential are slightly less likely
to be found: town dwellers, non-farmers, and those with higher literacy, initial employment,
earnings and loan access, and members of the group management committee. To attempt to
correct for any possible bias, when calculating treatment effects we will use inverse probability
weights from these attrition regressions. Found members of the sample who look more like
the attritors will get slightly more weight in the estimated treatment effect.


5.3     Randomization balance
Table 2 displays summary statistics and tests of balance for 38 baseline covariates. There
is balance across a wide range of measures, but a handful show imbalance. They suggest
higher levels of initial wealth among the treatment group.12
    While this imbalance may be chance, the missing 13 control groups could also cause the
imbalance. We estimate that if the missing control groups had baseline values just 0.05
standard deviations above the control mean, we would fail to find statistically significant
imbalance. If 0.1 standard deviations above the control mean, the mean differences between
the treatment and control groups would be close to zero.13 If so, this would imply that
the observed control group may be poorer than the treatment group, and will lead us to
overstate true program impacts. We model alternative attrition scenarios below.
  12
     The treatment group report 2 percentage points more vocational training, 0.07 standard deviations (SD)
greater wealth, 56% greater savings (though only in the linear, not in log form), and 5 percentage points
more access to small loans.

5.4       Participants
From Table 2, members of the 535 eligible groups were generally young, rural, poor, credit
constrained, and underemployed. In 2008 they were 25 years on average, mainly aged 16 to
35. Less than a quarter lived in a town, and most lived in villages of 100–2000 households.
A quarter did not finish primary school, but on average they reached 8th grade.
    In 2008 the sample reported 11 hours of work a week. Half these hours were low-skill
labor or petty business, while the other half was in agriculture—rudimentary subsistence
and cash cropping on small rain-fed plots with little equipment or inputs. Almost half of
our sample reported no employment in the past month, and only 6% are engaged in a skilled
trade. Cash earnings in the past month averaged a dollar a day. Savings were $15 on average.
Only 11% reported savings. 33% held loans, but these were small: under $7 at the median
among those who have any loans, mainly from friends and family. About 10% reported they
could obtain a large loan of 1,000,000 UGX (about $580).
    Although poor by any measure, these applicants were slightly wealthier and more ed-
ucated than their peers. If we compare our sample to their age group and gender a 2008
population-based household survey, our sample has 1.7 years more education, 0.15 SD more
wealth, is 7.5 pp. more urban and 5.4 pp. more likely to be married, and has 1.6 fewer
household members (Blattman et al. 2014).
    Note that for the most part this not a post-conflict population. The three most war-
affected districts did not participate in the YOP evaluation, and only 3% of the sample were
involved in an armed group in any fashion.
    Based on qualitative interviews, people applied to the program not because they thought
it would turn into their main occupation, but rather to have a side profession that would
raise cash to meet their household’s direct needs. Agriculture—mainly subsistence but some
cash cropping—was expected to remain the main activity. Initiative and affinity for skilled
work was clearly important, but people were keen to apply even if they were poorly qualified
for or had limited interest in a vocation. Most had no other government program to apply to.
As a result, the sample has wide variation in wealth, education and experience, not terribly
dissimilar from the general population.


5.5       Treatment effect estimation
Prior to collecting the 9-year data, we specified a primary interest in impacts on an index of
income measures.14 We also specified a secondary interest in the recipient’s health (physical
and mental), in child health and education outcomes, and political attitudes and behaviors.

      See https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/2187


                                                     19
In addition, we also prespecified one heterogeneity analysis: gender.
    We follow the prior empirical strategy and estimate program impacts by calculating
intent-to-treat (ITT) estimates via the weighted least squares (WLS) regression:

                                Yij = βIT T Tij + γXi + αd + ij

where Y denotes the outcome for person i in group j; T is an indicator for assignment to
treatment; X is the set of baseline covariates; α are district fixed effects (required because
the probability of assignment to treatment varies by strata); and  is an individual error
term, clustered by group. We weight observations by their inverse probability of selection
into endline tracking and to correct for attrition.
    Several outcomes have a long upper tail, and some of these large values are potentially
due to enumeration errors. Extreme values will be highly influential in any treatment effect,
and so we top-code all currency-denominated, hours worked, and employee variables at the
99th percentile.
    Finally, since outcomes are self-reported, we will overestimate the impact if the treatment
group over-reports well being due to social desirability bias, or if the controls under-report
outcomes in the hope it will increase their chance of future help. This is unlikely for two rea-
sons. First, misreporting would have to be highly systematic: income and employment was
collected through more than 100 questions across 25 activities, and assets and expenditures
were calculated from more than 150 questions. Second, we would also expect to see such
bias appear in other outcomes, but (as we will see below) we observe no treatment effects
across many measures. Misreporting would have to be confined to economic outcomes alone
to bias our results.


5.6    Dealing with multiple outcomes
Prior to the 9-year follow up, we pre-specified income as the primary outcome of interest,
combining multiple measures (earnings, consumption and assets) into one family index to re-
duce the number of comparisons. Secondary outcomes included children’s health/education
and political behavior, where again we combine multiple measures into a single family index
to reduce comparisons. We registered investment, employment, and other economic out-
comes principally as supporting outcomes to understand impacts on income. Because of this
structure, we do not adjust standard errors for multiple comparisons.

indicator plus the usual controls. We use these coefficients to calculate the treatment effect on each gender separately. ∗ implies p < .1, ∗∗ implies p < .05,

6        Results
6.1         Program delivery
Table 4 reports programs received since baseline, including YOP. First we consider simple
receipt of the YOP grant. As discussed in Blattman et al. (2014), of the 265 groups
assigned to a cash grant in 2008, 89% received it. 21 of these 29 groups not access funds
due to unsatisfactory proposals, bank complications, or collection delays. The remaining 8
groups reported they never received funds due to some form of theft or diversion.15
    We would expect treatment-control convergence if control group members were more
likely to receive another government or charitable program in the 9 years after YOP. Broadly
speaking, we do not find any evidence that the control group received a greater number of
transfers since baseline. In the 4-year survey, we asked about non-YOP programs received
in the 12 months before the survey. In the 9-year survey we ask respondents to report all
“major programs” they received from the government or an NGO since baseline.16
   15
      A comparison of baseline characteristics shows that treated and untreated groups are generally similar. In
a regression of receiving the grant on baseline individual and group characteristics, a joint test of significance
has a p-value of 0.2. Nonetheless, some characteristics are correlated with receiving the grant. Groups were
slightly more likely to be treated if they were educated and wealthier and did not have too many members.
Blattman et al. (2014) expands on this analysis.
   16
      Specifically we asked respondents to recall all major government or NGO programs they had received


                                                                             21
    Our estimates vary somewhat depending on what types of programs we include or exclude,
and so we report several alternative measures. Our preferred measure omits very minor
programs (such as mosquito nets, vaccinations, packets of seeds, and unspecified agricultural
extension) as well as any programs reported by the treatment group that sound like YOP
(such as tailoring training, repair training, and business grants whose source was unspecified).
In the decade before the survey, about 17% of the control group reports at least one non-
minor program. Some of these are substantial (such as a goat or a training course) but most
appear to be modest in nature. In the 4-year survey, for example, we calculated that the
average program received by the control group was worth less than $20, which is less than
5% of the value of the YOP grant. After 9 years, the treatment group is 2.9 percentage
points less likely to report such assistance (not statistically significant).
    If we change our preferred measure to include unspecified agricultural extension as “non-
minor”, include any YOP-like programs reported by the treatment group, or include all minor
programs, the program effect shrinks or reverses. As a result, we do not regard differential
treatment with other programs to be a major driver of convergence over the 9 years.


6.2     Economic impacts
Investment

The survey data and qualitative interviews suggest that groups commonly elected manage-
ment committee members to handle procurement, making major training and tool purchases
in bulk. These tools were distributed to individual members, but about half the respondents
said they shared some small or large tools with other group members. In the 2-year survey,
90% of treated group members said they felt the grant was equally shared.
    The majority of groups and members invested the funds in vocational training and capital,
with an emphasis on capital investments. By the two-year follow-up, 53% of the treatment
group had enrolled in vocational training, compared to 15% of the control group. Table 4
reports program impacts on human and physical capital investments. On average, treatment
translated into 340 more hours of vocational training than controls. Among those who
enrolled in any training, 38% train in tailoring, 23% in carpentry, 13% in metalwork, 8% in
hairstyling, and the remainder in miscellaneous other trades.
    However, the majority of YOP funds were invested in business capital. At the median,
groups estimated they spent 11% on skills training, 52% on tools, 13% on materials, and 24%
since the first multiparty elections in 2006. We used this election as a starting point because it is one of the
most significant and memorable events that decade, and we believed it was the best way to have a consistent
recall period across respondents.

on other expenses. Looking at capital stocks, after two years the treatment group reported
130% more business capital than the control group. These are self-reported assessments of
the total value of raw materials, tools, and other capital goods for respondents’ enterprises.
    After 4 years, however, we see evidence that the control group is catching up in terms
of business capital stocks. Whereas after two years the treatment group had 2.3 times the
capital stocks of the control group, after four years their capital stock level was just 1.5 times
greater. This decline in the treatment effect is significant at the 10% level. (Unfortunately
we did not assess capital stocks after 9 years, partly to expand room in the survey for child,
health, and education outcomes.)
    We see more details on convergence in Table 5, which reports levels of, program impacts
on, and changes in reported capital stocks. Between the 2- and 4-year endline surveys the
control group grew their business assets by 38% while the treatment group decreased theirs by
19%. The control group’s growth is significant at the 5% level. The bottom panel of Table
5 looks at reported asset levels and changes in (endogenous) subgroups of the treatment
group. Like the control group, people in groups assigned to YOP that did not receive the
grant report low levels of assets after 2 years but steep growth over time. We also see evidence
of disinvestment, with the people who were funded, took training, but no longer practice
report a 72% fall in assets between the 2 and 4 year surveys. Those still practicing report
relatively stable assets, suggesting they are not continuing to invest retained earnings.

Income

Table 6 reports the analysis for our primary outcome, income. We report a standardized
income family index composed of three measures, two of income flows and one stock measure.

   1. Monthly net earnings (i.e. business profits plus wages). To measure earnings (and
      employment levels), survey enumerators went through a list of roughly three dozen
      common occupations, from farm wage work to skilled trades, asking if the person had
      worked in that occupation in the past year. Respondents usually answered yes to
      two to five occupations. For each of these affirmatives, the electronic survey guided
      the enumerator and respondent through a series of questions about each occupation,
      including days worked in the past month, average hours per day, and gross and net
      earnings in the previous month. We used these data to develop estimates of earnings
      and hours worked in the previous month. We also report a measure of monthly gross
      earnings (business revenues plus wages).

   2. Nondurable consumption. The survey included an abbreviated consumption module,
      measuring the approximate value of food consumed in the past week, and less frequent
      expenditures (such as clothing or entertainment) in the past month. Thus the sum

 Notes: Each entry in columns 3 and 4 is estimated from a weighted least squares regression of the dependent variable on an indicator for assignment
to treatment, district fixed effects, and a vector of baseline covariates. Standard errors are clustered at the group level (of up to 5 people). We report
the coefficient on treatment only. All regressions are weighted by inverse probabilities of attrition and selection into the endline tracking sample.
Columns 5 through 7 come from a single regression, where we regress treatment on an indicator for treatment, an indicator interacted with gender,
and the gender indicator plus the usual controls. We use these coefficients to calculate the treatment effect on each gender separately. ∗ implies
p < .1, ∗∗ implies p < .05, ∗∗∗ implies p < .01




         of these consumed items is not a complete measure of consumption. Nonetheless,
         the items should account for the majority of non-durable consumption and (so long
         as treatment does not have a major effect on the composition of consumption) the
         treatment effect on the abbreviated measure should approximate the treatment effect
         on full consumption.

    3. Durable assets. Durable assets are not just a measure of poverty, but their use also
       provides a flow of consumption over time. Hence we include a measure of durable
       goods in our prespecified income index. The survey asked people several questions
       about their housing quality (such as roof material or dwelling size) as well as the
       quantity of a number of assets, ranging from various livestock, fruit-producing trees,
       household goods and furnishings, electronics, and tools and equipment. We combine
       these into a single index using the first principal component of all these asset variables,
       omitting any assets that might have been directly provided by YOP (such as sewing
       machines). We use the same weights across all survey rounds (including baseline) and
       so the mean of the index at endline indicates growth in assets since baseline across the
       sample.

We deflate all measures by a national measure of inflation.
  After 4 years, people assigned to YOP had 0.21 standard deviations higher income.17
   17
    Due to a minor error in the earlier use of baseline data, the estimates in Table 6 are slightly different
than in Blattman et al. (2014). In the earlier paper we reported an earnings ATE of 18.19 [4.898] instead of
17.94 [4.904] and an assets ATE of 0.181 [0.055] instead of 0.164 [0.051].


                                                                           25
Within the index, this corresponds to a 38.0% increase in net monthly earnings, a 0.163
standard deviation increase in assets, and a 10.7% increase in consumption.
    After 9 years, however, we no longer observe statistically significant impacts on income.
Income is 0.066 standard deviations greater in the treatment group, and this difference is
driven mainly through the effect on durable assets, which are 0.116 standard deviations
greater.18 Estimated program impacts on earnings and consumption are much smaller.19
Earnings are just 4.6% greater in the treatment group, and consumption just 1.4% greater
(neither is statistically significant). Thus any treatment effect on income after 9 years appears
to be dominated by historical earnings translated into accumulated durable assets rather than
higher income flows. Some of these durable assets could yield income or consumption, such as
livestock or trees. These subindices within assets increase 0.14 and 0.19 standard deviations
respectively (not shown). But our earnings and consumption measures explicitly collect
earning and consumption from these livelihoods, and these outcomes do not significantly
differ by treatment group.
    Following Blattman et al. (2014), Table 6 also reports impacts on income by gender. In
general, women earn roughly half as much as men, and report fewer assets. The results
after 4 years suggested that program impacts on women were proportionally greater. Men
and women had roughly similar treatment effects. But control women had low enough
incomes compared to control men that the program impacts were proportionally much larger.
Between the 4- and 9-year surveys, however, control women began to catch up in investment,
employment, and earnings. In Table 6 we see almost slightly higher treatment effects on the
income for women, but the difference is not statistically significant. Additionally, there is a
slight difference in patterns in the components. For men the income gains are concentrated
in accumulated assets, significant at the 5% level. Women display slightly greater impacts
on earnings and consumption, though neither estimate is statistically significant. Overall we
cannot reject that treatment effects vary little with gender.
  18
     The asset index does not include savings, since we only have savings and loans information at the 9-year
endline, and we want the index to be comparable over time. In the control group, 69% are a member of a
savings group and total savings across all sources is 125,000 UGX on average. The treatment effects (and
standard errors) are -0.034 [0.023] for savings group membership and -8,759 [12,338] for savings balances.
Neither is statistically significant and in neither case is there a positive treatment effect.
  19
     Inflation rose dramatically between the 4- and 9-year surveys. For this reason real consumption levels
look fairly flat over this period. These national inflation rates may exaggerate inflation in rural areas,
however, though without official data it is difficult to know. But looking at the control means in Table 6,
our assets measure rises 0.19 standard deviations between the 4- and 9-year surveys.




                                                     26
Employment and occupational choice

Table 7 reports program impacts on employment and time spent in skilled work, 4 and 9 years
after the grant. Employment was measured in the same module as earnings, as described
above. The results show a large, sustained increase in time spent doing skilled work, but no
sustained effects on other outcomes.
    After 4 years, we observed a statistically significant increase in total time spent working
of 5.5 hours, a 17% increase. This effect was largely due to increases in non-agricultural work,
especially skilled trades (134% increase) and high-skilled wage labor (51% increase). Average
earnings per hour also increased by about a fifth, significant at the 10% level, implying the
new work was better remunerated or higher productivity.
    None of these effects were sustained 9-years after grant disbursement, save for time spent
in a skilled trade. The treated sample spend twice as much time in skilled trade as the
control group and are twice as likely to be working primarily in skilled trades, which we
define as at least 30 hours per week in the past month. But there is no sustained effect on
employment hours or earnings per hour.
    As can be seen in Table 8, the control group has been increasing their overall hours
worked considerably, from just under 11 hours per week at baseline to over 43 hours per
week 9 years later. This growth in employment is not due to increases in skilled work or
work on farm, both of which have been stagnant over the 9 years, but due to increases
in non-agriculture work and petty business. The control group has thus increased time in
activities that produce low income, but they have increased their time in these activities
considerably.
    Finally, Appendix Table B.3 reports impacts on migration, and Appendix Table B.2
examines impacts on the business itself. At baseline nearly all YOP applicants were living in
a village or small town, with some in larger regional towns. By the 9-year endline, most of the
village-dwelling sample had moved to a small town or larger urban area. We see no effect of
treatment on this likelihood of moving. We also see little lasting effect on business formality,
including record-keeping, registration, or tax paying. We see weak indications that treated
group members are more likely to have employees. The average control group member has
1.1 paid part-time employees. This is 0.26 people higher in the treatment group, significant
at the 10% level only. It is mainly non-family employees, and the effects are concentrated
among men. We observe a significant rise in the estimated number of hours that all employees
work (a rise of 21 hours per month from the control mean of 987 hours, significant at the 1%
level). Puzzlingly we do not see a rise in total estimated payroll, however. Thus we regard
this as relatively weak evidence of a positive employment externality. It seems that more
non-family labor is used (about 5 hours a week) but it may be low paid or lower skill and so

                                              27
Figure 4: Estimated net present value of intervention using interpolated monthly net earnings




payroll is unaffected.

Cumulative impact

We estimate that this temporary earnings gain is roughly $665 or 1.8 times the size of the
grant (using 2008 USD and market exchange rates). We base this estimate on a linear
interpolation of earnings treatment effects between the four survey rounds (0, 2, 4 and 9
years), discounted to the baseline year at an annualized interest rate of 5%.20 Figure 4
illustrates this cumulative effect on earnings. While imprecise, it nonetheless implies that
the program was cost-effective in the sense of cumulative earnings gains for the directly
treated exceeding the average grant size.
    This should not be taken as a measure of social impact for at least two reasons, however.
First, the government has little to no data on NUSAF implementation costs. Judging by
other aid programs, it would not be unusual for these costs to exceed the value of the grant.
Second, there may have been local spillovers, and parishes are too large relative to the YOP
grants to measure spillovers with any precision. Some of these employment and earnings
gains could have come from displacing the work of existing craftspersons. Alternatively, the
demand shock could have stimulated local economies. Thus we do not have a full measure
of social impacts.
  20
    Profits were only measured a the 4-year endline. We model an immediate treatment effect of 18,000
UGX beginning at baseline and spanning 4 years, after which the treatment effect decreases linearly towards
our 9-year estimate of 4,800 UGX.

 Notes: Each entry in columns 3 and 4 is estimated from a weighted least squares regression of the dependent variable on an indicator for
assignment to treatment, district fixed effects, and a vector of baseline covariates. Standard errors are clustered at the group level (of up to
5 people). We report the coefficient on treatment only. All regressions are weighted by inverse probabilities of attrition and selection into the
endline tracking sample. Columns 5 through 7 come from a single regression, where we regress treatment on an indicator for treatment, an
indicator interacted with gender, and the gender indicator plus the usual controls. We use these coefficients to calculate the treatment effect
on each gender separately. ∗ implies p < .1, ∗∗ implies p < .05, ∗∗∗ implies p < .01

Robustness and sensitivity analysis

These conclusions are fairly robust to different estimation models and measurement decisions,
including how we deal with survey attrition. Nearly all statistically significant results are
driven by the persistent difference in durable assets alone. Table 9 reports the simple ITT
effects from the prior tables in Column 1, and variations in subsequent columns.
    If we omit the control vector, in Column 2, the program impact on income rises to 0.11
standard deviations and is significant at the 5% level. This due to the treatment-control
imbalance on assets and earnings at baseline (recall Table 2 above). This change is mainly
due to a rise in the treatment effect on durable assets, which were 0.06 standard deviations
greater in the treatment group at baseline. We continue to see no evidence of a statistically
significant rise in our flow measures of income.
    Columns 3 and 4 estimate the difference-in-difference treatment effect, with Column 3
controlling for other baseline covariates and Column 4 omitting them (but both include dis-
trict fixed effects). Column 4 is a form of unadjusted treatment effect that accounts for the
baseline imbalance in the key outcome. We cannot calculate this for the consumption (and
hence income) index because we do not have consumption data at baseline. Since earnings
and durable assets were slightly higher in the treatment group at baseline, the differenced
program effects are similar to Column 1 but considerably smaller than the unadjusted esti-
mates in Column 2. We also get qualitatively similar results with a treatment on the treated


                                                   30
estimate that uses assignment to treatment as an instrument for the 89% of groups that
received the grant (not shown).
    Our results also illustrate the importance of accounting for survey attrition. Column 4
includes control variables but no longer re-weights the sample according to probabilities of
attrition. As discussed in Section 5.2, we saw some signs that attrition was higher among
those with higher entrepreneurial potential. Thus, when we omit these attrition weights, our
estimated treatment effects in Column 4 rise slightly to 0.080 standard deviations, though
the effect remains non-statistically significant.
    Indeed, these results and Column 5 illustrate the importance of our efforts to minimize
attrition. Column 5 removes the sampling weights that come from our randomized tracking
of migrants (described in section 5.2). These increased the weight of the migrants and other
unfound people whom we tracked intensively after the initial failed attempts. Omitting them
is not a “robustness check” because it explicitly biased. Rather, column 5 illustrates the bias
that would arise had we not taken our approach. Our income treatment effect estimates are
significantly higher, especially earnings, and the index of all three measures increases 0.11
standard deviations with treatment, significant at the 1% level. This suggests that treated
migrants are more likely to be economically successful than control migrants, as expected.
    Of course, we do not know for certain that unfound treatment group members are more
successful than unfound control group members. Thus, as a final exercise, we model treat-
ment effects under different assumptions about the unfound. A Manski extreme bound
would impute the minimum value for unfound treated members and the maximum for un-
found controls (and vice versa for the other bound). Following this method, we could in
principle observe a maximal treatment effect on income of .74 standard deviations, and a
minimal one of -0.667 (not shown). These are so wide and unrealistic to be unhelpful. In-
stead, Table 9 reports less extreme bounds. In column 6 we estimate a new ITT where we
impute a high outcome for unfound controls, equal to the found mean plus 0.25 standard
deviations, while for the treatment group we impute a low outcome, the found treatment
mean minus 0.25 standard deviations. In column 7 we do the opposite. (In each case, this a
0.5 standard deviation gap between unfound treatment and control group members, which
is quite large and would represent for more selective attrition than we observed in section
5.2 or Appendix Table B.1.) In this semi-extreme set of scenarios, our income treatment
effects range from 0.009 standard deviations on the low end (obviously not statistically sig-
nificant) to 0.112 standard deviations on the higher end (statistically significant at the 5%
level). Importantly, note that we do not see a statistically significant rise in earnings or
consumption.

     to account for selective attrition or selection into the endline tracking sample. Finally, the last two columns omit attrition weights and instead impute semi-extreme values of the
     dependent variable, so that missing treatment and control group members have a 0.5 standard deviation difference in their outcomes (as we impute a mean + .25 standard deviation
     outcome for treatment and mean – .25 standard deviatioon for controls, or vice versa). ∗ implies p < .1, ∗∗ implies p < .05, ∗∗∗ implies p < .01
6.3     Human capital impacts
We next turn to secondary outcomes, which could arise from temporary economic gains. We
begin with the respondent’s own health and then consider the health and education of their
children.

Respondent’s own health

Table 10 reports program impacts on the respondent’s physical and mental health. As this
is a young population, mortality rates were just 0.55% over the nine years. YOP reduced
mortality by 0.4 percentage points, an 80% improvement, but one that is not statistically
significant.
    Among those alive and interviewed, the health and education of the treatment and control
groups are broadly similar. We have three measures of physical health: (1) an index of
physical functioning that averages self-reported performance at four activities of daily life
(such as standing and running) plus self-reported tiredness and general health problems; (2)
an index for whether they reported a disability, injury, illness or another inability to work;
and (3) number of days unable to work in the last month. We also asked respondents a
lengthy symptom checklist for various mental health issues, including: depression/emotional
distress; pro-social behavior; and hostility/aggression.21
    To reduce the number of hypotheses tested, we combine these secondary outcomes into
two family indexes of physical and mental health. We also report treatment effects on
the component measures for transparency. We see no substantively large or statistically
significant differences between the treatment and control group, either in the two family
indexes or their components. The estimated coefficients on the family indexes are less than
0.06 standard deviations.

Child health and education

Most YOP recipients were in their twenties, and bearing or raising small children, when they
received the grants. At baseline, the average member of the sample was 25 years old, had 1.5
children on average. In the first 4 years of the grant, the average sample had 1.6 children,
when income gains were highest.
    As a result, we hypothesized that YOP recipients would invest more in their children
at a young age, and as a result the children would have better child health and education
  21
     We asked respondents about the same depression, distress, and aggression/hostility symptoms at base-
line. At endline we add a set of new, more nationally-comparable symptoms. Whether we include these
additional symptoms or not, or look at changes in symptoms over time, our results and qualitative conclusions
do not change.

 Notes: Each entry in columns 3 and 4 is estimated from a weighted least squares regression of the dependent variable on an indicator for assignment to treatment,
district fixed effects, and a vector of baseline covariates. Standard errors are clustered at the group level (of up to 5 people). We report the coefficient on treatment
only. All regressions are weighted by inverse probabilities of attrition and selection into the endline tracking sample. Columns 5 through 7 come from a single
regression, where we regress treatment on an indicator for treatment, an indicator interacted with gender, and the gender indicator plus the usual controls. We use
these coefficients to calculate the treatment effect on each gender separately. For each index, missing values were imputed to be the row median of the measures that
compose the index, per respondent. Maximum N across all regressions is 2086 because the outcome Has died is measured for individuals found, including those who
did not complete the full survey. N = 1981 for all other regressions. ∗ implies p < .1, ∗∗ implies p < .05, ∗∗∗ implies p < .01

 Notes: Each entry in columns 3 and 4 is estimated from a WLS regression of the dependent variable on an indicator for assignment to treatment,
district fixed effects, and a vector of baseline covariates. Standard errors are clustered at the group level (of up to 5 people). We report the coefficient
on treatment only. All regressions are weighted by inverse probabilities of attrition and selection into the endline tracking sample. Columns 5 through
7 come from a single regression, where we regress treatment on an indicator for treatment, an indicator interacted with gender, and the gender
indicator plus the usual controls. N’s vary across variables because: not all respondents were ever pregnant, causing there to be N < 1982; current
child expenditures are meaasured for all respondents, while current expenditures per child is only measured for respondents with children; and health
measures for children were only measured for respondents with children between the ages of 3 and 9. Child educational measures and child health
measures stem from different portions of the survey, which may have led to inconsistencies in which children were discussed. ∗ implies p < .1, ∗∗

outcomes after 9 years. This is consistent with a wide literature on anti-poverty programs.
22
   We collected survey data on three main kinds of outcomes:

A. Fertility and child mortality. We first asked each respondent to recall and report each
    of their pregnancies, and followed these through to birth and currentl status. We
    use these data to construct approximate measures of fertility (number of pregnancies),
    percentage of births that were live, percentage of children still living, and the number of
    biological children. Men typically had multiple partners, and so only report pregnancies
    about which they were aware. This has obvious sources of error, which we will discuss
    in a moment. Panel A Table 11 reports program impacts on these measures for all
    respondents.

B. Educational outcomes. From a list of all biological children, plus non-biological children
    living in the household, we then asked respondents to report the child’s current grade
    attainment and enrollment status. Panel B of Table 11 reports program impacts on
    these outcomes for all children and biological children only. We report results for
    children currently aged 6–15 (age 6 or less at the time of the grant), but the conclusions
    are similar for children currently aged 6–24 (not shown). The table also reports impacts
    on expenditures on children’s clothing and education from the consumption portion of
    the 9-year survey.

C. Child current health outcomes. Finally, we collected health information on biological
    children who were aged 3–9 at the time of the survey (and hence unborn at the time
    of the grant).23 Many survey respondents did not live with all their children, and for
    this (and other reasons of cost and logistics) we did not collect anthropomorphic data
    on living children. Instead, we asked parents to report the physical functioning of
    their child along three dimensions: (i) 6 measures of physical functioning, including
    activities of daily life such as using the toilet, washing themselves, and walking and
    running; (b) an overall subjective assessment of the child’s general healthiness; and
    (iii) the number of reported malaria cases in the previous year. We assemble these into
    three sub-indices and use them to construct an overall index of child health, reported
    in Panel C of Table 11.
  22
     Aizer et al. (2016) find that welfare income to U.S. mothers increase the longevity of children by one
year. Paxson and Schady (2010) find that cash transfers to Ecuadorian women had positive impacts on child
physical and cognitive health after two years.
  23
     We do not have physical assessments on children currently aged 0–2 or 10+ because the daily activities
of life do not apply to children under 3, and a survey error meant that children over 9 were no asked the
questions.




                                                    36
All of these outcomes are respondent-reported and hence error-prone. Noise and systematic
underreporting of health will tend to bias treatment effects downwards, and make them less
precise (i.e. bias us towards failing to reject the null). We might be especially worried
about men’s reports, especially because they may be less likely to live or spend time with
their children. The main threat to identification is if such measurement error is correlated
with treatment status. While possible, it is not obvious why treated men should be more
knowledgable of their children’s health than control men, especially when we see no signs of
a change in the number of children or their ages. The chief possibility—that one group is
more likely to migrate away from their family than the other—shows no treatment-control
difference (see Appendix Table B.3). Hence, to a first approximation, we think these are
reasonable estimates of the mean effects of the program.
    We see almost no evidence of a change in fertility or children’s well-being. Most of the
estimated coefficients are not only statistically insignificant, but they are also small in the
sense of being less than 5% of the control group mean. Moreover, most 95% confidence
intervals exclude changes more than roughly 10%. The education coefficients generally point
in the wrong direction. Hence, even if the outcomes were significantly less noisy, there is little
reason to believe that we could observe substantively important improvement’s in children’s
well being.
    The one exception is the health index among children alive today. Child mortality was
roughly 4% of live births (and 11% of any pregnancy) among the control group, and there
is no statistically significant difference in the treatment group (indeed the sign is negative
for child mortality conditional on being born). But a health index for children is 0.08
standard deviations greater in the treatment group, significant at the 10% level. This effect
is concentrated among women, where treated women report children who are 0.17 standard
deviations healthier, significant at the 5% level. None of these standard errors are adjusted
for multiple comparisons, however, and so we must take these results with caution, especially
because they are concentrated in a single family index and a single subgroup. Nonetheless,
the result is consistent with a largely observational literature that has found that, compared
to income or assets in the hands of men, income or assets in the hands of women is associated
with larger improvements in child health (Thomas, 1990; Duflo, 2012).


6.4    Political impacts
Table 12 reports program impacts on political behavior after 4 and 9 years. In Blattman
et al. (2018), we found that during the 2011 national elections (3 years after YOP), those
assigned to treatment reported that they were no more likely to engage in non-partisan

 Notes: Each entry in columns 3 and 4 is estimated from a weighted least squares regression of the dependent variable on an indicator for
assignment to treatment, district fixed effects, and a vector of baseline covariates. Standard errors are clustered at the group level (of up to
5 people). We report the coefficient on treatment only. All regressions are weighted by inverse probabilities of attrition and selection into the
endline tracking sample. Columns 5 through 7 come from a single regression, where we regress treatment on an indicator for treatment, an
indicator interacted with gender, and the gender indicator plus the usual controls. We use these coefficients to calculate the treatment effect on
each gender separately. ∗ implies p < .1, ∗∗ implies p < .05, ∗∗∗ implies p < .01




                                                                       38
political actions, but they were significantly more likely to have supported and voted for
opposition candidates in elections the previous year. We hypothesized that this was partly
due to clientelistic election tactics, where villagers are commonly offered small sums of money
to vote, especially on behalf of the ruling party (Larreguy et al., 2018). By earning more
income, individuals in the treatment group were freed to publicly demonstrate their support
for the opposition.
    We see largely similar but less statistically significant patterns in the 2016 elections, held
8 years after YOP grants were disbursed. We asked a broadly similar set of questions on
nonpartisan and partisan actions and attitudes. Once again, we see little treatment-control
difference in political actions that are either nonpartisan or not specific to a party, and we
see no change in self-reported support for the ruling party. But the treatment group was 0.08
standard deviations more likely to support the opposition party, such as join the party, vote
for the opposition candidate, or actively work to get an opposition candidate elected. This
family index is significant at the 10 percent level only, and slightly smaller than the previous
effect of 0.12 standard deviations. Nonetheless, some of the component treatment effects
are very large: actively working to get an opposition candidate elected rises 62% relative
to the control mean, and voting for the opposition rises 14% relative to the control mean.
Longer term research will be need to see if the opposition support is more persistent than
the earnings impact.


7     Discussion and conclusions
The main effect of giving underemployed, poor young people one-time grants averaging $384
per person appears to have been an increase in earnings that lasted at most 9 years, plus a
relatively small increase in fixed assets due to accumulated earnings.
    Most grant recipients used the funds to train in and start the vocational enterprise that
they and their groups proposed. This helped them to get a few additional hours of employ-
ment per week, usually at relatively low wages. Nonetheless, this was a large amount of new
cash earnings given their poor alternatives and underemployment. Over time, however, both
the treatment and control groups were able to accumulate more capital and expand their
employment, usually in a mix of farm and non-farm activities. By the end of the 9 years,
the control group appears to have reached the same level of investment, employment, and
earnings as those who received the grant.
    These temporary gains are not unexpected. Although most studies of entrepreneurship
programs do not highlight this prediction, most studies (including this one) have been rooted
in models of financial market imperfections that allow for convergence over time. For ex-

                                               39
ample, in models of credit constraints and fixed start-up costs to enterprise, people above
some minimum levels of initial assets and earnings, with access to a savings technology, will
eventually save past the minimal capital constraint and start the enterprise. Convergence
will be faster if there are frictions that prevent the YOP group from rapidly accumulating
more and more capital. This could be in the form of other constraints on enterprise (such
as an absence of insurance, or limited ability), or constraints on capital accumulation such
as families “taxing” successful kin (Jakiela and Ozier, 2015).
    We estimate that this temporary earnings gain was roughly $665 or 1.8 times the size of
the grant (using 2008 USD and market exchange rates). While this an imprecise estimate of
the cumulative income gain, it still implies that the program was cost-effective compared to
direct outlays. We do not know the government’s program implementation costs, however.
    This figure does not include the gains in assets and children’s health. Besides being
difficult to value, we also take with some caution given that the effects are confined to a
single dimension of child well-being in a single subgroup (women). Nonetheless, the pattern
is consistent with an extensive literature on women using income to invest in their children’s
long run well being.
    What we do not know is what effects the intervention had on local markets and prices,
or the earnings of pre-existing entrepreneurs in the village or parish. Elsewhere in Uganda,
Blattman et al. (2016) were able to estimate the spillovers of cash grants to ultrapoor women,
and showed that the petty trading businesses they opened lowered the price of outside goods
in the village, raising the general standard of living. Pre-existing traders were crowded out of
the business, but mostly managed to shift to farm enterprises and maintain their earnings.
Hence there were positive spillovers on net. We do not have the same closely-knit set of
villages and data on non-treated villagers, and so we cannot estimate the same treatment
effects. It is possible that the net spillovers of YOP are positive as well. Yet it is equally
possible that the cumulative earnings gain likely overestimates the social impact, since the
new entrants may have taken some of the business from preexisting vocational tradespersons.
In that case, it makes even more sense to think of YOP as a social insurance program or
kickstart, one where the costs could be borne in part by more successful, older people in the
industry.
    If these patterns are borne out by more long term studies, such as the parallel findings in
Ethiopia in Blattman et al. (2018), then there are both theoretical and policy implications for
poverty. Theoretically, it would bolster the view that there are relatively few cases of house-
hold poverty traps, and promote a more marginalized view of poverty alleviation (Banerjee
and Duflo, 2011). It should also start to focus academic attention on the other frictions and
constraints besides missing credit markets. After all, a big part of the convergence story was


                                              40
the sharply diminishing returns to capital we observed in the treatment group. What seems
important is understanding the interactive effects between grants and efforts to relieve other
constraints.
    As a policy measure, it may make sense for governments to compare the costs and benefits
of enterprise capital grant programs to other temporary social insurance schemes, such as
guaranteed employment schemes. This would also affect how programs are targeted and on
what basis they are evaluated. If government and charitable agencies sell these programs on
the basis of permanent poverty relief, they may be setting up perfectly successful programs
to fail at an outcome they are unlikely to ever deliver.

Appendix for online publication

A        Ramsey model of investment and occupational choice
Our conceptual framework is rooted in a simple Ramsey model of investment and occupa-
tional choice with heterogeneous individuals, originally developed in Blattman et al. (2014).24
We consider the effects of a cash windfall on investment, savings, occupational choice, earn-
ings and consumption in the short run and long run. We also consider the effects of a
windfall where the recipient is constrained to make an initial capital investment. We exam-
ine the comparative statics in perfect financial markets as well as under a variety of missing
markets (credit, savings, and insurance) and behavioral considerations such as impatient or
hyperbolic discounters.


A.1        Setup
Consider an individual who can spend time working in one of two sectors: enterprise or
traditional labor. Production functions for enterprise and traditional labor are f E (k, lE , θ)
and f T (lT , ω), where k is accumulated physical and human capital used in enterprise, lE is
hours spent on enterprise, lT is hours on traditional labor, and θ is individual specific talent
in enterprise, and ω is individual specific talent in traditional labor. Working in enterprise
requires a minimum capital stock k ≥ 0, while traditional labor has no capital requirement.
We assume positive but diminishing marginal returns to inputs, fkE > 0 > fkk  E
                                                                                , flE > 0 > fllE ;
                                                                                         E
inputs are complements, fklE > 0; and the returns to inputs are increasing in ability, fkθ  > 0,
  E             T     25                      E    T
flθ > 0 and flω > 0. Also, note that lt = lt + lt ∈ [0, 1].
  24
     This model drew on a one sector model from Fafchamps et al (2012) and introduced occupational choice
and labor supply. The model was developed by the authors in collaboration with Julian Jamison and Xing
Xia for a suite of experimental studies of microenterprise and cash transfer interventions.
  25
     We also assume the minimum capital requirement means that f E (k, lE , θ) ≡ 0 as long as k < k, and
that for any ability level, at very low levels of k, marginal product of the first unit of labor is always higher
                                                                                               f E (k,0,θ)
in traditional labor than in enterprise, while at higher levels of k it is the opposite, lim fl T (0,ω) = 0 and
                                                                                           k↓0   l
     f E (k,0,θ)
 lim fl T (0,ω)    = +∞. For simplicity, we assume f (k, l , θ) is homogeneous of degree 1 in (k, lE ).

invested in enterprise and rt is the returns to these alternative financial assets at time t.
Without loss of generality, we assume k0 = 0 and all initial wealth is in the financial asset,
a0 . To make analysis simple, we fix rt = r > 0. Finally, to fully characterize the equilibrium
we add a transversality condition: lim δ t u0c (ct , lt )at = 0.

     This benchmark case considers perfect financial markets and consistent time preferences.
In this case, individuals will allocate assets between the enterprise and savings until the
returns of capital are equal, and will allocate their time across sectors until the marginal
disutility is equal. The solution to the problem is characterized as time-paths of quantities

    Conditions 1 and 4 imply that whenever investment in enterprise is positive the individual
                                            0
always produces at efficient scale, i.e. fkE (kt+1 , lt+1
                                                      E
                                                          , θ) = r. For simplicity, we focus on
interior solutions only throughout.



                                                              46
Who runs an enterprise?

For k > 0, there will be low θ types who cannot reach efficient scale because their returns
to capital are lower than r. We can define a minimum ability before enterprise is feasible,
                    0
θ = θ(r, k) for fkE (k, 1, θ) = r.26 Note that θ does not depend on a0 .
     As θ rises above θ, the returns to capital and labor increase in enterprise, and enterprise
becomes a better alternative than saving all assets in at . This does not guarantee that
the individual will invest, since time could be allocated instead to traditional labor. Not
surprisingly, those with high values of ω and low values of θ will only engage in traditional
labor. Specifically, there will be a second threshold, θ̃, above which individuals will invest in
enterprise if θ > θ is also satisfied. θ̃ is a function of the relative marginal products of labor.
The marginal product of labor in enterprise, M P LE (r, θ), is decreasing in r and increasing
in θ.27 In the traditional sector, M P LT (ω, a0 , r) is determined by the equilibrium level of
lT , and is increasing in ω, ao and r.28 For high enough ω, M P LT (ω, a0 , r) ≥ M P LE (r, θ),
and these individuals will engage only in traditional labor and save all their assets in at .
M P LT (ω, a0 , r) = M P LE (r, θ) defines a threshold level of θ̃ = θ̃(ω, r, ao ) where θ > θ̃ if and
only if M P LT (ω, a0 , r) < M P LE (r, θ). θ̃(ω, r, a0 ) is increasing in all three arguments r, ω
and ao . However, the effect of ao on θ̃ will be negligible and so we simplify to θ̃(ω, r).
     Finally, in the steady state29 , occupational choice is determined by the threshold θ∗ =
θ∗ (r, k, ω) = max{θ(r, k), θ̃(ω, r)}. Low ability individuals whose θ < θ∗ (r, k, ω) will set
k = 0 and lE = 0. c and lT will be determined by ao , r and w. High ability individuals
  26
   Since hours working in the enterprise are upward bounded by 1 while capital invested in skilled trade
must be higher than k, for any individual that invests in the enterprise, lkE must be higher than k. Then
                                          0                  0                                                 0
for any θ < θ, k ≥ k, and ls < 1, fkE (k, lE , θ) < fkE (k, 1, θ) = r. The inequality arises because fkE is
decreasing in k but increasing in lE and θ. Therefore, for individuals with θ < θ, their returns to capital in
enterprise is below r regardless of the level of lE and k. Note that θ is an increasing function of k, r and
other parameters in the production function f E .
                                                                  0
  27
    If there is positive investment in enterprise, condition fkE (k, lE , θ) = r pins down the level of lkE (this
because we assumed f E is homogenous of degree one in (k, lE )). lkE then pins down the marginal product
                                                                  0
                                                    u0 (c ,l )
of labor on the right hand side of condition 3: − u0l (ctt ,ltt ) = flE (kt , lt , θ).
                                                        c
  28
     If an individual does not invest in enterprise and only engages in traditional labor, conditions 1,3,5 and
6 will pin down a level of lT .
  29
     Note that we cannot have growth on the steady state because total hours available to the individual is 1,
and we assume there is no exogenous growth in productivity or individual ability. Therefore, we characterize
a steady state where ct , kt , lt and at are all constant. From optimal condition 1, we can see that, without any
restraints on savings or borrowing, the existence of a steady state requires δ(1 + r) = 1, otherwise we cannot
keep consumption constant. Notice that this because we assumed there is free lending and free borrowing,
                                                                  1
both at the same rate r. Patient individuals whose δ > 1+r           would over save and accumulate infinite wealth
                                                        1
when t → ∞; impatient individuals whose δ < 1+r would borrow too much today and their assets would
approach negative infinity as t → ∞. In both of these cases, the transversality condition would be violated.
While this condition δ(1 + r) = 1 seems restrictive, we could argue that in reality, there will bounds for
borrowing and savings. As long as there is lending and borrowing within some bounds at the rate r, our
results would hold. We do not need δ(1 + r) = 1 for our comparative analysis.


                                                        47
                                                                                          0
whose θ ≥ θ∗ will invest in enterprise and set k ∗ > 0 and lE∗ > 0 such that fkE (k ∗ , lE∗ , θ) = r

        u0 (c∗ ,l∗ )
and − u0l (c∗ ,l∗ ) = flE (k ∗ , lE∗ , θ) = flT (lT ∗ , ω). Their returns to capital will be r regardless of
         c
                                            ∗
their level of wealth. The ratio lkE∗ will be determined by θ and r, while hours in traditional
labor lT ∗ will be determined by w and r. Initial wealth ao will have a small effect on the
level of k ∗ , lE∗ , c and a. Without any constraints, all individuals will immediately jump to
these efficient steady state levels of production and consumption at time t = 1.

Impact of a windfall

With perfect financial markets, an unrestricted windfall will have no effect on entry into
enterprise and little effect on earnings because it does not change θ, ω or r. The individual
will immediate jump to a new steady state with higher level of savings a and consumption c,
and will slightly reduce investment k and hours in enterprise lE because of greater wealth.
    Suppose instead the windfall is granted in the form of in-kind transfers or restricted
funding and there is some minimal “flypaper effect” such that capital stocks are “sticky”
and cannot be divested immediately. This “restricted windfall” will force individuals to
                                          0
produce above their efficient scale, fkE (k, l, θ) < r. c will increase as output increases in the
enterprise. lT will decrease and lE could go either direction, depending on parameter values.
In the longer run, if it is possible to shift capital to a, individuals will divest until the returns
in enterprise drops back to r.


A.2      Cash windfalls in imperfect financial markets
A.2.1     Credit constraint at ≥ 0

For simplicity, we consider an extreme credit constraint, at ≥ 0. The intuition and com-
parative statics are similar for other less restrictive credit constraints. The credit constraint
affects optimality conditions 1, which becomes:

                          u0c (ct , lt )
                                         ≥ δ(1 + r) with equality if at+1 > 0                           (7)
                      u0c (ct+1 , lt+1 )
Initially wealthy entrepreneurs tend to operate at efficient scale, with marginal returns equal
to r. The less wealthy, more impatient and higher ability do not have savings, will satisfy 7
with equality, and will invest below efficient scale with marginal returns are higher than r.
    Credit constraints also change the steady state level of investments, returns to invest-
ments, and threshold θ∗ . Define ρ = 1−δ    δ
                                              , where a high level of ρ indicates impatience.
                                    0
          ∗∗     E∗∗              s   ∗∗ E∗∗
Define k and l       such that fk (k , l , θ) = ρ. For impatient individuals whose ρ > r,
the steady state level of capital and hours in the enterprise would be k ∗∗ < k ∗ and lE∗∗ , and


                                                    48
their returns to capital will be ρ. These individuals are investing below the efficient scale.
For those whose ρ < r, the steady state level of returns will still be r and investments will
still be k ∗ as before. To sum up, the steady state returns to capital will be max{r, ρ}. For
simplicity we will still refer to the threshold as θ∗ , while here θ∗ = θ∗ (r, k, ω, ρ) and θ∗ is
increasing in ρ whenever ρ > r. This means that with a credit constraint, more impatient
individuals will find enterprise undesirable than in the benchmark case.
     Not surprisingly, with a credit constraint, not all whose θ > θ∗ will immediately engage
in enterprise. Specifically, if there is a credit constraint, at ≥ 0, then compared to the
benchmark case with no constraints at all then occupational choice and investment will vary
by type and initial wealth in the following manner:

  1. Low ability individuals, θ < θ∗ . A credit constraint will not change occupational
     choice, consumption or labor supply as they would not invest in the enterprise even if
     they are allowed to borrow.

  2. High ability and High wealth, θ ≥ θ∗ and a0 ≥ k ∗∗ . A credit constraint will
     not change occupational choice. However, investment levels and returns will depend
     on time preferences:

       (a) Patient types (ρ < r) will invest k ∗ , with marginal returns r.
      (b) Impatient types (ρ > r) will invest k ∗∗ < k ∗ , with marginal returns ρ.

  3. High ability and below steady state wealth (θ ≥ θ∗ and k ≤ a0 ≤ k ∗∗ ).
     A credit constraint will reduce initial investment in enterprise only. They will start
     with an enterprise below efficient scale and over time will accumulate enough capital
     to reach the steady state level of investment.

  4. High ability and below minimum scale wealth (θ ≥ θ∗ and a0 ≤ k). A credit
     constraint will change initial occupational choice, but whether this effect is long-term
     or not depends on a0 , δ and abilities in each sector:

       (a) if a0 is close to k or ω is very high, and δ is close to one, the individual would
           be able to save in the initial periods and eventually accumulate enough wealth
           to invest in enterprise. In this case, the credit constraint only temporarily alters
           the individual’s occupational choice. Individuals will not invest in enterprise until
           at+1 is above k, after which they start investing in enterprise and reach the steady
           state level of investment over time.



                                               49
      (b) if a0 is far below k or ω is very low, and δ is close to zero, the individual would
          remain in traditional labor forever. In this case, the credit constraint has a per-
          manent effect on the individual’s occupational choice.

Impact of a windfall We first consider an unrestricted cash windfall. In cases 1 and 2(a),
individuals are in their optimal steady state and the windfall will increase consumption and
savings, and slightly reduce labor supplied, but will not affect entry into enterprise or re-
sulting earnings. In case 2(b), individuals will increase investments in enterprise temporarily
above k ∗∗ , increase total earnings but reduce marginal returns to capital to a level below ρ
but not lower than r; over time they will reduce capital in the enterprise until capital returns
in the enterprise rise up to ρ again. Consumption will rise in the long run, but savings will
be zero in the long run.
    The most relevant cases are 3 and 4. In case 3, the windfall will immediately increase
their investments in enterprise and earnings, and they will continue to increase capital and
earnings over time until they reach k ∗ . Likewise, in case 4, individuals will start and sustain
an enterprise if the windfall is enough to cover the capital requirement k. For those with
extremely low level of initial wealth a0 < k−M , the windfall will not immediately affect their
involvement in enterprises, but it does increase the chances of their engaging in enterprise
in the long run. Whether they will eventually engage in the enterprise will again depend on
their patience and productivity in traditional labor.
    The impacts of a windfall may be temporary. Note that, in both cases 3 and 4, for a
wide range of a0 a non-windfall recipient will eventually reach their optimal capital stock. In
case 3, where k ≤ a0 ≤ k ∗∗ , individuals will accumulate enough capital to reach the steady
state level of investment. In case 4(a), if a0 is close to k or ω is very high, and δ is close to
one, the individual will increase a in the initial periods and eventually accumulate enough
asset to invest in enterprise, once at+1 is above k. Only in case 4(b), for a sufficiently low
initial asset stock or labor productivity, the individual will be “trapped” at very low levels
of income.
    Next we consider a restricted windfall with some flypaper effect. In cases 1 and 2,
individuals are in their optimal steady state and the results are the same as in the case of
perfect financial markets: they will be forced to invest above efficient scale in the short run,
earnings will increase, but returns will be low. In the long-run, they will divest and go back
to the their steady state level of production, merely saving and consuming divested funds.
In cases 3 and 4, individuals are below steady state and the impact will be similar to the
case of the unrestricted windfall.



                                               50
A.2.2      Savings constraint at ≤ 0

Now we consider the case of a savings constraint where individuals do not have any alternative
means to invest other than enterprise. They are, however, still allowed to borrow at rate r.
Condition 1 now becomes

                            u0c (ct , lt )
                                           ≤ δ(1 + r) with equality if at+1 < 0.                                 (8)
                        u0c (ct+1 , lt+1 )

     Savings constraints can lead to investment above the efficient scale. For those with debts
at+1 < 0 (the impatient and poor ones), the first order conditions require their returns to
capital to be the same as r; however, for those without debts at+1 = 0 (the patient and
savings constrained ones), these conditions mean marginal returns are lower than r.
     Among those who do invest in the enterprise, for the patient individuals whose ρ < r, the
steady state level of capital and hours are k ∗∗ and lE∗∗ , and their returns will be ρ. Notice
k ∗∗ /lE∗∗ > k ∗ /lE∗ . For those impatient ones whose ρ > r, steady state returns are still r and
investments are still k ∗ as before. Thus the steady state returns to capital are min{r, ρ}.
Because individuals are still allowed to borrow, any individual with θ ≥ θ∗ would invest in
enterprise, though this θ∗ is lower than in the benchmark and credit constraint cases for
patient individuals whose ρ < r.30 Thus, under a savings constraint, more people run an
enterprise at any t > 0, before and after everyone reaches their steady state. However, the
average rate of returns among entrepreneurs will be lower than r.

Impact of a windfall An unrestricted windfall will not change any individual’s decision
to engage in enterprise, since all those with θ ≥ θ∗ will be already engage in enterprise at the
outset. However, in the short run, since individuals cannot save, the windfall will increase
consumption and capital stocks, and thus further reduce the marginal returns to capital in
the enterprise below min{r, ρ}. In the long run, however, capital and consumption will drop
back to the steady state level and rate of returns will rise back to min{r, ρ}.
    A restricted cash transfer with a flypaper effect will immediately increase capital stocks
and lower the rate of return while having no immediate impact on consumption. Over time,
the individual will consume these transfers until consumption and capital stock falls back to
the steady state level. The average impact on earnings will not be as high as under a credit
  30
    Savings constraints will lower the threshold level of θ∗ for those whose ρ < r. This because now we
would need to define θ∗ based on the new level of returns to capital min{r, ρ} instead of r. For simplicity
of discussion, we will still refer to the threshold as θ∗ , while here θ∗ = θ∗ (r, k, ω, ρ) and θ∗ is increasing in ρ
whenever ρ < r. This means that with a credit constraint, more individuals will be engaging in enterprise
than in the benchmark case.

constraint.

A.2.3    Savings and credit constraints at = 0

Finally we consider the effect of a savings constraint on top of a credit constraint. For
                                                                         0
those who do invest in the enterprise, their rate of returns will be fkE (k, lE , θ) = 1−δ
                                                                                        δ
                                                                                           = ρ.
This means the less patient will be investing below the efficient scale while the more patient
will be investing above the efficient scale. This also changes the threshold level θ∗ for all
                                                     0
individuals. We would need to define θ∗ using fkE (k, lE , θ) = ρ instead of r. For impatient
people whose ρ > r, θ∗ would be higher than in the benchmark case; while for patient ones
whose r > ρ, θ∗ would be lower than in the benchmark case. This means, compared to the
benchmark case, there will be more patient individuals and less impatient ones investing in
enterprise. Individuals with θ < θ∗ (case 1 above) will be engaging in traditional labor only,
as are those with high ability and below minimum scale wealth (case 4(a) and (b)).
    Cash windfalls, restricted or unrestricted, will be invested in all cases.31 Those at or
near their optimal steady state level of capital (including no enterprise) will have an average
return below min{r, ρ}, and those below their steady state will have average returns higher
than this level. Individuals in case 4, however, who do not receive a windfall and have
low initial capital stocks, will not gradually save and accumulate enough capital to start an

Next we consider the case of risky enterprise and risky traditional labor but a riskless financial
alternative. It is possible to model risk in several ways. To incorporate uncertainty, we
illustrate the case where the productivity measures θt and ωt are uncertain and vary over
time.
    Specifically, we assume that realizations of ability are normally distributed around average
expected productivity θ̄ and ω̄ , θt ∼ N (θ̄, δθ ) and ωt ∼ N (ω̄, δω ). Hours in enterprise and
traditional labor are determined after the realization of θt and ωt . Investment decisions kt
and at , however, are made in time t − 1, before the realization of productivity θt and ωt .
We can view the individual as having a stochastic income stream delivered by the stochastic
wage from traditional labor. At the same time, the individual      has the   option of investing
                                                                                          
                                                                            0
                                                                          E        E
his asset in either the risky enterprise with expected return Et 1 + fk (kt+1 , lt+1 , θ) or the
riskless asset with return 1 + r.

   The sole exception is the very poor with initial wealth a0 < k − M . They will no longer pass a point
where they have incentives to save in order to accumulate k. This a moot point if M > k.

returns to enterprise and traditional labor are positively correlated, then the riskless asset
will deliver higher expected utility than the risky enterprise, and the individual will invest
below the efficient scale in the enterprise as long as he is risk averse. In this case, the more
risk averse the individual is, the less he invests in risky enterprise, and the higher the returns
to the enterprise. Similarly, the higher the variability of θ or w, the less the individual invests
in risky enterprise,
    If instead, θt+1 and ωt+1 are negatively correlated, i.e. the returns to enterprise and
traditional labor are negatively correlated, then the enterprise and traditional labor are a
good hedge against each other. The individual will invest more in the enterprise, or even
                                                                        0

r, or even lower than r if the variability of ω is high.
    Here the optimal level of investment is a function of interest rate r, the mean and variance
of productivity θ̄, δθ , ω̄, δω , the correlation between θ and ω, patience δ and the degree of
risk aversion. The optimal choice of whether to invest in enterprise or not then depends on
all these parameters, as well as the minimum scale of production k.

Impact of a windfall We ask the same question as before: Under what conditions will the
cash windfall have a sustained effect on individuals’ investment in enterprise and/or returns
to investment in enterprise?
    Even absent a credit constraint a windfall may induce some individuals to enter into
enterprise, and change investment levels for those who do invest in enterprise, simply through
the wealth effect. If utility displays constant absolute risk aversion (CARA) wealth would not
have any effect on the optimal level of investment, and no effect on entry into enterprise. If,
however, utility displays constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) then a windfall increases the
level of wealth, which then increases the optimal level of investment in the risky enterprise.
    Note that there will be individuals with either very low initial wealth, or very high risk
aversion, who would not invest in the risky enterprise (because of k) but would do so after
receiving the cash windfall. Unless the amount of the windfall is very large (relative of the
minimum scale k) or the individual is very risk averse, we would not expect the windfall to
have a large long-run average effect on investment across many individuals.
    So long as both sectors are risky, for a windfall to result in high levels of investment
and high returns, there must be some other form of imperfection on top of an environment
with risk. Again, a credit constraint is a likely candidate in the setting described. This
conclusion rests on the assumption that there are roughly similar levels of uncertainty in the
two sectors. We turn to that assumption next.

Relative uncertainty Intuitively, the relative volatility of traditional trade and enterprise
matter for investments in enterprise. More importantly, the impact of their relative volatility
depends on initial wealth, the degree of risk aversion, as well as the correlation between
enterprise and traditional labor.
   In general terms, if either enterprise or traditional labor is relative safe (i.e. either σθ
or σω is low), then investment in enterprise k falls as σθ /σω increases; and the more risk
averse the individual is, the steeper the slope of the fall is. If σθ is low while σω is high,
the individual will very likely engage in the enterprise, as long as she is not bounded by a
credit constraint. If σθ is high while σω is low, the individual will likely not engage in the
enterprise. In both cases, a windfall will have little impact on investments and earnings.


                                              54
     If, however, productivity in traditional labor and enterprise are both very volatile (σθ and
σω both high), then the relationship between k and σθ /σω would also depend on initial wealth
a0 , the degree of risk aversion, as well as the correlation between θ and ω. First, consider the
case where traditional labor and enterprise are uncorrelated or positively correlated. Holding
everything else constant, if an individual has very low (or negative) initial wealth, then given
a highly volatile income stream from traditional labor, the safety asset would be much more
appealing to her than the enterprise even if the enterprise is less volatile than traditional
labor. In this case, the individual may not enter into enterprise even if she faces no credit
constraint – she might fear that she would never be able to repay the debt with her earnings.
The same happens if the individual is very risk averse – she would not enter the enterprise
and instead use the safety asset to smooth consumption over time. In both of these cases,
a large windfall might pull the individual out of these situations and allow her to invest in
the enterprise. However, if the returns from traditional labor and enterprise are negatively
correlated, then again k increases as σθ /σω falls, and the individual will likely invest in the
enterprise as long as she is not bounded by a credit constraint. In this case, a windfall will
have a long term effect on those with high levels of risk aversion and low levels of initial
wealth . Again, this because a windfall increases wealth and lead the risk averse to invest
more in risky assets – the enterprise.

We introduce quasi-hyperbolic (β, δ) preferences to see what predictions they hold for in-
vestment and earnings. The problem becomes:

We consider the case of a “naive” type, or “naif”, who makes investment decisions under the
false belief that future selves will act in the interest of the current self, and a “sophisticate”
who knows exactly what her future selves’ preferences will be.

total wealth at time t. cPt+1 denotes the individual’s predicted future decision about ct+1 at
time t.
    The differences between the naif and the sophisticate lie in the predicted consumption

inconsistency problem and will correctly anticipate future consumption. For them, cPt+1 =
ct+1 . Naifs, however, mistakenly believe that future selves will act as if their discount factor
remains unchanged at all future dates. For them cPt+1 < ct+1 . Time-inconsistency will affect
both consumption and savings.
    Time-inconsistency should not affect the optimal use of a cash windfall. For those with
θ ≥ θ∗ , they will still invest until the returns to capital are equal between the enterprise
                                           0
and alternative financial options, or fkE (k, lE , θ) = r. Note that consumption, hours and
savings will all be different under time-inconsistency compared to our benchmark case with-
out time-inconsistency. Thus threshold value of θ∗ is different than in the benchmark case.
However, the effect of a windfall will be similar to that in the benchmark case without time-
inconsistency. This because absent of any credit market imperfections, everyone will already
be at their efficient scale.

A.3.2      Time-inconsistency with credit constraints

For a windfall to be invested and produce high average returns, some other constraint must
be present. Similar to the case without time-inconsistency, credit constraints will suffice. To
see this, we turn to the Euler equations again. Those who are credit constrained will put
every additional dollar they get into consumption (not savings), because they are present-

biased. Therefore    ∂Wt+1
                             = 1 and the Euler equations become

for those who are bounded by the credit constraint, i.e. at+1 = 0.
     With time inconsistency, all credit constrained individuals will invest less than if they
                                                                      1                    1

the sophisticates can correctly anticipate their future consumptions, in their steady state
                                                                           0

strained (at+1 = 0), their steady state level of investment satisfies ρ < fkE (knaive , lE , θ) < τ =
   0
fkE (ksophisticate , lE , θ). They also work less and consume a larger portion of their income.
     Somewhat counter-intuitively, given the levels of β and δ, the sophisticates invest even
less than the naifs. This because the naifs believe (incorrectly) that they will consume less
tomorrow and eventually grow to k = k ∗∗ just like a time-consistent type. Thus they think
their average future marginal utility of consumption is low (i.e. high consumption) and
therefore are willing to consume less than the sophisticates. In practice, however, we might
expect β and δ to be positively correlated, or sophisticates to have both higher β and δ than
the naive. In this case, sophisticates would invest more than naifs.

Impact of a windfall The impact of a cash windfall is similar to the case with time-
consistent preferences. Credit constraints (but not savings constraints) are needed in this
simple model to expect investment and high returns. High investment and returns, moreover,
will only be seen where people start below their steady state. The steady state levels of
capital to which the time-inconsistent will move, however, are lower than the case without
time inconsistency. Thus the average returns will be lower than the benchmark case, but
still greater than r.
     Recall, however, that in the time consistent case the average impact was expected to
increase in patience (at least amongst those below their optimal steady state capital). With
time inconsistency, holding patience constant, we expect the impacts to be larger among
the more time-inconsistent. In practice, however, this comparative static will be difficult to
identify, partly because β and δ may be correlated and partly because they may be difficult
to measure separately.
     More importantly, restricted windfalls with a flypaper effect have the potential to in-
crease investment levels to k ∗ , at least temporarily. Eventually as long as they can divert,

                                                    57
both types will return to their steady state level of investment.. However, if there is a com-
mitment device, for example an in-kind transfer that cannot be diverted over time, then
the sophisticates will more likely be the ones who apply for and use this in-kind transfer.
Such a transfer will not only help some constrained individuals to enter into enterprise or
get closer to their steady state level of investment, it will also change the steady state level
of investment for the sophisticates from ksophisticate to k ∗∗ . A naive type, on the other hand,
would not want to tie their hands to such a transfer; they would prefer a transfer that can be
diverted over time. Intuitively, time inconsistency makes the sophisticates act like a person
with very low discount rate βδ every period, when in fact their real discount rate for the far
future is δ. So a windfall that also act as a commitment device could push them into a new
equilibrium that it wouldn’t do for someone who was time-consistent but merely impatient.

 Notes: Each entry in columns 3 and 4 is estimated from a weighted least squares regression of the dependent variable on an indicator for assignment to
treatment, district fixed effects, and a vector of baseline covariates. Standard errors are clustered at the group level (of up to 5 people). We report the
coefficient on treatment only. All regressions are weighted by inverse probabilities of attrition and selection into the endline tracking sample. Columns
5 through 7 come from a single regression, where we regress treatment on an indicator for treatment, an indicator interacted with gender, and the
gender indicator plus the usual controls. We use these coefficients to calculate the treatment effect on each gender separately. ∗ implies p < .1, ∗∗
