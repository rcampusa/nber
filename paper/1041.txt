                THE EMPLOYMENT AND WAGE EFFECTS OF IMPORT COMPETITION

                                IN THE UNITED STATES



                                   ABSTRACT

     A new methodology is developed to determine the extent to which import

competition has been responsible for labor displacements and wage movements in

specific, allegedly trade—impacted sectors. The procedure involves the

estimation of reduced—form wage and employment equations by sector. These

equations are first derived from a more complete structural model of general

equilibrium resource allocation.

      The proposed methodology is applied to nine manufacturing sectors in the

United States. The sensitivity of employment to the domestic price of imports

varies significantly across these nine sectors, whereas industry wages are

relatively unaffected by movements in the price of the foreign good.

Counterfactual simulations are performed under the hypothetical assumption of

no intensification or abatement of import competition from 1967—1979. The

differences between the paths of unemployment and wages so generated and the

actual, historical paths are attributed to the effects of import competition.

Imports have been responsible for the loss of a large number of jobs in only

one industry, and for a significant loss in wages in two industries, among the

nine studied.

I.       INTRODUCTION

         How important is import competition as a cause of labor displacements

and wage movements? It is generally believed that increased competition from

abroad in particular sectors can have only negligible effects on the aggregate

levels of employment and wages, these variables being primarily determined by

macroeconomic events and policies. But shifts in comparative advantage, just

as any structural changes, may in principle necessitate large movements of

resources from declining sectors to expanding sectors; and if resources are

not perfectly mobile, these reallocations may be accompanied by large changes

in the rewards earned by factors of production that do not move. Thus, import

competition has often been regarded as a prime cause of injury to workers

located in adversely affected sectors, and presumably as a source of gain to

workers in those sectors which have benefitted from shifts in the pattern of

trade.

         Even the limited view that a substantial number of jobs in specific

sectors have been lost to competitors abroad has been challenged in a number

of recent writings. Krueger (1979a, 197gb, 1980a and 1980b), Frank (1977),

Cable (1977) and Walters (1977) have argued that, relative to other structural

changes that occur in a dynamic economy due to, for example, differences in

the rates of technological progress across sectors, differences in the income

elasticities of demand across goods and differences in the rates of

accumulation of alternative factors of production, import competition has been

only a minor factor in labor displacement. Unfortunately, the methodology

used by all of these authors to draw this conclusion is seriously flawed. It

relies on an accounting decomposition that allegedly separates changes in

sectoral levels of employment into their proximate causes. However, as I have

shown elsewhere (Grossman, 1982a), this procedure does not have general
                                       —2—
validity. Unless factor substitution in production is impossible, the

accounting approach may, for example, attribute job displacements to

technological change which were in fact precipitated by intensification of

import competition. Put differently, the accounting procedure is incapable of

distinguishing shifts in isoquants from movements along isoquants. A further

difficulty with this approach is that it identifies the extent of import

competition by the share of imports in domestic consumption. This measure is

inappropriate, however, because the share variable varies not only with shifts

in the foreign supply curve for imports, but also with changes in conditions

of supply in the domestic industry.'

      In Section II, I develop an alternative methodology to address the

question raised at the outset. The procedure I propose involves econometric

estimation of reduced—form, industry—level, wageand employment equations.

These equations are derived from a complete set of structural equations that

together determine factor allocations and factor prices by sector. The

advantage of this approach is that it allows direct measurement of the

sensitivity of sectoral employment and wage levels to shifts in the supply of

imports. When the methodology is applied to nine manufacturing industries in

the United States, using monthly data from 1969 through 1979, it yields quite

plausible parameter estimates.

      In Section III, I define an appropriate measure of change in the extent

of import competition faced by an industry   Paths for employment and wages

for the nine industries are then simulated under the counterfactual assumption

that import competition was "neutral (i.e., did not intensify or abate)
                                     —3—
during the entire period from 1967 to 1979. These paths are compared to those

for actual employment and wages in the sectors, and the differences are

attributed to changes in the intensity of competition from abroad.

      Section IV contains a summary of the findings.

III. SENSITIVITY TO IMPORT COMPETITION: A NEW METHODOLOGY

         In this section, I describe a methodology that can be used to estimate

the sensitivity of sectoral levels of employment and wages to changes in

certain structural variables. The variables, which are exogenous with respect

to activity in any particular, small sector, are those which together

determine the general equilibrium allocation of resources. Among the

variables is the price of the foreign good that competes with domestic output,

which will be assumed to represent the location of a perfectly—elastic,

foreign supply curve.2 The approach I take involves the specification of

reduced—form wage and employment equations. These are first derived from a

more complete, structural model. Then, to test the methodology in

application, I have estimated nine such pairs of equations for various U.S.

manufacturing sectors.

         Consider a three—factor, many—good model of international trade with

imperfect substitutability between home goods and foreign goods and partial

mobility of factors between sectors. The output, Y1, of a representative,

importable—goods sector i is produced with the input of labor, L.

capital, K1 and "energy", E., according to the Cobb—Douglas production

function



                                     a1 L.
                                         a2 (1—a1—a2)

Here     if   is   the rate of Hicks—neutral technological progress and t             denotes

       Energy is assumed to be a traded input, available to sector           i   in


infinitely—elastic supply at an exogenous price, t)e3 The quantity of

energy input used by a profit—maximizing industry is found by setting its

where p.     is the price of sector i's output. Capital and labor are

nontraded factors, and their aggregate stocks are taken to be exogenous, at

least with respect to activity in a small sector. The derived demands for

capital and labor are given by, respectively,



                               a1 p .   Y.

where r1     is the rental rate on capital prevailing in sector 1,     and

w. is the wage rate there. Capital and labor are further assumed to be

partially, but imperfectly mobile between sectors.4 The fraction of the

aggregate stock of each factor that is supplied to sector     i   is a function of

the ratio of its reward in that sector to its aggregate rate of return.

Letting Ka and La be the aggregate stocks of capital and labor,

respectively, and ra and Wa be their aggregate returns, we have:


                    K.          r. c
     (2.5)               =

The real aggregate rates of return are determined by the aggregate stocks of

the nontraded factors and the price of the traded factor, according to:

      Finally, the output of sector                       i    is assumed to substitute imperfectly

for the import good (with exogenous price                                      and for the aggregate

basket of domestic goods. The demand facing this industry (which in

equilibrium is equal to its output) is given by:


                                     *                k            b       k

                                                                                                        0,   B > 0

where Q is real national income and                                    is the applicable ad valorem

tariff rate. There are nine equations, (2.1) through (2.9) which together

determine the nine endogenous variables, Y1, K1, L, E1, p.,

w1, ra and wa, as a function of the exogenous variables, Ka La

e' a' p,t.1 and Q.
      In principle, it would be possible to jointly estimate these nine

equations for a chosen sector. However, the difficulty one would encounter in

collecting a consistent set of data makes this procedure extremely

impractical. Fortunately, an alternative approach can be taken. Our interest

is in the effect of shifts in the foreign supply curve (i.e., changes in

p'(1+t), given our assumption of perfectly—elastic supply) on

employment and wages in the domestic industry). This is essentially a question
                                             —7—
about the reduced form of equations (2.1) to (2.9), so we may solve out for

this reduced form, and estimate it directly. By doing so, we sidestep the

task of collecting data for many of the endogenous variables.

       The reduced form equations for L and w are, after taking logs,

as follows:




      (2.10)         log L1 =        ÷t     +

                                                                       c7log Q

      (2.11)         log w1 =        + 1t   +

                                                                   +

       Of particular interest are the coefficients              and 86. These

measure the elasticities of domestic employment and wages with respect to the

price of the competing import good. In terms of the structural parameters, it

can be shown that:



                                                  b1d
      (2.12)            =          -
                            (b1+b2   c)(1+d)a1
                            __________________       + (b1+b2—d)a2 — (1+d)(1—a1—a2)
                                     1c
and




      (2.13)         86 = ct6/d
                                          —8—
According to the theory outlined above, both           and      should be

positive, reflecting the intuitive notion that a weakening of import

competition should raise employment and wages in the domestic industry. The

mechanism that applies here is the following one. An upward shift in the

foreign supply curve, manifested as a rise in the price of imports, causes

substitution in demand to the domestic good. This induces a rise in the

domestic price, and therefore an upward shift in the derived demand for

factors of production. The ultimate result is an increase in factor inputs

and in factor prices, the division between them depending upon the

elasticities of factor supplies to the sector.

      Evidently, both employment and wages will be more sensitive to import

competition the larger (in absolute value) is b1 and the smaller (in

absolute value) is b2. The more mobile is labor, the more responsive is

employment and the less so are wages. Finally, the sensitivity of both wages

and employment to changes in p increases with the degree of capital

mobility if and only if b1 +        >   — 1;   i.e., if demand for the sector's
                               b2
output is inelastic with respect to its own price.

      Equations (2.10) and (2.11) provided the bases for the econometric

estimation. An error term and a set of dummy variables for the months of the

year was appended to each equation, and a lag structure was allowed for each

of the exogenous variables. These lags were twenty—four months for the

aggregate capital stock, the aggregate labor force and the price of energy,

eighteen months for the aggregate price and the price of the competing import,

and six months for real income. The estimates were computed using fourth

degree, polynomially distributed lags (except for real income, where a

third—degree polynomial was used) on monthly data from January, 1969 through

December, 1979.
                                           —9—
        The data set was constructed as follows. First, nine industries,

defined as either three or four digit S.I.C. categories, were chosen for

application. These industries, all of which are generally regarded as having

suffered intense competition from imports in the recent past, are as follows:

hardwood veneer and plywood; leather tanning; footwear; pottery and related

ceramic products; bolts, nuts, rivets and washers; ball and roller

bearings; radios and televisions; photographic equipment; and dolls, games

and toys. Employment for each industry, measured in average man—hours per

week, was taken to be the product of the number of production workers and the

average number of hours worked per week.      I used average hourly earnings as

the measure of wages. All these series were taken from Employment and

Earnings (various issues).

        For the aggregate price level, I chose the wholesale price index, and

industrial production was taken as a proxy for real income. These variables

as well as those for the labor force and the price of energy were taken from

the Survey of Current Business (various issues). The aggregate capital stock

variable was calculated accordina to the formula K. .,
                                                       t1 = I.+(1—6)K

where        is gross investment and   o   is the constant rate of

depreciation. For real gross investment, I used total expenditure on new

plant and equipment divided by the implicit price deflator for fixed

investment. Since these data are available only on a quarterly basis, monthly

values were generated by interpolation. The benchmark observation for the

capital stock was taken from the Office of Business Economics (1971), and the

rate of depreciation from Jorgenson and Stephenson (1967).

The construction of the import price series posed the greatest problems, both

conceptual and otherwise. Price indices for imports by disaggregated

commodity categories are not available for the United States. Instead, I

first performed a concordance between the S.I.C. categories and the

seven—digit, Schedule A import classifications. Then I calculated unit values

for these finely disaggregated import groupings by dividing values by

quantities. Finally, I formed fixed—weight indices of the unit values, using

full—year 1974 values as weights. The tariff factors were constructed

similarly, using a concordance between the S.I.C. categories and the

T.S.U.S.A. classifications under which tariff rates are specified. Specific

tariffs were converted to their ad—valorem equivalents, again using values and

prices for 1974. The tariff factors were adjusted in several cases to reflect

temporary, escape clause protective measures6, and all factors incorporate

the ten percent import surcharge in force during the latter part of

      The estimated, reduced—form elasticities of wage and employment levels

with respect to the domestic price of the import—competing goods are reported

in Table 1. The figures shown represent long—run or total elasticities

(i.e., the sum of the individual lag coefficients). Standard errors are in

parenthesis.

      Almost all of the coefficient etimates are positive, as is predicted by

the theory. To characterize the results, it seems that the sensitivity of

employment to import prices varies significantly across industries.     In the

cases of leather tanning, nuts and bolts, ball bearings, photographic

equipment and toys, the elasticities are quite small, so that a large change

in the import price would be needed to affect a significant loss of jobs in

the U.S. industries. The elasticities are moderately sized for footwear,

pottery   and hardwood, whereas employment in the radio and television industry

is found to be very sensitive to import competition. This latter finding is

consistent with the high cross—price elasticities I estimated between domestic

and imported televisions in Grossman (1982b).

       The estimates of wage responsiveness to import competition are more

consistent across sectors. In all cases, these elasticities are small,

indicating that changes in the extent of foreign competition in particular

industries can effect only minor changes in the cross—sectoral structure of

relative wages in the United States. This finding suggests a relatively high

degree of inter—sectoral labor mobility.

       Reduced—form parameter values of the sort presented here are useful in

their own right, because they tell us, for example, the impact that proposed

tariff changes would likely have on employment and wages. The conclusion in

this regard is that tariffs on a number of goods could be reduced or

eliminated with only minimal effect on the number of jobs in the domestic

industry or the wages paid there. At the same time, protection such as

provided by escape clause measures is unlikely at any reasonable level to

preserve many jobs in an industry or to halt a decline in the relative wages

of a group of workers, if the relevant elasticities are small.

          In order to address the question of the extent to which import

competition historically has been responsible for the loss of jobs or the

relative decline in wages in certain sectors, it is necessary to supplement

the parameter estimates with a counterfactual path of import prices

corresponding to an assumed absence of import competition. This is the task

of the next section.

IV.   COUNTERFACTUAL SIMULATIONS



        A number of standards could conceivably be applied to measure the

extent of import competition. Those that rely on the quantity of imports

alone, or on the ratio of imports to domestic consumption or output, are

suspect, because these variables are affected not only by conditions in the

foreign industries, but also by changes in tastes or production conditions at

home. What is desirable, instead, is to define import competition in terms of

the location and movements of the foreign import supply curve.

        If foreign supply is assumed to be perfectly elastic, then import

prices, rather than import quantities, should form the basis for measurement

of the extent of competition.9 For the purposes of this study, a situation

of neutral import competition (i.e., neither an intensification, nor an

abatement) is defined as a constant relative price of the import good in terms

of the domestic aggregate price level. It is a fall in the relative price of

imports (not relative to the domestic price of good i, which is endogenous,

but relative to domestic prices in general) which begins the process by which

import competition effects a reallocation of resources.   Of course, a fall in

      relative to both p1   and      caused by some other structural

factor could begin the same reallocation process, but then it would not be

appropriate to attribute responsibility for the resulting movement of

resources or changes in factor prices to imports.

        Equations (2.10) and (2.11), with monthly dummy variables and lag terms

added, were simulated using historical data for all of the exogenous

variables, except for the domestic price of imports. In place of

             I used a series generated by multiplying a by the
                                      - 14   -

observation   of the relative domestic price of the import in terms of the

aggregate price index for January, 1967. Thus, I have generated paths for

employment and wages that correspond to the counterfactual assumption of

neutral import competition over the entire period, with everything else held

constant. Pairs of simulations were performed for all industries, except in

the two cases where the reduced—form coefficient estimates on the import price

had the theoretically incorrect (i.e., negative) sign.

       The hypothetical paths of employment and wages are depicted in Figures

1 through 16, as are the historical paths of these variables. By comparing

the simulated and actual values, we have an estimate of the effect of import

competition in each industry. Some of the information in the figures is

summarized in Table 2, where I present the historical and simulated average

levels of employment and earnings for the year 1979.

       It is evident from Table 2 that the experience with foreign competition

has not been uniform across sectors. In three industries, there would have

been less average employment in 1979 than was actually observed, had import

competition been neutral from 1967 to 1979, and in two sectors wages would

have been lower. In four industries import competition has been responsible

for the loss of a moderate amount of employment, ranging from 30,000 to

229,000 manhours per week. Only in the case of a single industry among the

nine studied (radios and televisions) can it be said that competition from

abroad has cost the United States a significant number of jobs. It is

estimated that employment in the radio and television industry would have

been 71.3 percent greater in 1979 than was observed, had import competition

been neutral for the preceeding twelve years. This corresponds to a loss of

approximately 60,000 jobs in this industry.

      The table shows that import competition has not had a major effect on

wages in most of the industries studied. In only two of the eight simulations

can we attribute to imports a loss of hourly earnings in 1979 greater than ten

cents per hour. Again, this evidences a fairly high degree of labor mobility

out of declining sectors, at least in the long run (i.e., after eighteen

months).

      Note that the methodology suggested here could be applied to a wider

range of questions. For example, it would be possible to estimate the effects

that the oil price increases have had on employment and wages in particular

industries by replacing the historical series for        with an assumed

counterfactual. Similar'y, one could simulate what the effect on the labor

market would have been of various, hypothetical trade policies, such as the

gradual reduction or elimination of protection. Of course, the procedure does

not allow us to trace the fortunes of those who are displaced from a declining

sector, as to whether, for example, they find new jobs in expanding sectors

and if so, how quickly. In order to answer to these important policy

questions, one would need detailed, micro—survey data.

V.   SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

       In a dynamic, open economy, resource reallocations and movements in

industry factor prices may have many proximate, structural causes. For

example, income elasticities of demand or rates of technological progress may

vary across sectors, or differences in the rates of accumulation of

alternative factors of production may effect changes in relative factor prices

and therefore relative costs of production. In recent years, much attention

has focused on the extent to which import competition has been a major cause

of labor displacements and wage movements, in comparison to these other

structural determinants of the industry structure of employment and wages.

       In this paper I have provided a methodology for addressing this issue.

I specified a model that determines the quantities of resources employed in a

given sector, and the equilibrium factor prices there.   The. model assumes:

(i) the existence of three factors and many goods; (ii) that two factors,

labor and capital, are imperfectly mobile between sectors, whereas the third,

energy, is a traded good available in infinitely elastic supply; and (iii)

that domestic output substitutes imperfectly for a competing, import good.

       Due to problems of data collection the structural model was not

estimated directly, but first was solved for its reduced—form. Reduced—form

wage and employment equations were estimated for nine, allegedly

trade—impacted manufacturing sectors in the United States. Particular

emphasis was placed on the estimated elasticities of employment and wages with

respect to the domestic price of imports. These coefficients indicate the

sensitivity of the domestic industry labor market to import competition. It

was found that, by and large, wages are not very sensitive to competition from

abroad, whereas the responsiveness of employment varied widely across sectors.

      In order to attribute certain job losses or wage movements to

competition from imports, it is necessary first to define a measure of the

extent of import competition. Here I used the relative price of imports in

terms of the domestic price aggregate as such a measure, and simulated paths

for employment and wages under the counterfactual assumption that this

relative price remained constant from 1967 through 1979. The difference

between the paths so generated and the actual, historical paths of employment

and wages is an estimate of the effect of changes in the extent of import

competition.   I found that employment and wages would actually have been lower

in some sectors than was actually observed had import competition been neutral

during the period. Even in cases where job or earnings losses could be

attributed to import competition, the effect was relatively small, except in

one industry (radios and televisions) where competition from abroad has had

evidently a major, negative influence on both the level of employment and the

wages paid to those with jobs.

      comments on the methodology. Robert Johnson and David Zimble provided

1.    Martin and Evans (1981) have noted several other difficulties with such

      accounting decompositions.
                                               could be carried out without the
2.    In principle, the proposed methodology

      assumption that the foreign import supply curve is perfectly elastic.

      However, without this assumption it would be necessary to collect data

      on the structural variables for all the countries that export to the

      United States in order to distinguish movements along a supply curve

      from shifts in the curve. Richardson (1974) has shown that the

      assumption that the United States is small in the market for its imports

      may be justified for many manufactured goods.

3.    The energy variable was included largely to capture the structural

      effects on employment and wages of the oil price increase. This

      explains why energy is modelled here as a traded good.

 4.    For a discussion of partial factor mobility in the standard trade

       models, see Mussa (1982) or Grossman (1983).   The particular modeling of

       intersectoral factor mobility used here is similar to that in Hill and

       Mendez (1982).

5.   In the case of one industry, namely hardwood veneers, data availability

     dictated an estimation period of January, 1972 through December, 1979.

6.   The various safeguard measures implemented by the United States in the

     last decade are listed and discussed in Gard and Riedel (1980).

7.   The resulting series of tariff—adjusted import prices are presented in

     an appendix that is available from the author upon request.

8.   The other coefficient estimates of the reduced—form equations are not of

     direct concern here, and are therefore relegated to an Appendix that is

     available from the author upon request.

9.   If import supply has a strictly positive but finite price elasticity,

     then neither prices nor quantities alone can be used to measure import

     competition. It is then necessary to distinguish shifts in the foreign

     supply curve from movements along it, which can only be accomplished by

     estimating supply equations for each country producing competing goods.
