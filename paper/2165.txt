           Project Appraisal and Foreign Exchange Constraints:
                           A Simple Exposition


                                 ABSTRACT



     In an earlier paper,' we showed that the value of shadow
prices depends   on   how  the   government  contemplates re-
equilibrating the economy to the perturbation associated with any
project, except   in the extreme case where the government has
chosen all policy instruments optimally. Only under restrictive
conditions will relative shadow prices for traded goods equal
relative international prices.    We develop here a general
methodology for calculating shadow prices, which expresses the
prices as a weighted average of domestic and international
prices. The formulae provide the conditions under which the
border price rule is valid. For instance, so long as there are
non—traded goods, even if the government leaves tariffs unchanged
(so that    relative domestic prices of traded goods remain
unchanged), unless the government completely neutralizes the
induced change in domestic income, there will be changes in the
prices of non—traded goods. These will preclude the use of the
border price rule.

      In our earlier paper, we raised three points:

      (1) In general, any project has       consequences   for dosestic incose,

governeent revenue, and foreign exchange. Depending on which constraints are

binding, the governient will have to adjust taxes, subsidies, expenditures,

and foreign borrowing whenever new projects are undertaken.

      (2) The calculation of shadow prices depends on how the            governa.nt

the the project, except in the    th.    rather •xtress case where the governeent

has chosen all policy     instrusents   optically, in which case   the   welfare

consequences   of   all forss of adjustaent are identical.

      (3) Only under certain restrictive conditions would relative shadow

prices for traded goods    equal relative international prices.
      The   general   validity of these propositions is, by now, well       established.
      In spite of this, the "border price" rule (that shadow prices are

proporionel to border or world prices) continues to enjoy considerable

popularity, partly because of the seemingly convenient simplification it

provides for calculation purposes, and partly because of its political

overtones, suggesting limited government interference in the market. If

correct, our results have an important practical implication--namely, that the

"border price" rule is applied too broadly, and should not be used unless the

country in question actually follows one of a limited set of policies for

which it is valid. We, therefore, welcome this opportunity to clarify our

results and further explain their application.

      Given the range of possible equilibrating mechanisms, the delineation of

all circumstances under which shadow prices are proportional to international

prices and the derivation of shadow price formulas when they are not equal to

international prices is a complex matter beyond the scope of our original

paper, the objective of which was to develop a general framework into which

such problems should be cast. The authors of recent comments on our paper2

argue that shadow prices may indeed be equal or proportional to international

prices udder somewhat more general conditions than a casual reading of our

earlier paper would suggest. Rather than debating the questions of which set

of assumptions is more appropriate or assessing the consequences of any

technical errors in the Dinwiddy-Teal piece, we believe it would be more

useful to recast the problem in general terms to see what is at issue.



A GENERAL FORMULATION

      We suppos. that the economy in question is initially (i.e., before the

project) in some equilibrium. This equilibrium may or may not imply trade

balance, a public deficit, or distortionary indirect taxes on trade,

production, and consumption. The nature of the initial equilibrium by itself

is not of importance for shadow price derivation, which depends only how a

particular project effects the change in the equilibrium position.

      To further simplify the analysis, we assume: a) the level of the

country's foreign trade activities do not affect the terms of trade it feces

(the small country assumption); and b) there are no quote restrictions on

consumption .3

      A "project' is defined as any small change in the composition of

national production. We shall use the superscript T" to denote traded

commodities and the superscript "N" to denote non-traded commodities.

denotes the set of traded commodities,7) the set on non-traded commodities,

and5 the set of all goods. CT denotes aggregate spending on traded goods

measured at world prices,

                      dX =
                              (dXi)

      Th. analytical problem is to determine the effect of the project on

national welfare once a new equilibrium is restored. We decompose the impact

on national welfare of the pro3ect into two elements: a) changes in th. level

of (current) utility of the representative consumer, and b) the present value




3 See our previous paper for a discussion of the relation between shadow
   prices and quota restrictions.

of net changes in the trade surplus/deficit. The former measures the

contemporary benefits of additional domestic spending, while changes in the

foreign exchange balance imply future benefits and costs.5 Letting dW, dU,

and dF stand for changes in welfare, consumer utility, and the trade surplus

respectively, we have:


                         dW = dU                                             (1)


where ? is the relative value of a unit increase in the trade surplus to a

unit increase in present utility.6

        Our objective now is to relate dU and dF to changes in consumption

levels, or alternatively to changes in domestic income and prices; and to

relate these changes to the underlying perturbation (dx). Current utility is

just a function of the current levels of consumption. Letting C1 denote the

consumption of the i'th commodity,


                         dU =    1 (U/C ] dC i                               (2)

                                iEJ
Since the marginal utility of the i'th good is dust equal to th. price of the

good times the marginal utility of income, we have (after normalizing the

marginal utility of income at unity):


                         dU q dC                                             (3)

                                iE
where      is the consumers' price of good 1.




5 We simplify our analysis by assuming the consumers do not save; thus, the
   direct effect of an increase in their current income is only an increase in
   current consumption. This also consistent with optimal investment/savings
   behavior by consumers, but not necessarily by the government at the same
   time.

   of dynamic modeling.

        SubstItuting (9') into (6) and (5'), while setting V1 at unity, and then

substituting into (1), we obtain the following expression for the change in

national welfare as a function of the direct foreign exchange earnings of the

project, the net change in dosestic conauser spending, and the change in

conauaer prices brought about by the project:


                 dW       dYd -        C   dq + 2(dYW - 9 dYd - 0 dq)                              (10)
                                            -7-



where we employed the standard vector notation C.dq =      E   C.dq.. This equation

takes account of the value of the project in international and domestic prices

(through dYW and dYd respectively), price and indirect tax changes (through

dq), and changes in direct taxes and subsidies (through dYd).

     We define the relative shadow price of any two goods i and j by

                         s/s
                          1

where the total derivatives take into account the full equilibrium adjustment

to the project-induced perturbation.

      The rest of the general analysis consists of calculations of the values

for dq and dyd associated with any project (dXi). where the calculations must

be done subject to any constraints imposed and the marginal public finance

behavior of the government. These are then introduced into (10) and (11) to

derive shadow prices. We proceed to demonstrate how this can be done for

several specific situations.



CONSUMPTION OF TRADED GOODS ONLY

      We first consider cases where there is no consumption of non-traded

goods. While admittedly of limited interest, these cases are useful as the

most straightforward illustration of our approach and our conclusion that the

border price rule holds only in special circumstances. We begin with the

simplest cases   in   which the government takes no action to adjustment domestic

prices to the perturbations caused by a project, using only direct taxes and

subsidies. We then consider cases where prices as well as direct taxes are

adjusted to restore equilibrium.

      In cases where the equilibrium entails constant domestic prices,

complete results are obtained easily. Here, (10) reduces to:

                          dW dYd MdYW -           0 dyd)                      (12)
                                      -8-



It is thus immediate that if the government acts to sterilize completely

domestic expenditures from the project (so, dYd 0). then dW is proportional

to the direct foreign exchange earnings of the project (dYW), so that the

border price rule holds. This is the same as saying that the government

shifts its portfolio from a traded commodity to foreign exchange. Setting

dYd = 0 implies 100k taxation of the domestic value of the project with no

accompanying lump-sum payments of these receipts.

      If the government makes compensating adjustments (of y kind) to

maintain the trade balance at its previous level, then the change in domestic

expenditure, dyd, must be exactly equal to iie times the change in foreign

exchange directly due to the project, dYw. Hence,


                      dW = dYW/8


Again, the border price rule holds.
      More generally, whenever the government imposes a 100 percent tax on

domestic income from the project and then allows domestic expenditure to

increase by some fixed fraction of the project's foreign exchange earnings,

relative shadow prices will equal relative border prices. These case are

those where:

                  dYd = ,dYW


The first two cases above correspond to i0 and v1/e respectively.7 These

results in turn are special cases of the still more general result that when

all relevant total perturbations are simply proportional to dYW, shadow prices

are also proportional to dYw.




7 An alternative interpretation of this condition is that public sector firms
   are required to keep their books in terms of border prices and the tax rate
   on such profits is set equal to 1-u.
                                                 -9-



        Now consider the case where the change in domestic expenditure, dYd, is

a function of the project itself and there is no net direct taxation. Here,


                        dYd                                                                      (13)

                                   i El..



If   the economy is indifferent to accumulating one more unit of foreign

exchange or incurring the foreign exchange coats of increasing domestic

consumption by one unit, then this implies                   =   lie,     a situation which we

referred in our previous paper as one of optimal borrowing. Clearly, (12)

implies that in this situation, the border price rule is correct.

        Finally, it is trivial to see that if relative domestic prices of the

traded goods are the same as their relative border prices, then the relative

shadow prices will also be in this ratio.

        We have thus identified five circumstances where the border price rule

will hold when domestic prices do not change and there are no non-traded

consumption goods:

        U) When the government equilibrates to leave domestic expenditure
             after the project unchanged (complete sterilization of domestic
             expenditure);

        (2) When the government equilibrates to leave a fixed trade balance
             after the project;

        (3) When the level of foreign borrowing is set optimally before the
             project (? = 1/8);

        (4) When the government uses direct taxation and lump-sum subsidies to
             increase domestic expenditures in proportion to the direct foreign
             exchange earnings of the project;

        (5) When there is a non-distortionary trads regime (domestic prices
             proportional to international prices).

        In all other cases, the         border    price rule cannot be directly applied.

Indeed, using (12) we   can       re-write      (11)   as

                                    =                                                            (11')

Here, the shadow prices are weighted averages of domestic and international

prices.8

      Consumption Taxes

      It is more difficult to get the border price rule to work when

ad)ustments are made in consumption taxes. We will not develop a general rule

of when border pricing is incorrect, but instead only consider several simple

examples.

      It can be demonstrated straightforwardly that if the government changes

all commodity prices in proportion, while using direct taxes to hold dYd equal

to zero, then (10) will reduce to a form essentially identical to (12) because

the commodity taxation will act identically to an income tax. In this

situation all of the previous results will continue to hold, with the change

in the price level playing the same role as changes in income did previously.

      Of greater interest are cases when only one consumption tax, e.g., that

on good 1. is altered and no lump sum transfers/taxes are imposed, so that the

change in domestic income equals the value of the pro)ect in domestic prices.

Then, (10) reduces to


               dW = dYd -
                                 C1dq1
                                          MdYW - edYd   -
                                                             Ødq]          (14)



If the change in the tax on good 1 is just sufficient so that dF =   9   the

welfare measure further simplifies to


               dW = (1     1                  —              dYW]        (14')
                                c1ce,n1ndYd        CC1/01]




8 Shadow prices are a positive weighted average (i.e., a > 0) provided that
   ie < 1.

9 Here, dq1 = (dYW   - e
                               dyd)/01.
                                                —11—


It is clear that the welfare change in (14') will be proportional to the

project's border price value only if the total indirect tax rate on each good

is the sane for all goods, a special case of which is zero indirect taxes.

Under these circumstances dyd would be proportional to dYW because the

coefficient of dYd becomes zero. Letting (1 +               r)   equal the common ratio of

domestic to world prices, this result follows from the basic properties of the

demand functions themselves. Engel aggregation implies that e                      1 +   t   and

Cournot aggregation implies that                 -Cj(1 +   t).       Otherwise, the border

prices rule will fail. The sane conclusions hold if the consumption tax on

good 1 is altered so as       to   keep contemporaneous utility constant, dU                 0,

allowing all benefits to derive through dF.1°

        Tb. general conclusion is that the "border price" rule fails unless the

various public finance instruments are set according some first- or second-

best rules derived from the solution            of en optimizing problem. When taxes are
set   in   a   more       fashion, the "border price" rule cannot be expected to

hold.



INCLUSION OF NOW-TRADED GOODS

        The sore interesting and relevant cases are thos. where consumption of

non-traded goods must also         be   considered. Th. involve additional constraints

on the actions of      the   government which must account for the market equilibrium

conditions       that for each non-traded good

                                                                                                  (15)

If the pro)ect leaves        output   of any non-traded good, e.g.,          goad , unchanged

Equations (16) ispose a set of restrictions on the feasible set of actions

which the governeent can take, above and beyond those in the previous cases.11

     The aisplest case is when all dosestic prices. q, are left unchanged.

This isplies that dYd suet also equal zero and fros (11) that the border price

rule will hold. This is the ease as case (1) above where, because of cosplete

sterilization, the entire effect of the pro)ect is on foreign borrowing.

      Interesting results only eserge when one or sore dosestic prices are

allowed to change when a new pro3ect perturbe a pre-existing equilibrius.

Each set of feasible adjustsent rules would require a separate set of shadow

price calculations. Here, we consider only a few specific cases.

      For instance, suppose that in response to a perturbation, the governeent

allows the exchange rate facing consuners to ad)uat, which changes the

relative prices of traded and non-traded goods, but leaves the relative prices

of traded goods as before. We further sisplify by considering only one non-

traded good, C. Taking this good as the nuneraire, we can denote the change

in the exchange rate as dE. This isplies


                       dq = qdE                                              (17)

11 That is. the nunber of connodity taxes and direct taxes/subsidies which can
   be set independently is reduced by the nusber of non-traded goods. For
   non-traded consodities whose output changes due to a pro)ect, the left-hand
   side of (16) is not zero but the change in output of that non-traded good.

Since (19) has the same form as (12), relating the change in welfare to the

change in domestic expenditures and the direct foreign exchange earnings of

the project, the same qualitative analysis can be applied. The only

difference is that with the inclusion of the non—traded good, en equilibrating

change in the consumers exchange rate is made. This change is incorporated in

the "hats" used in (19).13 Therefore, when the the only price changes are due

to exchange rate changes, the border price rule will be correct:

        (1) When the government equilibrates to leave domestic expenditure
             after the project unchanged (co.plete sterilization" of domestic
             expenditure);

        (2) When the government equilibrates to leave a fixed trade balance
             after the project;

        (3) When the level of foreign borrowing is set optimally before the
             project ( 1/);
        (4) When the government uses direct taxation and lump-sum subsidies to
             increase domestic expenditures in proportion to the direct foreign
             exchange earnings of the project;

        (5) When there is a non-distortionary trade regime (domestic prices
             proportional to international prices).

For any other taxation rules with exchange rate adjustment, relative shadow

prices do not equal relative international prices.14 The general shadow price

formula will be the same as (11'). but with the weight a now b.ing


                           (1 -)/(1 -+$)
Not.   that as    becomes smell, the shadow price ratio approaches the domestic

price ratio.




13 This analysis, of course, requires that s not equal   to   zero. This will be
   the case as long as the


14 It is easy to show that this analysis is unchanged for any price adjustment
   rule in which there is a one-to-on. relationship between the consumer price
   changes end the change in expenditure.

      Alternatively, suppose that the adjustments to price and domestic

expenditures are arbitrarily proportional. to the induced disequilibrium in the

foreign exchange market. In this case, the border price rule will be correct.

To see this, we write


                         dq = k1dF                                         (20.)



                         dYd                                               (20b)
                               kdF

The choice of k must be consistent with equation (16), so that



                     0    dF((CN/Yd]k          E IaCM/aq 3k )              (21)

                                           iE
Substituting (21) into (5)' (with VI =1), we sse that the chang. in

contemporaneous utility will be proportional to dF. Naking th. same

substitution into (9) and then (6') shows that dF will be proportional to dYW,

thus proving that dW will be proportional to the project's direct foreign

exchange earnings and supporting the border price rule. The result stems from

government behavior which uses lump sum taxes/subsidies (kr) to equilibrate

in a way so that everything is proportional to the direct foreign exchange

earnings of the project.

      Obviously, there are many other behavioral rules which a government

could use   to   re-equilibrate an economy. Each would require explicit

calculation of the project-induced changes in prices and domestic expenditures

and then measured using (10). It should be clear, however, that ther. is no

presumption that the results will be shadow prices which correspond with

international prices, except in special circumstances.

CONCLUDING COMMENTS

         We have demonstrated that it is appropriate to use relative border

prices as the relative shadow prices for traded good only in special

situations where the government. The underlying reason for this conclusion is

that generally investment pro)ects affect budget constraints in domestic

prices and changes in these budget constraints lead to spending changes.

These leakages, in turn, can affect both contemporaneous utility and the

future utility (via the foreign exchange balance) in ways such that knowing

only the direct foreign exchange values of two pro)ects is not sufficient to

determine their ranking in terms of social welfare, or even to determine if a

pro)ect with positive foreign exchange earnings will have positive net social

value.

         Moreover, so long as there are non-traded goods, even if the government

leaves tariffs unchanged (so that relative domestic prices of traded goods

remain unchanged), unless th. government completely neutralizes th. induced

change in domestic income, there wi]]. be changes in the pric. of non-traded

goods.15 Th. magnitudes of these price changes, and the consequent w.lfare

effects, depend on all price and income elasticities.

         Thus, although the border price rule will not, in g.n.xal, be valid, we

have developed a framework which allows shadow prices to be calculated. These

calculations will in gensral necessitate knowledge of income and   price
elasticities, as well, as of the r.lativs values of contemporaneous utility and

future utility in th. form of current foreign exchange holding.. Fortunately

for th. practitioner this should not usually require additional estimations

since these are precisely the parameters which ordinarily are used to




   It should be noted that the price of non-traded goods, relative to traded
   goods, can be viewed as th. reel exchange rate.

calculate shadow prices for non-traded goods and factors. Our results serely

isply that this inforsation be used also in the calculation of the shadow

prices for traded goods.

      It would be convenient for econosic theorists if we could prasuse that

governeents set all of their policies optically, in tercs of a well defined

social welfare function. It is apparent, however, that all too often we

observe policies that sees inconsistent with any reasonable" social welfare

function, and indeed, with each other. This say be because we (the econosic

analysts) have badly us-specified the sodel of the econosy, and in

particular, the constraints facing the governsent. But it say also be because

there is no reason to believe the outcoses of the political/adsinistrative

processes should accord with a well defined social welfare function.

      In these circucetancea, what should be the nature of the advice given by

econocists? It is apparent that that advice predicated on the presuaption

that all other governeent actions are optically set, to saxisize a well

defined social welfare function, is not only based on an incorrect description

of the econosy, but also, were it taken seriously, sight have significant

adverse effects. There is a fashion esong sos• econosists to build into their

welfare analyses certain "political constraints"; but econosists sees to have

no particular ecusen in ascertaining what are and are not political

constraints. The best that econosists can do is describe how governeents have

in fact b.haved in the past--how they have equilibrated th. econosy to various

kinds of suall p.rturbations including those pro).ct-r.let.d--and to describe

the cons.quenc..--hsre, th. shadow price isplications--of alternative ways in

which the econocy sight be equilibrated. We hope that our paper has clarified

how this say be dons.
