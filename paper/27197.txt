Measuring the Environmental Benefits of Electric Vehicles (Relative to the Car that Wasn't
Bought)

                                         ABSTRACT

The true net environmental benefit of an electric vehicle (EV) is measured relative to the vehicle
that an EV buyer would have bought and driven had they not opted for an EV. This
"counterfactual" vehicle cannot be observed, but its fuel economy can be estimated. We use
quasi-experimental variation in a generous California EV subsidy program to show that buyers of
EVs would have, on average, purchased relative fuel-efficient gasoline-powered cars had they not
gone electric. The true incremental pollution abatement arising from the EV is thus substantially
smaller when compared to this appropriate reference vehicle, as opposed to, say, the average new
passenger car.

          1    Introduction

          Policy-makers, in the U.S. and around the world, view adoption of electric vehicles (EVs)
          as central to addressing urban air pollution, lowering carbon emissions and reducing over-
          all petroleum consumption. The long-run vision is one of an electrified transportation sector
          powered by clean, renewable energy and achievable through a combination of generous sub-
          sidies and government mandates. The setting for this paper, California, provides one such
          example. California is at the forefront of the EV transition in the United States.1 Still, this
          transition remains in the early stages. Fewer than 5 percent of the California light-duty vehicle
          fleet is electric and, according to the California Energy Commission, roughly 27 percent of Cal-
          ifornia's electricity is obtained from renewable sources. Both of these are increasing rapidly.
          California's Governor Brown issued an Executive Order B-16-12 that calls for 1.5 million zero-
          emission vehicles statewide by 2025 as part of a goal to reduce petroleum use in cars and trucks
          by 50 percent by 2030. Moreover, California's Renewable Portfolio Standard calls for 50 percent
          of electricity to be generated from renewable sources by 2030. Senate Bill 100 will, if passed,
          mandate a path to a 100 percent renewable grid.
              The extent to which electric vehicle adoption helps to achieve environmental policy goals
          depends on the emissions of electric vehicles relative to the alternative vehicle. Intuitively, a
          household that switches to an electric vehicle will generate a larger environmental benefit if it
          replaces a gas guzzler than if it replaces a gas sipper. Importantly, it is insufficient to simply
          observe what car is sold or retired when a household buys an EV. What matters is the fuel
          efficiency of the car that would have been purchased had the household chosen a conventional
          vehicle instead.   2


              In this paper, we seek to estimate the fuel economy of the cars that are displaced when Cal-
          ifornia households buy EVs. We propose a transparent, quasi-experimental design that allows
          us to estimate the distribution of fuel economy of cars that would have been purchased if an
          EV had not. Our approach builds on previous work that documents a causal increase in EV
          purchases induced by a major California EV subsidy policy called the Enhanced Fleet Modern-
          ization Program (EFMP).3 The pilot program began in July 2015 - and over the first two years
   1 In 2020, roughly half of all EVs on the road in the US are in California.
   2 Although   not the focus of this paper, there are also important considerations on the supply side. If EV penetration
proceeds far in advance of electric grid transformation, the maximum potential environmental benefits will be capped
as a result of powering transportation with fossil fuels. Furthermore, as Jenn et al. (2016) notes, interactions between
policies may offset the environmental benefits of electric vehicles by allow automakers more flexibility to sell less
efficient vehicles.

allocated roughly $72 million in state funding. The eligibility rules of this program expose
some households to thousands of dollars of subsidies for EV purchases, while withholding
those subsidies from others in a way that allows for a "treatment/control" comparison. This
allows us to compare what the distribution of vehicles purchased in locations in which the
EFMP induced people to adopt fuel-efficient electric vehicles relative to locations where con-
sumers were ineligible for the program.
   Every estimate of the pollution abatement benefits of EVs either implicitly or explicitly as-
sumes a displaced, or "counterfactual", vehicle. Some use stated preference data (e.g.Holland,
Mansur, Muller and Yates (2016)), while others may assume a particular model pair for com-
parison (e.g. Archsmith, Kendall and Rapson (2015)). We are aware of only one other working
paper that attempts to empirically estimate attributes of the vehicles displaced by EV adoption
(Xing, Leard and Li (2019)). Our paper is complementary to Xing et al. (2019) as ours relies on
a different source of variation, deploys a different empirical estimation strategy, and focuses
on a different sub-population (middle-income and low-income households).
   We compare the distribution of vehicle fuel economy purchased by households living in
EFMP-eligible zip codes and EFMP-ineligible zip codes and find evidence that: (1) the pro-
gram does increase the average fuel efficiency of the set of vehicles purchased in a zip code,
but that (2) subsidy participants would have purchased relatively fuel-efficient vehicles in the
absence of the program. These results suggest that, in the absence of the program, households
would have purchased vehicles with an average fuel economy of roughly 35 miles per gallon,
substantially higher than the average fuel economy of light-duty passenger vehicles purchased
in California over our sample period. This finding substantially moderates the potential air
emissions or fuel savings benefits of incentives relative to what might be calculated if the "ref-
erence" vehicle were, for example, assumed to have a fuel economy equal to the average new
car.
   This project contributes a datapoint on an important policy parameter to the literature, and
speaks to policy in several ways. First and foremost, this project provides empirical evidence
on the environmental benefits of an electric vehicle incentive program targeting low-income
and middle-income households. Although historical adoption of electric vehicles has been
heavily titled toward high-income households, visions of electrifying the transportation sector
require substantial adoption by low- and middle-income households. This paper provides
some of the first evidence as to the environmental benefits of encouraging adoption amongst
these households. Accurately quantifying these benefits is central to achieving California's



                                                3
       statewide climate change mitigation goals for 2030 and beyond. In addition, the demand side
       substitution away from conventional vehicles has important fiscal implications. Like many
       other states, gasoline consumption per capita in California has declined over the past decade.
       Absent recent state fuel tax increases, tax revenues and fuel consumption are comparable to
       levels a decade ago. A widespread transition to electric vehicles would accelerate a transition
       away from fuel taxes as a primary means of support for infrastructure investment.4 Our work
       directly speaks to whether EVs are more likely to displace relatively high (or low) fuel economy
       vehicles which contribute less (or more) to fiscal coffers on a per-mile basis, and to the speed
       at which the transition to alternative methods of financing infrastructure might need to occur.



       2    Data

       We obtained data, covering 2015 to 2017, from a third-party data source that aggregates in-
       formation about all vehicles purchased and registered within California. We observe total
       monthly vehicle purchases made by consumers (i.e., excluding fleet or government purchases)
       in each of California's roughly 8,000 census tracts at the make-model-model-year level (e.g.,
       2013 Toyota Camry). We match vehicles by make, model and model-year to fuel economy
       data from www.fueleconomy.gov5 and construct the distribution of fuel economy ratings for
       purchased vehicles for each census-tract-month during our study period.
           As expected, the distribution of fuel economy, plotted in Figure 1 is heavily skewed - the
       vast majority of vehicles purchased during our study period are those with combined fuel
       economy ratings between 20 and 30 miles per gallon. This is partially driven by the fact that
       our vehicle purchase data includes both new and used vehicles, and used vehicles tend to have
       lower fuel economy.
           Figure 2 plots the quarterly trend in both CA vehicle sales (in millions of units on the pri-
       mary axis) and mean fuel economy (in miles per gallon on the secondary axis). Although sales
       did not meaningfully change over the study period, average fuel economy rose modestly, as
   4 Davis and Sallee (forthcoming) document that electric vehicles have led to a $250 million decrease in gasoline tax

revenues, and go on to explore the optimal electric vehicle mileage tax.
   5 We string-match our transaction data to make and model makes from the EPA fuel economy rating database in

three steps. First, we match models names across the two datasets, conditional on fuel and engine type. For vehicles
that do not match, we then remove drive-train information from both datasets (e.g., AWD), again conditioning on fuel
and engine type. We hand-code the remaining matches. Where multiple trim lines exist, we assign the fuel economy
rating of the most popular trim line for the model. But, in a few instances, due to the coarse nature of the data on engine
type (e.g., both plug-in and conventional hybrids are classified as HEVs), there are a few instances where a single model
might offer versions with different engine technologies. We examine the robustness of our results to assumptions about
the fuel economy of these models in our appendix table and find little evidence that assumptions about this small
subset of vehicles meaningfully impacts our conclusions.

    consumer preferences shift towards higher fuel economy vehicles and new, more fuel efficiency
    engine technologies (e.g., battery-electric vehicles) grow in popularity.



    3       Program Details

    To examine fuel economy of the displaced vehicles, we leverage variation from the EFMP pi-
    lot. We have previously examined the impact of the pilot program on the adoption of electric
    vehicles in Muehlegger and Rapson (2018). We briefly summarize the important details of the
    program here.6 The EFMP offers incentives to low- and middle-income households to replace
    current vehicles with cleaner and more fuel efficient vehicles. During out study period, EFMP-
    eligibility was limited to two pilot regions: San Joaquin Valley and the South-Coast Air Quality
    Management District (i.e., roughly the Los Angeles metropolitan area). Within these locations,
    eligibility was limited to households with incomes < 400% of the federal poverty line with
    lower income households receiving more generous incentives. In addition, households within
    "disadvantaged communities" (DACs) as defined by the CalEPA EnviroScore, were eligible for
    more generous incentives.

    and the mean fuel economy of those vehicles (on the secondary axis, in miles per gallon).


   Figure 3 maps zip code boundaries for the Southern two-thirds of California. Regions in
grey are the San Joaquin Valley and South Coast AQMDs, the two AQMDs that piloted the
EFMP over our study period. The zip codes in pink are those that contain a disadvantaged
census tracts. Thus, means-tested households in zip codes that are both grey and pink would
be eligible for the subsidy. Outside of the grey and pink boundaries of the two participating
AQMDs and disadvantage zip codes, households would be ineligible.
   Although the EFMP offered large incentives (up to $9,500 for low income households living
in disadvantaged zip codes to purchase battery electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles), smaller
incentives were also offered if qualifying households purchased a "conventional" hybrid ve-
hicle. From publicly available data on program participation, we observe 2,474 participants
in the program. Table 1 reports the number and average fuel economy (in gallons per mile or
GPM-equivalent) of the battery-electric vehicles (BEV), a plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEV) and
hybrid vehicles (HEV) purchased through the program. Hybrid vehicles were the most popu-
lar category purchased by program participants - roughly 45% of participates choose a hybrid
vehicle. Roughly 38% chose a plug-in hybrid - the remainder chose battery electric vehicles.
The average fuel economy (in gallons per mile) of the different vehicles lines up as expected.

Hybrid vehicles are the "least" fuel efficient of the three (at 0.0269 GPM or roughly 37 miles
per gallon), although they are still substantially more fuel efficient than the average conven-
tional vehicle. Plug-in hybrids are slightly more fuel efficient at close to 40 miles per gallon
equivalent while battery electric vehicles are the most fuel efficient at over 100 miles per gallon
equivalent. For reference, we also report the average fuel economy of all 18.6 million vehicles
purchased by consumers in California between 2015 and 2017. All of the vehicles purchased
under the program are substantially more fuel efficient than the average vehicle, with a fuel
economy of roughly 22 miles per gallon.

   Average fuel economy by engine type mask substantial variation within group. We plot the
distribution of vehicle fuel economy for the three groups of vehicles in Figure 4. For ease of
interpretation, we group vehicles by their combined miles-per-gallon rating (or MPGe rating
for battery electric vehicles). While plug-in hybrid vehicles are more fuel efficient on average
than conventional hybrid vehicles, the fuel economy distributions of the two groups of vehicles
overlap substantially. In contrast, battery electric vehicles are substantially more fuel efficient
than all plug-in and conventional hybrid vehicles.
   Since EFMP program eligibility is set at the zip-code level, we aggregate our census tract-
level sales up to the zip-quarter level, and follow the rules of the EFMP program to deter-
mine whether households in a particular zip code are eligible for the most generous incentives.
Specifically, if a zip code: (a) contains partially or wholly a census tract classified as disadvan-
taged by the CalEPA EnviroScore 2.0, and (b) is located in either the San Joaquin Valley Aid
District or the South Coast Air Quality Management District, we classified the zip code as eligi-
ble for the EFMP Plus-Up program. According to program rules, zip codes that do not contain
a disadvantaged census tract or are outside of the pilot region are classified as not eligible for
the program.
   The gradual shift in fuel economy noted statewide in Figure 2 is present in both the EFMP-

eligible and ineligible zip codes. Figure 5 plots the annual distributions of vehicle fuel effi-
ciency (measured in gallons per mile or the equivalent thereof) for the "treated" locations (i.e.,


                                                   9
disadvantaged zip codes in the pilot regions) and "control" zip codes. The left panel of Fig-
ure 5 shows how the distribution of GPMs of the transacted vehicles has shifted downward
from 2014 to 2017 in the treated zip codes (DAC = 1, AQMD = 1). The right panel of Figure
5 shows the same thing but for untreated zip codes (DAC = 0 or AQMD = 0). This highlights
one advantage of our empirical approach. As average fuel economy is changing throughout
California over this period if we were to simply compare mean fuel economy in EFMP-eligible
zip codes before and after the introduction of the program, we might misattribute the gen-
eral trend towards more fuel efficient vehicles to the EFMP program. Rather, by comparing
similar locations inside and outside of the pilot regions, we can control for state-wide trends
in purchases and better isolate effect of the program as distinct from shifting preferences for
Californians.



4    Empirical Approach

Our empirical strategy is based on the implementation rules for the EFMP pilot program. To
be eligible for the most generous subsidies, applicants must live within DACs within the pi-
lot program regions. The eligibility rules allow us to compare locations that are similar with
respect to demographic characteristics, pre-program adoption patterns and their level of "dis-
advantage" as measured by the Cal EPA EnviroScore, but which differ in eligibility by whether
or not they are located within the two pilot air districts.
    We compare the average fuel economy of vehicles purchased in disadvantaged zip codes
inside and outside of the two participating AQMDs, before and after the start of the EFMP pilot
program. We regress the average fleet fuel economy in a zip-month on zt , the fraction of pur-
chases that receive an EFMP subsidy relative to all vehicle transactions in the zip-quarter. We
include zip-code fixed effects to control for time-invariant zip code preferences related to fuel
economy and region-time fixed effects to control for unobservable changes in the preferences
for fuel economy inside and outside the pilot regions.
    Formally, we estimate
                                   Yzt =  1 zt + tA + z +     zt                              (1)

where our dependent variable Yzt is the average fuel economy of vehicles purchased by house-
holds in zip z in month t. In the tables below we scale up zt from fractions to percentage
points, and interpret the coefficient  1 as changes in GPM by a one-percentage-point increase
in the share of transactions that received the EFMP plus-up subsidy.



                                                10
         Our primary parameter of interest is the fuel efficiency of the marginal vehicle replaced as
   a result of the incentive. From our estimate of the impact of the incentive on average fuel
   efficiency, we can back out an estimate of the fuel efficiency of the vehicle which would have
   been purchased, absent the incentive. To illustrate the intuition, suppose we observe two zip
   codes that are identical but for their EFMP eligibility status. If the average fuel efficiency in the
   EFMP-eligible zip code increases significantly when an electric vehicle is purchased through
   the program relative to the fuel efficiency in a zip code in which households are not eligible,
   it suggests that the electric vehicle is substantially different than the vehicle that would have
   been purchased absent the subsidy. In contrast, if the average fuel efficiency does not differ
   between the two locations when electric vehicles are purchased through the EFMP program, it
   suggests that the subsidized vehicle was similar in fuel efficiency to the vehicle that would have
   otherwise been purchased absent the subsidy. To estimate the fuel efficiency of the marginal
   replacement vehicle, we subtract our estimated coefficient from the average fuel efficiency of
   the vehicles chosen under the program.7 For each regression specification, we report the fuel
   economy rating (in MPG) of the marginal replacement vehicle in at the bottom of each result
   column.


   4.1       Alternative specifications

   Whether the empirical strategy above provides an accurate estimate of the impact of the EFMP
   program on the average fuel economy in a location depends on an assumption that that fuel
   economy in locations that avail themselves of the program would have followed a similar path
   absent the program to locations that either did not participate or were not eligible. Evidence
   in favor of this assumption can be found in parallel trends in fuel economy across treated and
   control zip codes before the introduction of the program. If treated and control locations dif-
   fered along some dimensions that affect trends in fuel economy, we might misattribute ex post
   differences in fuel economy to the program. Thus, we consider three additional specifications:
   (1) a "matched" specification, (2) a triple-differences specification, and (3) a within-zip code
   specification.
         In the "matched" specification, we use nearest-neighbor matching (Abadie and Imbens
   (2006)) to pair disadvantaged zip codes in participating AQMDs with "control" disadvan-
   taged zip codes in non-participating AQMDs, where we match zip codes by pre-period trends
   in GPM. Although all disadvantaged zip codes have somewhat different socio-demographics
7 We   derive this relationship in the appendix.



                                                    11
than non-disadvantaged zip codes, the eligible set of DACs might differ along dimensions that
are correlated with trends in fuel economy preferences. The "matched" specification places ad-
ditional weight on zip-code that have more similar trends in fuel economy in the pre-program
period.
    The "triple-differenced" specification includes as an additional set of controls the non-
DACs in the pilot and non-pilot regions. To the extent that fuel economy in pilot and non-pilot
regions were trending differentially over time, the additional set of non-DACs in and out of
the pilot regions allow us to control for those differences. Formally, the specification includes
a full-set of interaction fixed effects, tA , tD and z , capturing shocks common to the pilot
region, shocks common to DACs and time-invariant zip-level differences.


                               Yzt =  1 zt + tA + tD + z +       zt                            (2)


    Finally, we consider a "within-zip" specification that focuses only on the treated zip codes
and identifies the coefficients from quarter-by-quarter variation the number of people who
receive subsidies within each "treated" zip code. As above, we include zip code fixed effects,
the coefficient estimate identified from a comparison of a given zip code in a quarter in which
many people purchase a vehicle through the EFMP program to that same zip code in a quarter
in which few people receive a subsidy.



5    Results

We present our results in Table 2. Column (1) corresponds to our primary "difference-in-
differences" specification from equation (1). Columns (2) through (4) correspond to our al-
ternative "matched", "triple-differenced" and "within-zip code specifications. In panel A,
the explanatory variable of interest is the fraction of transactions (in percentage points) in a
zip*quarter purchased via an EFMP subsidy. Across all columns, we estimate negative coef-
ficients that are within a narrow range. These coefficients are consistent with the subsidized
vehicles being more fuel-efficient than the average vehicle purchased in a zip-quarter. Inter-
preting the coefficient in column (1), if 10 percent of vehicles in a zip-quarter receive an EFMP
subsidy, the mean fuel efficiency (measured in gallons per mile) decreases by -0.00055 gallons
pre mile. This is equivalent to increasing the average fuel economy of purchased vehicles (with
a mean fuel economy of roughly 23 percent) to an average of roughly 23.3 miles per gallon.
    The relatively modest increase is reflective of two features of the EFMP program. The first is


                                               12
that roughly 80 percent of the vehicles purchased under the EFMP program during this period
were plug-in or conventional hybrid vehicles. Although both are more fuel efficient than the
fleet average, they are significantly less fuel efficient than battery electric vehicles, which were
purchased much less frequently under the program.
      The second relates to what vehicle would have been purchased absent the incentive. By
combining our estimates in Panel A with information about the average fuel efficiency of ve-
hicles purchased under the EFMP program, we can obtain an estimate the fuel economy of
the counterfactual vehicles that would have been purchased absent the incentive. To be clear,
we don't observe this hypothetical purchase in our data; rather, we observe the purchases and
average fuel economy in locations that are similar to the EFMP-eligible zip codes (i.e., also clas-
sified as "disadvantaged" by CalEPA), but were not eligible for the EFMP incentive by virtue
of being located outside the pilot regions. Under the assumption that the similar, but ineligible
location is reflective of what might have happened absent the EFMP program, we can back-out
an estimate of the fuel economy of the vehicle that would have been purchased absent the sub-
sidy. We report the fuel economy of the "marginal replacement" vehicle at the bottom of panel
A.
      Absent the subsidy, our results suggest that individuals who purchased vehicles during
the study period would have tended to purchase relatively fuel efficient vehicles, with fuel
economy averaging roughly 35 miles per gallon as alternatives. This moderates the impact of
the EFMP program on environmental outcomes and fuel consumption, as it suggests program
participants would have purchased "gas-sippers" rather that "gas-guzzlers" in the absence of
the program.


5.1     Estimates by vehicle type

In this section we explore the possibility that the alternative vehicle that would have been cho-
sen absent the incentive might vary by type of EV purchase. That is, the (unobserved) coun-
terfactual vehicle may be different for households that purchase a BEV, households purchasing
a PHEV, and households purchasing a conventional HEV. We directly test this by estimating
separate coefficients for each engine type. Specifically, we estimate the average fuel efficiency
in a zip-month as a function of the share of transactions receiving EFMP plus up, by each en-
gine type (BEV, PHEV and HEV). As we did above, we then subtract the coefficients from the
average fuel efficiency of the each engine type to estimate the fuel efficiency of the replaced
vehicle.

           vehicles purchased in a zip*quarter.


          We present the estimates of the specification in 3. Unsurprisingly, we find that battery elec-
    tric vehicles purchased under the EFMP program have the largest impact on fleet fuel economy.
    This is consistent with Figure 4, which shows that BEVs are substantially more fuel-efficient
    than either plug-in or conventional hybrid vehicles. Despite these considerations, we do not
    find strong differences when we estimate the marginal vehicles that would have been pur-
    chased in the absence of the program.


    5.2      Implications for Emissions Abatement

    The true emissions abatement contribution of an EV purchase is a function of three main fac-
    tors: 1) the difference between the fuel economy of the EV and the car that otherwise would
    have been purchased, 2) the amount the car will be driven (vehicle-miles traveled, or VMT),
    and 3) the upstream emissions profile of the electricity generators that power a plug-in EV. In
    this section, we use our estimates of counterfactual vehicle fuel economy to calculate the im-
    plied CO2 abatement under two different electricity grid generation profiles. Throughout, we
    hold VMT constant at the California state average (14,453 miles per driver per year).8
          Roughly speaking, the marginal source of electricity generation in much of the US is an effi-

       and cleaner in others (California and regions with a substantial endowment of hydroelectric-
       ity). While several recent papers have estimated the marginal emissions profile of EVs (e.g.
       Holland, Mansur, Muller and Yates (2016) and Archsmith, Kendall and Rapson (2015)), here
       we acknowledge that the grid composition is changing and readers with interests across vary-
       ing jurisdictions may wish to apply different grid emissions profiles. We thus use two reference
       points: one in which EVs are charged by a natural gas plant (0.418 kg of CO2 per kWh9 ), and
       a second that uses 50 percent natural gas and 50 percent carbon-free electricity (0.209 kg of
       CO2 per kWh). These assumptions conform to actual policy and other contributions to the
       literature.10

one can see the inverse relationship between EV CO2 savings and fuel economy of the compar-
ison vehicle. Abatement relative to the (fuel-efficient) counterfactual vehicle that we estimate
in this paper is substantially lower than when the reference vehicle is less efficient, as would be
the case with a reference vehicle reflective of new (or new and used) vehicle purchases over the
same period. To the extent EV subsidies are intended to promote CO2 abatement, the policy
implications are profound. Suppose a policy-maker were to assume the reference vehicle is an
average new car purchased over our sample period. The true CO2 savings would be less than
one-sixth what may be expected if the grid is powered by natural gas. For cleaner grids, the
error would be smaller but still substantial ­ roughly 33 percent less emissions reductions than
anticipated when the grid emissions profile is halfway between natural gas and zero-carbon.



6    Conclusion

In this project we seek to understand what cars are displaced when California households
buy EVs. We implement multiple variants on a simple, quasi-experimental design that allows
us to estimate the distribution of fuel economy of cars that would have been purchased if
an EV had not. The eligibility rules of this program expose some households to thousands
of dollars of subsidies for EV purchases, while withholding those subsidies from others. We
exploit the pilot nature of the EFMP program to understand what cars are displaced when
California households purchase EVs. To do so, we compare the distribution of vehicle fuel
economy purchased by households living in EFMP-eligible zip codes and EFMP-ineligible zip
codes. Our results are remarkably robust to changes in specifications, with estimates of the
replaced vehicle fuel economy falling within a very narrow range.
    We find evidence that: (1) the program increases the average fuel efficiency of the set of



                                                16
vehicles purchased in a zip code, but (2) subsidy participants were most likely to purchase
relatively fuel efficient vehicles in the absence of the program. This second point moderates
the potential air emissions or fuel savings benefits of EV subsidies. If the "reference" vehicle
were assumed to have a fuel economy equal to the average new car purchased, a policy-maker
would dramatically overstate the true greenhouse gas savings. The extent of overstatement
depends on the composition of electricity generation sources powering the EV. If the EV is
charged by an efficient natural gas generator, the implied CO2 emissions savings would be
overstated by roughly six times; if the EV is charged by a 50/50 mix of natural gas and renew-
ables, CO2 savings would be overstated by fifty percent.

     A.1    Estimating the marginal replacement vehicles

     We report rough estimates of the fuel efficiency of the marginal replacement vehicle, using
     the potential outcome framework with never-takers (NT), compliers (C), and always-takers
     (AT). We consider this framework in the context of the intent-to-treat in with the difference-in-
     difference specification. Defining zi as the intent to treat indicator, and Di to be the treatment
     "take-up", i.e. the adoption of EVs. Given that the observation i is at the zip-year level, we
     interpret that within each observation, a fraction of it has Di = 1, and 0 for the rest. (Does this
     even make sense?) The fractions of populations within zip-quarter that fall into each of the
     treatment- and assignment blocks are shown as follows:

Table A.1: Potential treatment framework: Share of population within each treatment-assignment
(ITT) status

                                                 zi = 0          zi = 1
                                     Di = 0       + C
                                                 NT                NT
                                     Di = 1          AT           + C
                                                                 AT




         Our outcome of interest is the fuel efficiency measure (average-gallons per mile), which will
     be expressed as a function of Di .


                    E[Yi |zi = 1] =  NT E[Y (0)| NT ] +  C E[Y (1)|C ] +  AT E[Y (1)| AT ]           (3)



                    E[Yi |zi = 0] =  NT E[Y (0)| NT ] +  C E[Y (0)|C ] +  AT E[Y (1)| AT ]           (4)

         The ITT estimate should therefore give us


                         E[Yi |zi = 1] - E[Yi |zi = 0] =  C ( E[Y (1)|C ] - E[Y (0)|C ])             (5)

         In our specifications, we scale the treatment by the zip-year level realizations of iC . Given
     that the share of compliers are small and has minimal effect to the shares of always-takers and
     never-takers, and assuming that there are no heterogeneous treatment effects by the realized
     complier shares, zi is 0 if in the non-assigned zip-years and iC for assigned zip-years


                       Ei [Yi |zi = iC ] - Ei [Yi |zi = 0] = iC ( E[Y (1)|C ] - E[Y (0)|C ])         (6)

   So the coefficient on the share variable estimates ( E[Y (1)|C ] - E[Y (1)|C ]). To estimate the
replacement vehicle fuel efficiency, i.e. E[Y (0)|C ]), we subtract the replaced vehicles' average
fuel efficiency (E[Y (1)|C ]) from the coefficient of iC .


A.2    Endogeneity and Instrumental Variables

Given that the denominator of the main regressor zt is all vehicle transacted including ICEs
transacted in the zip-quarter, rather than EVs only, we believe that the endogeneity issue is
less of a concern. We still address this issue by constructing an instrument for the EFMP-share
(and an analogous instrument for average subsidies). We instrument for EFMP-share (over all
types of vehicles transacted) using the count of EFMP transactions in zip z at time t, normalized
by average total (including ICE) number of transactions in that zip in all quarters except the
current one, scaled by the ratio of sales in all other zips in AQMD*DAC in the current time
period relative to others.
   Formally, denoting the number of post-period quarters as T , the quarter in which the EFMP
program becomes active as t and average number of transactions in zip z in quarter t as Qzt =

i 1(zip = z,time = t), we construct the instrument for EFMP-share as follows, where Q is now
total transactions including ICEs:


                                    i 1(Subsidyizt > 0, zip = z, time = t)
                           IVzt =        r =t,rt Qzr
                                                                                                (7)
                                                         x =z Q xt
                                             T -1    rt  x =z Q xr / T -1

A.3    Robustness checks

Due to the level of aggregation of our data, we need to make several assumptions when map-
ping make-model-model-years to fuel economy ratings.
   In our data, we cannot definitively identify from our data whether BMW I3s, that are tech-
nically classified in our data as battery-electric vehicles, have "range-extender options" that
allow for a gasoline engine to recharge the battery. The range extender option provides func-
tionality very similar to a plug-in hybrid vehicle (with commensurately lower fuel economy).
   In addition, our data contains information on fuel type, (gasoline, diesel, hybrid, and elec-
tric), but does not offer distinctions between PHEVs and HEVs. This is an issue for the follow-
ing models (model years in parentheses):

   · Ford C-Max (2013-17)

   · Ford Fusion (2013-18)

   · Honda Accord (2014)

   · Hyndai Sonata (2016-17)

   · Toyota Prius (2012-15)

   We test the robustness of our analysis to each of these groups of vehicles for which we
cannot definitively assign fuel economy ratings. For the former (the BMW I3), we run specifi-
cations excluding the I3 from the fleet and find little impact on our results, consistent with the
modest market share of the vehicle. For the latter group of vehicles, for which we do not know
whether a given vehicle is a plug-in or conventional hybrid, we perform a bounding analysis,
first under the assumption that all of the vehicles have the most "optimistic" fuel economy rat-
ing (as if all the vehicles sold were PHEVs) and then under the most "pessimistic" assumptions
(that all the vehicles sold were conventional HEVs). We present our main specification under
all three assumptions below.

A.4    Geographical units

One challenge in constructing the dataset is that policy assignment into the EFMP is done at
the zip-code level, while the transaction data is at the Census tract level. In order to reconcile
the discrepancies in the geographical units, we construct a merged dataset in which the unit of
observation is zip-quarter. This is done by weighting the tract level observations by the share
of geographical overlap with a given zipcode. We show the cross tabulation of treatment status
at the tract level and that at the zipcode level. We see that there is one tract-zip overlap in which
the tract was treated but the zip was not. This is fixed in the analysis data.
