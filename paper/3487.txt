       Does monetary policy affect the teal economy? And if so, what is the

transmission mechanism through which these effects occur? These two questions

are among the most important and controversial in macroeconomics. This paper

presecta some new empirical evidence that bears on each.

      Our original motivation for undertaking the research reported here was

far more modest than is suggeated by the two queationa raised above; it was to

test a model of monetary policy transmission sketched in Ben S. Bernanke and

Alan S. Blinder (1988). There we developed an analogue to the simple IS-tM

model which embodied an unconventional (but rather old) view of the monetary

transmission mechanism; that central bank policy works by effecting bank

assets ("loans") as well as bank liabilities ("deposits").

      The microeconomic justification of this so-called credit view is the

observation that, under realistic conditions of asymmetric information, loans

from financial intermediaries are "special." Specifically, the expertise

acquired by banks in the process of evaluating and screening spplicsnts and in

monitoring loan performance enables them to extend credit to customers who

find it difficult or impossible to obtsin credit on the open market. As a

consequence, when the Federal Reserve reduces the volume of reserves, and

therefore of loans, spending by customers who depend on bank credit must fall,

and therefore so must aggregate demand.1 This provides an additional channel

of transmission for Federal Reserve policy to the real economy, over and above

the usual liquidity effects smsnating from the market for deposits.2

      Until now, the credit view has been perceived as unsuccessful

empirically. One apparently damaging piece of evidence is the finding that

bank deposits are better predictors of output changes in unrestricted vector

autoregressions than are bank assets (Stephen R. king (1986)). However, it is


                                       2
extremely risky to make structural inferences from unrestricced vector

autoregressions which, after all! are only reduced forms, If we want to

measure the true structural effects of a policy change, there are really only

two alternatives.

        First, we can specify and estimate a structural economic model. Thus

Bernanke (1956) used a "structural vector autoregression approach" to study

the relationships among money, credit, and income, and obtained a more

optimistic reading on the importance of credit, Unfortunately. inferences

drawn from structural models are typically sensitive to the choice of

specification and to the identifying assuitptiona. For example, Bernanke

imposed covariance restrictions to get identification.

        The second alternative is to try to       isolate   a direct measure of Federal

Reserve policy. Suppose, for example, that we could find a variable whose

innovations could be interpreted as "policy shocks. •          (The systematic portion
of   the variable could depend in any arbitrary fashion on lagged economic
variables.)    Suppose further that, perhaps because of information lags, these

measurable    policy shocks could reasonably be assumed to he independent of
contemporaneous economic disturbances. Then the reduced-form responses of the

economy to observed policy shocks would correctly measure the dynamic

structural    effects of a monetary policy change. This second strategy is the

one we follow in this paper.

        Specifically, think of the economy as being represented by the following

very general structural modeU

(I) Y   —
               + S1Y,1 +      CP ÷ C1P1   +
                                              u
(2) Pt —       ÷   IJYti   ÷ GP1 ÷
where Y is a vector of nonpolicy variables, P is a vector of policy variables,
and u and v are orthogonal disturbances. The system (l)-(2) is obviously not

identified. Two types          of identifying    assumptions are most obvious.

        The preceding discusaion suggests excluding Y from (2), which means

assuming there is no feedback from the economy to policy actions within the

period. If D0—O, we can convert this system into a standard vector

autoregression (VAR) by substituting (2) into (1) and solving for                to

obtain:

(3) Pt — DY51      + GP1   +
                               v.
(t)   Y—       (IB)'1   [(B1+ CoD)Yti +   (C0G   + C1)?1 +   u+
      C0v} -
In    this case, the effects of policy innovations on the nonpolicy variables can

be unanbiguously identified with the impulse response function of Y to past

changes in v in the unrestricted VAR consisting of (3) and (4), with P placed

fun in the ordering.

        An alternative identifying assumption is to suppose that contemporaneous

P does not enter equation (1), that is, that C5—O, so that policy actions

affect real variables only with a lag. In this case, the appropriate VAR has P

Jf in the ordering, via:
(3') t    — (IBy1 [B,; + C1P + ut).
          — (0 + D5(I-B5) 15,)Y + (C + DQ(I -Bo)Ci)Pi +

          +

Here v is still a policy innovation, but P is now also affected by

contemporaneous macro shocks, u1

        In this paper, we make some use of each of these two alternatives. In

either case, we entertain the idea that the Federal funds rate (or the spread

between the funds rate and some alternative open market rate) is an indicator


                                                 4
of Federal Resent policy--at least before october 1979        If so, the dynamic

response   of the economy to innovations in the funds race, or in the funds rate

spread, will measure the true structural responae to monetary policy. In

particular, we can "see" the   monetary   transmission mechanism unfold by

examining the responses of bank balance sheet variables, like deposita and

loans, and target variables, like unemployment and inflation, to a Federal

funds rate shock.

      Before doing this, however, we must defend the idea that the funds rate,

or the funds rate spread, is a measure of monetary polity. This we do in

three steps.

      First, if the funds rate is a measure of monetary policy and if monetary

policy affects the real economy--two conclusions that this paper

supports--then the funds rate should be a good reduced-form predictor of major

macroeconomic variables. We therefore begin in Section 1 by studying the

information content of the Federal funds rate, The results we obtain are

striking: The Federal funds rate is markedly superior to both monetary

aggregates and to most other interest rates as a forecaster of the economy.3

This is an important finding even to those who ste skeptical about the rest of

our analysis, because it challenges a recent argument of Christopher A. Sims

(1980), Robert B. Litterman and Laurence Weiss (1985), and other "real

business cycle" advocates that the predictive power of interest rates is due

to real, rather than monetary, factors. Why, if the real business cycle view

is correct, does the Federal funds rate predict real output better than other

open-market interest rates?

      Second, if the Federal funds rate measures monetary policy, as we claim,

then it should respond to the Federal Reseres's percption of the state of the


                                          5
economy. Our next step (Section II), therefore, is to estimate monetary

policy reaction functions explaining movenants in the funds rate or the funds

rate spread by lagged target variables, as in equation (2). As an

alternative, we also try a latent variable approach adapted from Robert B.

Avery (1979). In all cases, we obtain plausible results which suggest that

the Fed was purposefully manipulating the funda rate during the pre-1979

period- -an observation that is consistent with what the Fed claims to have

heen doing during that time.                                                  -




       Finally,   in Section III, we make the case that movements in the funds

rate are genuine policy changes, not simply endogenous responses of the

Federal funds market to changes in the economy. This boils down to showing

that the supply curve of nonborrowed reserves between FOLIO meetings is

extremely elastic at the target funds rate. Uaing both monthly and weekly

data, we find little effect of reserve demand shocks on the funda rate, which

supports the idea that the funds rate is mostly driven by policy decisions.

       Given all this evidence, we consider it reasonable to treat either the

funds rate or the funds rate spread as a measure of Federal Reserve policy

which, though not statistically exogenous, is at least predetermined within

the   month. We therefore interpret the estimated dynamic responses of the
economy to shocks to these alternative policy measures as reflecting the
structural   effect of monetery polity in the particular historical period under

study.4

       In doing this, we reach two   main conclusions. First, monetary policy
does seem to effect the real economy; a variety of meaeuree of real activity

respond to shocks to the Federal funds rate (Section 1).

       Second, there appears to be something to the idea that monetary
transmission works through bank loans as wall as through deposits (Section

IV). Loans seem to respond slowly to monetary polity innovations--which makes

economic sense because loans are contractual commitments, and whith also

explains why loans are not as useful as deposits in forecasting. But loans do

eventually respond substantially to a thange in the funds rate, with a timing

that coincides closely to the response of the unemployment rate. This

coincidence in time does not prove that loans tarry the impact of monetary

policy to the real economy; an alternative explanation, which we discuss in

Section IV, is that loan volume passively adjusts to economic activity.

Nonetheless, the timing seems to us to be strikingly consistent with the

credit view.



      I.   The Information Content of the Federal Funds Pat.
      Eoat   hoc ergo procter hoc fallacies notwithstanding,5 much of the
empirical case for the real effects of money has   been based on the observation

that movements in monetary aggregates precede movements in the real economy

Milton Friedman and Anna J. Schwartz (1963) were, of course, the first to

document this relationship extensively. Leonall Andersen and Jerry Jordan

(1968) showed that money was a better predictot of CNP than fiscal variables,

Sims (1972) demonstrated that money Grsnger-causes nominal CNP in a bivariate

system; and Lawrence J. Cbristiano and tars Ljungqvist (1988) have recently

produced parsllel findings for industrial production. If money is at least

partly exogenous, these results suggest that changes in nominal money can be

used to produce real effects.

      In the late 1970's, attention focused on whether it   was "anticipated" or

"unanticipated" money that leads output. Robert J. Barro (1977,1978) presented
empirical evidence for unanticipated money; Robert J. Gordon (1982) and

Frederic S. Mishkin (1982) made rebuttals. The distinction between

anticipated and unanticipated money was important for deciding whether

systematic monetary policy could affect output. However, this entire debate

presumed that the tendency of money to lead output implied some type of causal

relation,

      More recent empirical work has questioned precisely this supposition.

First Sims (1980) and then Litterman and Weiss (1985) found that interest

rates tend to abaorb the predictive power of money. Specifically-, a nominal

interest rate appears to dominate money as a forecaster of output when added

to a vector autoregression containing money, output, and prices. These

authors interpreted this finding as evidence against the effectiveness of

monetary policy, whether systematic or non-systematic. This interpretation

was disputed on empirical grounds by King (1982) and Bernenks (1986) and on

theoretical grounds by Bennett T. McGallum (1983). Nevertheleaa, the apparent

fact that money has far less predictive power for output than do interest

rates is an important challenge to the traditional "money leada income"

argument for monetary policy effectiveness,

      This section picks up and supporta a suggestion made by McGallun (1983),

who argued that the Sims result need not imply that monetary policy is

ineffective. Interest rates sight in fact, be better indicators of policy

actions than the monetary aggregates. If Mccallumt is right, it seems to us

that the Federe]. funds rate should be a better information variable than other

open-market interest rates because it is tied so closely to Federal Reserve

policy.6    This section shows that this is indeed the case.

      In reconsidering the question of predictive power, we take a more


                                       a
comprehensive view of the matter than previous literature has, In particular,

we consider nine different real variables one might want to forecast (listed

in Table I). three different interest rates, and two different meaures of

forecasting power. We also vary the details of the tests in many ways in order

to assess the robustness of the results,

      We begin with a battery of Granger-causality tests reported in Table 1.

Each row of the table represents an equation that forecasts some measure cf

real economic activit by six lags of itself, six lags of the log of the

Consumer Prite Index, six lags of the logs of both Ml and HZ. and six lags

each of three different interest rates-- the Federal fonda rate (FUNDS), the

three-month Treasury bill rate (BILL), and the ten-year Treasury bond rate

(BOND),9 Our focus, of course, is on the predictive power of money and

interest rates. Lags of the price level are included for comparability with

previous literature and because it is presumably      money and/or ngl

interest rates that affect real variables.10

      The table shows the marginal significance levels for the hypothesis that

all lags of either a monetary aggregate or a particular interest rate can be

excluded from the equation predicting a real variable. A small value thus

indicates that the column variable is important for predicting the row

variable. All data are seasonally adjusted. The sample period runs from

1959:7 to 1989:12.12

      Table 1 shows that, according to the Granger-causality triterion, the

Federal funds rare is far and away the best predictive variable among the five

considered. It is superior to Ml, M2, and the Treasury bill rate in predicting

every one of the nine macroeconomic variables; in fact, Ml has virtually no

predictive power at all. The funda rate is also superior to the bond rate in

for every variable except housing starts. No other monetary variable is

significant at this level more than twice,

      The preceding restalta are quite robust. While precise numbers vary as

the details of the equations are chsnged, the clear superiority of the Federal

funds rate aa a forecaster survives when we use non-seasonally-adjusted data;

when we first-difference the nonstacionary variables;13 when we use three,

four, or twelve lsgs in the forecasting equations rather than six; when we add

a time trend to the regressions; when we omit one of the Ms from the equation;

and when we vary the sample. Two examples of the latter are particularly

interesting.

      First, it is well known- -or. rather widely believed- -that the Federal

Reserve reduced its reliance on the Federal funds rate as an intermediate

target in October 1979. So it might be surmised that the predictive power of

the funds rate would be even stronger in a subsample that ends in September

1979. Table 2, which excludes data after September 1979 but is otherwise

identical to Table 1, shows that this conjecture is generally true. Despite

the smaller sample size, FUNDS performs better as a predictor (as measured by

F tests) in the pre-Volcker sample (compared to the full sample) in seven

cases and worse in only one. More important, however, it is once again

superior to NI, M2, snd BILL in forecasting all nine variables, and superior

 to BOND for eight variables.

instrument before 1966- -a period during which it was generally below the

discount rate.14 If so, the funds rate should be even more informative in

regressions which begin in January 1966. In fsct, however, when we ran such

regressions (not shown) the funds rate's forecasting ability (as measured by F

tests) generally declined compared to that in the full sample. But that may be

due to the smaller sample size. In the 1966-1989 sample, FUNDS remains

superior to both Ml and BILL in forecssting all nine variables and is superior

to BOND in eight of nine cases.

      So far we have been using Crsnger-csusality tests to assess "predictive

power." There is at least one serious drawback to this spproach which srises -

because the righthand variables era not orthogonal. A stylized example will

illustrate the potential problem. Suppose, say, that Ml was truly an exogenous

policy variable which moved the Treasury bill rate (BILL), which in turn moved

the real economy. Then Ml might be insignificant in a regression that includes

BILL even though it is the genuine driving force.

      This is one reason why Sims (1980) and Littermsn-Weiss (1985) focused on

a different measure of predictive power, one that is constructed from a VAR

with orthogonslized residuals: the percentage of the variance of the

forecasted variable attributable to alternative rihr-hand side variables at

different horizons. This metric also has its drawbacks, including dependence

on the ordering of the explanatory variables15, dependence on the horizon,

and low levels of statistical sgnificsnce (see David E. P.unkle (1985)). But,

rather then carry on a pointless debate over which measure is superior, let us

just say that each conveys somewhat different information.

      Fortunately, the choice of metric is not terribly important to our

conclusions, as Tables 3 and 4 show. These results are based on exactly the


                                      11
same data, samples, and specification as are Tables 1 and 2, except that the

variance decomposition exercise requirea that we eatizate complete vector

autoregressions, rather than single equations. Thus each row in the table

summarizes a complete VAR which includes six lags each of the variable to be

forecast, the price level, the two Ma, and the three interest rates. The

entries in the table are the percentage of variance of the row variable

attributable to each of the column variables at a 24-month horizon. Variables

were ordered in the way they appear in the table; thus we handicap FUNDS by

always placing it last among the five policy variables.

      The results here are slightly less dramatic than the Cranger-causality

results. But they still strongly support the view that the Federal funds rate

is an informative variable.                                               -




      Look first at Table 3, which pertains to the full 1959-1939 sample.

Despite its disadvantageous position, FUNDS still contributes more to the

twenty-four month variances of industrial production, capacity utilization,

employment, unemployment, and orders for durable goods than any other variable

except the the foretasted variable itself. If we compare FUNDS to the other

four monetary-policy variables, we aee that it outperforms M2 in every caae

(generally by very wide margina), and Ml and BOND in every case but one.

However, by this metric. FUNDS   has   more predictive power than BILL   for   only

six of the nine variables (versua eight in Table 1).

      Table 4 offers corresponding results restricted to the pre-Volcker

sample; it is thus directly comparable to Table 2. Tn thia shorter sample, the

Federal funds rate is the moat informative eingle variable for forecaating the

same five real variables as in Table 3. It outperforms both monetary

aggregates in every case, outperforms BILL in seven of nine caaea, and BOND in

six of nine cases. For some variables, the superiority of the funds rate over

other information variables is slim; but for industrial production, capacity

utilization, employment, and unemployment the percentages of variance at

twenty-four months explained by the funds rate are 28, 24, 38, and 34

respectively. No other monetary indicator records such high numbers anywhere

in the table.

     Reordering the variables to put the funds rate first among the policy

variables generally (but not always) increases its contribution in the

variance decompositions, as expected. But the increases are pronounced in

only a few cases.16 This suggests that, for most variables and most time

periods, the information contained in the funds rate is nearly orthogonal to

the information in the other forecasting variables.17 Adding a time trend,

changing the sample, and switching to non-sessonslly-adjusted dsts changes

these results relatively little and alters the basic message not at all.

Differencing the nonstationary variables does cause the predictive performance

of FUNDS to deteriorate substantially. But it remains superior to the other

four monetary variables in most cases.

     Our resulta so far suggest that much of the information content of

interest races is to be concentrated in one particular interest rate, the

Federal funds rate. This finding is important, since, if it holds up, it

suggests a need for macroeconomiats to turn their attention to shocks

emanating from the market for bank reserves. As we suggested earlier, it is

also consistent with McCallum's (1983) view that monetary policy may have real

effects which are transmitted directly through interest rates, rather than

through monetary aggregates.

      However, in the context of work on a new index of leading indicators,


                                         13
James H. Stock and Mark W. Watson (1989) have called attention to the

predictive power of two   different   interast-rare-based variables: the spread

between the six-month commercial paper rate and the six-month treasury bill

rare (henceforth, CPZILL) and the spread between the ten-year and one-year

Treasury bond rates (henceforth TERN, for term structure). CPBILL has been

found by Stock and Watson and other authors to be particularly informative)

How does the Federal funds rate compare with these alternative interest rate

variables as predictors of the real economy?

        Tables 5-7 provide the comparisons. For the full 1961-89 sample2°,

these tables show both Granger-causality test results and variance

decompositions for five monetary and interest rate variables; the Federal

funds tate (FUNDS); the two Stock-Watson variables (CPBII.L and TERN); and the

two monetary aggregates.21 In addition, we continued to include the price

level and lagged values of the dependent variable in every equation.

        Table S shows that CPBILI. is overwhelmingly the best information

variable by the Cranger-causality criterion, generally wiping out the

predictive power of FUNDS.22 But Table 6 shows that--even when placed last

in the ordering. - FUNDS ia more useful than CPBILL by the variance

decoaposition metric. When FUNDS is placed ahead of CPBILL in the ordering

(Table 7), it not only carries far more information than CPBILL for every

variable, it is actually rhe best single information variable in eight of the
                                -
nine cases.24

       How should we interpret these disparate results? Much depends on why

CPBILL is such an informative variable. A natural hypothesis is that CPBILL

is a good predictor because it captures the market's assessment of economy-wide

default risk, Barnanke (1990) argues against this view, however. He points

out that the default risk on prise commercial paper is virtually zero,25 and

that the correlation of CFBILL with conventional measures of default risk is

surprisingly low. Instead, Bernanke finds evidence for a hypothesis, examined

esther by Timothy Q. Cook (1981), that CPBILL tends to rise moat sharply

during Fed-induced "credit crunches," such as the episodes- of

dieintersediation that occurred during the late 1960s and the 197Da        Bernanke

concludes that CFBII.L predicts the future of the real economy largely because

it indicates the stance of monetary policy.26

          If this conclusion is   correct,   then the results we obtained when

comparing CFBILL and FUNDS are perfectly sensible. Suppose, for example, that

FUNDS is a measure of monetary policy and that monetary policy works largely

by inducing "credit crunches, • whose occurrences are sensitively recorded in

CPBILL. Then FUNDS should lose its marginal forecasting power in regressions

that contain CPBILL because the latter already captures the impact of monetary

policy. At the same time, however, FUNDS should remain informative in a

variance decomposition sense because it is the most direct indicator of

Federal Reserve policy.27 Superiority for CPBILL in a Cranger-causality

sense   and for FUNDS in a variance decomposition sense is precisely what we

find in the data. We thus see no conflict between our approach and the

Stock-Watson results.

         The finding that FUNDS is an excellent predictor is consistent with our

main thesis: that FUNDS measurós the stance of monecary policy. However,

fluctuations in the funds rate might be caused primarily by variations in the

demand for, rather than the suooly of, bank reserves. For example, unexpected

cash withdrawals will increase banks demands for reserves. In this case, the

information content of the funds rate would not imply any effectiveness of


                                         15
monetary policy; it would merely reflect the correlation of the funds rare

with surprises in bank deposits, which in turn carry information about future

developments in the economy.

       A conclusive demonstration that short-run movements in the Federal

funds tate are dominated by either demand-side or supply-side forces probably

cannot be made, given the difficulties of econometric identification in a

context in which certeinly expectations and perhaps even game-theoretic

considerations are pertinent. Nevertheless, in the next two sections, we

present evidence that is at least consistent with the view that short-run

variations in the Federal funds rate are mostly attributable to Federal

Reserve policy decisions, not to fluctuations in the demand for reserves,



             II. The Federal Reserve's Reaction Function



       If the Federal funds rate or some related variable is an indicator of

the Federal Reserve's policy stance, and if the Fed is purposeful and

reasonably consistent in its policy-making, than the funds rate should be

systematically related to important macroeconomic target variables like

unemployment and inflation. In this section we estimate policy reaction

functions in the form of equation (2) that show that this is true. We obtain

similar results with two very different methodologies, which bolsters our

confidence in the conclusion.

       First, we suat decide what variable to use to represent the tightness

or ease of monetary policy. The Federal funds rate itself is the most obvious

choice and, for most of our purposes, is quite adequate. So most of the

results in the next two sections use FUNDS as the measure of policy. However,


                                      16
FUNDS has one obvious drawback: a apecifio value of the funds rate might

represent "easy money" when general market interest rates are high (say,

because expected inflation is high) but tight money" when general market

interest rates are tow. For most of our work, this problem is unimportant

because we use innovations rather than levels of variables. But, for some

purpoaes, it is uaeful to have a concrete measure of the level of the policy

variable.

       Rohert 0. Laurent (1988, 1989) and others have suggested the spread

between the funds rate and a tong-term bond rate as a useful monetary

indttaror, on the grounds that the long rate incorporates the inflationary

expectations component of all interest rates but is relatively insensitive to

short-run variations in monetary tightness or ease. Indeed, the "tilt of the

term structure is a traditional monetary policy indicator that is much

discussed in the financial press. Thus, as an alternative to FUNDS, we also

consider as a monetary indicator the spread because the funds rate and the

ten-year bond rate, which we call FFBOND.28

       Figure 1 displays the behavior of both FUNDS        and   FFBOND from 1959

through 1989. Readers will immediately notice that the two series behave very

simIlarly; not surprisingly, it   is    the funds rate, not the bond rate, that

dominates movements in FFBOWD. Official MEEk      business cycle      peaks are

indicated by vertical lines in    the   figure. Notice that every cyclical peak

since 1959 was preceded by a sustained runup in FFBOND. Furthermore, only two

sustained increases in FFBOND were n        followed   by recessions. The first such

episode, which was long and gradual, ended with the 1966 credit crunch, which

was followed by a "growth recession". The second is the very recent runup

which, as of this writing (September 1990), has not led to a recession. These

graphs show in a very simple way, why the Federal funds rare has so much

predictive power.
         The graphs also call attention to the four episodes in this period

selected by Chrisrina Romer and David Romer (1989) as instances in which the

Fed deliberately turned ccntrattionary to fight inflation; these are marked by

the letter R. In three of the four cases, decisione hy the Fed to fight

inflation (as dated by the Romera) were followed by increases in the funds

rate and ihen by recession, The one exception is April 1974, when the funds

rate fell after the Fed decided to fight inflation (according to the Romers) -

This    sort of anecdotal evidence leads us to look for a systematic reaction

function with FFBDND (or some auch aeasure) on the left and inflation (and

perhaps other things) on the right.

         As our first way of estimating such a reaction function, we estimated

a series of three-variable VARa using six lags each of one of our measures of

monetary polity, the prime-age (25-54) male unemployment rate, and the log of

the    CPI. The sample period ends in September 1979, before the Volcker

dc-emphasis of interest rates in the implementation of monetary policy. There

is not much point in displaying detailed estimation results; we only note that

the hypotheses that either lagged unemployment or lagged inflation can be

omitted from the equations predicting FUNDS or FFBDND were always easily

rejected. The lagged state of the economy clearly has a great deal of

predictive power for any of the three funds-rate-based variables.

          Instead, Figures 2 end 3 display the implied impulse response functions

 of   FUNDS and FFSDND to shocks to unemployment and inflation. The results
 look   like plausible reaction functions. Inflation shocks drive up the funds

 rate (or the funds rate spread) -   with   the peak effect coming after 5-ID months

and then decaying very slowly. Unemployment shocks push the funds rate in the

opposite direction but with somewhat longer lags and smaller magnitudes.30

To our surprise, these relationships in the data did not break down in the

post-1979 period. Reaction functions estimated in the, sane way for the

1979-1989 period looked qualitatively similar.

      A latent variable measure of Fed ooljy

      A clever variation on the reaction function theme was explored by Avery

(1979), who argued that no single indicator tan fully measure the Feds policy

stance. He therefore proposed to measure monetary policy by means of a

multiple-indicator multiple-cause (MIMIC) model of polity determination.

Specifically, suppose there is some true but unobserved measure of monetary

policy, called y*. The latent variable y* is assumed to be a linear function

of a vector of causal variables X:

(5) y*_(.U
where y* is Txl (T is the sample length), X is Txk, u is a Txl error vector

independent of X. and k is the number of explanatory variables. Equation (5)

should be thought of as the true reaction function, so that X is lagged

unemployment, lagged inflation, etc.

      Although y* is not directly observed, assume we have m indicators of y*,

collectively called Z, 1 is a Txm vector which obeys:

(6) Z—yb' 4-v.
Think of 2 as alternative measures of monetary policy, such as various

interest rates or growth rates of financial aggregates. The error matrix, v,

is Txm and is independent of y*, but has an unrestricted covariance matrix.

     Even though y* is unobserved, the parameters of (5) and (6) and,

therefore, fitted values of y* can be estimated by maximum likelihood


                                       19
 techniques, under the assumption of joint normality (see Avery or R. N. Hauser

and A. S. Goldberger (1971)). Avery estimated a rather complicated version of

 this model using monthly data from 1955-1975, He used six indicators of

monetary policy, and his explanatory variables included various lags of the

merchandise trade balance and industrial production as well as unemployment

and inflation. Although he obtained reasonable results for his estimated

model, the overidentifying restrictions imposed by (5) and (6) were strongly

rejected,

      To obtain alternative estimates of the reaction of monetary policy to

the state of the economy, we estimated a simplified version of Avery's model

over the 1959-1979 sample. We used three indicatora of monetary policy (the

Z'a): the spread between the funds rate and the long-term bond rate (FFSOND),

the spread between the discount rate and the long-term bond rate (DRZOND), and

the annualized real growth rate of non-borrowed reserves, all meaaured in

percentage points.h1 The causal variables (the X's) were the same as in the

previously-estimeted reaction functions: six lags of prime-age male

unemployment and six lags of the CPI,°2 All variables were measured as

deviationa from means, so no constant term was included.

      The parameter estimates are identified only up to an arbitrary scaling

factor. As an convenient normalization, we set the coefficient on y* of FFBOND

in (6) equal to unity. With this metric, the reaction function" coefficients

of equation (5) are displayed in Table S. The absolute megnitudea are not

meaningful, but the pattern of response is. As can be seen, these patterns are

similar to those found in the VARs: Increased unemployment loosens policy and

increased inflation tightens it. However, the long lags implied by the

rate, nessured in decimals. The table reports the effects of U

statistic tests the overidentifying restrictions of the model.
application of the Avery technique may not allow sufficiently long lags.

Indeed, the chi-square statistic for the overidentifying restrictions of the

model rejects those restrictions, as was the case in Avery's results35

      Nonetheless, we pause to ask how closely FFBOND corresponds to our

estimates of the latent-variable measure of monetary polity, y*. To answer

this question, look at equation (6) and suppose that FFBOND is the first

element of the vector 2. If 21 is really the proper measure of policy, then

 t'   will   closely resemble 21. that is, the error term v1 will have small


eatimated variance, And the same holds for       and Z3. Hence the simple

correlations between the fitted values of y* and each 2 should indicate how


closely related to policy" (i.e., to }s        each observable variable is.


      These correlations, which are readily calculable from the estimates, are

0.80 for FFBOND,   0,64 for DRBOND, and 0.23 for nonborrowed reserve growth.

These numbers say that the two interest-rate indicators, and especially

FFBOND, were closely tied to monetary policy in the pre-Volcker period; but

real reserve growth was not,

      Once again, if this model is actually capturing the reaction function,

it should give very different results for the post-1979 period. When

estimated over the period October 1979 to January 1988, the model in fact gave

generally nonsensical results, including many incorrectly-signed coefficients.

       Overall, the results of this section lend support to the view that (1)

the Fed tried to "lean against the wind" during the pre-1979 period, and (2)

the Federal funds rate and related variables (especially, perhaps, the spread

between the funds race end the long-term bond rate) are good measures of the



                                        21
Fed's policy stance before 1979. The evidence that there was a major shift in

policy goals or strategy after 1979 is more mixed, but is, in any case, less

important for our purposes.



         iii. The Supply of and Demand for Bank Reserves



      The fact that reasonable reaction functions can be estimated when the

Federal funds rate or a related variable is used as a proxy for the stance of

monetary polity is evidence for the validity of these proxies. tn this

section, we consider a different sort of evidence implied by the behavior of

the Federal funds rate and funds rate spresda within the month.

      The thesis of this paper is that innovations in FUNDS help predict the

economy because they measure policy-induced shocks to the supply of reserves.

But the funds rate would not be a good measure of monetary actions, if, as we

noted earlier, its information content stemmed from shocks to reserve

demand- -arising fros changes in the economy- -rather than from shocks to

reserve suonly.

      For the funds rate to be a good measure of monetary policy actions, it

must he essentially unresponsive to changes in reserve demand within a given

month, as assumed in system (3)-(4). This amounts to saying that the Federal

Reserve supplies reserves completely elastically, or nearly so, at its target

funds rate. In this section, we present three different types of evidence in

support of the idea that the within-month supply of reserves was extremely

elastic at the target federal funds rate prior to October 1979,

      All three pieces of evidence are based on the same ides. We think of    the
Fed as setting a supply curve for nonhorros'ed reserves for the month or week.


                                       22
 If the supply curve is horizontal, as in Figure 4a, then any development

 within the period which affects the ffl4fl4 for bank reserves, but which could

 not have been contemporaneously known by che Fed, will nec affect the funds

 rate. On the other hand, the funds rate will be affected if the supply curve

 is not horizontal, as in Figure 4b. In econometric terms, innovations in

vaciables which drive the demand for bank reserves are fts.tni.nents for

consistent estimation of the slope of the supply curve of nonborcowed

reserves

      We implemented this idea first by using as instruments the innovations

in the nine matro variables whose predictability was discussed in Section I.

Six different five-variable WARs were run over the period 1959:8 to 1979:9.

Each used three of the nine macro variables37 nonborrowed reserves of

depository institutions, and either FUNDS     or   FFBOND as a measure of monetary

policy. Innovations from these VARs were then used to estimace the slope of

the supply curve. Specificaily, we regressed the innovation in the policy

measure on the innovation in nonborrowed reserves, using the innovations in

the three macro variables as instruments. If the innovations io the macro

variables contain information that the Fed did not have when it set policy for

the month, then the instrumental variables regression should provide an

estimate of the slope of   the   reserve supply function,39

     With two   alternative   measures of polity and three sets of instruments,

we have six estimates in all, Results are given in rows 1 through 3 of table

precisely. This is consistent with the idea that, prior to 1979, the Fed set

a target funds rate or funds rate spread and supplied reserves elasticaLly as

required.

        One problem with using the VAR innovations of the macro variables is

that our information sot is presumably smaller than that used by        the   Fed, so

policy-makers might have anticipated some of what we call "innovanions." In

that case, this information might have affected the Fed's decision, and the

identification of the supply curve would be lost,

        to avoid this problem, we used an instrument that certainly could not

have been known to the Fed. Specifically, Peter Rathjena (1989) has collected

a data set, which he kindly providod to us, consisting of preliminary

announoements and successive revisions of economic variables. From these data,

we constructed the difference between the preliminary announcement of personal

income for a given month      (issued   in the subsequent month) and the second

revised estimate of personal income for the given month (issued two months

later) -    The difference between the two announcements embodies information

that   was unavailable to the Fed during the given month, and thus should be a
valid   instrument.40
        We calculated innovations to the alternative polity indicators and
nonhorrowed reserves using bivariate VARa, then again regressed the innovation
in the policy measure on the innovation in nonborrowed reserves, this time
using   the difference in personal income announcements as an instrussent. flue to
data availability, this sample began in 1969. The results are shown in row 4
of Table 9.     This time the estimated slopes of the reserve supply curves are

negative    and approach   statistical signifioanoe. Again, this is inconsistent

with   the view that the Fed's supply curve of reserves was upward-sloping

                                            24
 within the month.

       Veekly data

       As a final wey to estimate the elasticity of reserve supply, we went to

weekly data. The idea was to try to exploit the lagged reserve accounting

 system in effect fron September 1968 to January 1984. which made banks' demand

for reserves completely inelastic within the week.

       As above, suppose that the Fed's supply curve of nonborrowod reserves

is extremely elastic at the target federal funds tate. In such a world, if

there is a shock to deposits, and hence to required reserves (BR), the funds

rste will respond very little while nonborrowred reserves (NBR) will move

virtually one-for-one with KR. (See Figure 4m.) Eapirically, innovations in FR

should be highly correlated with innovations in NER but virtually uncorrelated

with innovations in the funds rate.

      Conversely, if the supply curve of nonborrowed resserves were very

inelastic, as would be the case if the Fed were targeting NBR, then the funds

rate would take up most of the slack while NM would hardly respond. We would

find a strong correlation between innovations in KR and the funds rate, but a

weak correlation between innovations in KR and NM.

      What do we actually find in the data? to see, we rsn a VAR    on weekly
data for required reserves, nonborrowed reserves (both in logs), and the

Federal funds rate. Twelve weekly lsgs of each variable were used, end the

ssisple period was from January 1969 (corresponding to the beginning of lagged

reserve accounting) until the end of September 1979 (when operating procedures

changed). We interpret the innovations to this VAR   as   "shocks" to the

variables.

      As predicted by the theory for an interest-rate targeting regime, the


                                      25
correlation between shocks to required and nonborrowed reserves was fairly

high during this period (.60), while shocks to either required or nonborrowed

reserves were almost uncorrelated with innovations cc the Federal funds rate

(correlations were .14 and -.02, respectively). Estimating the elasticity oi

reserve supply by   regressing   funds race innovations on nonborrcwed reserve

innovations, using innovations to required reserves as an instrument, revealed

that a one percentage point shock to the annual growth of HER is associated

with less than a 0.1 basis point movement in the funds rste, with a

c-statistic of 3.2. This is, once again, consistent with the view that the Fed

was targeting the funds rate during the pre-Voloker period.

     cie repeated the above exercise for the three-year pericd beginning in

October 1979 to see if the estimated slope would be much larger under the

allegedly monetarist" operating procedures. The two periods             different   in

that the standard devistion of the funds rate is about twice as large and the

standard deviation of nonborrowed reserves innovations is only ebout half as

lsrge in 1979-1982 as in 1966-1979. So the policy change seems to have made a

difference. However, the correlation between innovations in ER and HER is

still .45. which is not drastically lower than in the earlier sample. And the

correlation between required reserve innovations and funds rate innovations

rises to .45, which is what would be expected under e nonborrowed reserve

targeting regime. Nonetheless, when we applied our instrumental variables

technique to estimate the slope of the supply curve, the estimate for the

1979-1982 period was 1.3 basis points, or about 13 times as     large   as in

1968.1979. This seems broadly consistent with both the previous finding and

what the Fed was seying.

             IV. The Transmission of Monetary Policy

         So far we have argued that the Federal funds rate, or parhapa the spread

 between the funds rate and some other interest rate, is a good indicator of

 monetary policy. By this, we mean that short-run fluctuations in the variable

 are dominated by shifts in the atance of polity, not by non-policy influences.

 Policy actions might well be influenced by past economir conditiona, But it

 is   important for our argument that the polity indicator not be sensitive to

current (that is, within-month) developments in the economy. We have offered

evidence that this is so.

        As discussed in the introduction, a variable that ia an indicator of

policy in this sense would be very useful, since it would allow us to trace

out the effects of policy without developing an explicit structural model. If

the funds rate measures policy intentions, and if these intentions are

predetermined, then the reduced-form responses of economic variables to

innovations in the funds rate should measure the effects of policy.

        In   this   section, we utilize this idea to study the dynamic   effects of
monetary     policy actions on bank balance sheets and on the economy in general.

Monthly data on the balance sheets of commercial banks are published by the

Federal Reserve. (See the data eppendix.) Our sample        begins in 1959:1, for
comparability       with the other results in this paper, and ends in 1978;l2, when

the Fed changed its definition and the format of its table. This end point,

however, is not a problem for u, since we want to restrict ourselves to the

pre-Volcker period anyway.41

       We estimated three different VARs, each including an indicator of

monetary policy based on the funds rate, the unemployment rate, the log of the

CPI, and the log levels of each of three bank balance sheet variables


                                            27
(deposits, securities, and loans) all deflated by the C?I.42 As usual six

lags of each variable were used, From each estimated VAR, we calculated the

implied impulse response functions (moving average representations) to a shock

to the monetary indicator. Under the assumption that innovations to the

indicators represent policy actions, the responses of the other five variahtes

will trace out the dynamic effects of such an action on the banking system and

the economy.

      The VAR   coefficients   themselves are not very interesting, and so are not

reported. Furtherzocre, since the shapes of    the   impulse response functions are

alnost identical regardleas of whether the funds rate or a funds rate spread

is used as a policy measure, we show only the results using the funds rate.

Figure 5 displays the responses to a one standard deviation (31 basis point)

shock to the funds rate over a horizon of 24 months.43

      Tight money (a positive innovation in FUNDS) does indeed reduce the

volume of deposits held by depository institutions, as we would expect. The

effect starts immediately, builds gradually, reaches its peak in shout nine

months, and appears to be permanent.44

      The other results bear in an interesting way on the money-versus-credit

controversy. Naturally, bank assets fall along with bank liabilities. But the

composition of the fall is noteworthy. For the first six months or so after

the policy shock, the fall in assets is concentrated almost entirely in

securities; loans hardly move, However, shortly thereafter securities

holdings begin gradually to be rebuilt while loans start to fall, By the time

two years have elapsed (the end of the graph), security holdings have almost

returned to their original value and essentially the entire decline in

deposits is reflected in loans.

       This pattern is just what we should expect. Loans arc

quasi-contractual commitments whose stock is difficult to change quickly.

ganks therefcre react to reduced deposits in the short run by selling off

securities. In the longer run, however, portfolios are re-balanced, with the

primary effect (according to these results) falling on loans. Similar results

have been obtained by Leonard I. &aksmura (l98).

      To relsre this pattern of portfolio adjustment to developments in the

real economy, Figure 5 also displays the impulse response function of the

uneaplcyment rate. Ac is apparenr, the effects on unemployment are

assenrially zero during the first two or three quarters after the shock to the

funds rate; but at about the nine month point unemployment begins to rise,

building gradually to a peak after about two years before declining back ro

zero (the decline is not shown in the graph)

      This timing of the unemploymenr response is inreresring, because it

corresponds fairly well to the estimated timing of the effect of the policy

shock cn loans. The fact that unemployment and bank loans move together

following a change in the funds rate is consistent with the view     chat   bank

loans are an   important   component of the monetary transmission mechanism, even

though loans do not lead real variables and are therefore nor useful in

forecasting exertises with 'TARs.

      There is, however, an alternative interpretation of our resulrs: that

monetary policy works entirely through the conventional money-demand

mechanism, while the observed behavior of loans reflects a purely passive

response to a falling demand for credit. One problem with this interpretation

is that there is no reason for bank portfolios to bear any systematic

relationship to either the stance of monetary policy or the level of real

 substitutes- -as they are under the traditional 'money only" view.    But we have
 shown here that the composition of bank portfolios does
                                                           respond systematically
 to monetary policy. Another related problem for the
                                                       "money only' view is that
 the composition of firma' borrowing also seems to be sensitive   to monetary
 policy with losns felling and other means of finance (like commercial
                                                                             paper)
 rising during periods of monetary stringency.45 If the decline in bank losns

 following a monetary tightening were simply a passive response to
                                                                      falling
 credit demand, we would expect to see 5jj forms of
                                                       corporate borrowing
 declining.



      V. Conclualon

      This paper draws three msin substantive conclusions.

      First, the funds rate (or a aeasure based on it) is a rather good

indicator of monetary policy, even for the period after 1979. The funds rate

is probably less contaminated by endogenous responses to contemporaneous

economic conditions than is, say, the money growth rate.

      Second, the stylized fact that nominal interest rates are good

forecasters of real variables should be refined to note that the Federal funds

rate is a psrticulay informative variable.46 In fact, the finding that the

Federal funds rate dominates both money and the bill and bond rates in

forecasting real variables seems more robust than the oft-cited finding of

Sims (1980) and Litterman and Weiss (1985) that the bill rate dominates
                                                                          money.
Whether or not one accepts the other arguments of this paper, this result

stands as a challenge to the real-business-cycle interpretation of the earlier

findings. It needs to be explained.'7


                                        30
         Finally, our results are consistent with the view that monetary policy

works in part by affecting the composition of bank assets. Tighter monetary

policy results in a short-run selloff of    banks   security holdings, with little

effett on loans. Over time, however, the brunt of tight money is felt on

loans,    as banks terminate old loans and refuse to make new ones. To the

extent that some borrowers are dependent on bank loans for credit, this

reduced supply of loans can depress the econony The fact that the timing of

the responses of loans and unemployment to monetary policy innovations are so

similar    is circumstantial evidence that this channel is operative, even though

loans do not Orenget-cause unemployment.

commenta,




1. The argument is sketched by Blinder and Stiglitz (1983).  Note that an
aasuaptton of imperfect substitutahility of loans for seourities in bank
portfolios is needed to ensure that a decline in reserves leads to a decline in
loans.

2. Another implication of the theory is that real economic activity will contract
if banks reduce the share of loans in their portfolios (for example, because they
fear bank runs). Bernanke (1983) argues that this may have deepened the Great
Depression.

3. As will be clear later, its chief competitor is a variable based on the
commercial paper rate suggested by Stock and Watson (1989).

4. As we are considering tha responses of the economy in a particular historical
episode, not contemplating the effects of a change in the policy rule, the Lucas
critique does not apply.

5, Tobin (1970).

6. The discount tate might be thought to be tied even more closely to policy.
But it often "follows the marketTM and, perhsps because of its political
sensitivity, it is often held fixed for long periods of time.

7. Litterman (1984) takes more or less the same view in a paper similar in spirit
to, but different in details from, this section.

8. The measures were chosen because the time series are available monthly and
because they are popular indicatora of economic conditions. We report results
for every measure of mggregste activity that was tried.             Except for the
unemployment and capacity utilization rates, all variables are measured in log
 levels.

 9. All interest rates used in this paper are measured as monthly averages of
 daily figures, expressed at annual rates.


                                           39
 10. Once many lags are used, there is little difference between putting the price
 level or the inflation rate in the equation.

 11. The table has no column for the lags of the dependent variable. Such a column
 would heve 0.0000 everywhere. The table also omits F-tests for dropping the CFI.
 That variable predicts real consumption at the 1 percent level end four other
 variables at the 10 percent level.

 12. Since money supply data start only in 1959:1, the first usable observation
 Ia 1939:7, given the need for six lags.

13. These ere: industrial production, employment, housing starts, personal
income, retail sales, consumer expenditures, new orders for durable goods, the
price level, Ml, and HZ. If we mechanically first-difference ygythine
 (including all three interest rates), neither FUNDS nor the other two interest
rates has much predictive power left. We do not view the latter as a very
sensible procedure, however.

14. This was suggested to us by a referee.

15. As we noted in the introduction, whether the policy variables come before or
after the macroeconomic variables depends on which identifying assumption is
made.

16. Most notably, putting FUNDS first (rather than last) increases it,
percentages of the variance explained from 12.7, 1.0, and 3.2 to 46.2, 40.4, and
45.3 for housing starts, retail sales, and consumer spending, respectively.

17. Putting the five policy variables before the price level and the lagged
dependent variable in the ordering, but keeping FUNDS last among the policy
variables, hardly changes its contributions.

18. Laurent (1988), using quarterly data, finds the funds rate superior to real
M2 growth in predicting real GNF growth. Oddly, however, he does not include
lagged CNP growth in his prediction equations and never uses M2 and the funds
rate together in the same equation.

19. See, in particular, Benjamin A. Friedman and Kenneth N. Kuttner (1989)
"Money, Income, and Prices after the 1980s, NBER Working Paper No. 2852,
February 1990.

20. Data on the six-month commercial paper rate are available only fros 1961.

21. Some might think this competition unfair since CPBILL and TERM are interest
rate soreads while FUNDS is an interest rate jgj. For this reason, we also ran
similar regressions replscing FUNDS by FFBOND, the difference between the Federal
funds rate and the 10-year bond rate. Results were not affected.

22. Similar results are obtained by Bernanke (1990), who pursues the comparison
of these variables in greater detail.



                                       40
23. FUNDS is the best single predictor for three variables; C?BILL for none.
FUNDS carries more predictive power than CEBILL in six of the nine cases.

24. The ordering underlying Tables 6 and 7 puts the monetary policy variables (as
a group) first1 followed by own lags and the CE'I. However, the results comparing
FUNDS to CPBILL change little if the monetary policy variables are placed last
instead.

25. According tO Moody's Investors Service (1989). the historical probability of
2-1 commercial paper defaulting within 270 days is O.004Z: there is only one such
instance of default.

26. Bernanke also argues that TERM, the other Stock-Watson variable, is also a
monetary policy indicator.
27. Note the parallel to our earlier discussion of the relative virtues of the
Crariger-causality and variance decomposition metrics.

28. We also tried the spread between the funds rate and the three-month Treasury
bill rate (FFEILL), which almost always gave results intermediate between FUNDS
and FFBOND.

29. The ordering is: policy variable, unetaployment rare, inflarion rate.

30. Note, however, that the graphs show the impulse responses to one-stand4d
deviation shotks. A one-standard-deviation inflation shock is a much bigger
number (215 basis points, at an annual rate) than a one.standard-deviation
unemployment shock (18 basis points).

31. The results changed little when we used the funds rate and the discount rate
(rather than the spreads) or used nominal rathar than real non-bcrrcwed reserves.

32. Avery's technique does not readily accommodate lagged values of the policy
variable.

33. Avery's method does not produce standard errors for individual coefficients.

34.. In fact, OLS regressions of the funds rate on six lags of unemployment and
inflation (excluding lags cf the funds rate) have highly serially correlated
residuals.

35. With a single latent variable, the overidentifying restrictions are just that
the responses of indicator variables to any given causal variable be in fixed
proportion.
36. This also requires that the lnatrumenrs not be affected by policy within the
month, In terms of equation (1), this mean that C0—0.

 37. We used only three variables, rather than all nine, to conserve on degrees
 of freedom. Given the use of six lags, these regressions have 30 righthand
 variables.


                                         41
38. Results using FFBILL were not much   different.
39. Although the innovations are estimated froa a first-stage VAR, the slope
estimates in the second stage are consistent, and the standard error estimates
provided by the instrumental variables procedure are asymptotically correct. This
is because the second-stage parameter estimates and the VAR parameters are
asymptotically independent (the information matrix is block diagonal), and the
WAlt residuals are consistent estimates of the true disturbances.

40. An alternative is the difference between the initial personal income
announcement end the final revision. However, the final revisions reflect such
things   as new benchmarks that do not represent new information about the
particular month. -
41.   The results were basically unchanged when we used an alternative
balance-sheet series which the Fed began publishing in 1973 and which is still
heing maintained. Again, see the data appendix.

42. In alternative regressions, we used the balance sheet variables in nominal
terms. This made little difference. Results were also similar when we differenced
the data instead of using levels.

43. The policy shocks themselves are transitory. They generally build for about
four montha and then die away rather quickly.

44. Although the diagram stops at 24 months, we ran all the impulse response
functions out to 48 months.

45. his point is documented end explored in research in progress by Anil ICashyap,
Jeremy Stein, and David Wilcox,
46. The other particularly informative variable is Stock and Watson's (1989)
spread between the commercial paper rate and the bill rate.
47. A simple explenation. of course, is that money policy is effective.
