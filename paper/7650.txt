                                           ABSTRACT

       I use micro data on food and recreation expenditures from 1888 to 1994 to provide the first
estimates of overall CPI bias prior to the 1970s and new estimates of bias since the 1970s and to
reassess long-run growth rates. I find that CPI bias was -0.1 percentage points per year between 1888
and 1919 and rose to 0.7 percentage points per year between 1919 and 1935. CPI bias was low in
the 1950s and 0.3 percentage points per year in the 1960s and then rose to 2.7 percentage points per
year between 1973 and 1982 before falling to 0.6 percentage points per year between 1983 and 1994.
Inadequately accounting for the introduction of new consumer goods probably was the biggest source
of bias between 1919 and 1935. Revised growth rates suggest that despite the Great Depression real
per capita personal income was not falling but was rising by 0.5 percentage points per year between
1919 and 1935 and that growth rates were not stagnant in the 1970s but were almost as high as in
the 1960s (4.0 and 3.2 in the 1960s and 1970s, respectively).

1 Introduction

Accurately measuring changes in the cost of living is central to calculating real growth rates; but,

there has been no work quantifying the extent of overall CPI bias prior to the 1970s. The 1961

Stigler Commission concluded that virtually all economists would agree that there was upward

bias in the various price indexes that they reviewed but the Commission presented no numerical

estimates of bias (National Bureau of Economic Research. Price Statistics Review Committee.

1961). The Boskin Commission (Boskin et al. 1998) argued that CPI bias is probably greater

now than it was in the past because the number of goods has grown, because a greater rate

of technological change is leading to more rapid price shifts, and because demand has shifted

towards services and quality, making the task of measurement much harder. However, studies of

CPI bias in specific goods or commodities suggest that bias may have been greater prior to the

1950s than afterwards. Nordhaus (1997) estimates that the largest changes in the quality adjusted

price of lighting between 1800 to 1992 occurred between 1860 and 1950. Raff and Trajtenberg’s

(1997) study implies that most of the real change in the quality adjusted price of autos between

1906 to 1982 occurred prior to 1940.

          This paper uses micro data on food and recreational expenditures from as far back as

1888 and Engel’s Law to provide the first estimates of overall annual bias in the Consumer Price

Index (CPI) prior to the 1970s as well as new estimates of bias since the 1970s. Engel’s Law states

that as income rises the budget share spent on such necessities as food falls and the share spent on

such luxuries as recreation rises. Controlling for changes in relative prices and in demographic

characteristics, trends in food and recreation budget shares should therefore mirror increases in

real income. Deviation in trend between food shares and income growth suggests that the CPI

does not adequately account for quality changes that increase the durability of foods, the late

introduction of new goods into the CPI, consumer substitution, and changes in the distribution

network. Deviation in trend between recreation shares and income growth additionally indicate

improvements in the standard of living arising from increases in leisure time.

           I begin the paper with a discussion of long-term trends in real per capita income and in

expenditure shares devoted to food and to recreation. The empirical methodology is outlined in

the next section. I then describe the data and present the results. Before concluding, I discuss the

implications of the findings for measured growth rates.



2 Trends

Trends in the share of expenditures devoted to food and to recreation from the National Income

and Product Accounts contraindicate trends in real per capita income and expenditures deflated

by the CPI in the 1920s, 1970s, and 1980s (see Figures 1 and 2).                   After growing at a rate of

2.7 percentage points per year between 1899 and 1919, real personal income per capita grew

only by 1.3 percentage points per year between 1919 and 1929 before declining during the Great

Depression. But, although in 1935 real income per capita was below its 1919 level, the expenditure

share of food fell from 34 to 26 percent between these years and the share of recreation increased

from 4 to 5 percent, implying that real incomes were higher. Trends in food and recreation shares

between 1973 and 1994 are comparable to those observed between 1950 and 1972 and suggest

that growth rates between 1973 and 1994 were as high as those between 1950 and 1972 (3.5

percentage points per year) even though measured growth rates were lower (1.4 percentage points

per year).1

           Inconsistency between trends in real income and trends in food and recreation shares

could arise from either CPI bias, changes in demographic characteristics, or declines in the


   1
    Between 1950 and 1972 the share of food at home fell from 15 to 11 percent and the share of recreation rose
from 6 to 7 percent. By 1994 the share of food at home stood at 7 percent and the share of recreation at 8 percent.

Note. Figures for 1929-1997 are from the National Income and Product Accounts and were obtained as a machine
readable file from the U.S. Department of Commerce. Expenditures on food and recreation prior to 1929 are from
Lebergott (1996: 148-153). Recreation includes entertainment and reading. Expenditures include not only those of
individuals but also those of non-profit institutions, private trust funds, and private health and welfare funds.

figures for personal expenditures are from Lebergott (1996: 148-153). The figures for personal income prior to 1929
used the growth rates in Series F 6-9 in U.S. Bureau of the Census (1975: 224). Personal income and expenditures
include not only those of individuals but also of non-profit institutions, private trust funds and private health and
welfare funds.

relative prices of food and of recreation. The relative price of food fell sharply during the Great

Depression and the relative price of recreation fell during the first quarter of the twentieth century.

In the next sections I therefore formally control for price changes and for changes in demographic

characteristics.



3 Empirical Methodology

I document trends in the standard of living by tracking trends in the share of food eaten at home,

total food, and recreation. The advantage of using food and recreation as indicator goods is

that because their income elasticities are substantially different from one, their budget shares

are sensitive to the mismeasurement of income. Food has the additional advantages of being

a non-durable and of arguably being strongly separable from other goods in consumers’ utility

functions, implying that CPI bias in such goods as cars will not affect food’s budget share through

any complementarities or substitutabilities (Hamilton 1998). The advantage of food at home

over total food as an indicator is that an equation in which the expenditure share on all food is

the dependent variable should include the relative price of restaurant meals on the right hand

side unless food at home and food eaten out are perfect substitutes. Because price indices for

restaurant meals will suffer from CPI bias, this will complicate estimates of bias. However, I use

total food as an indicator as well (omitting the relative price of restaurant meals in estimation)

because it is the only food indicator available in 1888-90.2 The advantage of recreation is that

because recreation requires time and because many of the complements to recreation such as

public parks and sports facilities are publically provided, estimated CPI bias will reflect changes

in hours of work and in public investments as well and therefore provide a broader measure of


   2
    Because the share of food eaten out was small in the 1910s and probably even smaller in the 1890s, this should
not materially affect the bias results for the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth.

changes in the standard of living.

          Hamilton (1998) shows how to use different years of cross-sectional micro data and

geographic and temporal varation in inflation rates of all goods and of the indicator good to

identify CPI bias. He begins with the basic demand structure,


           w   i;j;t   =   +    (ln PI ;j;t   , ln P       N ;j;t     )+           (ln Yi;j;t         , ln P   j;t   )+   X0  + u   i;j;t   (1)


where the subscripts refer to an individual household i, to region j, to time period t, to the indicator

good I, and the non-indicator good N; and where w is the share, P is the true but unobserved price,

X is a vector of individual household characteristics, and u is an error term. Because the true cost

of living is a weighted average of food and non-food and because all prices are measured with

error, Equation 1 can be written as


                            w   i;j;t   =   +             (ln(1 + ΠI ;j;t )                    , ln(1 + Π       I ;j;t   )) +


                                                           , ln(1 + Π )) + X0 +
                                                   (ln Yi;j;t                                    j;t




                                                   (ln(1 + E ) , ln(1 + E )) ,
                                                                       I ;t                              N;t              E   t   +

where Π is the cumulative percent increase in the CPI measured price and E is the year-t percent

measurement error in cumulative inflation. The empirical specification then becomes

                                                                                6

then, assuming that the relative bias between the indicator and non-indicator good is constant

across years and that the prices of the indicator good and the non-indicator good are equally

biased,


                                            ln(1 + E ) =
                                                                , :                                                  (5)
                                                        t




Cumulative percent CPI bias at time t is therefore


                                               1 , exp(
                                                            , ) :                                                    (6)


If the indicator good is less badly biased than the non-indicator good (as is arguably true for

food), then Equation 6 will understate the bias. If the indicator good is more badly biased, then

Equation 6 will overstate the bias.

           Hamilton (1998) also shows how to control for relative price changes when geographic

variation in the price of the indicator good is unavailable. Without geographic variation in the

price of the indicator good, Equation 3 becomes

              I can roughly estimate CPI bias without controlling for relative price changes in years

when consumer expenditure surveys are unavailable. First estimate the single cross-section in

year T,


                                                w    i   =      + ln Y       i   +       X0  + u i                                 (11)


where Y is inflation adjusted (with CPI bias) income. Then, predict inflation adjusted income for
          i



a household given the share of the indicator good from the NIPA numbers and given demographic

characteristics for year T and year T + 1 and obtain the percent increase. The difference between

the predicted increase and the actual increase will yield a rough measure of CPI bias.



4 Data

In 1888-90 the United States Department of Labor undertook the first nationwide consumer

expenditure survey. I use this survey, as well as those of 1917-19, 1935-36, 1960-61, 1972-




                                                                              8
73, and 1980-94.3 The post-war surveys cover a representative sample of the United States

population. As detailed in the Data Appendix, the pre-war surveys were more specialized. One

major difference is that the early surveys did not cover “slum or charity” families and those

before 1935 did not cover higher income families. These differences in population coverage

will not affect estimates of CPI bias, provided that there is enough overlap in income across

surveys, because identification comes from comparing food and recreation expenditure shares of

households with the same inflation adjusted income controlling for demographic characteristics.

           I impose several restrictions on the samples both to exclude suspect observations and

observations where food demand may be unusual and to obtain more comparable populations

across surveys. I restrict all surveys to urban families, to husband and wife families, to families in

the post-war period who were not receiving welfare or food stamps, to families where the husband

was age 21-64, and to families where the husband was in the labor force. I exclude observations

in which the share of expenditures devoted to food was less than 0.05 or greater than 0.8 and in

which the share of expenditures devoted to recreation was greater than 0.7. In the post-war period

I also exclude families containing adults over age 25 other than the husband and wife.

           I create regional price indexes for 4 census regions for all items, for food, and non-food

beginning in 1917 and for recreation and non-recreation beginning in 1960. These indexes can be

used to compare changes in the cost of living across census regions. The Data Appendix details

their construction. Inflation adjustment for the 1972-73 and 1960-61 surveys is for two different

years, for the 1935-36 survey for one year only (the survey predominately covers expenditures

in 1935), and for the 1917-19 survey on a monthly basis because of high war-time inflation and

    The surveys used in this paper are the Department of Labor’s Cost of Living of Industrial Workers in the United
States and Europe, 1888-1890; the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Cost of Living in the United States, 1917-1919; the
Department of Labor and Department of Agriculture’s Study of Consumer Purchases in the United States, 1935-
1936; the Department of Labor’s Consumer Expenditure Survey, 1960-61; the Survey of Consumer Expenditures,
1972-1973; and John Sabelhaus’ Consumer Expenditure Survey: Family Level Extracts, 1980:1–1995:1.

variation in starting months. The exact survey dates of individual households in the 1888-1890

study are not known, but this should not affect estimates of CPI bias because the price level was

fairly constant between these years.

            The dependent variables that I use in the estimation are the share of expenditures devoted

to food eaten at home, the share of expenditures devoted to all food, and the share of expenditures

devoted to recreation. Expenditures for food at home are not known in 1888-90. Recreation

includes entertainment and reading expenditures, but not expenditures on vacation lodging, food,

or travel. Beginning in 1972-1973 it also includes expenditures on such items as boats, aircraft,

and wheel goods.

            Control variables include real total expenditures, relative price changes, the share of food

eaten out (when the dependent variable is food eaten at home), demographic characteristics, time

dummies, and region dummies (3 for 4 census regions). I use total expenditures rather than income

because expenditures better reflect permanent income. The full set of time dummies consists of

dummies for 1888-90, 1917-19, 1935, 1960, 1961, 1972, 1973, and individual dummies for each

of the years 1980-1994. Demographic controls include the age of the husband, the age of the wife

(unknown in 1960-61), and a dummy variable equal to one if the husband is nonwhite (unknown

in 1888-90). With the exception of the 1960-61 survey I know the total number of children and

the total number of household members other than the husband and wife above age 18. In all

years except for 1960 I also know the number of children under age 2, the number of boys age

2-15, the number of girls age 2-15, the number of boys age 16-17, and the number of girls age

16-17. When I use the 1960-61 survey I therefore use a more limited set of demographic controls

and in all other years I use a fuller set of demographic controls.4


   4
     Using a more limited set of controls does not materially affect the bias estimates. I do not include the work
status of the wife as a control variable. Only 3 percent of wives in the early surveys worked. In the later surveys the
inclusion of wife’s work status leads to collinearity problems with the share of food eaten out and the year dummies.



                                                         10
           The final step in the construction of the data set requires merging two or more years

of consumer expenditure data. But, how many years of data can be pooled? There have been

tremendous changes over the course of the century in the types of food consumed (e.g. purchase

of a whole, feathered chicken instead of deskinned and deboned chicken breasts). The time

dummies will reflect these changes in functional form and I may therefore mismeasure the extent

of CPI bias. The rule that I follow in determining which consumer expenditure surveys can be

pooled is to pool if the inclusion of an additional survey does not change the CPI bias results.

This procedure suggests that I can legitimately pool the 1960 through 1994 data and the 1888

through 1935 data. This procedure also suggests that I cannot pool the 1935 data with later data.

I therefore use Hamilton’s (1998) methodology to ascertain the extent of CPI bias for 1888-1935

and 1960-1994, but not for 1935-1960. I estimate CPI bias for 1950-1960 by using the 1960-61

Engel curve and comparing actual and predicted income between 1950 and 1960.5



5 Results

I estimate CPI bias between 1888-1935 and 1960-94 using both the empirical specification

that allows for geographic variation in relative price changes (Equation 3) and the empirical

specification with no geographic variation (Equation 7). Because regional price indexes for all

items and for food are unavailable prior to 1917 and for recreation prior to 1952, I use the

specification without geographic price variation for the 1888-1917 data when the dependent

variable is either all food or recreation and for the 1917-1935 data when the dependent variable

is the recreation expenditure share. I use the specification with geographic price variation for

the 1917-1935 data and the 1960-1994 data when the dependent variable is the food expenditure


   5
     This procedure assumes that the functional form of the Engel curve did not change in the span of ten years and
that relative price movements were small.

share. I also use this specification for the 1972-1994 data when the dependent variable is the

recreation expenditure share, limiting myself to these years because the definition of recreation

in the 1960-61 survey was not comparable to later definitions. I use the 1960-61 Engel curve for

food to estimate CPI bias between 1950 and 1960.

           Selected regression coefficients and selected cumulative bias estimates are given in

Table 1 for 1888-1919, in Table 2 for 1917-35, and in Table 3 for 1960-94 for food, and in Table 4

for recreation. Engel curves for food in 1960-61 are given in Table 5. Two different specifications

are shown for recreation in 1972-94. In all years, the specification in which the expenditure

share of food at home is the dependent variable has the best fit and the specification in which the

dependent variable is recreation has the poorest fit. The control variables have the expected sign.

The greater the share of food eaten out, the lower the share of food eaten at home. The greater

the number of children in the household, the greater the food expenditure share. Older children

increase the share of expenditures devoted to food by more than children under age 2. Children

decrease the share of recreational expenditures, but in the 1917-1935 and the 1972-94 data the

number of boys in some age groups increase the share of recreational expenditures. Both food

and recreation expenditures are lower for non-whites (though neither significantly nor materially

for recreation in 1917-35).

           The regression results yield reasonable estimates of expenditure and price elasticities.

The estimated expenditure elasticities for food at home are 0.47 in 1960-94 and 0.62 in 1917-35.

Those for total food are 0.65 in 1960-94 and 0.68 in 1917-35 and in 1888-1917. The expenditure

elasticities for recreation are 1.37 in 1972-94, 1.41 in 1917-35, and 1.82 in 1888-1917.6 The price

elasticities for food eaten at home are -0.87 in 1960-94 and -0.85 in 1917-35. Those for all food


   6
     Expenditure elasticities were calculated as 1 + w . If is biased because total expenditures are measured with
error, then CPI bias will be measured with error as well. Using household income as an instrumental variable would
entail making assumptions about the relationship between permanent and transitory income. Hausman et al. (1995)
used future consumption and found that both the IV and OLS results accurately estimated the elasticities.

are -0.96 in 1960-94 and -0.87 in 1917-35. The price elasticity of recreation is -0.29 in 1960-94.7

The coefficient on the price of food relative to non-food is not precisely estimated in 1960-94.

Restricting the data to 1972-94 yields statistically significant and somewhat larger coefficients

on relative prices and these coefficients, together with the specification without geographic price

variation, can be used to obtain alternative estimates of CPI bias.

              Table 6 summarizes cumulative bias estimates and, where applicable, presents estimates

corrected for relative price changes. The estimate of CPI bias between 1950 and 1960 was

derived by using the NIPA shares and the 1960-61 Engel curve to obtain predicted household

total expenditures in both 1950 and 1960 and, controlling for demographic change, comparing

the trend in these predicted shares with the trend in actual household personal expenditures (from

the NIPA numbers). Because the price of food rose less than the price of non-food in this period,

this estimate will be a rough upper bound for CPI bias.

              CPI bias was minimal during the 1888-1919 period. Using the specification for food

yields bias estimates of -0.1 percentage points per year, even after correcting for relative price

changes using the estimate of                 =   :006 from the 1917-35 regression. Dropping from the
sample individuals who had income from gardens or animals and therefore may have had some

self-sufficiency in food yields an estimate of 0. Using recreation as an indicator good and not

adjusting for prices suggests that CPI bias was 0.3 percentage points. Adjusting for relative

price changes using the estimate of               =     :046 from the 1972-94 regression suggests that CPI bias
was 1.3 percentage points per year. However, differences in the total expenditure elasticity of

recreation between 1888-1919 and 1960-94 suggest definite changes in functional form, so it may

not be possible to use an estimate of              derived from modern data.

              The CPI was biased between 1917-1935. The specification that uses the share of food

Note. Standard errors in parentheses. No standard error is given for 1950-60 because this is only a rough
estimate. The price adjustment for 1888/90-1917/1919 used the value of = :006 from the 1917/19-1935/36
regression and assumed that movement in the relative CPI price of food mirrored that in the relative wholesale
price of food (Series E 40-51 in U.S. Bureau of the Census 1975: 200). Using a larger value of would yield
a larger, negative estimate of annual bias. Using the value of = :046 from the 1960-94 recreation equation
to adjust for declines in the relative price of recreation yields a cumulative bias estimate of 0.384 (ˆ =0.011)
for 1888/90-1917/1919 and one of 0.561 (ˆ =0.023) for 1917/1919-1935/36. The second specification that
used recreation as an indicator good contained a quadratic term in total expenditures. The cumulative bias
estimate is corrected for relative price changes using = :046. For a price index for recreation prior to 1935
see Owen (1970: 85).

at home as a dependent variable suggests that annual bias was 0.7 percentage points per year.

The specification that uses all food as an indicator good yields the smaller annual bias estimate

of 0.4 percentage points. Dropping from the sample individuals who had incomes from gardens

or animals yields annual estimates of CPI bias of 0.8 and 0.6 using food at home and total food,

respectively, as indicator goods. The specification that uses recreation as an indicator good yields

the larger estimate of 1.1 percentage points per year with no relative price adjustment. Correcting

for relative price changes using the estimate of              from the 1972-94 regression suggests that CPI

bias was an even larger 3.1 percentage points per year. Excluding from the sample households

who in 1917-19 lived in smaller cities and therefore may have had fewer opportunities for market

recreation does not change the results. Using the Engel curve specification that is quadratic in

total expenditures yields estimates of CPI bias (after correcting for relative price movements)

of 0.9, 0.7, and 3.3 percentage points using food at home, all food, and recreation as indicator

goods, respectively. Using recreation rather than food as an indicator good may lead to a bigger

estimate of CPI bias because recreation may be more badly biased than non-recreation or because

estimated CPI bias is additionally indicating improvements in household living standards arising

from increases in leisure time and in the public provision of recreation.

            CPI bias has fluctuated in the post-war period. Using food at home and food as an

indicator good suggests that CPI bias was at most 0.1 percentage points per year from 1950 to

1960. Using total food yields a larger estimate of bias.8 Bias was relatively low in the 1960s and

high thereafter. Using the share of food eaten at home as an indicator good suggests that CPI bias

was only 0.3 percentage points per year between 1960 and 1972; but, it was 2.7 percentage points


   8
     The bias estimate is 0.9 percentage points per year. Because the price of restaurant meals relative to food at
home is likely to vary by across cities, the Engel curve that uses at home and controls for the share of food eaten out
is the preferred specification. Results for recreation are not presented. The expenditure share of recreation in the
NIPA numbers was slightly lower in 1960 than in 1950, suggesting that we are overestimating income growth during
the 1950s.



                                                         20
per year between 1973 and 1982 and 0.6 percentage points per year between 1983 and 1994.

Overall bias between 1973 and 1994 was 1.6 percentage points per year. Using the specification

without geographic price variation and an estimate of 0.031 for             (derived from the 1972-94

data) implies that CPI bias was 0.5 percentage points between 1960-72 and 1.5 percentage points

between 1973 and 1994. Using all food as an indicator good yields a larger estimate of bias

between 1960 and 1994. When I use recreation as an indicator good and use the specification

given in Equation 3, I obtain a larger overall estimate of CPI bias between 1973 and 1994.

When I use the Engel curve specification that is quadratic in the logarithm of total expenditures

(Equation 9) and correct for relative price changes I obtain an estimate of bias of 1.4 percentage

points per year between 1973 and 1994.

          What explains the observed pattern of CPI bias? CPI bias may have been greater in the

1920s than from 1890 to 1919 because many new consumer goods were introduced in the 1920s

and these were only slowly introduced in the CPI. For example, radio sales were insignificant

in 1919 but rose eight fold between 1923 and 1929 and continued to rise even during the Great

Depression (Owen 1969: 88). The rise of electricity in the home led to the widespread diffusion

of such other appliances as refrigerators. The growth of car ownership allowed consumers to

move to cheaper suburban land and shop at a wider variety of stores, including chain stores. These

grew rapidly in the 1920s and became the standard instruments for mass retailing (Chandler 1977:

233). But, refrigerators were only introduced in the CPI in 1934, new autos in 1940, and used

autos in 1952. Other goods that became common in the 1920s but were only slowly introduced in

the CPI include light bulbs, washing machines, vacuum cleaners, and auto repair and supplies.9

          The Boskin Commission (Boskin et al. 1998) estimated that the biggest source of CPI

bias between 1975 and 1994 was in the late introduction of new goods into the CPI and quality

improvements in existing goods. The post-war pattern of higher bias in the 1970s than in the

1960s or 1980s may arise from the greater price volatility of the 1970s relative to the 1960s (Baily

1981) and from extensive improvements made to the CPI in the 1980s, including changing the

homeowner’s component from cost of purchase to value of rental services and quality adjustment

of used car prices (see Greenlees and Mason 1996 for a full list).



6 Implications

Estimates of CPI bias suggest that we are mismeasuring growth rates. Table 7 shows annual

growth rates in per capita personal income deflated by the CPI (“usual” growth rates). It also

shows “revised” annual growth rates that account for CPI bias (estimated using food at home as

an indicator good). Revised growth rates are very similar to usual growth rates between 1899

and 1919. They are more favorable than usual growth rates between 1919 and 1935. Instead of

a negative growth rate, we obtain the positive (though still small) growth rate of 0.5 percentage

points per year. Increases in the standard of living during the 1920s may have been so high

that even the income shock of the Great Depression was not enough to reduce per capita income

                                                      22
back to 1919 levels. Growth rates during the Great Depression could also have been better than

indicated by the usual income numbers. Even during the Great Depression the proportion of

families owning radios and refrigerators increased (Owen 1969: 89; Lebergott 1993: 113).

              Table 7 also shows that although growth rates in the 1970s were not as high as those

in the 1960s, they were substantial. Revised and usual growth rates are similar between 1950

and 1972, but then deviate sharply between 1973-1982. Instead of the low growth rate of 0.3

percentage points per year we obtain one of 3.3 percentage points per year. Revised growth rates

then fell to 2.4 percentage points per year during the 1980s and early 1990s.

              Estimates of CPI bias derived from using recreation as an indicator good suggest that

in the pre-war period we are underestimating the increase in living standards because we are

accounting for neither the rapid decrease in hours worked nor the increased public investment

in parks and recreational facilities. The average work week fell by 20 hours between 1890 and

1940 (Series D 765-778 and D 802-810 in U.S. Bureau of the Census 1975: 168-69). Because of

declines in family size and innovations in household technology the weekly hours of housewives

spent in meal preparation declined from 44 in 1900 to 22 at the end of the 1920s (Lebergott

1993: 51). From 1921 to 1930 the number of public golf courses and swimming pools tripled

and the number of public baseball diamonds more than doubled (Series H 849-861 in US Bureau

of the Census 1975: 398). The true growth in real per capita income, corrected for increases in

recreation, may have been from 3.1 to 5.5 percentage points per year between 1899 and 1919.

Between 1919 and 1935 true growth rates may have ranged from 0.9 to 3.0 percentage points per

year.10


  10
       The rationing of work hours during the Great Depression suggests that these estimates represent upper bounds.

7 Conclusion

This paper has used consumer expenditure surveys from 1888 to 1994 to provide the first estimates

of overall CPI bias prior to the 1970s and to reassess long-run growth rates in per capita income.

CPI bias was small between 1888 and 1919 and between 1950 and 1972, but was high in the

1920s, 1970s, and 1980s. CPI bias was -0.1 percentage points per year between 1888 and 1919

and rose to 0.7 percentage points per year between 1919 and 1935. CPI bias was low in the 1950s

and 0.3 percentage points per year in the 1960s and then rose to 2.7 percentage points per year

between 1973 and 1982 before falling to 0.6 percentage points per year between 1983 and 1994.

Overall bias between 1973 and 1994 was 1.6 percentage points per year, in the upper end of the

Boskin Commissions’ (Boskin et al. 1998) range of 0.8 to 1.6 percentage points per year and

similar to Nordhaus’ (1998) and Hamilton’s (1998) respective estimates of 1.5 and 1.6 percentage

points per year. The estimates are also consistent with Hamilton’s (1998) bias estimates of 2.5

percentage points per year between 1974 and 1980 and 0.9 percentage points per year between

1981 and 1991.

          Both the 1961 Stigler Commission (National Bureau of Economic Research. Price

Statistics Review Committee. 1961) and the 1998 Boskin Commission (Boskin et al. 1998)

concluded that the biggest defect in the CPI was its failure to account adequately for new

goods and improvements in existing goods. Quality adjusted price indices of specific goods

(e.g. Nordhaus 1997; Raff and Trajtenberg 1997) and the timing of the pre-war increase in

bias (coinciding with the consumer revolution of the 1920s) suggests that this is likely to be the

biggest source of bias in the 1920s as well. Factors that may help explain the post-war pattern of

increasing and then decreasing bias include the greater price volatility of the 1970s relative to the

1960s and improvements to the CPI throughout the 1980s.

          This paper’s findings suggest that we are underestimating real annual growth rates



                                                 24
between 1919 and 1935 and after 1972. Correcting for CPI bias (estimated using food at home

as an indicator) and recalculating growth rates suggests that despite the Great Depression real per

capita incomes were rising by 0.5 percentage points between 1919 and 1935 and that growth rates

were almost as high in the 1970s (3.2 percentage points per year) as in the 1960s (4.0 percentage

points per year). These revised rates undoubtedly underestimate increases in living standards

between 1919 and 1935 because they only account for CPI bias arising from the late introduction

of new goods into the CPI, the increased durability of existing goods, consumer substitution, and

changes in the distribution network. Additionally accounting for increases in leisure and in public

recreational expenditures in the first half of the twentieth century suggests that growth rates were

even higher.

          Many historians (e.g. Schlesinger 1957: 135; Dobson 1988: 248-49) have argued

that the prosperity of the 1920s was “flawed” because employers and investors were the primary

beneficiaries whereas workers received only partial compensation for increases in productivity.

Certainly the decrease in work hours and the concomittant increase in personal income would

suggest otherwise. But, even the more modest revisions to growth rates suggest that it may be

time to reassess not only the 1970s but also the 1920s.



Data Appendix

The Pre-War Consumer Expenditure Surveys

The pre-war consumer surveys are generally comparable with each other and with the post-war

surveys. All provided a thorough accounting of family sources of income and outlays of that

income and were extensively checked for completeness and consistency. All utilized roughly

similar interview techniques – multiple visits, strong encouragement to keep written records, and

the use of home surroundings to stimulate accurate recall of expenditure data. All used schedules

                                                25
that strongly resembled each other. And, trends in the budget shares of most broad categories of

goods in all of the surveys are consistent with the national income and product accounts. There

are, however, differences in population coverage.

          In 1888-90 the sample was limited to workers in nine protected industries (bar iron,

pig iron, steel, bituminous coal, iron ore, cotton textiles, woolens, and glass) and appears to have

been stratified by the proportions employed in each industry. Twenty-three states were covered,

none of them in the west. Sample families were selected from employer records and were limited

to families of two or more persons.

          Families from the 1917-1919 study were also selected from employer records and were

restricted to those where both spouses and one or more children were present, where salaried

workers did not earn more than $2,000 a year ($13,245 in 1982-84 dollars), where families had

resided in the same community for a year prior to the survey, where families did not take in

more than three boarders, where families were not classified as either slum or charity, and where

non-English speaking families had been in the United States five or more years. Ninety-nine

cities in 42 states were covered.

          The 1935-1936 Consumer Purchases Study was limited to native-born husband and

wife families in which families in metropolises and white families in large cities had a minimum

income of at least $500 ($3,650 in 1982-84 dollars) and families in other cities had one of at

least $250 ($1,825 in 1982-84 dollars). There was no upper income limit. The survey covered

the self-employed as well as wage and salary workers. The communities covered by the study

include 51 cities, 140 villages and 60 farm counties, representing 30 states. Both urban and farm

families were covered.

Price Indexes

The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) has been measuring changes in retail prices of goods and

services purchased by city wage earners and clerical workers since 1913. Indexes from 1800

through 1912 are estimated from price data from sources other than the BLS (see Series E 135-166

in U.S. Bureau of the Census 1975: 210-211).

           The BLS provides regional price indexes up to the present day for urban consumers for

all items and for food beginning in 1967 and for food at home, nonfood, and recreation beginning

in 1978.11 Price indexes for earlier years are given for selected cities only. I weight the price

indexes for cities on the basis of their populations to create regional price indexes. For 1917

through 1950 I use the cities and price indexes given in Handbook of Labor Statistics: 1950 to

create regional price indexes for all items and for all food. For 1950 through 1967 for all items

and for food, for 1953 through 1978 for food at home, and for 1960 through 1978 for recreation

I use the smaller sample of cities for which continuous price indexes are available.12 The food

index used in the estimation is based upon the price of all food. The results were not sensitive to

the use of a price index for food at home instead of all food.

     Price indexes for all items, for food, and non-food are available from the BLS web site. Price indexes for
recreation are available from various issues of CPI Detailed Report.
