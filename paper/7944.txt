         It is generally believed that markets avoid problems, such as tyranny of the majority, that

arise when allocation is accomplished through collective processes.1 However, theory that has

been well understood since at least the 1970s, as well as recent empirical work (Waldfogel,

1999), indicate that in the presence of supply side non-convexities, differentiated product

markets deliver only products desired by substantial constituencies.2 With fixed costs, the

number of product options will increase in the size of the market. If fixed costs are large, the set

of available products can be small or even empty. As a result, consumers are not completely

atomistic; each consumer’s welfare depends on the distribution of product-preferring types in her

market. When consumers share similar preferences, then additional consumers will bring forth

additional products – or improve the attributes or position of existing products – and the

consumers will thereby confer positive pecuniary “preference externalities” on each other.

However, if distinct groups of consumers have substantially different preferences, the groups can

fail to benefit – or can even hurt – each other through product markets.3 Although Friedman

(1962) argues that “widespread use of the market reduces the strain on the social fabric by

rendering conformity unnecessary,” markets are not immune to problems analogous to the

tyranny of the majority.

        The way that people help or hurt each other through product markets – how product

market preference externalities function – depends on the magnitude of fixed costs in relation to

market size. If all production took place at constant returns to scale so that production could

occur at arbitrarily small scale, then all types of consumers would get precisely what they wanted

from differentiated product markets. The arrival of new consumers of some type would not need

to alter the character of current products or make viable any new products for which existing

of market allocation over collective choice on the basis that markets avoid problems akin to tyranny of the majority.
           2
             See Dixit and Stiglitz (1977) and, especially, Spence (1976) for a discussion of the product selection
problem in differentiated product markets with fixed costs. Many ideas in this paper are an extension of Hotelling
(1929).

  Preference externalities are negative when an increase in one population shifts away from regions of product space
preferred by another group. See below.

consumers had held unfulfilled desire. With constant returns, consumers would have no effect

on each other, either positive or negative. On the other hand, if fixed costs are large enough to

allow only one product in the market, adding consumers with different preferences will

encourage repositioning of the product to better suit the preferences of the changed population.

Suppose that an individual’s tendency to purchase decreases in the distance between the product

and her ideal, for example because there is an “outside” option. If no additional products are

introduced when the population shifts, then some of the original consumers will be made worse

off by new consumers and will become less likely themselves to purchase the product.

        The present study documents the importance of these supply side non-convexities by

asking “who benefits whom” in US daily newspaper markets. In particular, we ask how the

tendencies for blacks and whites to purchase newspapers vary across markets with the numbers

of whites and blacks in the markets.4 The newspaper market is both well-suited for studying

preference externalities and interesting in its own right. Fixed costs in daily newspaper

production are large, and markets typically support few participants. Most MSA's support only

one or two newspapers, and only about one third of the population buys a daily paper. The

newspaper market therefore has both limited product choice and widespread exercise of outside

options: existing products are far enough from many households’ ideal that many segments do

not purchase. This suggests that differences in daily newspaper positioning will have

distributional impacts on readership tendencies across groups, making some groups better off

and others worse off. Newspapers also merit study as a medium that plays an important role in

political discourse.



4
  We could, in principle, classify people many different ways to examine who benefits whom. Documenting
patterns of preference externalities among groups requires identifiable groups with different product preferences
whose absolute and relative population sizes vary across markets and, for our study, across zip codes within markets
as well. As we detail below, these conditions are all satisfied for blacks and non-blacks whom we succinctly, if
inaccurately, term “whites.”


                                                             2
        This study is closely related to Waldfogel (1999), which documents that consumers’

welfare, in their capacity as radio listeners, depends on the distribution of consumer types – with

similar and different preferences – in the market.5 White listener welfare increases in the number

of whites and is invariant with the number of blacks; and vice versa. Hispanic and non-Hispanic

consumers bear a similar relationship to each other through radio broadcast markets. The

preference externality mechanism is different in radio and newspaper markets. The top 250

markets have an average of roughly 20 radio stations, in contrast to an average of less than 3

daily newspapers published per MSA in our 269 markets. Further, the top 250 markets each

have an average of 1.9 black-targeted and 1.1 Hispanic-targeted radio stations, and 61 (26)

percent have at least one station targeting blacks (Hispanics). The question facing blacks as

radio listeners is largely, “how many programming options will target me?” An increase in the

number of blacks will increase black welfare by raising the number of black-targeted stations.

This increase will hurt other listeners only if it alters the position of, say, white-targeted options

that are relatively close substitutes for black stations. It will presumably have no effect on the

welfare of listeners to unrelated programming formats (e.g. classical music). In contrast, there

are virtually no specifically black-targeted daily newspapers.6 The question facing blacks as

potential newspaper buyers is, instead, “how close are the (few) mainstream-targeted dailies to

my preferences?” In the not-uncommon circumstance of a single-daily-paper market, if the

paper’s positioning is responsive to the distribution of customer types, then this distribution can

affect all potential customers, not only those with preferences similar to blacks. Hence, if blacks

and whites have sharply different tastes in newspapers – and we will show that they do – one

 Chicago has the Defender and New York has the Daily Challenge, but neither has more than a 2% percent share of

might expect stronger negative across-group preference externalities in this context than in radio

broadcasting.

       Using zipcode-level newspaper circulation data on over 10,000 zip codes in 269

newspaper markets (MSA’s), as well as both zipcode and MSA-level data on demographic

composition, we examine how each group’s tendency to purchase newspapers varies with the

distribution of persons by type in the local market. Based on purchasing tendencies by different

groups in markets with multiple papers, we can infer that blacks and whites have substantially

different preferences in newspapers. Consistent with this, we find strong evidence of positive

preference externalities within groups and striking evidence of negative preference externalities

across groups. The tendency for blacks to purchase a daily paper increases with the number of

blacks in the market but decreases with the number of whites. The tendency for whites to

purchase a newspaper increases in the number of whites and is unaffected by the number of

blacks. Using data on the distribution of reporters across beats at papers in our sample, we

document the product positioning mechanism underlying our results: a) whites and blacks prefer

differently positioned products, and b) product position is sensitive to the fraction of blacks in

the population.

       The paper proceeds in seven parts. Section 1 reviews the literatures relevant to the

present study and presents both theoretical background and illustrative examples showing how

groups can affect each others’ welfare through product markets, or how preference externalities

operate. Section 2 describes the data used in the study and section 3 examines basic evidence of

preference externalities. Section 4 documents that newspaper preferences differ across groups.

Section 5 describes our empirical strategy and presents results on who benefits whom in daily

newspaper markets. Section 6 documents the product positioning mechanism underlying the

results. A brief conclusion follows.

1. Relevant Literature

         This paper builds on three separate bodies of research. First, there are theoretical studies

of differentiated product markets and monopolistic competition, which tend to show that markets

characterized by fixed costs and limited mechanisms for price discrimination are prone to deliver

sub-optimal product variety (see, for example, Hotelling, 1929; Spence, 1976, 1977a; and Dixit

and Stiglitz, 1977). A theoretically straightforward positive implication of this work is that

available product variety depends on the size of the market in relation to fixed costs and the mix

of consumer tastes. Waldfogel (1999) documents who benefits whom, among blacks, Hispanics,

and whites, in their capacity as radio listeners.7

         Second, this paper builds on a small literature on race and media markets, including

Spitzer (1991), Dubin and Spitzer (1993), Karamanis and Wildman (1997), and Siegelman and

Waldfogel (1998). A related literature in political science and sociology considers the effect of

industry concentration on the production of content and editorial diversity. 8

         Third, this study contributes to a substantial body of research on the industrial

organization and regulation of media markets. In broadcast media, Spence (1977b), Berry and

Waldfogel (1999b, 1999c) and Anderson and Coate (1999) examine the operation of markets in

which programming produces viewers to be “sold” to advertisers. A related literature in

newspapers (see Reddaway, 1963; and Rosse, 1967, 1970) emphasizes the importance of fixed

costs in advertising, circulation and content production and the resulting formation of highly

concentrated markets with few product options. A second branch of the literature examines


7
 Rogers and Woodbury (1996) and Berry and Waldfogel (1999a) document the relationship of market size to the
number of available varieties, which indicates the importance of fixed costs in determining variety in radio markets.

line of research uses newspaper firms as an avenue for the study of technology adoption and

diffusion (Dertouzos and Quinn,1985; and Genesove, 1999).



2. Theoretical Background

        In the standard competitive model production takes place at constant returns to scale, so

that even if preferences differ across consumer types, the welfare of each consumer is

independent of the distribution of types. Because all products can, by assumption, be provided at

arbitrarily small scale, consumer welfare is independent of market size.

        The presence of supply-side non-convexities introduces a possible dependence of

consumer welfare on the size of the market and, for differentiated products, on the distribution of

product preferences across consumers. With fixed costs, a product is viable only if demand

exceeds some threshold. If preferences for features of differentiated products differ across

consumers, then the welfare of a potential consumer depends not only on the size of the market

generally but also on the number of consumers preferring similar varieties of the differentiated

product. A consumer’s welfare increases in the number of persons with similar preferences and

can be either unaffected, or reduced, by the number consumers with different preferences in the

market.

        Depending on the size of fixed costs relative to the size of the market, the mechanism

underlying preference externalities can be entry or product positioning. Which mechanism

predominates depends on the market. The contrast between the radio broadcasting and

newspaper industries is instructive. The radio broadcasting industry, examined in Waldfogel

9
  The industrial organization of the newspaper industry has been extensively studied. From a theoretical
perspective, Chaudhri (1998); and Blair and Romano (1993) examine the pricing decisions of a newspaper
monopolist earning revenues from circulation and advertising. Both find that features of the newspaper market can
lead to lower consumer prices with monopoly ownership. Empirically, Bucklin, Caves and Lo (1989); Dertouzos
and Trautman (1990); and Thompson (1989) all produce evidence that concentration may in some cases benefit
consumers.
                                                            6
(1999), supports an average of 24.5 stations per market across the top 246 markets. The number

and mix of radio stations (products) in the market determines listener welfare, and station entry

provides the mechanism for consumers to affect each other. A classical music station is

launched only when the number of potential listeners crosses some minimum threshold. The

addition of classical music lovers to a market thus raises the welfare of other classical music

lovers. If classical listeners are drawn from another programming format (say, jazz), then the

arrival of the classical music lovers can make jazz-or-nothing listeners worse off by causing

withdrawal of the jazz station.

         If fixed costs are purely exogenous, then consumers help or hurt each other through an

integer effect, as products either launch or exit. If fixed costs include an endogenous component,

for example if product quality increases in the size of the market, then consumers can help or

hurt each other through effects on product quality as well as simple product availability.10 The

daily newspaper example illustrates this clearly. The small number of daily newspaper products

per market, even in large markets, indicates that for daily newspapers, product quality and

positioning are more significant mechanisms, relative to product entry, in determining how

consumers affect each other. The Fargo metro area, for example, has a population of about

150,000 and one daily paper. If fixed costs were entirely exogenous and inputs were priced in a

national market, then the Chicago metro area, population 8 million, would support 53 papers.

Instead, it has about 5.11 Daily newspaper quality is vastly different between the two markets:

the Fargo paper averages 28 pages per issue and employs 20 reporters and editors, while the


10

11
  The Chicago Tribune and the Chicago Sun-Times have circulations of 650,000 and 500,000, respectively. An
additional 24 papers published in the MSA have combined circulation of about 800,000. A useful measure of the
number of available products that adjusts for the asymmetry across products is the number of paper equivalents,
which is calculated as the inverse of the squared sum of the market share for each paper:

circulation-weighted averages for Chicago dailies are 50 pages and 150 reporters and editors.

Endogenous fixed costs are clearly very important in this industry; how they operate is beyond

the scope of this paper. What matters for the present study is that, for whatever reason, daily

newspaper markets support few products. As a result, daily newspaper consumers affect each

other largely through publishers’ product positioning and quality choices rather than through

product proliferation.

       It is useful to consider how product market preference externalities might operate given

the composite-nature of daily newspapers. Each daily newspaper contains a bundle of articles on

topics organized into sections such as national news, local news, sports, international news,

weather, style, etc. Consider a reader only interested in news whose local paper is already

adequate for her interests. Suppose that a large group of sports-lovers moves to town, and the

paper increases the size of the sports section to appeal to these readers. Except that the paper is a

little heavier, the news-lover is no worse off, and she will presumably not stop buying. In this

scenario sports-lovers benefit each other but do not hurt news-lovers. How, then, might sports-

lovers hurt news-lovers? First, instead of just adding new content, the newspaper might shift

some coverage from news to sports. Second, the sports-lovers might prefer a punchier prose

style throughout the paper, while news-lovers prefer staid prose. With the arrival of the sports-

lovers, the entire paper may shift its style toward punchy prose, also making the sports-lovers

better off and the news-lovers worse off even if the total amount of news coverage remains

constant.

       One might characterize a newspaper product in two dimensions, position (as along the

news-sports or punchy-to-staid spectra above) and depth, meaning, for example, the number of

article topics covered within each section or, more simply, the number of pages. If depth were

the only product dimension there would be no negative preference externalities. Simple

experience suggests, however, that dailies have position as well as depth dimensions. It seems

                                                     8
clear that no number of New York Post articles constitutes a close substitute for New York Times,

at least in the eyes of Times readers. Likewise for the Boston Herald and the Boston Globe, or

the Philadelphia Daily News and the Philadelphia Inquirer. Position is important and, as a

result, we expect some scope for negative preference externalities in daily newspaper markets,

especially where there are few dailies available.

          It is also important to note that, in principle, prices can affect the operation of preference

externalities if different groups have different willingness to pay for daily newspapers. In

practice this does not appear to be important in the newspaper market, for two reasons. First,

prices do not vary much across papers: three quarters of general interest newspapers cost $0.50

per day, with little variation across markets. Second, roughly 80 percent of daily newspaper

revenue is derived from advertisers, as opposed to readers.12 Given the de facto reliance on

advertising revenue, it is reasonable to expect product selection in daily newspaper markets to be

driven by audience sizes and by ability to pay only inasmuch as different audiences have

different value to advertisers. Our models in the sections that follow therefore do not include

prices.



3. Illustrative Example

          It helps fix ideas to introduce an example illustrating how product positioning and quality

– and the resultant utility of various consumer types – vary with the distribution of consumer

types in the market. Suppose that a product is characterized by two parameters, position, p,

along some one-dimensional spectrum and depth d. Production costs include a fixed component

and a component proportional to depth: φ0 + φ1d. Consumers are located along the spectrum

12
   According to the Newspaper Association of America, revenue from readers (which they term “circulation
expenditures”) to daily and Sunday papers was $10.3 billion in 1997, while advertising expenditure to newspapers
totaled $41.3 billion. The latter figure includes “all costs: time and talent, space and production” and therefore
presumably overstates newspaper revenue from advertising. See http://www.naa.org/info/facts99 (viewed February
9, 2000). Estimates in the literature confirm these figures. See in particular industry reports by Compaine (1980,
1982) and Udell (1978).
                                                            9
with some density f(x). The utility of the product to a consumer at location x0 is max[d-αx0 -

p,0], where α reflects “transport costs.”13 If α=0, then the paper’s location does not matter for

whether consumers purchase or enjoy it. If α is high, on the other hand, a product will be valued

only by nearby consumers, and a market might support multiple papers, provided that production

costs are not too high. For some range of transport and production costs and some distribution of

consumers, the equilibrium is a single product located at the median of consumers.14 Suppose,

for simplicity, that consumers buy if utility exceeds zero and that they purchase only the product

with highest utility at their location.

         This simple setup shows how the location of the paper can be sensitive to the distribution

of consumer types. This is intuitive for equilibria involving a single product located at the

median. A change in the preferences of the median consumer changes the position of the

product, making some consumers better off and others worse off. The example is also useful for

illustrating how groups affect each other. Figure 1 shows how two groups (“blacks” and

“whites”), with different distributions of preferences along the spectrum, can affect each other.

Suppose that black preferences tend to be located to the left of white preferences and that there

are many more whites than blacks. With the initial black population (B0) and a single-product

equilibrium, the product locates at p0, slightly left of the white median. When the black

population increases to B1, if the equilibrium configuration remains single product, the product’s


13
   This framework is generally consistent with theoretical studies of quality differentiation in spacial markets such as
Neven and Thisse (1990) and Economides (1989). However, most product differentiation models published since
D’Aspremont, Jaskold-Gabszewicz and Thisse’s (1979) reinvestigation of Hotelling (1929) typically consider
quadratic transport costs. Neven and Thisse (1990) also introduce differentiation in quality preferences as well as
product position. These modeling assumptions, while often essential to the results of each paper, are not directly
relevant to our argument that the distribution of tastes affects the number and quality of products available in a
market.
14
   The existence of equilibria in spatial product markets is the subject of a large literature. In general, existence
depends on assumptions regarding the nature of transport costs (D’Aspremont, Jaskold-Gabszewicz and Thisse,
1979), availability of outside options (Böckem,1994), the number of choice variables (Economides, 1989), the
number of competitors (Economides, 1993) and the shape of the product space (Salop, 1979). Our formulation is
essentially the minimum differentiation result of D’Aspremont et al. (1979) for linear transport costs with Bertrand-
style competition in quality rather than price. The elements of our illustrative example all emerge from the basic
formulation of Hotelling (1929).
                                                               10
position shifts left to p1. By moving the product closer to their ideal points, this repositioning

makes most blacks better off; and it makes most whites worse off.

       For different values of parameters, the model underlying this example can support many

different predictions. For example, with sufficiently high transport costs and low production

costs, one product might locate at the white median, another at the black median. For

sufficiently low production costs, there could be a range of products. The point of our example

is to show how groups can affect each other through product positioning. It is an open empirical

question – and the object of this study – to document whether they do.



                                               II. Data

       The basic data set used here is a cross section of per-capita newspaper circulation by zip

code in 269 newspaper markets, along with population characteristics at the zipcode and MSA

level. Aggregate zip code-level circulation is constructed from underlying circulation for

approximately 1,200 daily newspapers. Our data also include population shares for five races

defined by the Census (white, black, Indian, Asian and other) and counts of Hispanics and non-

Hispanics in each group. We construct these population shares at both the zip code and MSA

level using data from the 1990 census. We also have demographic variables, such as the age,

income and education distribution at both the zip code and MSA level. Our basic measure of

readership is circulation per capita, which we prefer to a household level measure because of the

straightforward link to demographic information from the Census. In some specifications of our

model we present results using readership per household.

       In addition to the circulation and population information, we have detailed data on

newspaper characteristics from two sources. We record newspaper prices and the number of

editors and reporters, by subject specialty (beat), at each newspaper from Burrelle's Media

Directory, 2000 Edition. We identify the average page length of each paper using data from the

                                                      11
Editor and Publisher International Yearbook (1999). We use the reporter data in section 6 to

characterize the spatial position of daily newspapers. We use page and price data to characterize

newspaper quality.

        Newspaper circulation data are published by the Audit Bureau of Circulation (ABC), a

membership organization providing independent audits of newspaper and magazine circulation

data for use by advertisers. ABC (1999) reports daily circulation by zip code for approximately

1,200 member newspapers. We sum circulation across newspapers to create zip code-level

totals. Because some papers do not report circulation data in every year, to allow inclusion of

more papers in the sample, the zipcode totals are created from daily circulation averaged over the

years 1996, 1997 and 1998.15

        We define a paper’s market as the metropolitan statistical area (MSA) or consolidated

metropolitan statistical area (CMSA) of publication. Note, however, that our data report each

included paper’s circulation in all markets, not just in the home market. This market definition is

used by ABC and large individual newspapers in circulation reporting and offers the advantage

of a straightforward link to Census data. Because much of our analysis involves the relationship

between zipcode circulation and characteristics of the entire market, we exclude from our

analysis zip codes that are not located within a metropolitan area.

        We also exclude 15 MSA’s for which we have incomplete data on daily newspaper

circulation.16 We identify incomplete data in two ways. First, approximately 30 general-interest

daily newspapers undergo annual audits by ABC but do not report circulation by zip code.

15
   A few other features of our data are worthy of note. In particular, although most entries in ABC data cover
individual newspapers, some papers published under joint operating agreements or by a single owner report
combined data. For example, our data record only combined circulation for the San Francisco Chronicle and the
San Francisco Examiner for each zip code—we do not know the circulation for each paper individually. Because
we aggregate circulation by zip code this does not affect our analysis. However estimates of newspapers circulated
per market generally underestimate totals because of this aggregation. Note also that we only have overall
circulation data by zip code, not by type of household within the zip code.
16
   The excluded markets include: Atlanta, GA; Chico, CA; Daytona Beach, FL; Duluth, MN--WI; Eau Claire, WI;
Janesville--Beloit, WI; Joplin, MO; Kalamazoo, MI; Lake Charles, LA; Lima, OH; Los Angeles--Anaheim--
Riverside, CA; New York--Northern New Jersey--Long Island; Terre Haute, IN; Tulsa, OK; and Wheeling, WV--
OH.
                                                            12
About 10 of these papers are published in towns or cities outside of MSA’s and hence do not

enter our sample. The remaining papers include nationally-distributed papers (New York Times,

Wall Street Journal, Christian Science Monitor) as well as a handful of major regional papers

(Tulsa World, Daily Oklahoman, New York Daily News). Second, in order to identify

newspapers not audited by ABC and therefore outside the universe of our data, we compared the

list of papers available from ABC to the set in Burrelle’s. We identified approximately 300

general interest daily papers that do not undergo auditing by ABC and hence for which no zip

code-level circulation data are available. The majority of these are published in towns or cities

outside of MSA’s and would therefore not enter our sample. The remaining 100 papers are

primarily local papers with low circulation. We exclude from our analysis markets for which we

are missing more than about 15% of MSA circulation.17 By excluding these markets we lose

2,300 of approximately 14,200 (five digit) zip codes, about 1,600 of which are in Los Angeles or

New York.

        In addition, about 2,300 zip codes in our sample MSA's have circulation reported by

ABC but no corresponding population information in the Census data, either because as central

business district locations they literally contain no residents or because the zips were established

or reconfigured after 1990. Total circulation in these zip codes is about 1.4 million, or about 4%

of the total circulation covered by our data. Results for 5-digit zip codes reported throughout the

paper omit zip codes for which we have no population information. In most specifications of our

model we also present results that aggregate circulation in the affected zip codes to the four-digit

zip code level to produce “hybrid” five- and four-digit zip codes. The assumption underlying

this aggregation is that newspaper purchases in these zip codes are made by residents of nearby

areas. To examine the sensitivity of our results to this treatment of circulation in “empty” zip


17
  Burrelle’s reports total circulation for papers missing from ABC. Because these totals reflect circulation inside
and outside of the home market, the market share we estimate using Burrelle's data overestimates the actual market
share. In practice, our basic regressions are not sensitive to the cutoff.
                                                            13
codes we examined our results omitting the 41 markets where circulation in these zip codes

exceeds 10% of circulation in the market. Results did not differ from the basic 5-digit zip results

and are not presented. Finally, we used current household counts available from three sources

(Claritas, the U.S. Post Office and S&MM's “Survey of Buying Power and Sales”) to identify

about 100 zip codes where population data from the Census differs substantially from these other

sources. Results for hybrid zip codes presented in the paper also aggregate over these zips.18

         Table 1 characterizes the data in the study, presenting population, circulation and

newspaper characteristics at both the newspaper and MSA levels. The ratio of daily circulation

to population – our basic measure of newspaper consumption – averages about 25% across

sample MSA’s. The average number of papers circulated per MSA is 8.72. Because circulation

tends to be very asymmetric across papers, it is useful to calculate a “newspaper equivalent”

measure, as the reciprocal of the product HHI. The average number of newspaper equivalents

per MSA is 1.7. The total circulation in our data is 35 million, which is roughly 85% of general-

interest daily paper circulation within metropolitan areas of the U.S. and about 60% of total

circulation, according to Burrelle's Media Directory, 2000.

         The basic empirical task of our study is to measure the impact of MSA demographic

composition on different groups’ tendencies to subscribe to newspapers. Successful

measurement of the impact of MSA population composition on different groups’ daily

newspaper consumption requires variation in both MSA and zipcode population composition.


18
  Aggregation to hybrid zip codes serves one additional purpose. Because our circulation data combine newsstand
and home delivery sales, to the extent that individuals purchase newspapers outside of their residential zip code we
misallocate circulation in our data. If the purchase of newspapers by non-residents is highest in central business
districts where we find the greatest number of “empty” zip codes, then aggregation to hybrid zip codes also
ameliorates any misallocation due to newsstand purchases. To explore the potential extent of this misallocation, we
obtained home delivery and newsstand sales for 12 newspapers (Honolulu Advertiser, Indianapolis Star, Arizona
Daily Star (Tucson), Jefferson City Capital News, Madison Capital Times, Charleston Gazette, Syracuse Post
Standard, Clarksburg Exponent, York Daily Record, Hagerstown Morning Herald, Lancaster Intelligencer Journal
and the Seattle Post-Intelligencer). Newsstand sales range from about 10-40% overall for these papers, but
newsstand sales are concentrated in relatively few zip codes, with between 45% and 85% of newsstand sales made
in 10% of the zips carrying each paper. To further consider the potential effect of misallocation on our results we
created a data set fully aggregated to the four-digit level, however variation in population statistics proved too low at
this level of aggregation for meaningful analysis.
                                                               14
Table 1 shows that both of these sorts of variation are present. There is substantial variation

across zipcodes in the fractions and, across MSA's, in the number of Hispanics and, in particular,

blacks. There is substantially less variation in the number of Asians.

       The bottom panel of table 1 reports individual newspaper characteristics and circulation-

weighted MSA averages. The average daily paper price is $.48, with little variation across

papers. The average number of pages is 35, and the average paper has 17 reporters and editors.



                         III. Basic Evidence of Preference Externalities

       The first question we seek to address is whether consumers confer a benefit on each other

generally, in their capacity as daily newspaper readers. We accomplish this by asking whether

the tendency to purchase a newspaper increases in the size of the market. Table 2 presents

weighted least squares regressions of readership (sz) in five digit zip codes, in hybrid zip codes

and in the MSA purchasing a daily newspaper on MSA population, with readership defined in

population and household terms. In all specifications, the tendency to purchase the paper bears a

positive relationship to market size. An increase in population of 1 million leads to an increase

in the subscription rate of about 0.3-1.0 percentage points. The effect is somewhat larger in the

hybrid zip specification, reflecting the inclusion of circulation in the unpopulated zip codes. The

effects are also somewhat lower in specifications that include observables. There is evidence of

positive preference externalities.

       The positive relationship between market size and the tendency to purchase daily

newspapers indicates that consumers derive greater satisfaction from newspapers in larger

markets. How much do people benefit each other? Consumer surplus is the valuation that

consumers place on the newspaper less the price paid. Both prices paid and product quality may

vary across markets, so that regressions in table 2 mask the mechanism and magnitude of

preference externalities. Table 3 shows how average prices and measures of paper quality (page

                                                     15
lengths and reporting staff) vary with market size. Prices are essentially invariant across

markets. Approximately 75% percent of dailies are priced at $0.50. Yet, paper quality,

measured both by page length and reporters per paper, increase in market size. If readers value

additional content, then welfare will be higher in larger markets, with prices constant, even if the

fraction of population purchasing the paper were invariant with market size.19

        We have documented that people benefit each other generally through daily newspaper

markets. As market size increases, the quality of the paper increases while its price does not.

The tendency for people to purchase a daily paper also increases in market size. We now turn to

the main question of the study, who benefits whom in daily newspaper markets?



                       IV. Do Newspaper Preferences Differ Across Groups?

        For preference externalities to operate differently within and across groups, product

preferences must vary among consumer types. Evidence from other media indicates that

different racial and ethnic groups have distinct preferences for media content which might also

appear in newspaper choices.20 In this section we examine differences in newspaper preferences

among whites and blacks.

        Our task is complicated slightly by the fact that circulation data are not available

separately by group of consumer. Consequently, we cannot simply compare the distribution of

papers chosen, for example, by different groups within a market. Because group shares differ

substantially across zip codes, however, we can compare the distributions of papers chosen in,

say, predominantly black vs. predominantly white zip codes within the same media markets.

Such a comparison also requires that the markets have at least two widely available daily papers
19
   Other measures of quality are also higher in larger markets. For example, 133 out of 224 Pulitzer Prizes in
journalism (outside of the breaking news and photography categories) awarded to daily newspapers over the 20
years 1980-1999 have gone to papers in the ten largest markets, while these markets contain only 38 percent of the
1990 US population. See www.pulitzer.org (viewed May 10, 2000).
20
   See Waldfogel (1999) for evidence on how preferences in radio programming differ by race, gender, and age and
Sterngold (1998) for evidence on how television viewing preferences differ by race.


                                                            16
(whose data are reported separately). The markets must also have substantial numbers of

persons in each of the groups. These criteria are satisfied in Chicago, Philadelphia, Boston and

Washington, although the black population in Boston, at 5%, is lower than the population in the

other markets.

            To characterize whether, and how, newspaper preferences differ across race we run

the following regressions:


     s 1z = γ 0 + γ 1bz + η z ,


where sz1 is the market share of the market’s dominant paper relative to its major, typically

tabloid competitor (e.g. the Boston Globe among the Boston Globe and Boston Herald) in

zipcode z, bz is the fraction of population that is black in zipcode z and ηz is an error term. In a

second specification, we include the fraction in the zipcode with at least some college as well as

other zipcode-level observables that might affect newspaper choice. We run a separate weighted

least squares regression for each market, using zipcode populations as weights. Results are

presented in Table 4. In each of the markets, preferences for the non-tabloid paper differ

substantially across race. The estimates imply that in each of the markets, the non-tabloid paper

has roughly 60-80 percent of circulation among white readers, while it has a roughly 20-40

percent market share among black readers.21

            It is worth noting that table 4 shows that preferences differ across racial groups, not that

preferences differ because of race. While it may be interesting to know whether preferences

differ because of race or because of other unobserved factors correlated with race, understanding

this distinction is not important for the present study. We are interested, for example, in how the




21
 The readership share of the Washington Post relative to the Washington Times is higher for both blacks and
whites in the DC metro area, likely reflecting the somewhat unique nature of this paper.
                                                          17
distribution of persons with different preferences in a market affects the welfare of individuals in

each group, not how individual characteristics shape the underlying preferences.

          Two circumstances are needed to document a difference between own-group and across-

group preference externalities. First, preferences must differ across groups. We see that

preferences vary among blacks and whites. Second, documenting patterns of preference

externalities requires variation in the groups’ shares of population across zips and numbers

across MSA's. We observe substantial variation in the proportion of blacks across zips and the

black population across MSA's. The black-nonblack comparison thus provides a reasonable

context for testing whether preference externalities operate differently within and between

groups. The regressions in the sections that follow focus exclusively on blacks and whites.



                                  V. Empirical Strategy and Results

1. Cross Section Approach

          In this section, we document the nature of preference externalities operating within and

across black and white populations. If we had subscription data by zip and race, we could simply

estimate the following equations for each of the two groups:



    (1)          s Wz = α 0 + α1WM + α 2 BM + ε Wz


    (2)          s zB = β 0 + β 1WM + β 2 BM + ε zB


In these equations szB is the zip code share of the blacks buying a daily newspaper, szW is the zip

code share of whites buying a daily newspapers, WM is the population of the whites in the MSA,

and BM is the number of blacks in the MSA. If the difference between black and white

preferences matters, the tendency for each group to subscribe will increase in the size of the

own-group and will be invariant (or will decline) in the size of the other group (α1, β2 > 0; and

                                                      18
α2, β1 = (<) 0). If preferences, as well as ability to pay, do not differ across groups, then α1=α2

and β1=β2.

           While we have circulation data by zip code, we do not have these data by race. However,

we do know the racial composition of the zip codes, and this allows us to estimate α0,α1, α2 ,β0,

β1, and β2. Define bz as the black share of the population in the zip code, and note that:


(3)             s z = bz s zB + (1 − bz ) s Wz


Substituting (1) and (2) into (3) yields:

(4)             s z = α 0 + α 1WM + α 2 BM + ( β 0 − α 0 )bz + ( β 1 − α 1 )WM bz + ( β 2 − α 2 ) BM bz + ν z

where ν is an error term equal to bz ε zB + (1 − bz )ε Wz .22 All of the parameters are identified from

interactions of MSA black and white populations (BM and WM) with the zip code black (bz). The

equation is intuitive: the α coefficients are estimated directly as the constant and the coefficients

on WM and BM. The coefficients on the interactions of bz with the constant, WM, and BM show the

difference between the black and white constant, the black and white effect of whites and the

black and white effect of blacks.23

           We also estimate variants of the model that allow for differences in the tendency to

purchase newspapers across regions. Region dummies estimated directly in equation (4) allow

the tendency to read newspapers to vary across census regions but not across race. Region

dummies alone and interacted with bz allow for region effects that differ by race. We also

estimate a specification with MSA-level observables such as income, education and age.

           Table 5 reports zipcode-population-weighted least squares regression results for blacks

and whites. The first four columns report the results for 5-digit zip codes and the second four

columns for hybrid zip codes. We report results in each category with no region dummy

22
     We deal with the heteroscedasticity of the error ν by calculating robust standard errors.
23
     Note that we can estimate all of the (β-α) parameters using only within-MSA variation. We discuss this below.
                                                               19
variables, with simple region dummy variables, with region dummy variables and observables,

and with interacted region dummy variables. The results, across a variety of specifications, are

striking. Within-group preference externalities are positive and significant in virtually all

specifications. Per capita circulation among blacks increases with the number of blacks in the

MSA (β2>0) and per capita circulation among whites increases with the number of whites (α1

>0). The own-group effects are more than ten times higher for blacks than for whites in all of the

specifications, perhaps reflecting comparatively small MSA black populations. Additional

blacks raise the black-targeted appeal of products from a very low level. If the marginal utility

of additional group-targeted content declines, then marginal blacks would have a larger effect on

black welfare than marginal whites (who are always numerous) would have on whites.

        Table 5 also shows clear evidence of negative preference externalities across groups. All

else equal, the tendency for blacks to subscribe to daily papers decreases as the number of whites

in the MSA increases (β1<0). As white population increases, holding black population constant,

newspapers become less appealing to blacks. The tendency for whites to subscribe does not

appear to depend on the MSA black population (α2=0).

        It seems curious at first glance that the number of whites in a market actually hurts

blacks. This result is easier to understand when one recalls that an increase in the number of

whites, holding the black population constant, raises the proportion of population that is white.

This may, in turn, shift the position of the product(s) to make them less appealing to blacks.24

It is interesting to contrast the evidence that black newspaper consumption is reduced by white

population with the analogous evidence from radio broadcasting. In that context, while blacks

have a negative effect on the number of white-targeted stations in each market (and vice versa),

there are no significant effects of each group on the other group’s tendency to consume. The
24
  One can view our specifications as approximations of more general functions sW(W,B) and sB(W,B). We
experimented with this approach by estimating versions of equation (4) allowing for fully-interacted first and second
order polynomials in W and B. Estimates of parameters of interest were very similar in the reported specifications
and the first order approximation. Estimates of the second-order approximations proved erratic.
                                                             20
negative consumption cross effect is absent because groups listen to the radio even when their

most preferred programming options are not available. For example, blacks listen to white radio

in markets without black-targeted options almost as much as blacks listen in markets that also

offer black-targeted options. The negative consumption result for newspapers suggests that

blacks are less willing to consume a less-preferred newspaper option than in the radio context.

Individuals do not exercise the outside option in radio: virtually all persons listen to radio during

the week, while only about one third of the population purchases a daily newspaper.

Presumably, this difference reflects availability of substitutes. There are many substitutes for

daily papers, including television, radio, weekly newspapers and magazines but few substitutes

for radio listening, particularly in cars.



2. MSA Fixed Effects

        One concern that our basic specification cannot address is whether unobserved MSA

factors affecting the tendency to read newspapers are correlated with MSA group populations.

We can use within-MSA variation across zipcodes to identify some of the parameters in equation

(4). In particular, we can estimate the difference between each group’s own and cross effects.

Table 6 presents estimate the following equation:

(5)          s Mz = ( β 0 − α 0 )bMz + ( β 1 − α 1 )WM bMz + ( β 2 − α 2 ) BM bz + µ M + ν Mz

where µM is a fixed effect for MSA M.

        We estimate two parameters showing whether each group helps itself more than it helps

the other group. First, the coefficient (β1-α1) shows how much the effect of whites on blacks

exceeds the white own effect. We estimate this to be negative and significant, indicating that

white population raises white reading shares more than white population raises black reading

shares. Second, the coefficient (β2-α2) shows how much the black own-effect exceeds the effect

of blacks on whites. We estimate this to be positive and (at least marginally) significant,
                                                            21
indicating that black population increases the black reading share more than black population

increases the white reading share. The fixed effects estimates confirm the asymmetry of effects

documented in table 5: black and white populations each exert larger positive effects on their

own tendencies to read than they exert on the reading tendency of their population complement.



                                     VI. Product Positioning

       We have documented in the sections above that newspaper readership depends positively

on the size of an individual’s own group and negatively or not at all on the size of the remaining

population. We have suggested that the mechanism for the operation of these preference

externalities is product positioning. In this section we examine this explicitly using data on

newspaper characteristics. The first question we must address is whether blacks and whites

prefer newspapers targeted in different ways that are detectable in our data.

       We characterize product positioning using the numbers of reporters assigned to different

beats. Burrelle's provides newspaper-level data on reporters employed by individual newspapers

and the areas they cover. Burrelle’s identifies over 200 beats covered by daily newspapers,

which we aggregate into six major categories: news, economy (markets, finance, labor, etc.),

industry (industry-specific coverage), entertainment (music, movies, theater, etc.), lifestyle

(fashion, fitness, decorating, recreation, etc.) and sports. Using these beats we can calculate the

fraction of each paper’s reporting in “hard” and “soft” news. We classify news, economy and

industry as “hard” news; and we classify entertainment, lifestyle and sports as “soft” news. We

aggregate these data across papers to the MSA level. According to our classifications, 43% of

reporters are assigned to hard news (32% to news, 4% to economy and 7% to industry), and 30%

cover soft news (8% cover entertainment, 15% cover lifestyle, and 7% cover sports). The

remaining 27% cover photography, advertising, classifieds and other areas that we label

production staff.

                                                     22
           Do blacks and whites have different preferences for types of reporting? Recall from table

4 that blacks and whites have substantially different preferences for daily newspapers in Boston,

Chicago, Philadelphia, and Washington. Table 7 shows the distributions of reporting resources

assigned to the five major beats for the dominant and competing papers in these cities. In

general, the papers preferred by black readers assign a larger fraction of reporters to lifestyle and

entertainment than the papers preferred by whites. The papers preferred by whites assign a

greater fraction of reporters to business and news topics, although the Boston Herald appears to

assign a greater fraction of reporters to business topics than the Globe. In each case the ratio of

hard news to total staff is higher for papers preferred by white readers and the ratio of soft news

to total staff is higher for papers preferred by blacks.

           If blacks prefer more soft news than whites, and if product positioning is the mechanism

underlying the pattern of preference externalities documented above, papers should contain more

soft news as their populations contain proportionately more black residents. Table 8 reports

regressions of the fraction of reporters in the MSA assigned to hard news beats on the proportion

black in the MSA. The second column includes an MSA population term to control for possible

effects of market size on product positioning independent of percent black. In both

specifications the fraction black bears a negative (and at least borderline significant) relationship

with the fraction of reporters assigned to hard news. The latter two columns perform the

analogous exercise with the fraction of reporters assigned to soft news beats as the dependent

variable, with consistent results: MSA’s with proportionately more blacks have daily papers with

proportionately more soft news.25 These results provide evidence that publishers pitch their

papers differently when facing different mixes of potential readers, which can explain why

blacks in markets with larger numbers of whites are less likely than blacks in other markets to

purchase a daily paper.


25
     Because of production staff, hard and soft news do not make up 100 percent of reporting and editorial staff.
                                                               23
                                          VII.    Conclusion

       Markets are generally thought to avoid distributional problems that pervade allocations

made by collective choice. Yet, this stark dichotomy between market and political allocation

schemes can break down in the presence of supply-side nonconvexities. With fixed costs and

differing product preferences, potential consumers can exert positive or negative preference

externalities on each other. Thus, an effect analogous to the tyranny of the majority in voting

arises in the market context as well, in the sense that individuals’ welfare as product consumers

depends on the distribution of product-preferring types in their markets.

       We have documented the pattern of preference externalities among black and white

consumers of daily newspapers in the US. We find that, in their capacity as newspaper

consumers, members of each group benefits themselves and either harm or confer no benefit on

each other through the product market preference externality mechanism. Further, because

newspaper markets support few products, the theoretical scope for negative preference

externalities is large, and the negative cross effects that we document are large compared to other

studied contexts (Waldfogel, 1999). Finally, we present evidence that product positioning

provides a mechanism underlying our results.

       Friedman (1962) argues that “the use of political channels… tends to strain the social

cohesion essential for a stable society,” while, by contrast, “widespread use of the market

reduces the strain on the social fabric by rendering conformity unnecessary.” Mounting evidence

on media markets suggests otherwise. More research is necessary to determine whether these

effects operate in a broader class of markets. If so, then collective and market allocation

processes may not differ so much as is conventionally thought.
