                Monetary and Fiscal Policies in an Open Economy

                                   ABSTRACT

ness and proper conduct of national macroeconomic policies.       Specifically,

this paper summarizes the implications for the conduct of macroeconomic

policies in open economies of both the traditional approach to open economy

macroeconomics and of more recent developments.     As recent experience demon-

strates, no country is immune from disturbances originating in the rest of

the world and no government can sensibly conduct its macroeconomic policy on

the assumption that it operates in a closed economy.     National economies are

linked not only through the mechanism of tile Keynesian foreign-trade multiplier

but also through the complex of linkages implied by commodity trade, capital

mobility and the exchange of national monies.     These linkages are not proper-

ties of a particular model but implications of parity conditions and equilibrium

requirements in goods and asset markets, income and balance sheets constraints,

the absence of long-run money illusion, and consistency of expectations which

impose important constraints on the conduct of macroeconomic policy in an

open economy.

        The central theme of this paper is that international linkages between

national economies influence, in fundamentally important ways, the effective-

ness and proper conduct of national macroeconomic policies.   Specifically, our

purpose is to summarize the implications for the conduct of macroeconumic

policies in open economies of both the traditional approach to open economy

macroeconomics (as developed largely by James E. Meade, Robert A. Mundell and

J. Marcus Fleming) and of more recent developments.   ·Our discussion is organized

around three key linkages between national economies:    through commodity trade,

through capital mobility, and through exchange of national monies.     These link-

ages have important implications concerning the effects of macroeconomic policies

in open economies that differ from the effects of such pOlicies in closed economies.

        Recent developments in the theory of macroeconomic policy have estab-

lished conditions for the effectiveness of policies in influencing output

and employment which emphasize the   distinctionbetw~en anticipated   and unan-

ticipated policy actions, the importance of incomplete information, and the

consequences of contracts that fix nominal wages and prices over finite inter-

vals.   In this paper, we shall not analyze how these conditions are modified

in an open economy.   However, since our concern is with macroeconomic policy,

a principal objective of which is to influence output and employment, we shall

assume that requisite conditions for such influence are satisfied.


I.   Commodity Market Linkages

        International trade links the prices of goods produced and consumed in

different national economies.    This linkage has at least three implications for

the conduct of macroeconomic policy in open economies.

        First, according to the principle of purchasing power parity, the price

level in one country (in terms of domestic money) should equal the price level

in a foreign country (in terms of foreign money) multiplied by the exchange


                                         1

                                       •
rate between domestic money and foreign money.     Because of transport costs,

trade barriers, -different weighting schemes for price indices and changes in

relative prices of non-traded goods, this link is not rigid; but the evidence

indicates that this principle holds fairly well over long time periods (though

it has weakened during the 1970s).    The key implication of purchasing power

parity is that a country cannot choose its long-run inflation rate independently

of its long-run monetary policy and the long-run behavior of its exchange rate.

A country, particularly a small country, that fixes the exchange rate between

its domestic money and the money of some fore1gn country will experience a

domestic inflation rate and a domestic rate of monetary expansion that are

strongly influenced by the monetary policy of that foreign country.     This is so

even if changes in real economic conditions (which are largely independent of

domestic monetary policy) induce divergences from strict purchasing power parity.

       Second, the world monetary system and the conduct of national monetary

policies must allow for changes in equilibrium ,relationships between national

price levels induced by changes in relative prices of internationally traded

goods and of non-tradable goods.     To maintain a system of fixed exchange rates,

changes in equilibrium relationships among national price levels must be accom-

modated by differentials among national inflation rates, supported by appropriate

national economic policies.   Under a system of controlled or managed floating,

it is essential that countries either allow their inflation rates or the rates

of change of exchange rates to accommodate equilibrium changes in relative

national price levels.   A rule that links changes in the exchange rates rigidly

to changes in domestic and foreign prices, in accord with relative purchasing

power parity, is not consistent with this requirement.

       Third, macroeconomic policy can do little to offset changes in equilibrium

levels of real income resulting from changes in relative prices of internationally

traded goods.   A case in point is the: recent increase in the relative price of
                                            3


oil.     Monetary policy can influence the extent to which the increase in the

relative price of oil affects general price levels and perhaps short-run

levels of employment in oil exporting and oil importing countries.             Tax and

expenditure policy can affect the extent to which gains and losses of real

income are translated into changes in real expenditure, or are financed by

changes in foreign lending and borrowing.           By influencing the level and dis-
                                                ~


tribution of real expenditure, fiscal policy can also affect the relative

prices of non-tradable commodities and the distribution of the change in real

national income among individuals within the economy.          However, neither monetary

nor fiscal policy can alter to any appreciable extent the average change in the

long-run level of real expenditure resulting from a change in the relative

prices of internationally traded commodities that are beyond the control of

national economic policies.


lIe     Capital Market Linkages

          International capital mobility links interest rates on financial assets

denominated in different national monies through the interest parity relation-

ship.     This relationship requires that interest differentials betwedn securities

denominated in different currencies equal the forward discount or premium on

foreign exchange.     The empirical evidence indicates that this relationship

holds almost exactly for easily tradable securities identical          i~   all respects

except currency of denomination" but somewhat less well for assets exchanged

primarily in national credit markets (see Robert Z. Aliber, Michael Dooley and

Peter Isard, and Jacob A. Frenkel and Richard M Levich).v           International capital

mobility also allows countries to finance imbalances in their current accounts

and thus provides an important channel for the international transmission of

macroeconomic disturbances.       The linkage of interest rates through interest

parity and the transmission of macroeconomic disturbances through international
                                            4


capital flows have significant implications for thp. conduct of macroeconomic

policy in open economies.

       International capital mobility imposes a severe constraint on the use of

monetary policy for domestic stabilization purposes.           Under a fixed exchange

rate, an increase in the    domes~ic   credit   com~onent   of the money supply in a

small open economy may temporarily reduce interest rates on domestic           securitie~,


but it will induce a capital outflow and a corresponding loss of foreign ex-

change reserves that will rapidly reduce the money supply back to its previous

equilibrium level.   Monetary expansion by a large country, which affects con-

ditions in world financial markets, can be somewhat more effective in influ-

encing domestic prices,    out~ut   and employment.   However, even a large country

will suffer a loss of foreign exchange reserves that is inversely related to its

size in the world economy.    Sterilization operations of a central bank may

temporarily insulate the domestic money supply from changes in foreign exchange

reserves; but, in the long run, sterilization cannot sustain ,a money supply

that differs from the equilibrium level of money demand.          Under a   f~exible   ex-

change rate, a government regains long-run control over the nominal money supply.

However, international capital mobility still limits the effectiveness of mone-

tary policy:   Any increase in aggregate demand induced by lower domestic interest

rates is partially dissipated in      ~ncreased   expenditures on imported goods,

financed by international capital fluws; and exchange rate adjustments that

occur rapidly in response to perceived changes in monetary policy are likely to

leaq to rapid adjustments of domestic prices and wage. rates, thereby limiting

the effect of monetary policy on output and employment.

       A high degree of capital mobility also implies a low degree of effective-

ness of fiscal policy.     Under a flexible exchange rate, a fixed domestic money

supply and a domestic interest rate fixed by        condi~ions   in world markets (and

by exchange rate expectations which affect the forward discount or premium on
                                               ,.
                                           5


foreign exchange) impose a strict constraint on the level of domestic income

that is consistent with monetary equilibrium.        Fiscal policy actions do not

affect this constraint (except possibly by altering exchange rate expectations)

and, hence, cannot affect the equilibrium level of domestic income.           Under a

fixed exchange rate, the money supply is not fixed because the capital inflow

induced by an expansionary fiscal poLicy will increase the foreign exchange re-

serves of the monetary authority.      The initial expansionary effect of any fiscal

stimulus, however, is limited by the extent to which it falls on domestically

produced goods that are not close     substi~utes   for imports; and the    subsequ~nt


multiplier effects of any fiscal stimulus are limited by the high marginal

propensity to spend on internationally traded goods.

        To achieve the maximum effect from fiscal and monetary policy in open

economies, it follows that such policies should be directed toward goods and

assets that are isolated from world trade, that is, toward goods and assets for

which the home country is "large" relative to the size of the market.           Changes

in government expenditures on non-tradable goods are likely to be mure effective

in influencing domestic output and employment than changes in government expendi-

ture on internationally traded goods.      Similarly, open market operations in-

volving financial assets that are not close substitutes for international

financial assets are more likely to influence       intere~t   rates and thus other

macroeconomic variables [see Rudiger Dornbusch, William Branson and

Russell Boyer].   This does not imply, however, that it is desirable to artifi-

cially restrict trade and capital movements in order to enhance the effectiveness

of macroeconomic policy.      Such restrictions have an important cost in terms of

reducing the benefits that a country derives from integration of markets.             More-

over,   substi~ution   possibilities among goods and among financial assets limit

the effectiveness of restrictions,on trade and capital movements.           As many policy-

makers have discovered, using macroeconomic policy for         dom~stic   stabilization



                                                                                              /
                                            6


Objectives in an open economy is like trying to heat a house when the doors and

windows are open and    th~   cold wind is blowing.

          Finally, international capital mobility implies that current account

imbalances can be financed by capital movements, independent of the government's

willingness to allow cha~ges in its foreign exchange reserves.         Hence, with

capital mobility, the current account which measures both the net contribution

of the foreign sector to aggregate demand for domestically produced goods and

the change in a country's net debtor position, is always a concern of macro-

economic policy, regardless of the exchange rate regime.         As emphasized by the

absorption approach to the balance of payments [see Sidney Alexander and Harry

G. Johnson (1958)], the current account is equal to the excess of national in-

come over national expenditure.       It follows that the policies required to bring

about an improvement in the current account are not primarily commercial policies

that affect the domestic relative prices of imported goods, but monetary and

especially fiscal policies that stimulate private saving and that reduce the

government's own excess of spending over income.


III.   Monetary Linkages

          The concept of monetary equilibrium as requiring equality between the

demand and supply of money, is a basic ingredient in both closed and open

economy macroeconomic theory.       It implies that any change in the supply of

money or any exogenous disturbance to money demand must lead to changes in

the equilibrium values of one or more of the variables that inf.luence        money

demand.     It also implies that any disturbance or policy action that does not

directly affect the demand or supply of money must, in equilibrium, lead to

offsetting changes in the variables      that'inf1uenc~   money demand that are con-

sistent with a constant level of that demand.

          The implications of monetary equilibLium for the macroeconomic policy
                                          7


of an open economy operating under a fixed exchange rate are reflected in the

principles of the monetary approach to the balance of payments [see Michael

Mussa (1974) and the articles in Frenkel and Johnson (1976)].      Specifically,

the use of monetary policy for domestic stabilization purposes is constrained

by the equilibrium level of the demand for money which io largely beyond         th~


control of the monetary authority.   An   expansion of the domestic credit component

of the money supply may temporarily raise prices (especially of non-traded goods),

raise output (especially in industries with sticky wages and prices), and reduce

interest rates (especially for domestic securities sheltered from world finan-

cia1 markets).   In the longer run, however, the direct effect of monetary ex-

pans ion on desired spending and on desired portfolio reallocations, and the in-

direct effects of changes in prices and interest rates will induce deficits in

the current and capital accounts of the balance of payments.      H;.nce the foreign

exchange reserve component of the money supply will decline until the money

supply is reduced to the long-run equilibrium level of money demand.      For a

large country, the long-run equilibrium level of money demand may be influenced

by the effect of domestic monetary expansion on the world price level.      However,

except for a reserve currency country, whose national money is accepted as a

foreign exchange reserve by other countries; the principal long-run effect of

monetary policy will be on the composition of assets on the central bank's

balance sheet rather than on the magnitude of its monetary liabilities.      Further,

other economic policies affect a country's foreign exchange reserves (and hence

its cumulative official settlements balance) only    ~o   the extent that they   aff~ct


the demand to hold domestic money.   For example, an import tariff can induce a

once-and-for-a11 increase in the level of reserves to the extent that it in-

creases the domestic price level and thus the demand to hold domestic money.

But, it cannot induce a continuing inflow of foreign exchange reserves by

reducing imports relative to exports [see Mussa (1974)].


                                                                                          /
                                          8


       The requirements of monetary equilibrium also constrain economic policy

under a flexible exchange rate.     A flexible exchange rate is not an additional

policy tool that can be manipulated by the government, but rather an endogenous

variable that is determined by market forces which are influenced by the actual

and expected conduct of fiscal and, especially, monetary policy.       In particular,

from the homogeneity postulate, it follows that, other things constant, in the

long run, changes in the nominal money supply will lead to proportionate changes

in all nominal prices, including the price of foreign exchange.       This is one of

the fundamental tenets of the monetary approach to exchang~ rates [see Frenkel

and Johnson (1978)].

       Other important implications of this approach follow from the essential

dynamic linkage between current exchange rates and expectations of future ex-

change rates implied by international mobility of financial assets denominated

                          .    1   First, since future government policies will

influence future exchange rates, it follows that expectations concerning future

policies should influence current exchange rates.      Hence, the effect of any

particular policy action on exchange rates (and through exchange rates on other

macroeconomic variables) will depend on its effect on expectations concerning

future policy actions.   Second, the sensitivity of exchange rates to expectations

of future policy implies that the traditional approach to macroeconomic policy

analysis, which views policy as    iso~ated   actions in response to particular

circumstances, is inappropriate.     Instead, it is necessary to analyze the general

framework ofgovernrnent policy, within which the effect of any particular action

depends on the public's perception of the implications of that action for the

future conduct of policy.   Third, since exchange rates respond quickly to new

information about events likely to affect foreign exchange markets, exchange

rate adjustments are an important channel for rapid transmission of macroeconomic

disturbances and of government policies.       In particular, new information that leads
                                        9


to the expectation of a higher rate of inflation is likely to induce an immedi-

ate depreciation of the foreign exChange value of domestic money which will be

rapidly translated into increased domestic prices of internationally traded

commodities.   In addition, exchange rate depreciation may serve as a     ~ignal


for upward adjustments in the prices of domestic goods and in wage rates.

Fourth, if there is short-run stickiness    ~f   prices of domestic goods in terms

of national monies, then rapid exChange rate adjustments will induce changes

in the relative prices of different national outputs.       Such relative price

changes are a desirable response to changing real economic conditions requiring

adjustments of relative prices; and a flexible exchange rate regime may have

an important advantage in facilitating such adjustments.      However, unnecessary

changes in relative prices in respol1se to purely monetary disturbances may have

significant social costs that can be avoided or reduced by pursuing monetary

policies that are not themselves an independent source of monetary disturbances

and that offset, as much as possible, exogenous fluctuations in money demands.

Fifth, official intervention in foreign exchange markets, which alters only

the supplies of non-monetary assets available to the public, may have a limited

influence on exChange rates through portfolio balance effects.       In aadition,

such intervention may have a more powerful effect on exchange rates by signal-

ling to the public the intentions of governments concerning future policies.

Finally, exchange rates may be useful as an indicator for monetary policy -

directed at offsetting fluctuations in money demand, especially when rapidly

Changing inflationary expectations maAe nominal interest rates an unreliable

indicator of fluctuations in money demand.       For example, the combination of

rising nominal interest rates anu appreciation of the foreign exchange value

of domestic money would probably indicate an increase in the demand for domestic

money that should be accommodated by an increase in supply; whereas the      co~


bination of rising interest rates and depreciation would probably indicate an
                                          10


acceleration of inflationary expectations that should not be fueled by an

accommodative monetary policy.


IV.     Concluding Remarks

          In this paper we have discussed the implications of "openness" of an

economy for the effectiveness and appropriate conduct of macroeconomic poli-

cies.    As recent experience demonstrates, no country is immune from distur-

bances originating in the rest of the world and no government can sensibly

conduct its macroeconomic policy on the assumption that it operates in a

closed economy.     National economies are linked not only through the mechanism

of the Keynesian foreign-trade multiplier but also through the complex of

linkages implied by commodity trade, capital mobility and the exchange of

national monies.     These linkages are not properties of a   par~icular   model but

implications of parity conditions and equilibrium requirements in goods and

asset markets, income and balance sheets constraints, the absence of long-

run money illusion, and consistency of expectations which impose important

constraints on the conduct of macroeconomic policy in an open economy.
