                                          ABSTRACT

       This paper reviews the main developments in U.S. trade and the balance of payments from

the first years of the 19th century to the first decade of the 20th.

       American export trade was dominated by agricultural and other resource products long

after the majority of the labor force had shifted out of agriculture. The shift out of agriculture

was more rapid among the major trading partners of the United States because the American land

area increased in the first half of the nineteenth century and agricultural land increased

throughout the century. The rise in agricultural land area and a rapid decline in transport cost

increased the supply of U.S. agricultural products to Europe and further displaced European

agriculture and encouraged migration from Europe.

       The existence of the large world market, relatively open to the products of American

comparative advantage and with a high price elasticity of demand for American exports,

encouraged the expansion of U.S. land, agriculture, capital inflows, immigration, and the western

migration of population.

                               U.S. TRADE AROUND 1800


         Trade was on the minds of the entrepreneurs who financed the first

settlements in the Americas. They dreamt of riches --     the   kind that could

come only from exploiting the natural resources of areas newly opened to

European settlement and exporting the products. They did not envisage

financing subsistence farmers or artisans, or manufacturing settlements

serving local markets.

         As it turned out, the American colonies were, in their early days,

heavily involved in exporting. They probably exported something like a

quarter of their production in the early years of the 18th Century (Gallman

and Lipsey, in Davis, Easterlin, and Parker, 1972).      By the end of the 18th

Century that export propensity had been cut in half. Thus, around 1800,

something like ten to fifteen per cent of U.S. output was exported (j.j and

Shepherd and Walton 1972, p. 44). To some extent, that decline in the export

propensity could be attributed simply to population growth -     - larger   countries

tend to trade less in proportion to their output than smaller countries -       - but
the decline in exporting was too large for much of it to be attributed to that

cause.

         Exports of domestic merchandise by the United States at the beginning of

the 19th century were about 3 per cent of world exports and five per cent of

Europe's exports at a time when the population of the United States was only

about 1/2 of 1 per cent of the world's population and 2 1/2 per cent of

Europe's (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1975 and Bairoch, 1976a, Table 2, p. 18).

Thus in terms of exports of its own products per capita, excluding re-exports

of products made by others, the United States was twice as trade-oriented as

Europe, and more than five times as export-oriented as the world as a whole.
                                                                                2


The United States was also heavily engaged as an intermediary in a variety of

indirect "triangular" trades, especially with the nearby European colonies.

If we measured the trade propensity by total exports, including re-exports,

the U.S. ratios would be about twice as high.

      American exports in the early l800s were almost all natural resource

products. More than three quarters were the output of agriculture in 1803-07

and almost another fifth the output of forests and of the sea. Less than 5

per cent was the product of manufacturing industries (U.S. Congress, 1884,

Table 3). The industry origin of American exports in these years was similar

to that of 35 years earlier.

      This almost total concentration of exports on natural resource products

at the beginning of the 19th Century, and the fact that it almost duplicated

the export trade pattern of the mid-18th Century. contrasts with indications

that the structure of production had already started to shift away from

primary products. If Bairoch's (1982) very rough estimates are to be believed,

the United States (or the area that was to become the United States) moved

from a level of per capita industrial output far below the world level, and

that of even China and India, in 1750, to a level above the average of

developed countries and of Europe as a whole around 1800, behind only the UK,

by a large margin, and Belgium and Switzerland by narrow margins. Thus, the

structure of production seemed to be changing faster than that of other

countries without altering the comparative advantage of the United States.

      Most of the exports from the United States were destined for Europe

(over 60 per cent), about a quarter to Great Britain and Ireland. Those

shares represented a considerable decline from the period around 1770 (over 70

per cent to Europe, 57 per cent to Great Britain and Northern Ireland alone).
                                                                                      3

Almost all the exports not bound for Europe were destined for the West Indies

(29 per cent in 1768-72). New England's exports were largely to the West

Indies, as were half the exports of the middle colonies, while exports from

the southern colonies, the producers of cotton and tobacco, went over-

whelmingly to Great Britain. The southern colonies dominated exports to Great

Britain in 1768-72 (almost 90 per cent), the middle colonies, exports to

Southern Europe (over half), and New England and the middle colonies, exports

to the West Indies (three quarters) (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1975, and

Shepherd and Walton, 1972, pp. 94-95).

      The southern colonies were the most dependent on exporting before the

American Revolution. Their exports per capita were roughly twice as high as

those of New England and the middle colonies. Imports per capita were much

more similar among the regions, almost identical between New England and the

Middle Colonies on the one hand, and the southern colonies on the other

(Shepherd and Walton, p. 113).

      A distinctive feature of U.S. trade at the turn of the century was the

exceptionally high share of re-exports in total exports. Over half of exports

consisted of re-exports, as opposed to exports of U.S. merchandise, in almost

every year from 1796 through 1808, until the embargo (U.S. Bureau of the

Census, 1975, Series 190-192).

This enormous re-exporting activity was a consequence of the European Wars

following the early l790s, in which Great Britain and France each attempted to

block the other's trade with its colonies. The effect "...   was to throw into

our hands the greater part of the colonial carrying trade of the world -         an

economic prize for which European nations had been fiercely struggling for

nearly two centuries" (Callender, Introduction to Chapter VI)." The valuable
                                                                                 4

articles of colonial produce, such as sugar, coffee, spirits, cocoa, indigo,

pepper, and spices of all kind, were carried by them, either directly to

Europe, or brought to the United States, and from thence exported in American

vessels. ... The manufactures of Europe, and particularly those of Great

Britain, as well as the manufactures and produce of the East Indies and China,

were, also, imported, and again exported in large quantities, to the West

Indies, South America and elsewhere. (Pitkin, as quoted in Callender, pp. 240-

241).

        The United States not only accounted for a disproportionate share of

merchandise trade but also was heavily involved in the export of shipping

services. Earnings on ocean freight were about 30 per cent of export earnings

during the five years around 1800. The revenue from shipping was larger than

from exports of any commodity.

        Imports of merchandise almost always exceeded exports at the beginning

of the nineteenth century. The negative trade balance was more than offset by

large freight earnings, but the U.S. had negative net balances on account of

other services, such as insurance and interest. The interest item reflected

the accumulated net current account deficit of earlier years, although during

the quinquennium around 1800, there was a small net outflow of capital from

the U.S. (North, 1960).

        Wilkins (1989) estimated that America's long-term foreign obligations in

1803 were $65.70 million or more. These included foreign holdings of federal

debt (almost $5 million) plus over $15 million in holdings of corporate stock,

particularly stock in the Bank of the United States (pp. 48 and 646). If

Wilkins is correct that North had underestimated the foreign debt of the

United States, the estimates of interest payments and the current account

deficit mentioned above are also too low.

                            THE GROWTH OF TOTAL U.S. TRADE


The U.S. share of world trade

       As the 19th century began, U.S. trade was a minor part of world trade.

Over   the   course of the century, that part grew, until in 1900 U.S. exports

were 15 per cent of world exports (Table 1). Some of that increase simply

reflected the growth of the U.S. population from about a half per cent of that

of the world in 1800 to around 5 per cent in 1900 and 1910.

       The share of American domestic exports in the total of world export

trade was far above the U.S. population share and probably well above the U.S.

share in world output throughout the 19th Century. In other words, the U.S.

was more export-oriented than the average country. The export

share relative to the world rose throughout the 19th Century and then receded

a bit before World War I.

       The disparity between the U.S. world export share and its population

share was steadily reduced over the 110 years. Relative to Europe, the

disparity was much smaller, but it, too, fell through the 19th Century, until

it disappeared in 1910, with the U.S. at about 20 per cent of Europe's exports

and population. Thus by that time there was no difference from Europe with

respect to the degree of orientation toward exports.

      The comparison of U.S. trade with world trade can be made also for total

trade measured by the sum of exports and imports (Table 2). Since U.S.

imports were not rising as fast as U.S. exports, as the U.S. reduced its

foreign borrowing relative to its trade, the combined share levelled off

earlier, before the end of the century. At its peak, the U.S. trade share was

something around twice the U.S. share of the world's population.

     Whatever the measure used, the trend of U.S. trade during the 19th

century was one of increasing importance in the world market, particularly for

U.S. exports. That growth in importance in trade reflected in large part the
                                                                                7

rising size of the U.S. in terms of population and production, particularly

the latter as U.S. growth in output per capita outpaced that of the rest of

the world.




Total Trade and Output

      The proportion of U.S. output that was destined for foreign markets went

through some wide annual swings before the European peace settlement in 1815.

However, aside from a few years of embargo and war, the main trend in the

ratio of exports to aggregate U.S. output in current prices was a decline from

the 10-15 per cent of the 1790s and the much higher levels of the end of the

colonial period (Table 3). For the 100 years following the Napoleonic Wars

the average decade ratios ranged only from about 5 1/2 to 7 per cent. The

lowest export proportions were around 1830 and in the 1850s and the highest.

after the early period, were in the 20 years after 1890. The ratios for 1793

to 1860 are lower than those of the colonial period not only because trade

declined in importance but also because these national output measures in the

denominator include more non-market output -    farm improvements and home
manufacturing -   than   earlier and later output measures. By their nature,

these forms of output are not likely to be exported. They declined from 15-20

percent to 7 or 8 per cent of conventionally measured output between 1800 and

1860. Thus a conventional output measure would show some continued decline in

the trade share in the early 1800s.

      The ratio of exports to GNP in constant dollars tells something of the

same story of lower dependence on export markets in the 19th century than

earlier. In any case, the greatest dependence on export markets for the U.S.

economy as a whole had ended before the 19th century began, and certainly

before the l820s.

      The U.S. dependence on import trade was even greater than on export

trade in the period around 1770, perhaps a third of the colonies' production

or consumption. During the first half of the 19th century the import ratio

was above the export ratio, especially in the early years, but imports fell

below exports after the 1870s as the U.S. turned from capital importer to

capital exporter.

      In real terms, imports fell even more than exports relative to the GNP,

but they followed the same path of decline to 1829-38 and then a recovery.

The highest dependence on imports, in real terms, was just before the Civil

War, after which the ratio fell by about a third.

      One way to interpret the trade/output ratios is to think of growth in

trade that is no faster than growth in output as representing Npassive trade

behavior. Growth in trade more rapid than that in output, leading to a rise

in the trade/output ratio, can be thought of as "activeTM or even "aggressive"

trade behavior. Most of the period appears to be characterized by passive

trade behavior in this sense, but there was a fairly long stretch of years,

from the 1850s through the 1890s when American exporting became more

aggressive, and each decade saw some rise in the export ratio. However, no

such trend appears in the constant price series; the trend in the current

price ratios reflects a rise in export prices relative to domestic prices in

these decades.

                 THE U.S. BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND CAPITAL FLOWS


      For most of the period from the inauguration of George Washington to the

end of the 19th Century, the United States imported more merchandise than it

exported. Only in the last three decades of the century did exports exceed

imports, and that export surplus continued into the 20th Century (Table 4).

      Until the Civil War, the deficit on merchandise trade was roughly offset

by a surplus on shipping earnings, as the U.S. merchant fleet earned much more

than the U.S. paid to foreigners for freight shipments. That source of income

dwindled during and after the Civil War, and by the l880s, the U.S. had become
                                                                              11

a net importer of shipping services.

      Even while freight earnings were offsetting the deficit in the

merchandise trade account, the other main current account item, interest, was

always in deficit. The United States began its existence as a net debtor and

all through the 19th century and up to World War I it paid out more in

interest on its debts than it earned on its foreign assets.

      The obverse of this excess of current account payments was the import of

capital into the United States. Until an abrupt turn to capital exporting at

the end of the century, the United States was a net borrower from foreign

countries throughout the 19th century (Table 5).

      The cumulation of borrowing year after year meant that the United States

was a net debtor throughout these years. Even at the beginning of World War

I, despite fifteen or twenty years in which the United States was a net

foreign lender most of the time, the country was still a net debtor to the

rest of the world (Table 6).

                 (1989), Tables 3.1 (pp. 50-52) and 5.4 (pp. 147-150) suggest
                 somewhat larger net liabilities in 1803, by perhaps $15
                 million, and in 1914 by about $340 million.

      These figures on net U.S. liabilities say that foreigners had some net

claim on part of the wealth of the United States throughout the 19th Century.

That is, foreigners' claims on U.S. wealth were larger than U.S. claims on

foreign wealth. One comparison of foreign claims with reproducible wealth

suggests that the net foreign claims amounted to almost 14 per cent of wealth

at the beginning of the century. That share fell to about 7 per cent by 1850,

4 per cent by 1900, and only two per cent on the eve of World War I (Davis.

1972, Table 8.12). More recent calculations by Callman (1992) that raise the

estimated value of reproducible wealth, but put a rather low figure on foreign

claims in comparison to Lewis (1938) and Wilkins (1989), are summarized in

Table 7. They describe a fall in the foreign claims from 13 per cent of

domestic capital, excluding land, in 1774 to 9 per cent at the end of the 18th

century, and then some sharp fluctuations through the 19th century. These

reflect not only inflows and outflows of capital and the rate of U.S. capital

formation, but also the effects of U.S. inflation, which tended at times to

reduce the ratio by raising the nominal value of U.S. capl.tal.

      There are several ways to view the role of these flows of financial

capital in American development. One is as a source of financing for

aggregate capital formation, permitting faster accumulation of capital than

would have taken place if only domestic financing had been available. On this

basis, it is hard to suppose that imports of capital had a great influence on

the rate of development during most of the nineteenth century. The capital

inflows or changes in net foreign obligations were rarely more than 6 percent

of gross capital formation or of changes in the domestic capital stock of the

United States (Table 8). The major exceptions were 1815 to 1840 and the

period including the Civil War, 1860 to 1870, when the main foreign investment

was in federal government bonds. Edeistein has suggested that U.S. borrowing

from foreign countries rose when U.S. capital formation surged; borrowing

tapered off as U.S. saving, rising more gradually and steadily, caught up with

capital formation. Thus, investment from abroad accommodated the large spurts

in the demand for capital that characterized the rapidly growing economy.

      There may have been other roles for borrowing from abroad. One might

have been to supply funds for particularly risky forms of capital formation at

a lower interest rate than would have been required by domestic lenders.

Another might have been to supply funds when, in the face of heavy demands by

rapidly growing sectors, U.S. domestic lenders' needs for diversification of

risks made them reluctant to offer sufficient financing to these sectors.

Another interpretation is that U.S. railway and government securities,

relatively safe and requiring less local knowledge than investment in smaller-

scale enterprises in agriculture, mining, and manufacturing, tended to be sold

overseas, while domestic suppliers of capital invested in the riskier, but

more profitable, sectors (Edelstein 1982, 237-38).

      The bulk of foreign investment in the United States was portfolio

investment rather than direct investment. That is, it consisted of purchases

of bonds or, to a small extent, equities, that did not involve control over

the enterprise receiving the capital. Just before World War I, about 80

percent of the stock of long-term foreign investment in the United States was

portfolio investment; the same had been true for the flow over a long period

(Edeistein 1982, 36 and 37). Governments and railways were the chief

borrowers, and most of the financing was in the form of bonds rather than

equities.

      In 1789, it was public debt that was the main channel for foreign
                                                                               17

capital, and Wilkins (1989, Table 2.1. P. 32), estimates that almost 30 per

cent was held abroad, mainly in France and Holland. That was clearly

infrastructure financing, since it supported the establishment of the United

States as an independent country. In 1803, foreigners also held a third of

corporate stock, mainly of banks (Wilkins, 1989, Table 2.3, p. 37). The

Louisiana Purchase in 1803 added about $11 million to the total federal debt

and the same amount to the federal debt held by foreigners, so that we can

particularly describe this important jump in the size of the U.S. economy as

having been financed from abroad.

      Throughout the first half of the 19th Century, almost all foreign

financing went to governments, first the federal government and later, state

governments, and to banks (Wilkins, 1989, Table 3.1, Pp. 50-51). Only after

that did railroads become a major field for foreign capital, but federal

borrowing during the Civil War far exceeded the total of other borrowing

through the 1870s. We know more about British capital than about that of

other countries, but that is not a great handicap because the British role was

so large, over three-quarters of long-term foreign investment in the U.S. at

the end of the 19th century and still 60 percent in 1914 (Wilkins, 1989, Table

58, p. 159).

      Most of the foreign investment, whether for government or private

companies, went to large, lumpy, social overhead capital projects, such as

canals, railways, electrical utilities, and telephone and telegraph systems

(Edelstein 1982, 39-41). Manufacturing enterprises were probably almost all

too small to seek foreign financing by floating stock or bond issues, or in

most cases, by any type of public financing, even from domestic sources.

      There were many instances of manufacturing enterprises set up by foreign
                                                                               18

craftsmen or entrepreneurs with special knowledge or skills. However, in an

era in which transportation and communication were slow by modern standards,

these often involved the migration of the owners and eventual conversion of

their enterprises into domestic entities. Thus, these enterprises involved

mainly a flow of human capital to the United States.

      After 1865, relatively little of the flow of new foreign financing went

into government securities. From 1865 through 1914, over 60 per cent of

British portfolio investment flowed into transportation, almost entirely

railroads. Manufacturing, utilities, mining, and finance and real estate each

accounted for 6 to 7 per cent, as did all levels of government (Wilkins, 1989,

Table 5-9, p. 164). In 1910, 85 per cent of British investment was in

railroads, according to one estimate.

      The likelihood that foreign investment was much more important in the

flow of capital to the railroad sector than in U.S. fixed investment as a

whole is suggested by the fact that the value of foreign investment in U.S.

railroads in 1914 was about a quarter of the book value of railroad road and

equipment (Wilkins, 1989, Table 6.1, p. 194, and HS, Series Q356). British

investment alone was 16 per cent of the book value in 1914 (j).     Foreign
holdings were estimated by Jenks to range from 20 per cent to a third of the

nominal value of U.S. railroad securities between 1873 and 1914 (Wilkins,

1989, Table 6.4, p. 198).

      Since the United States was inferior to European countries in technology

in a number of industries during the 19th century, it may seem surprising that

there was so little inflow of direct investment, a natural channel for the

exploitation of technological advantages. Transportation and communication

were so slow, by modern standards, that it was almost impossible to control a
                                                                              19

subsidiary enterprise from across an ocean. Under those circumstances, the

transfer of technology and skills took somewhat different forms, particularly

the migration of key personnel, often children or other relatives, to

establish subsidiary enterprises or to manage them once they were acquired.

The enterprises were frequently what Mira Wilkins (1989) referred to as "free-

standing" enterprises, in the sense that while they were owned by foreigners,

they were not subsidiaries of foreign companies. Such enterprises were likely

over time to evolve into independent, domestic U.S. firms through the

migration of their owners to the United States and their adaptation to

American circumstances. In the end, the flow of financial capital was

intertwined with a flow of human capital.

      Immigration is often thought of as a movement of labor, but it is also a

flow of human capital. Movements of human capital are not traditionally

included in balance of payments accounts, since no monetary payment is

involved, at least when there is no slavery. However, the flow of human

capital may have been more important to U.S. development than the flows of

financial capital. In terms of numbers, immigration into the United States in

each decade from the 1830s through the beginning of World War I ranged from

about 5 percent to 10 percent of the number already in the country (U.S.

Bureau of the Census 1975, Series A 6, and C 89). Furthermore, most of the

immigrants (a 50 percent larger proportion than in the population as a whole)

were between fifteen and forty-four years of age (U.S. Bureau of the Census

1975, Series C 119, C 122-27, C 138, and C 141). They came to the United

States with most of their rearing costs already incurred in their home

countries and with a large part of their working lives still ahead of them.

      Some notion of the relative importance of the human and financial
                                                                               20

capital flows is provided by Neal and Uselding (1972), who estimated the

"resource pool arising from net immigration." The two types of inward capital

flows are compared in Table 9.

Even at the peak period of financial capital inflow, 1860-1890 (the United

States became a net exporter of capital after that), the low end of the range

for the estimate of the value of the human capital inflow embodied in

immigration was more than twice the financial capital flow. Before the Civil

War, the relative importance of the human capital flow was even greater, and

in the 1900-1909 decade, when the net financial capital flow was outward

rather than inward, the inflow of resources through immigration continued at a

high level. Thus the contribution of the inflow of resources from abroad to

American growth was much greater than might be inferred from the conventional

capital inflow data.

                   CHANGES IN THE COMPOSITION OF U.S. TRADE

                  AND THE COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE OF THE U.S.


The Composition of Trade

      The composition of American exports in the late 18th century and the

beginning of the 19th century reflected the fact that American comparative

advantage was based on the exploitation of abundant natural resources. The

largest part of exports consisted of agricultural products, but products of

the forest and of the sea were also important: 19 per cent of the total in

1803-1810, already a large decline from the 28 per cent of British continental

colonies in 1770 (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1975, Series z294). Thus, the

first great shift in export composition, as population moved away from the

coast and as forest land was cleared for farming, was, within resource

products, away from forest and ocean products toward those from agriculture.

In the decades before the Civil War around 80 per cent of U.S. exports were of

agricultural products.

     An indication of the shifts in importance of the sectors from which

exports originated is given by Table 10. One of the trends is the shift away

from forestry and fishing, responsible for almost 20 per cent of exports in

the first decade, already down from 27 per cent in 1770, but for less than 7

per cent before the Civil War.

      There was some rise in the importance of manufacturing as a source of

U.S. exports before the Civil War, but American exports were dominated

throughout the period by agriculture. A more surprising fact is that despite

the rise of manufacturing industry in the United States, discussed below,

agricultural products were over 70 per cent of total U.S. exports throughout

the 19th century and a majority of exports up to World War I.

      Within agriculture, the first half of the century saw the decline of

tobacco, the great colonial staple, and its replacement by cotton, which alone

accounted for half or more of exports from the 1830s to the beginning of the

Civil War. Cotton remained important for the rest of the century, and in the

years up to World War I, was still around a quarter of the value of all

exports.

      A different view of changes in the composition of trade is provided by

broad economic classes of goods. Before the Civil War, the United States was

mainly an exporter of raw materials and foods. Raw materials alone were 60

per cent or more of exports, food exports were about 20-25 per cent, and semi-

manufactures and finished manufactures accounted for the rest, with the

finished goods rising in importance and the semi-manufactures declining

(Table 11).

      The period after the Civil War saw very different trends. The share of

raw materials fell to around 30 per cent and food exports increased to replace

them, reaching a peak importance of over 40-45 per cent in the last two

decades of the 19th century and then declining to about a quarter just before

World War I. Thus raw materials and foods together remained overwhelmingly

predominant in exports almost until the eve of World War I, at 80 per cent or

close to it through the 1880s, and three quarters of the total through 1908.

      The changing comparative advantage of the United States can be described

by a comparison of the role of resource products in exports as compared with

imports. By Vanek's (1963) definition of resource products (crude materials

and crude foods) the share of these products in exports fell from four times

that in imports to less than that in imports between 1820 and 1904-13, with

the sharpest drop coming between the beginning and end of the Civil War. By a

broader definition of resource products that includes manufactured foods such

as flour and mat, the decline in the resource share was only about half as

large and the Civil War played less of a role. Since the value added in

manufacturing is relatively small in these industries the broader definition

seems more appropriate. Nevertheless, the shift away from U.S. comparative

advantage in resource products is very substantial, from an export share over

twice the share in imports to virtual equality.

     All this is not to say that manufactured goods other than foods played

no role in exports. The share of finished manufactures started very low: a

little over 5 per cent in 1820 and still less than 10 per cent in 1840, but

reached over a quarter in the first two periods of the twentieth century, over

40 per cent for finished manufactures and semimanufactures together. Their

steady growth in importance was interrupted in the period from the Civil War

through the l880s as crude food exports pushed them aside for a time. As a

result, the share of finished manufactures in U.S. exports in the 1880s and

l890s (15 and 17 per cent) was not very high compared to that of "third world"

countries around 1900, about 11 per cent according to Bairoch and Etemad

(1985, Table 2.1), if we remove nonferrous metals from their manufactured

category for comparability.

      On the import side, the United States began its existence as an importer

of finished manufactures, more than half the total at first. As these

products grew in importance among exports, they declined among imports. By

the beginning of the 20th century the United States was no longer a net

importer of finished manufactures from the rest of the world. The

manufactures share in exports grew from a tenth of that in imports in 1820-21

to more than the share in imports by 1904-13.

The Irtdustrv Distribution of Trade Relative to Outout     and   EmDloyment

       The share of agriculture in American exports throughout the 19th century

did not reflect the   transformation    that was taking place more generally in the

American economy. In the economy as a whole, agriculture was shrinking in

importance throughout the 19th century. The share of agricultural output in

conventionally defined CDP fell from almost half in 1800 to a third in 1860

(Weiss, 1993). If farm improvement is included in agricultural output and it

and home manufacturing are included in CDP the decline appears more gradual

and concentrated in the period from 1840 to 1860. The general story of the

period, strongly influenced by the assumptions made in calculating GDP, is

that agriculture was already much more dependent on exports than other sectors

of the U.S. economy and that this dependence, as measured by the ratio of

exports to output, increased substantially up to the beginning of the Civil

War.

       After the Civil War, farm gross product in current prices fell from

forty per cent or so of CNP in 1869 to twenty per cent in 1900 and only a

little over fifteen per cent in 1913, when the agricultural share in American

exports was still over half.

       Estimates of the industrial distribution of the U.S. labor force also

show the shift out of agriculture, particularly after 1810 or 1820. The

contrast between the stability of agriculture's share in exports and the

decline in agriculture's share of the labor force is not quite as Strong in

Weiss' (1992) estimates -    the   agricultural share fell from 74 per cent in 1800

to 56 per cent in 1860      as in those of Lebergott (1966) and David (1967) -   83

per cent to 53 per cent over the same period. All tell a similar story,

however, of a large rise in the ratio of exports per worker in agriculture
                                                                               27

relative to other sectors. Agriculture's share of the labor force continued

to fall in the second half of the century, from a little over half at the

beginning of the Civil War, to forty per cent in 1900 and a little over thirty

per cent by 1910, according to Lebergott (1966). Rapid as the decline in the

agricultural share of the U.S. labor force was from before the Civil War to

the beginning of World War I, the fall was even steeper in some other

countries. For example, in Great Eritain, the largest market by far for U.S.

exports, the share of the labor force in agriculture, forestry, and fishing

fell by more than half between 1861 and 1911 (Mitchell, 1978, p. 61), and the

share of agriculture alone fell by 60 per cent from 1841 to 1901, after a

decline of a third in the previous forty years (Kuznets, 1966, Table 3.2).

      The combination of the falling importance of agriculture in production

and the labor force with its stubbornly high share in exports meant that

American agriculture was becoming increasingly dependent on exporting.

Agricultural exports were about a tenth of agricultural gross income in the

early 1800s, reached more than a fifth and at times almost a quarter in the

late 19th century, and were still close to a fifth through the beginning of

World War I (Table 12).

      Thus the export dependence (exports/output) of the agricultural sector,

always high relative to that of the country as a whole, went from being twice

as high in the early 19th century to three and a half times as high during the

late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

      The United States retained much of its comparative advantage in

agricultural products far into the period of industrialization and far into

the era when the United States was becoming a major industrial power. One

reason for this was that, in contrast to European countries, the United States
                                                                                      28

was increasing its land area even as its population, labor force, and capital

stock were growing. Between 1790 and 1850, the end of the period of growth in

area, the land area of the United States more than tripled. The population

grew more than twice as fast, but the enormous increase in acreage kept the

land/population ratio to less than a doubling. Over some periods, such as

1800 to 1810 or 1820, or 1840 to 1850, the ratio declined (U.S. Bureau of the

Census, 1975, Series A-i to A-5). From 1800 to 1850 the population/land ratio

in the U.S. rose less than that of Europe and Asiatic Russia, despite the far

more rapid population growth rate in the United States.

      Despite the declining importance of agriculture, the second half of the

nineteenth century represented a climax in the development of American

agriculture and the agricultural export trade. Farm productivity and output

per capita grew more rapidly in the second half of the century than in the

first half and the per capita output of agricultural products reached levels

never again attained in later years.

      This rapid growth of farm output involved large expansions in the

farming area of the United States, even after the land area of the United

States itself stopped growing; the land added to farms in the 50 years after

1850 was almost twice the 1850 average. Many of the great increases in farm

production were associated with the migration of production to new areas. In

the first half of the century, cotton production migrated from Georgia and

South Carolina to Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, and Arkansas. After 1850 the

main shift was the migration of grain and meat production from the Atlantic

states and the Ohio Valley to the states vest of the Mississippi.

      These additions to farm acreage involved increases in the U.S. supply of

agricultural products. At the same time, the supply of North American
                                                                               30

agricultural products, as seen from Europe, was increased further by a rapid

decline in freight rates both within the United States and on shipments across

the Atlantic.

      Rapidly increasing U.S. production and falling prices, combined with the

decline of transport costs, enabled American products to drive continental

suppliers out of the British market for grains and meat during the years after

the Civil War. Eventually the same transport-cost developments, as well as

increases in U.S. domestic demand and the development of still newer producing

areas such as Canada, Australia, and Argentina brought about the dethronement

of the United States as the major supplier of agricultural products to Europe.

      One of the countries that felt the impact of U.S. grain exports was

Sweden. As Swedish grain exports declined in the face of American

competition, many Swedish farmers gave up their less productive Swedish land

resources and moved to the United States, especially to Minnesota and

Illinois. There they combined their human capital acquired in Sweden, their

farming skills, with the more productive American land and climate, and thus

added to the U.S. grain supply still further (Blomstrom, Lipsey, and Ohisson).

      The significance of the foreign market was greatest during periods of

rapid expansions in agricultural output. For example, although post-Civil War

agricultural exports ranged between 20 and 25 percent of output, the increase

in agricultural exports was about one third of the increase in output from

1870-1874 to the peak in 1895-1899. Exports absorbed large proportions of

increases in agricultural output when agricultural output was growing most

rapidly. They sustained agricultural prices, which might otherwise have

dropped sharply, given the relatively low domestic elasticity of demand for

most agricultural products. In that way, exports encouraged the flow of
                                                                                      31

resources (both land and settlers) into new agricultural production. The flow

might otherwise have been cut off at an earlier point if large price declines

had made new settlement unattractive.

      The histories of individual commodities contain illustrations of two

somewhat different roles for export markets. One is to supply the initial

impetus for the settlement of new lands and for production of a commodity.

The other is to provide a wider market and a higher demand elasticity, and in

some cases a more efficient scale of production, for goods that are initially

made for local, or domestic, markets. Several products fall into the first of

the categories mentioned - -   those   initially oriented toward the export market

and always mainly dependent on it. Tobacco, for example, was produced largely

for export from an early stage in its development. Over two thirds of the

crop was exported in 1800 and about three quarters in 1810. Cotton was the

epitome of an export crop. 80 percent of the output was exported in the

1830s, when it first reached major importance. Even in the second half of the

nineteenth century, when cotton and tobacco had long since declined in

significance as parts of American agriculture, the proportion of the crops

exported remained over 50 percent.

      Important as cotton and tobacco were, they accounted for only about a

sixth of agricultural output in 1860, and were responsible for less than a

fifth of the growth of agricultural exports between 1860 and 1890, although

they had provided more than 80 percent of the growth in U.S. agricultural

exports between 1800 and 1860. Many of the other agricultural products -          -
even those that were export items -    - fell   into the second class described

above. They began as essentially domestic products but became export goods as

American production developed and became more efficient and as transportation
                                                                                 32

costs fell. The export market was not the main impetus in the     early   stages of

development. The course of the trade/output ratios of some of these other

products, such as grains, was very different from those of cotton and tobacco.

At no time did the grain export ratio reach 50 percent - -   domestic   consumption

was always the main destination of grain output. However, the export market

did, at times, take a large fraction of increases in the output of grains; in

the case of wheat, for example, almost 50 percent of the increase in output

from 1869-1873 to 1894-1898 went into exports.

      For some products, the export/output ratios are deceptive, because the

output is sold to another domestic industry and processed before exporting.

Exports of live animals were almost always a small fraction of farm output,

but the export of meat products accounted for considerable proportions of the

farm sales. In the case of pork products, for example, the rise in exports

was at times over 50 percent of the addition to farm income from hogs,

although exports never accounted for a high proportion of any year's output.

Exports of the animals themselves were negligible.

      Thus the situation for grains and meat products differed from that of

cotton and tobacco, to judge from the lower export/output ratios and the wider

fluctuations in these ratios. There was, probably, a steady increase in

domestic demand with the growth of population and urbanization. Domestic

demand was, however, inelastic. That is, a decline in price would not

have produced a great increase in domestic food consumption; an increase in

output, all thrown on the domestic market, would have caused severe price

declines. Foreign demand, at least in markets in which there were other

suppliers to replace, was much more elastic. The United States could increase

its sales abroad by replacing other foreign suppliers and the American
                                                                                33

agricultural sector did not have to rely on raising the domestic consumption

of foods by lowering prices.

      Changes in supply were irregular, as in the case of cotton, and also

involved large population movements to new farming areas. These population

movements were, however, partly autonomous --   that   is, they were not simply a

response to rising prices. If there had been no foreign market, but only the

domestic market with its inelastic demand, a period of rising supply from new

land settlement, if it would have taken place, would have brought severe price

declines. Thus, the existence of the foreign markets and their openness to

U.S. exports may have been an essential pre-condition for rapid agricultural

expansion.

      Aside from agriculture, primary industries that were important in

exports at the beginning of the nineteenth century, and even more in the

eighteenth century, were forestry and fisheries. Both were declining as

export industries during the first half of the nineteenth century, and the

fisheries had already declined considerably in the final years of the

eighteenth. Products of the sea fell from 16 percent of exports in 1770 to 7

percent in 1803-1810 and 2 percent in 1851-1860; and forest products, which

accounted for 12 percent of the value of exports in 1770 and 1803-1810,

declined to 5 percent in 1851-1860.

      The export/output ratio for forestry was probably above 15 percent in

the early 1800s. In the case of fishing, exports in the 10 or 15 years before

the Civil War appeared to be well over a quarter of the total value of output,

and the ratio must have been higher in earlier years. It might well have been

a third or more, especially for the whale fisheries, in the 1770s. The

importance of export markets thus seems to have been great in a wide range of
                                                                               34

primary products, including those derived from forestry and fishing as well as

farming.

      Even in 1869, before the peak in farm exports, the export ratio for

agriculture was more than twice as great as the ratio for manufacturing. The

few manufactured products that were exported reflected the richness of

American resources, rather than American capabilities in processing them. The

export ratio was inflated by the figure for food products, mainly grain and

meat products, in which a high fraction of the value entering the final cost,

over 80 percent, had been added in agriculture rather than in manufacturing.

      The petroleum and coal products group, also highly dependent on a

resource base, was the only manufacturing industry in which exports played a

large role in the early stages of development. Exports accounted for more

than half of output in 1869 and 1879, and the share remained above one quarter

through 1914. In no other manufacturing industry, even those such as foods

which were close to the primary production stage, did the ratios ever go above

15 percent. In 1869, 14 out of 18 manufacturing industries showed export

ratios below 4 percent, and 10 out of 18 ratios were below 2 percent.

      The dominance of export trade as a factor in U.S. growth was confined to

agriculture and other primary industries. Within agriculture, exports played

a major role in two different ways. In some products, particularly in the

early decades, the foreign market was the main outlet and the main stimulus to

the flow of resources and the growth of production. In others, especially in

the second half of the nineteenth century, the foreign market eased the path

of rapid growth in output by cushioning the effect of increased supply on

price, an effect which we might expect to have been large in view of the

presumably low price elasticities of domestic demand for agricultural
                                                                                    35

 products.

       Another indicator of the trend in American comparative advantage is

provided by sectoral export/output ratios, available only from 1869 on.

While the trends are not very strong, they do differ in direction. The export

ratio in agriculture reached a peak in 1879 and then mainly declined (Table

13). The ratio in resource-oriented manufacturing also reached its peak in

1879, while for other manufactured goods, the export ratio showed an upward

trend, if any.

Thus, in both agriculture and resource-oriented manufacturing industries, for

which export trade was relatively important -      over    ten per cent of production

at times -   the   importance of export markets was declining. Resources were

becoming less of a basis for American exports. In other manufacturing

industries, on the other hand, for which the resource base was less important,
                                                                              36

exports rose as a per cent of production. That was particularly notable in

metal products, machinery, and transport equipment (Table 14).

      On the import side, the opposite changes were taking place. The shares

of imports in domestic consumption were declining sharply for manufacturing as

a whole and for almost every manufacturing group, the main exception being

forest products (Table 15).

   The import share of goods consumed generally increased for the resource

industries, agriculture, fishing, and mining. In manufacturing, imports

provided sharply decreasing shares of most products. Thus the import data

give clear indications of the shift in American comparative advantage toward

manufacturing and away from natural resource products.



The Commodity Composition of tJ.S. Trade in Relation to World Trade

         The changes in U.S. comparative advantage after the Civil War can be

illustrated by the comparison of the composition of U.S. exports with that of

world exports. The U.S. share of world exports of primary products fluctuated

over a fairly narrow range from the l870s through the first years of the

twentieth century and only fell somewhat in the decade or so before World War

I (Table 16). The U.S. share of world manufactured exports remained at about

4 per cent through the 1880s and then rose rapidly. Thus the shift in

comparative advantage on the export side took place only at the end of the

century despite the large shifts in U.S. production and employment mentioned

above.

         Another way of seeing this change is by comparing the composition of

U.S. exports with that of world exports. The world ratio of manufactured

product to primary product exports was quite stable at around sixty percent

from the late 1870s through 1913. The U.S. ratio was far lower, reflecting

the U.S.comparative advantage as a primary product exporter, remaining at

about sixteen to eighteen per cent from the l870s through the early l890s.

Then, in the next twenty years, it rose to forty per cent, as the shift in

production and employment from primary products to manufacturing finally began

to be reflected in the composition of U.S. exports.

                              THE DIRECTION OF U.S. TRADE


Changes in the      Destination   of Exvorts and the Origin of Imoorts

         American exports were directed mainly to Europe from the country's

earliest days, and almost all that did not go to Europe were shipped to

European colonies in the West Indies (Table 17). Since much of the trade

pattern in these years reflected the effects of the Napoleonic Wars and the

British blockade of Europe, some of the West Indies trade may have been

disguised trade with Europe or a temporary substitute for European trade.

         The concentration of American exports on Europe increased over most of

the 19th century, despite the growth of the industrial economy of the U.S.

That growth was presumably giving the United States the capability of being

more of a competitor to Europe in manufacturing, and less of a supplier of raw

materials and foods, but the increasing focus on Europe as a market lasted

through the l880s, and was only sharply reversed after the l89Os. The same

was true for the role of the U.K., which grew as a destination of U.S. exports

from less than a quarter at the beginning of the 18th century. despite the

ties of language and tradition, to over half in the l870s and 1880s before

falling back rather steeply after 1900. Some of the former UK share went to

Germany    in   the late 19th century and some of it went to the Western

Hemisphere, as U.S. exports began shifting to less developed areas of the

world.

         Europe was about as important as a source of imports as it was as a

destination for exports in the early decades of the 19th century (Table 18).

However, for imports the trend in the European share was steadily downward,

from two thirds or so to about half before World War I. The decline in the

British share, and also in        the   French share, was steeper, while the German

share of U.S. imports doubled. The other areas increasing in importance as

sources of imports were Canada and Asia.

      The underlying causes of these shifts were changes in foreign supply and

demand, arising from the growth of population and production in other

countries, and changes in American supply and demand arising from U.S. growth

and the changing structure of production.

      The share of American exports going to Europe was not very different

from the share of Europe's own exports other than to North America, going to

Europe (intra-European trade) during much of the 19th century, despite the

extra cost of ocean transport for shipping goods from the U.S. (Table 19).

The similarity in export destinations, despite the differences in the stage of

development between Europe and the U.S., suggests that these shares were

determined mainly by the weight of Europe as a market.
                                                                               43

      On the import side, the story was different; Europe remained the source

of close to three quarters of Europe's imports other than those from North

America throughout the century, but Europe declined as a source of U.S.

imports after the mid-century. Either the weight of Europe as a producer was

falling or U.S. demand was shifting away from the mix of products suited to

Europe's comparative advantage as American manufacturing industries developed

and their products supplanted imported manufactures in the U.S. market. The

stability of Europe's share of U.S. exports, at least until the 1890s or

later, is linked to the stability of agriculture's share of U.S. exports, up

to the 1880s or 1990s. Both reflect the decline of European agriculture and

the continued American comparative advantage in agricultural products. The

decline in Europe's share of U.S. imports is linked with the falling share of

finished manufactures in U.S. imports, discussed earlier.

      One way to judge the closeness of trade relations is to take account of

the sizes of destination countries, by population, for example. Canada, which

never accounted for a noticeable share of total U.S. exports, can be seen from

the U.S. exports per capita to be much more closely tied to the U.S. by trade

than many larger countries (Table 20). By this criterion of trade

"intensity", both income per capita in the importing country and a common

language appears to be important positive influences, to judge by the high

trade intensity with distant Australia and the intensity of trade with the UK

relative to Germany and France.

      On the import side, the intensity of trade, as measured now by U.S.

imports per capita of origin country population, with U.K. — 100, was

especially high with Canada, to a much greater degree than for export (Table

Mexico, Brazil, and Germany all exported more to the U.S. per person in the

source country than did Australia, despite the common language. Propinquity,

for Mexico and Canada, and the nature of each country's comparative advantage

seemed to be more important in determining the sources of imports than were

language or per capita income.

                        TRENDS IN THE U. S. TERMS OF TRADE


Aggregate National Terms of Trade
      The ratio of export to import prices, or terms   of trade of a country
(sometimes referred to as the "net barter terms of trade") measures changes in
the purchasing power of exports: the quantity of imports purchased by each

unit of export production. A rise in the terms of trade is often viewed as a

favorable development for a country, and referred to as an "improvement" in

the terms of trade, although that interpretation is questionable at times. If

a rise is the consequence of increasing demands for the country's export

products, the effect on real income is favorable. However, if it is the

consequence of a rise in costs relative to other countries, it is an

unfavorable development, representing a decline in the country's ability to

compete in international markets. That is true whether the rise in costs is

the result of inflation or of productivity growth that is slower than in other

countries.

      It   is widely believed that countries depending on primary products for

export revenue tend to suffer declining terms of trade in the long run.

Several reasons have been suggested as to why such a decline is to be

expected. One is that price elasticities of demand for agricultural products

are low. Increases in world production are not easily absorbed by gains in

consumption and therefore result in relatively large price declines.

Furthermore, income elasticities of demand for food are low; a rise in income

leads to a less than proportional rise in food consumption. Food prices

therefore are not lifted by increases in world income. In addition, it is

said that agricultural products are sold in competitive markets and there is

little opportunity for producers to exercise monopoly power to raise prices.
                                                                                     46

In contrast, manufactured products are said to be subject to higher demand and

income elasticities and to the raising of their prices through monopolistic

market practices.

     Data on the terms of trade of the United States span a period of over

100 years, covering the metamorphosis from a primitive economy exporting

almost entirely primary products to an industrial power with one of the

worlds highest income levels. On the whole, the picture is one of long-term

improvement in the terms of trade - -    perhaps    an increase of two-thirds from

the founding of the country to World War I (Table 22). The greatest gains

took place before the Civil War, when the United States was almost entirely an

little, if at all. Within the nineteenth century history of the United

States, therefore, there is no evidence that being an agricultural exporter

led to an unfavorable evolution of the net barter terms of trade.



Sectoral Price Trends

      Classical economic thought contained strong predictions about the long-

term trends of the relative prices of agricultural and other primary products

relative to manufactured goods. The classical view, starting at least as far

back as Robert Torrens, continued by John Stuart Mill, and reinforced by

Jevons' alarm at the exhaustion of British coal resources, was that a...    the
exchange value of manufactured articles, compared with the products of

agriculture and of mines, have, as population and industry advance, a certain

and decided tendency to fall."1 The opposite view was suggested from a

reading of the factual record by Hilgerdt in a 1945 League of Nations report

and was later promoted in a series of United Nations documents and articles,

particularly by Raoul Prebisch and Hans Singer. That view was that primary

goods prices had been declining secularly, and attributed the decline to low

price and income elasticities for food, declining demand arising from the

replacement of natural raw materials by synthetic materials, and monopolistic

or oligopolistic pricing practices of manufacturing firms in developed

countries that prevented buyers of manufactured exports from reaping the gains

from productivity improvements in manufacturing.

      The United States in the 19th century was a good laboratory in which to

II, Book IV, Chapter 2, p. 282

test these theories because the record of the aggregate terms of trade goes

back to the period when agriculture was predominant and extends through the

transformation to an industrial economy, and the record of agricultural and

manufacturing prices and productivity also reaches to earlier stages of

development than for most other countries.

      Within U.S. exports, the price index for agricultural products,

dominated by exports of cotton, was so volatile that it is hard to see a

trend, but there were clearly large declines in prices of both agricultural

and manufactured products between 1815-20 and 1830 or the 1830s as a whole.

Since the export prices of manufactures did not fall as fast as agricultural

export prices, the relative export prices of manufactures increased (Table

23). From the 1830s to the 1850s changes in relative prices were fairly

small, not surprisingly in view of the fact that cotton and tobacco were very

heavily weighted in the agricultural export price and cotton and tobacco

manufactures accounted for 70 to 80 per cent of the weight in the manufactured

goods price index. After 1879, there was a considerable decline in the price

of manufactured exports relative to prices of agricultural exports, a movement

that accorded with the classical expectations and contradicted the Prebisch-

Singer view.

      The basis for the classical belief that manufactured goods prices would

fall in the long run was the conviction that productivity would grow more

rapidly in manufacturing than in agriculture. That part of the prediction

seems to have been correct, both before and after the Civil War. From 1879 to

the beginning of World War I, manufacturing productivity rose more rapidly

than agricultural productivity, and manufactured goods export prices fell

relative to agricultural export prices (Table 23). The relative productivity

change accounted for about sixty per cent of the relative export price change.

      In the twenty years before the Civil War, a similar relative growth in

manufacturing productivity did not have any counterpart in export price

developments; the export price ratio for manufactured goods rlative to

agricultural products was quite stable. In the earlier period also, from

1815-20 to 1839-40 there was little change in the export price ratio. In this

earlier period too, a comparison of Sokoloff's (1986) productivity measures

for selected manufacturing industries with the Towne and Rasmussen (1960)

productivity measures for agriculture suggests that manufacturing productivity

was growing much faster than agricultural productivity.

     There are several possible reasons why the productivity and price ratios

do not match before 1860. After 1830, North's (1961 Appendix II, Table IV)

export price index is dominated by cotton manufactures and to a much smaller

extent, tobacco manufactures, both of which enjoyed productivity growth more

rapid than that in agriculture (tobacco manufactures only after 1850,

according to Sokoloff). However, both industries' outputs included large

elements of agricultural input and that may explain why North's manufactures

price index rises by an amount identical to that of the raw material price

index, dominated by cotton and tobacco.

     Before 1830, the products in North's manufactures price index do not

match Sokoloff's list well, the largest item in the price index being soap,

not included by Sokoloff, and the second being tobacco manufactures, which not

only include a large agricultural input content but also did not enjoy rapid

productivity gains before 1850.

      The price and productivity movements of the post-Civil War period reveal

the changes in the rewards to the factors of production in the two sectors.
                                                                               51

Just as the agricultural export price indicates the money return per unit of

agricultural commodities sold, the ratio of the agricultural to the

manufacturing price is one measure of the purchasing power of these

agricultural commodities, assuming that manufactured exports are

representative of U.S. manufacturing production in general. The product of

the relative price and the agricultural productivity index indicates the

course of returns to factors of production, or inputs, in agriculture: the

purchasing power over manufactures of an hour of agricultural labor or a unit

of capital employed in agriculture.

      Agricultural factors of production did very well indeed after the 1890s,

by this measure (Table 24). Productivity in manufacturing increased much

faster than in agriculture. Agricultural export prices rose rapidly, much

faster than prices of manufactured goods. The purchasing power of

agricultural factors over manufactured goods grew at a fast pace while the

purchasing power of manufacturing factors of production over agricultural

products actually fell. The gains from growing productivity in manufacturing

went largely to agricultural factors of production and, of course to foreign

purchasers of U.S. manufacturing exports.

The Navigation Acts

      Most of what we have described here as the development of American trade

in the nineteenth century could be thought of as being outside the realms of

both chance events or conscious policy. We have attributed trade developments

mainly to income levels, productivity changes, factor endowments and changes

in endowments. One possible exception to the unimportance of government

policies is the influence of the Navigation Acts on the trade pattern of the

American colonies, the pattern with which the country began its existence.

      The British government in the colonial period was no believer in leaving

trade to the operation of the invisible hand. As Adam Smith described the

exemptions from the Navigation Laws, their purpose was to exploit the

incentives provided by access to foreign markets to encourage the cultivation

of grain, the clearing and use of forests, and the raising of cattle beyond

what would otherwise be feasible in •'...   a thinly populated country." The key

to the success of the policy was the fact that access to "extensive markets"

would cause the prices of these products to be high, as they would not be in a

country cut off from trade. These high prices would encourage the extension

of cultivation and improvement of the breed of cattle.

      The other side of the Navigation Acts, and their main purpose, was to

give home (British) purchasers of some colonial raw materials a monopoly on

the output of the colonies, to keep prices low, and to severely restrict the

growth in the colonies of manufacturing industries that might compete with

British sellers.

      The initial pattern of colonial trade fit well with these plans, since

the exports were so largely crude materials and foods and imports were mainly

manufactured products. However, the same pattern could be explained by the

factor proportions and technological backwardness of the colonies. The fact

that the evolution of the pattern of trade after independence was gradual, and

the fact that the United States moved toward greater concentration on trade

with the U.K. after independence, when the earlier restrictions were absent,

suggest that economic forces, rather than the Navigation Acts were the main

determinants of both the commodity and country patterns of U.S. trade.
                                                                                54

      A similar conclusion, minimizing the effects of British imperial policy

on the welfare of the colonies and on the nature of their economies was

arrived at by North (1974). He dismissed restrictions on manufacturing as

inconsequential, given the colonies' factor proportions, which did not point

to any comparative advantage in that field. That view was shared by many

contemporary observers. For example, Benjamin Franklin (quoted in Callender

1909, pp. 35 and 36), "...while there is land enough in America for people,

there can never be manufactures of any amount of value.. .the colonies are so

little suited for establishing of manufacture, that they are continually

losing the few branches they accidentally gain. There was a burden placed on

American producers of tobacco, particularly, as measured by the difference

between prices received and those available outside the U.K. And there were

also burdens on consumers in the colonies from the artificially inflated

prices of goods imported from other European countries. However, they were

counterbalanced, to a considerable degree, by the advantages of British

military protection (North, 1974, pp. 54-55).

      North's analysis, treating 1785-1793 as the norm representing the

situation without British restrictions, implies that if there were any effects

from the restrictions they were short-lived and did not deflect the United

States from its long-term growth path.



The Napoleonic Wars ad the Trade Embargo

      There is no doubt that the Napoleonic Wars and the accompanying trade

embargo before the War of 1812 provided both great opportunities for trade and

shipping, as is described in the earlier quotation from Callender, and also

large negative shocks to the young U.S. economy. It is harder to say whether
                                                                                 55

any of the effects were permanent, in the sense that the U.S. gained new

industries that survived successfully after the period, or gained or lost

footholds in world markets.

       Most of the analyses of this period have focussed on the immediate

advantages of American neutrality at a time when almost all potential rivals

were swept from the trade scene. North describes the years 1793 through 1807

as "extraordinarily prosperous ones. .   . a a characterization confirmed by

"...nuuierous literary descriptions..." (p. 72). The prosperity came from

shipping earnings (which on net balance grew from $5 - 8 billion to $38 - 40

billion), and from increases in export prices and terms of trade.

       Once the embargo on trade began in 1808 and especially with the entry of

the U.S. into the war in 1812, these gains were reversed. Shipping earnings

and exports fell drastically and the terms of trade turned against the United

States. The embargo did have some effect in promoting manufacturing in the

United States, but the path of development did not match American comparative

advantage at the time, according to North, and the artificially induced

industrialization quickly withered under postwar competition. Thus the net

balance of the war period, despite the prosperity of its early stages, does

not seem to have propelled American economic development in any substantial

way.

       A later review of even the prosperous part of the Napoleonic War period

by Coldin and Lewis (1980) attempted to deflate the "legendary importance" of

the neutrality period by estimating effects on the rate of growth of per

capita income. The estimated gains, while perhaps not of legendary

dimensions, were substantial --   increases   in the annual growth rate of per

capita income of something between 30 and 40 per cent. Although the authors
                                                                                   56

refer to these income gains as not dramatic they do suggest that there were

more permanent gains to development -   - the   growth of port cities and inland

towns, additions to shipping tonnage, and the spread of banking and of

commercialization in general.



The Civil War

      The Civil War was the bloodiest of American history, was fought entirely

on American Soil, and divided the country on economic lines to a large extent.

Despite these factors, there has always been some belief that the northern

states experienced economic gains from the war. However, North (1966, p. 149)

judged that the war ". . .was not a major impetus to accelerated industrial

growth..." and presumably was not a major setback either. The basis for the

statement was that the acceleration of industrial growth and the development

of manufacturing had taken place before the war. Gailman (1972) pointed to

the heavy manpower losses during the war, the decrease in immigration, and the

smallness of the industrial requirements of the military •forces in that

period. What the Civil War did do was to alter the relation between the

northern and southern states, greatly reducing the per capita income level of

the South, and widening the income differential between the South and other

areas. There was also a major shift in the balance of political power that

was relevant to trade policy, since the southern states, more dependent on

exports and more oriented to free trade, lost to the northern states, which

were more import dependent and more favorable to protectionist legislation.

      The negative effects of the war on the United States as a whole are

reflected in the earlier description of U.S. shares in world trade, which fell

between 1860 and 1870 in an unusual interruption of the long-term upward
                                                                               57

trend. The net indebtedness of the U.S. tripled between the beginning of the

war and the end.

      The distribution of exports did not change in a way that would suggest

that the war violently altered the American industrial structure. The share

of finished manufactures grew, but not to a degree that suggested a major

break in the upward trend. The share of cotton exports declined, but no

faster than it did between the 1830s and 1840s, and less than from the 1870s

to the l880s.

      On the whole, the Civil War appears more as an interruption to the

changes in the composition of production and exports that were taking place

than as a spur to them.



Effects of Tariff Policy

      The extent to which protectionist legislation promoted manufacturing

industry by restricting foreign competition in the U.S. market has been a

perennial subject for dispute. North (1966) mentions the possibility that the

Tariff Acts of 1816, 1824, and 1828 helped revive some parts of the textile

industry after the 1808 embargo and the War of 1812 severely damaged the

industry, but suggests that by 1830 the industry, having become a net

exporter, had no need for protection. He also suggested that the iron

industry, so regulated by the British Navigation Laws,2 was protected by the

high transport cost of its products.

      The era after the Civil War is sometimes cited as a period in which the



     2 While Great Britain encourages in America the manufacture of pig and
bar iron, by exempting them from duties.., she imposes an absolute prohibition
upon the erection of steel furnaces and slit-mills in any of her American
plantations." Smith (1776), Book 4, Chapter 7.
                                                                                58

United States used high tariffs successfully to encourage infant industries

that eventually became giants. In 1869, imports were 14 per cent of the

consumption of manufactured goods, and by 1909 that ratio had fallen to 6 per

cent. In every manufacturing industry in which the import share was 10 per

cent or more in 1869, that share fell to half or less in 1909. The iron and

steel industry was an extreme case, with imports falling from 12 to about 1½

per cent. These declines suggest that some of the rapid growth in U.S.

manufacturing involved import substitution: the replacement of imports by

domestic production. That was obviously the case for shares of the market,

but there were also a couple of examples of import substitution in the

absolute sense, with declines in the amount of imports in an industry.

      Two cases of import substitution in this absolute sense stand out in the

nineteenth century, and both involve industries in which protection was

increased. One was the large fall in imports of textiles before the Civil

War. In this case the domestic industry had expanded under the embargo, which

was, in effect, a prohibitive tariff, although it was never put in those

terms. Taussig (1931) concluded that the embargo itself, rather than the

tariffs adopted to preserve the industry, provided the main impetus to growth.

      Imports of iron and steel also fell between 1879 and 1899, in a period

when domestic consumption of these products more than doubled. Since the

decline in imports was insignificant relative to the growth of production, it

cannot have been the main impetus to such growth. Most appraisals of the

history of the industry have concluded that, while protection and the decline

of imports may have hastened the growth of some elements of the industry,

particularly tin plate, they were not the major influence in the long run for

the industry as a whole (Taussig, 1931; Teinin, 1964).
                                                                                59

      A study of the tariff on pig iron (Baack and Ray, 1974) concluded that

the tariff on that product did raise the level of domestic production. Part

of that effect was through the impact on the quality of imports. Since the

tariff on pig iron was a specific duty, framed in terms of dollars per ton, it

weighed much more heavily on cheap grades of pig iron than on expensive

grades. The result was a decline in imports of low quality pig iron, and

encouragement to domestic production at the low end of the quality scale.

      In general, the historical studies of protection have attempted to learn

whether protection was successful, in the sense of encouraging the production

of the protected item. They do not, however answer the more important policy

question as to whether the growth and welfare of the country was enhanced,

rather than only that of the protected industries and the factors of

production employed in them.



                        TRADE AND U.S. ECONOMIC GROWTH


      The United States, through much of its history, has been pointed to as a

country for which international trade was unimportant. At least it was a

country that, until recently, considered international trade unimportant, gave

little thought to it in policy making, and in which most branches of economics

were taught as if the country were isolated from the rest of the world. One

reason was the relatively low and, at times declining ratio of U.S. trade to

U.S. output described earlier.

      These low ratios have affected the recurrent debate about the importance

of trade for U.S. economic growth, particularly growth in the 19th century. A

relatively modest role for international trade was assigned by Kravis (1972),

partly on the argument that trade was too unimportant, in terms of its share
                                                                                  60

of total output, to account for much of the growth in GNP or GNP per capita.

A view of the economy as governed by some type of economy-wide production

function in which inputs of factors of production lead to predictable outputs

of product tends to find little room for any influence of trade. Output

growth is assigned as far as possible to growth in the amounts of inputs or in

their quality, to technological progress, and often to some unexplainable

residual. What is missing from these analyses is the question of why the

inputs of resources grew at the rate they did, and the role played not only by

the actual exports and imports, but also by the broader trading

circumstances -   - the   existence of markets and the ability of producers and

traders to have access to them.

      The view that assigns a more crucial level to trade, and to the growth

of foreign demand, has been associated with the work of Douglass North on U.S.

economic growth. North described the role of growth in foreign demand for

cotton in leading to the westward expansion of cotton farming and, in its

wake, more general expansions in settlement and cultivation.

      A review of these controversies by Jeffrey Williamson shifted the

emphasis to a more general influence of trade: the existence of foreign

demand, rather than its growth, and the likelihood, or almost certainty, that

the price elasticity of demand in foreign markets was higher than that in the

domestic market - -   probably   much higher. That high elasticity meant that

rapid expansions of production, such as from the spread of cultivation to new

areas, could take place without causing drastic reductions in the prices

received by producers. Without the highly elastic demand of the foreign

market, expansions of production would quickly face the effects of the low

domestic demand elasticities, prices would fall quickly, and the expansion
                                                                               61

would be cut off. It is not implied that the elasticity of foreign demand for

a product as a whole was necessarily different from that in the U.S. The

higher foreign elasticity of demand for an American export arose from the fact

that it was, typically, a much smaller element of foreign supply than of

American supply. Therefore the American export could substitute for foreign

exports or local production of the same product. If there were efficiencies

to be gained from concentrating an expansion in production in a short period,

they might well be lost if trade were cut off or reduced.

      A corollary of this effect of the international market is that the ratio

of exports to production should increase when production grows most rapidly.

As described earlier, that was the case for cotton production in the United

States, and it was also true of the surges in middle-western grain and meat

production in the second half of the nineteenth century. Thus the

existence of a high-elasticity market, in combination with the factors that

initiated the surges in production, may have been crucial to the westward

expansion of the country.

      On a more speculative note, one might consider that the advice now being

given to most developing countries urges policies that are outward- rather

than inward-oriented, and favor neutrality or export promotion over import

substitution. Since many currently developing countries are much smaller than

the U.S. was during the early stages of its industrialization, the trade

orientation may be more necessary than it was for a large, continental,

developing country such as the U.S. already was during most of the century.

On the other hand, an outward-oriented trade policy that encourages trade may

have ramifications for many other aspects of government policy. It may affect

investment, competition, monetary, and fiscal policies. It may affect the
                                                                            62

choice of industries by investors, and the productivity of domestic producers.

These broader influences could go far beyond what is suggested by the amounts

of goods actually traded.
