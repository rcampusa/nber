This paper evaluates the impact of international reserves, terms of trade shocks and capital flows on
the real exchange rate (REER). We observe that international reserves cushions the impact of TOT
shocks on the REER, and that this effect is important for developing but not for industrial countries.
This buffer effect is especially significant for Asian countries, and for countries exporting natural
resources. Financial depth reduces the buffer role of IR in developing countries. Developing countries
REER seem to be more sensitive to changes in reserve assets; whereas industrial countries display
a significant relationship between hot money and REER.

        This note evaluates how international reserves hoarding and economic structure affect the real
exchange rate (REER) and its adjustment to inflows of capital, terms of trade shocks, and other
shocks. We compare the REER patterns between developing and the OECD countries.1 The
background of our study is the presumption that volatility induces first order adverse effects on the
economic performance of developing countries.2 Recently, Aghion et al. (2006) found that REER
volatility reduces growth for countries with relatively low levels of financial development; hence
factors mitigating REER volatility may be associated with superior economic performance. Other
studies have unraveled the fact that TOT improvement leads to REER appreciation through the
income effect.3 For most developing countries, terms of trade shocks are the most important source of
exogenous volatility. Developing countries are exposed to TOT volatility that is 3 times the volatility
of industrial countries, resulting in income shocks that are 3.5 times as volatile as those affecting
industrial countries [see IDB (1995) and Hausmann et al. (2006)]. Dealing with TOT volatility is a
challenge for natural resources exporters, exposed to TOT volatility that is 3 times the volatility of
manufacturing countries.4 TOT shocks impose a daunting challenge for developing countries.
Shallow domestic financial systems, relatively small size, and the lack of sectoral diversification in
most developing countries limit their ability to mitigate TOT shocks by internal adjustment.
Sovereign risk and the lack of proper financial instruments inhibit the ability to hedge against these
shocks by relying on the global financial system (see Caballero (2003)). Developing countries are
left with self-insurance as a last resort option of dealing with TOT shocks.
        Our study examines the degree to which international reserves mitigate the impact of terms of
trade (TOT) shocks on the REER. We find that this effect is important for developing countries,
especially important for Asian countries, and for countries exporting natural resources, but not for
industrial ones. We also confirm that financial depth is a key element in determining the degree of
mitigation offered by international liquidity. The overall results are robust to adding controls like
capital flows, exchange rate management and monetary policy, trade and financial openness.

1. Effective TOT shocks and REER adjustment – the shock absorbing role of international reserves

        We start the analysis by testing the extent to which international reserves mitigate the impact
of terms of trade shock on the REER. The empirical analysis covers 1970 to 2004, 60 developing
economies and 20 industrialized economies.5

        As a benchmark, we adopt a panel regression methodology:

        (1)      ln( REERit ) = a1,i + α1 (TO * ln(TOT )) it + α 2 ({TO * ln(TOT )} * RES ) it + ε it ;

where the independent variable is the natural log of the real effective exchange rate (REER), defined
such that higher REER indicates real appreciation (see Appendix A for definitions), TO * ln(TOT ) is
                                                                                 IM + EXP

log of the terms to trade, ln(TOT ) , and RES = ln[1 +                              ] a proxy for the
                                                                      GDP
International reserves/GDP rate. Buffering effects of international reserves would be captured by
α 2 < 0 . The mitigation of TOT shocks may stem from reducing the magnitude of the REER
adjustment triggered by capital flows; thus, minimizing the odds that capital flight may end up with a
full blown financial crisis, potentially triggered by balance sheet effects associated with nominal and
REERs depreciations [see Calvo et .al (2004) and Mendoza (2005) for further discussion of these
balance sheet effects]. Equation (1) is also consistent with the predicted patterns of financial
intermediation and the real exchange rate in a collateral dependent open economy, extending the
framework in Aizenman and Lee (2006) to a two sector model [see Appendix A].
        A concern regarding regression (1) is the possibility of a unit root in the real effective
exchange rate. The results of individual tests on REER series portraying these series as I(1) processes
could be due to low power in those tests. We work around this problem using the panel unit root test
developed by Levin, Lin and Chu (2002).6 Although we rejected the unit root hypothesis for the

         See Appendix B for the exact list of countries include in each category.
6
         The test assumes that each individual unit in the panel shares the same AR(1) coefficient, but allows
for individual effects, time effects and possibly a time trend. By introducing a series of lags, the test may be
viewed as a pooled Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF), with the null hypothesis of nonstationarity (I(1))
behavior. See Taylor & Sarno (1998) and Calderon (2002) for other references to the stationarity of pooled
REER series.

REER, we found high persistence: an autoregressive coefficient of about 0.84, but well below 1 (see
Table B7, Appendix B).
            The specification of regression (1) follows the observation that the effective terms of trade
shock, d ln(TOT ) * TO , is a first order approximation of the income effect associated with the terms
of trade improvement rate, d ln(TOT ) , where the income effect is defined as the GDP rate of change
induced by the shock.7 By design, (1) implies that the elasticity of the REER with respect to effective
terms of trade shocks is

                        d ln( REER)
            (2)                        = α1 + α 2 * RES
                       TO * d ln(TOT )


Hence, regression (1) provides information about the degree to which hoarding international reserves
may impact REER dynamics induced by terms of trade shocks. Table 1 reports the regression results
for 1970-2004. Column (1) presents the baseline regression pooling all countries, subject to data
availability. The elasticity of the REER with respect to the effective terms of trade shock is well
above one: a one percent improvement of the effective terms of trade induces a REER appreciation of
about 1.8 percent. 8

         I.e., for small terms of trade shocks, ΔGDP / GDP ≅ TO * Δ ln(TOT ) .

         See Appendix G, Table G1, for regressions of the REER on the effective TOT and International
reserves in the absence of interaction terms. For developing countries, the elasticity of the REER with respect
to the effective TOT is well above one, whereas the elasticity of the REER with respect to the stock of IR/GDP
is well below minus one – higher stock of IR/GDP is associated, on average, with depreciated REER.
                                                             4


         Column (1), Table 1 implies that d ln( REER) /[TO * d ln(TOT )] ≅ 1.8[1 − 2 * RES ] ; that is,
international reserves hoarding lessens the elasticity of the REER with respect to the effective TOT
by more than twice the International reserves/GDP. Hence, for a country with trade openness of
0.25, and IR/GDP ratio of 0.1, the elasticity of the REER with respect to the TOT is .25*1.8(1-2*0.1)
= 0.36. This is in line with De Gregorio and Wolf (1994), who found that the elasticity of the REER
with respect to TOT, unconditional of the RES position, is about 0.4 for a sample of OECD countries.
Table 2 summarizes the elasticity of the REER with respect to both the effective and the regular
TOT. Developing countries, especially emerging Asia, and commodity exporters have been
significantly more exposed to changes in the terms of trade. Increasing the stock of reserves in each
of these countries could reduce this vulnerability to external shocks, smoothing the reactions of their
REERs to terms of trade changes.

All means are calculated over the same sample period as in the equations displayed in table 1. These elasticities are
calculated based on the average holding of international reserves and average trade openness for each sub group.


         Columns (2) and (3) in Table 1 show that aggregation matters – the mitigation effects
associated with international reserves applies to developing, but not to Industrial countries. This is
consistent with the notion that limited development of the capital market in Developing countries
hampers their ability to mitigate the volatility associated with shocks. Economic structure matters
greatly – exports of natural resources magnify the impact of the effective terms of trade shocks and
the mitigation associated with international reserves by a factor exceeding 2. Interestingly, this
mitigation effect is insignificant for that group, yet we will show later that it is significant for the
lagged effective TOT shock. In contrast, these interactions are insignificant for manufacturing
intense countries. The last two columns focus specifically on Latin America and Asia; effective TOT
shocks induce large effects in both blocks. International reserves provide a powerful mitigation of
effective TOT shocks in Asian countries, but not in LATAM.
                                                        5

       Table B.8 in the Appendix supports the robustness of prior results, evaluating the adjustment
to the one year lagged effective terms of trade shock on the contemporaneous REER:


       (1’)    ln( REERit ) = a1,i + α1 (TO *ln(TOT ))it −1 + α 2 (TO *ln(TOT ) * RES )it −1 + ε it


The signs are identical to Table 1, the main difference being that shocks are apparently absorbed
faster in LATAM and Asia, where most of the coefficients on the lagged shocks are insignificant for
these blocks. Tables C.2 and C.3 in Appendix C report country specific results. The above suggests
that the volatility of the real effective exchange rate would be mitigated by higher levels of
international reserves. We validate this conjecture in our data [see Appendix F]. For further
reference to previous studies looking at this relationship see Hviding, Nowak, and Ricci (2004).
       To verify robustness, Table C.1 in Appendix C reports distinct specifications of regressions
(1) and (1’) for subsets of countries. The regularities uncovered in these regressions include:

•   Reserves play a role in the mitigation of TOT shocks only in Developing countries. This
    mitigation role is not displayed in Industrial countries under any specification.
•   REERs in countries that specialize in exports of manufactures are inelastic to changes in their
    terms of trade. No role for reserves as shock absorber for this subgroup.
•   Commodity exporters display a very elastic REER against changes in the terms of trade. This role
    is consistently more significant for lagged values of TOT.
•   REERs in Latin American emerging economies are remarkably independent from changes in the
    TOT, and reserves do not seem to function as shock absorbers for those economies. Exceptions
    are Argentina, Chile or Ecuador (see table C.2 in the appendix).
•   For Asian emerging markets, TOT changes clearly have an impact on their REER, and reserves
    play a central role moderating the effects of changes in the TOT.

Appendix C submits our initial findings to a series of controls. We show that the transmission of
effective terms of trade shocks into the REER and the buffer role of foreign liquid assets is
augmented by greater flexibility of exchange rate regimes. REER seems to be more sensitive and
reserves play a more prominent role after negative effective TOT shocks. Although we do not find a
significant change in the slope of the interaction between effective TOT and Reserves for all
                                                    6

developing countries after the 1997 Asian Crisis, we find that in Latin American economies and
Commodity exporting countries, reserves play a bigger mitigation role after 1997.

       Faced by changes in their terms of trade, we expect that countries with deep financial markets
will be able to internally self-adjust in a more effective manner than those with shallow markets. To
verify, we introduce the interaction of our reserve mitigation term [TO*ln(TOT)*RES] with a
measure of financial depth represented by the M2 money aggregate deflated by GDP (see Appendix
D).9 Financial depth significantly decreases the role of reserves as shock absorber for our global
sample of developing economies. This effect seems to be insignificant for Latin America,
industrialized economies, commodities and manufacture exporters. Interestingly, Asian economies
seem to be extremely sensitive to both the mitigation effect of reserves and the role of financial
development in the domestic market. The same regression holds for lagged values of terms of trade,
reserves and liquid liabilities. Although the role of financial development seems to die faster than that
of reserves for all emerging markets, the results are quite robust, especially for Asian economies,
where both effects (that is, reserves as shock absorber and the corresponding mitigation of this role
through financial depth) remain highly significant.

       To verify robustness, we estimate the REER adjustment in four ways [see Appendix E]: Panel
with Country Effects, Country Effects on De-trended Real Effective Exchange Rate, Time and
Country Effects on Log of Real Effective Exchange Rate, and Country Effects and Quadratic Time
trend on Log of Real Effective Exchange Rate, controlling for various types of capital flows,
exchange rate regime, trade and financial openness, and relative income. Overall, the relationship
between TOT, REER and the mitigation effect from reserve accumulation described above is robust
to the inclusion of these controls. Breaking Capital Inflows in several categories allows us to expose
systematic distinctions in the effect of those flows on the REER for different subgroups of countries
[see Table 3].

•   Inflows associated with short term capital tend to appreciate the REER. Developing countries’
    REER seem to be very sensitive to changes in reserve assets, fairly inelastic to movements of
    short term capital and highly inelastic to changes in long term foreign capitals. Industrial

 Following King and Levine (1993) and Rousseau and Wachtel (2005) we experiment also with M3, Credit
Allocated to the Private Sector and M3 minus M1.
                                                             7

       countries display a very consistent positive correlation between FDI inflows and REER
       appreciations across the board. Inflows of Hot Money are also associated with real appreciations
       in these industrialized economies. When we interact reserves with trade openness, we observe
       that the effects of a decrease in reserves on the REER are diminished as we move towards greater
       trade openness [see Appendix E].

 •     Manufactures exporters display a highly significant relationship between inflows of hot money
       and appreciation of the REER; while natural resource countries’ REER are not related to changes
       in capital inflows, once we adjust for trade openness. REER in Asian emerging economies
       consistently react to inflows of hot money, especially in those specifications that take trade
       openness into consideration. Changes in reserve assets and FDI inflows seem to play a minimal
       role in the determination of the REER for these Asian Economies. Latin American emerging
       markets REER seem to be considerably sensitive to changes in reserve assets although this
       relationship is broken when we use the interactions with trade openness.

 Notes: Each number represents the number of significant (at 10 %) coefficients of each type of capital inflows to REER
 across our eight different specifications [See Appendix D]. “0/0” would correspond to 8 insignificant coefficients for that
 country subgroup.
 Positive signed coefficient uncovers a positive relationship between inflow and appreciation. For the case of Reserves,
 positive signed coefficients reveal a positive relation between reductions of official reserves and appreciations.
 (*) For Latin America there is a distinction between the effects of “Other Investment” inflows and “Portfolio” inflows.
 The former seem to be associated with appreciations of the REER while the later are associated to real depreciations.
 _______________________________________________________________________________________________

 •     REER depreciation associated with FDI, found by Athukorala and Rajapatirana (2003), is only
       consistently present in manufactures exporters and Latin American economies once we account
                                                     8

    for trade openness. FDI inflows tend to appreciate REER in industrial countries, even though at a
    lower rate than other types of capital.
•   The results support the hypothesis that international trade helps mitigate pressures for real
    appreciation (see Hau (2002)).
•   Nominal exchange rate depreciation has the expected negative effect on REER across the board.
    Natural resource exporters and Latin American economies seem to be especially sensitive to these
    changes in nominal exchange rates.
•   Higher International reserves/GDP ratio is associated with depreciated REER. However, this
    effect is mitigated by trade openness. These results are much weaker for the OECD.

2. Concluding remarks

    Our paper suggests that hoarding and managing international reserves has the effect of mitigating
the impact of TOT shocks on the REER. Consequently, countries exposed to TOT volatility may
benefit from active management of international reserves in ways that go well beyond the
conventional prerogative of a central bank (see Davis et. al. (2001) for a review of the experience of
Chile and Norway). Greater integration of financial markets may have increased the responsiveness
of financial flows to TOT shocks [see Aizenman and Lee (2005), Rodrik (2006) and the references
therein]. Hence, TOT improvement associated with higher domestic returns would induce capital
inflows, leading to further REER appreciation. Similarly, TOT deterioration may lead to disorderly
outflows, where the rush to exit is motivated by the wish to minimize capital losses. Better
understanding of these issues is left for future investigation.

  Appendix A: Financial intermediation, the real exchange rate and liquidity shocks

           This appendix outlines a model explaining equation (1). It would be presumptuous for us to
  claim that we have a fully specified model that accounts for all the reasons for hoarding reserves, and
  that we control all the relevant variables. Indeed, we doubt that such a model exists -- countries
  hoard reserves due to several motives beyond the traditional buffer stock and exchange rate
  management approaches. The observed hoarding reflects changing circumstances, where
  precautionary and self insurance, mercantilist and REER stabilization motives seem to play greater
  role, possibly due to deeper financial and trade integrations [see Cheung and Ito (2006) for an
  econometric evaluation of the changing patterns of hoarding international reserve10]. In this
  appendix we outline a model explaining the REER stabilization role of international reserves in the
  presence of TOT shocks. Our empirical strategy is to start testing the most rudimentary prediction of
  this model, stated in equation (1). We verify the robustness of our findings by adding controls
  dealing with other variables identified as pertinent for accounting international reserves [exchange
  rate flexibility, trade and financial openness, etc.].


           A growing literature has identified financial intermediation, in the presence of collateral
  constraints, as a mechanism explaining the hazard associated with credit cycles induces by shocks.
  The prominent role of bank financing in developing countries suggests that capital flights, induced by
  adverse terms of trade shocks or contagion, impose adverse liquidity shocks. This appendix outlines
  a model describing conditions under which ex-ante hoarding of international reserves may provide a
  self insurance mechanism that would mitigate the real effects of liquidity shocks, ultimately reducing
  the adverse effects of terms of trade volatility on the GDP. For simplicity, we focus on an ex-ante/ex
  post model dealing with the determination of the GDP level and the real exchange rate during one
  investment cycle. Applying the logic of endogenous growth, one may extend the model to deal with
  the impact of terms of trade shocks on growth.
           As our focus is on developing countries, we assume that all financial intermediation is done
  by banks, relying on debt contracts. Specifically, we consider the case where investment in a long-
  term project should be undertaken prior to the realization of liquidity shocks. Hence, shocks may
  force costly liquidation of earlier investments, thereby reducing output. We solve the optimal demand

  for deposits and international reserves by a bank that finances investment in long-term projects. The
  bank’s financing is done using callable deposits, exposing the bank to liquidity risk. Macro liquidity
  shocks, stemming from sudden stops and capital flights, cannot be diversified away. In these
  circumstances, hoarding reserves saves liquidation costs, potentially leading to large welfare gains;
  gains that hold even if all agents are risk neutral. In this framework, deposits and reserves tend to be
  complements – higher volatility of liquidity shocks will increase both the demand for reserves and
  deposits. This is another example of hoarding international reserves as a self-insurance against non-
  diversifiable liquidity shocks.11
            We model the financial intermediation and the real exchange rate by combining Diamond and
  Dybvig’s (1983) insight with Aghion, Bacchetta and Banerjee’s (2003) modeling of market
  imperfections in a collateral dependent small open economy.12 We construct a minimal model to
  explain the self insurance offered by international reserves, in mitigating the output effects of
  liquidity shocks with endogenous real exchange rate determination. Investment in a long term project
  should be undertaken prior to the realization of liquidity shocks. Hence, the liquidity shock may
  force costly liquidation of the earlier investment, reducing second period output. We simplify further
  by assuming that there is no separation between the bank and the entrepreneur – the entrepreneur is
  the bank owner, using it to finance the investment.
            We consider a small open economy, where a traded good Y is produced with capital and a
  country specific non-traded factor. In addition, the traded sector includes exports of commodities,
  generating revenue which is determined by the realization of terms of trade shocks [= the relative
  price of the exported commodities to other traded goods]. The traded good Y is the numeraire. The
  relative price of the non-traded factor is denoted by p, and is referred to as the real exchange rate
  There is a continuum of lenders and borrowers and their number is normalized to 1.
            We focus now of the evolution of the economy throughout one investment cycle, where
  gestation lags imply that capital should be installed well before hiring specific non-traded input. To
  simplify, the supply of the specific factor is inelastic, at a level Z. The lenders in the economy cannot
  invest directly, but lend their saving at the international interest rate. Depositors are entitled to a real

  return of rf on the loan that remains deposited for the duration of investment. The safe return reflects

  a risk free investment opportunity, either in the form of a foreign bond, or as storage technology. The
  borrowers are entrepreneurs who have investment opportunity, but are credit constrained. The actual
  investment should be undertaken prior to the realization of liquidity shocks. The production function
  is a Cobb Douglas CRS technology:
                  1 β 1− β

                  a
  where K1 is the non-liquidated capital invested at period 1, z is the level of country-specific input,
  hired at a relative price of p1 . Premature liquidation of capital is costly, and is associated with a
  proportionate adjustment cost of θ . Specifically, reducing the capital stock by one dollar yields a net
  liquidity of 1 /(1 + θ ) . The time line associated with financial intermediation is summarized in Figure
  A1. At the beginning of period 1, the entrepreneur with initial wealth H1 , borrows μH 1 .13 The
  combined liquidity of (1 + μ ) H1 finances planned investment K1 , and setting aside liquid reserves R1 :
           (A2) (1 + μ )H1 = K1 + R1 .
           Next, a liquidity shock δ realizes. A positive shock is inconsequential, because banks can
  accommodate positive liquidity shocks by purchasing a risk free bond, or investing in the risk free
  low yield storage technology. Hence, we focus our attention on adverse liquidity shocks, reducing
  desirable deposits form μH 1 to μH1 (1 + lδ ) , δ < 0, l > 0. Our model focuses on the impact of
  adverse liquidity shocks on optimal investment and liquidity, refraining from modeling the reasons
  for the shock. Such a shock may reflect external developments, like a higher foreign interest rate,
  contagion, or a reaction to a signal revealing the future TOT. For example, suppose that the public
  learns of a signal δ , determining the second period foreign currency earnings from commodity
  exports. A negative TOT shock may induce anticipation of an economic slowdown, triggering
  capital flights, and reducing deposits from μH1 to μ H1 (1 + lδ ) . Independently of the exact source of
  the adverse liquidity shock, gestation lags associated with tangible investment and costly liquidation,
  expose the bank to the downside risk associated with abrupt adjustment.

    Collateral constraints can be shown to arise due to capital market imperfections in the presence of moral
  hazard and costly monitoring [see Holmstrom-Tirole (1996) and Aghion-Banerjee-Piketty (1999)].

           The bank uses reserves to meet the liquid shock and to purchase the non-traded input. In case
  of need, the liquidly shock may be met by costly liquidation of capital. Consequently, the ultimate
  capital is:

  where p1 may depend on δ.
           To gain further insight, it is useful to focus on the simplest discrete example, where with
  probability half an adverse liquidity shock of δ = −ε ( 0 ≤ ε < 1 ) would take place, and with
  probability half there would be no liquidity interruption. The value of ε corresponds to the volatility
  of the liquidity shock, δ. The asymmetric nature of tangible investment implies that only negative
  liquidity shocks may require real adjustment. In these circumstances, the expected profits are:

           Entrepreneurs with initial wealth H1 , subject to collateral constraint μ, use bank financing μH 1 . The

                    combined liquidity (1 + μ ) H1 finances investment K1 and hoarding reserves, R1 ,

                                                     (1 + μ ) H 1 = K 1 + R1 .

                       APPENDIX B: DEFINITIONS AND DATA
  Definitions of the series used in the Main text

   Real Effective Exchange Rates (REER)
  The real effective exchange rate index represents a nominal effective exchange rate index adjusted
  for relative movements in national price or cost indicators of the home country,
  REER = Π ti [(e / ei )( P / Pi )] wi
  Where e: Exchange rate of the subject currency against the US dollar (US dollars per rupee in index
  form)
         ei: Exchange rates of currency i against the US dollar (US dollars per currency i in index
         form)
         wi: Weights attached to the country/ currency i in the index
          P: Consumer Price Index (CPI) of Subject country
         Pi: Consumer price index of country i
  An Increase in REER corresponds to a Real Domestic Appreciation. Data belongs to the IFS
  dataset. 14

  Trade Openness (TO)

  Trade openness is the sum of merchandise exports and imports divided by twice the value of GDP, all
  in current U.S. dollars. The final variable TO is defined as a smooth moving average including a
  maximum of 5 past observations of trade openness. Data from IFS and WDI was used to compose
  this index

  Terms of Trade (TOT)

  Net barter terms of trade are the ratio of the export price index to the corresponding import price
  index measured relative to the base year 2000

  Sources:

      1) United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, Handbook of International Trade and
         Development Statistics.
      2) Constructed. We use export and import value data from IFS. We use two kinds of proxies for
         export/import price indices.
              a. Indices for export and import prices that are compiled from survey data for wholesale
                 prices or directly from the exporter or importer (called “direct pricing”). See IFS line
                 76.
              b. Indices for Unit Value of Exports see IFS line 74 and Unit Value of Imports see IFS
                 line 75 are Laspeyres, with weights derived from the data for transactions.
         We use indices based on direct pricing when available since these are generally considered
  preferable to unit value indices, because problems of unit value bias are reduced.
  14
    IFS data has started to report REER data as Divisia Indices. To our best knowledge the REER data used in this study
  follows the previous trade weighted definition.

  Reserves (RES)

  The “Reserves” variable used for the interaction with terms of trade the total stock of Reserves (
  special drawing rights, reserves of IMF members held by the IMF, and holdings of foreign exchange
  under the control of monetary authorities) where gold holdings are excluded. Data is finally
  converted as the ratio of domestic GDP. The main source for this series is WDI and DataStream

  Net Capital Inflows

          FDI: Foreign Direct Investment captures the net inflows from foreign direct investors to the
  domestic economy
         Portfolio Investment: Portfolio Investment is composed of flows in equity and debt
  considered for portfolio investment
         Other Investment: Other Investment is composed of trade credits, loans, currency and other
  flows. Most of this capital flows are short term
         - Δ INTER. RESERVES: Decrease in Official International Reserves
  Net Capital Inflows were taken from the BOPS dataset.

  Economic Structure

        1- RELATIVE INCOME: GDP per Capita relative to the US GDP per capita
        2- EXMG: Excess Money Growth. Calculate as Money and Quasi-Money (M2) growth rate
            minus GDP (in current US$) growth.
        3- MANGDP: Percentage of the economic activity captured by the manufacturing sector
            (excluding construction)
        4- CGDP: Percentage of the economic activity dedicated to the production of commodities
            other than manufactures.
  Sources: IFS, WDI and UN statistics.

  REGRESSION SPECIFICATIONS

     1- Simple Panel with Country Fixed Effects

      ln( REERit ) = CountryEffectsi + α * X it + ε it

     Where α is a vector of (n, 1) estimators and X is a vector (1, n) of independent variables.

     2- Panel with Country Fixed Effects and Quadratic Time Trend

      ln( REERit ) = CountryEffectsi + α * X it + β1 * T + β 2 * T 2 + ε it
     Where T represents a time trend

     3- Panel with Country Fixed Effects and Time Effects

      ln( REERit ) = CountryEffectsi + TimeEffectst + α * X it + ε it

  DETRENDING THE REAL EFFECTIVE EXCHANGE RATE

  We use the Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter 15 to test the robustness of the previous regressions results
  against the hypothesis of common trends. Using this filter the de-trended real effective exchange rate
  (TLREER) solves the following optimization problem:

                  ∑      ( LogREERt − TREERt ) 2 + λ ∑t =2 [(TREERt +1 − TREERt ) − (TREERt − TREERt −1 )]2
                  T                                        T −1
       Min T      t =1
  {TREERT }t =1



  Where lambda is the penalty parameter. In the appendix we present results with a lambda = 1600

  Pooled Unit Root Test for the Series used in the Main Text
  In this section we test our REER and TOT* Reserves series for unit roots using estimators of a panel
  unit root test developed by Levin, Lin and Chu (LLC, 2002). The test assumes that each individual
  unit in the panel shares the same AR(1) coefficient, but allows for individual effects, time effects and
  possibly a time trend. The test may be viewed as a pooled Dickey-Fuller test, or an Augmented
  Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test when lags are included, with the null hypothesis that of nonstationarity
  (I(1) behavior). After transformation by factors provided by LLC, the t-star statistic is distributed
  standard normal under the null hypothesis of nonstationarity.

  Regressions are based on a balanced panel of 60 countries over the period 1980-2002


  Summary of results:
  Tables B.7.1 and B.7.2 show the results of our pooled ADF test under different specifications
  (number of lags and the inclusion of time trends) for our REER series and the interacted variable of
  TOT and Reserves used in the econometric analysis. Although both series show a remarkably high
  persistence (AR (1) coefficients above .7 for both series without trend), we are able to reject the null
  of non-stationarity at a 1% confidence level in both tests.

Inclusion of Controls to our Main Equation
In this section we control for the differences in the foreign exchange regimes across countries. To do so,
we divide our sample following Reinhart and Rogoff’s classification of FOREX Regimes (see below,
note that we do not include dual markets and freely falling regimes)16
1           •No separate legal tender
2           •Pre announced peg or currency board arrangement
3           •Pre announced horizontal band that is narrower than or equal to +/-2%
4           •De facto peg
5           •Pre announced crawling peg
6           •Pre announced crawling band that is narrower than or equal to +/-2%
7           •De factor crawling peg
8           •De facto crawling band that is narrower than or equal to +/-2%
9           •Pre announced crawling band that is wider than or equal to +/-2%
10          •De facto crawling band that is narrower than or equal to +/-5%
11          •Moving band that is narrower than or equal to +/-2% (i.e., allows for both

Summary of results:
Table C.4 indicates that developing countries under more flexible forex regimes will find a larger role
for reserves as shock absorbers at the same time that they seem to be more exposed to exogenous TOT
shocks.

                                   ***************************************
To further analyze the uncovered buffer effect of liquid foreign assets on TOT shocks we divide the
main regression by the nature of the TOT shock (positive of negative).

Summary of results:
The results displayed in Table C.5 show that the buffer effect of reserves in developing countries seems
to be larger given a deteriorations of the countries terms of trade. Nevertheless, given the standard errors
is difficult to reject the hypothesis of symmetry across both coefficients.
                               ***************************************
Have reserves changed their role as ETOT shock absorbers after the 1997 global turmoil? To answer this
question a simple test consists of splitting the interaction between ETOT and Reserves into two covering
the periods before 1997 and after 1998 then using a simple Wald test to compare the slopes on those
coefficients the table below shows the results of a panel regression with country fixed effects. Reserves
are always in terms of domestic GDP. We also include the level of reserves to control for significant
changes in the volume of international liquidity between periods. F statistics corresponding to the Wald
tests are shown at the bottom of the table.

Summary of results:
From the Wald test applied to the coefficients on table C.6 we determine that the slope of the buffer
effect of reserves did not significantly changed after the 1997 financial crisis for developing countries in
general. However, the Wald test indicates differences between pre 97 and post 97 slopes for the different
subgroups. Reserves seem to play a more relevant role after 1997 for Latin American and Commodity
exporters. Although the results show a higher role of reserves before 1997 for Asian economies, this
may be due to the depletion of reserves in those countries that followed from the financial crisis.

    Financial depth seems to be important to determine the degree in which reserves help absorb
    external shocks. To highlight this finding we divide our between observations of relatively low
    domestic liquidity (less than twenty percent of total output) and relatively high liquidity (more than
    twenty percent of total output). We observe that the buffer effect of international reserves seems to
    be stronger when countries face shallow financial systems.

       dependency leaves our main result unaffected. Moreover, purging countries with high export
       dependency makes our coefficients larger and more robust.
