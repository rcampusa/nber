One Money, One Market: Estimating the Effect of
Common Currencies on Trade

NBER Working Paper No. 7432
December 1999
JEL No. F33


                                                  ABSTRACT


        A gravity model is used to assess the separate effects of exchange rate volatility and currency
unions on international trade. The panel data set used includes bilateral observations for five years spanning
1970 through 1990 for 186 countries. In this data set, there are over one hundred pairings and three
hundred observations, in which both countries use the same currency. I find a large positive effect of a
currency union on international trade, and a small negative effect of exchange rate volatility, even after
controlling for a host of features, including the endogenous nature of the exchange rate regime. These
effects are statistically significant and imply that two countries that share the same currency trade three times
as much as they would with different currencies. Currency unions like EMU may thus lead to a large
increase in international trade, with all that entails.
