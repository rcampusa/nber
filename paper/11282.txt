                                          ABSTRACT

This paper considers economic issues and trends in the rock and roll industry, broadly defined. The

analysis focuses on concert revenues, the main source of performers ' income. Issues considered

include: price measurement; concert price acceleration in the 1990s; the increased concentration of

revenue among performers; reasons for the secondary ticket market; methods for ranking performers;

copyright protection; and technological change.

      The fact of the matter is that popular music is one of the industries of the
      country. It’s all completely tied up with capitalism. It’s stupid to separate it.

                                                              – Paul Simon


1. Introduction

       As was highlighted by a much ridiculed box in the 2004 Economic Report of the

President that questioned whether fast food restaurants should be classified in the

manufacturing sector, defining an industry necessarily entails some arbitrariness. We

seek to survey the economics of the popular music industry, a subfield of economics that

we euphemistically call Rockonomics. But what is popular music? Where does one draw

the lines? Here, we will define popular music as music that has a wide following, is

produced by contemporary artists and composers, and does not require public subsidy to

survive. This definition rules out classical music and publicly supported orchestras. It

includes rock and roll, pop, rap, bebop, jazz, blues and many other genres. What about

Pavarotti? Well, we warned you that the border of the definition can be fuzzy. If the

three tenors attract a large following and are financially viable, we would include them in

the popular music industry as well.

       Why is popular music worthy of a handbook chapter? There are several

responses. First, Paul Simon’s sentiment in the epigraph not withstanding, for many fans

popular music transcends usual market economics and raises spirits and aspirations. In

this vein, for example, Bruce Springsteen once commented, “in some fashion, I help

people hold on to their own humanity, if I'm doing my job right.” Dewey Finn, the

character played by Jack Black in the hit movie, School of Rock, went even further,

immodestly claiming, “One great rock show can change the world.” The rock and roll

industry arguably started as a social movement intended to bring about political,


                                                                                           2
economic and cultural change, as much as it did as a business. Certainly, popular music

is an important cultural industry.

       Second, precisely because emotion and non-traditional economic concerns loom

large in popular music, the industry can be a breeding ground for new insights into

economics. Social considerations are important in transactions outside the music

industry; they are just magnified when it comes to a rock and roll concert.

       Third, the popular music industry provides a testing ground for some important

economic theories. For example, popular music is a classic superstar industry, where

rewards are highly skewed. Can economic models explain the distribution of rewards?

Also, despite the non-economic forces that affect the popular music industry, can basic

economic factors, such as supply and demand, still provide a good explanation of many

of the important developments in the industry?

       Fourth, the industry is profoundly affected by technological change, such as the

advent of radio, TV, record albums, cassette tapes, CDs, MP3 players, the Internet, etc.

Thus, popular music provides an unusual setting to understand how rapid technological

change affects an industry.

       Fifth, and finally, the popular music industry is, by definition, popular. As a

consequence, students are particularly motivated to learn about the industry, and

examples drawn from the industry thus provide good material for teaching economics.

       To help guide our coverage, Table 1.1 provides a summary of the main income

sources for the top 35 popular music performers who toured in 2002, ranked by income.

The figures, which are taken from Rolling Stone magazine, should be viewed as rough

estimates. Another caveat to bear in mind is that some sources of income – such as




                                                                                           3
revenue from merchandise sales, movies, commercials and (don’t laugh) cell phone

jingles – are not itemized in the table, but included in the total. These other sources of

revenues can be substantial. The Osbournes, for example, had a huge success with their

reality TV show that aired on MTV. Nevertheless, the table provides an indication of the

relative importance of live concerts, record sales, and publication royalties in performers’

income. Although the concert figures are somewhat inflated because artists do not tour

every year (and our sample conditions on having toured), it is clear that concerts provide

a larger source of income for performers than record sales or publishing royalties. Only

four of the top 35 income-earners made more money from recordings than from live

concerts, and much of the record revenue for these artists probably represented an

advance on a new album, not on-going royalties from CD sales. For the top 35 artists as

a whole, income from touring exceeded income from record sales by a ratio of 7.5 to 1 in

2002. Royalties from publishing music was slightly less than income from recordings.

Consequently, we will devote much attention to live concerts in this paper.

       The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The next section describes

the organization of the music industry, devoting particular attention to live performances.

Section 3 discusses theoretical issues in the pricing of concerts. Section 4 considers

major developments in the popular music concert industry, with particular emphasis on

prices, ticket sales, revenue, and concentration among promoters. Section 5 considers the

important role played by scalpers. Section 6 provides a method for ranking performers

based on economic data. Section 7 considers the role of the superstar model in the rock

and roll industry. Section 8 discusses the role of radio and royalties, and section 9




                                                                                             4
considers related issues involving file sharing. Section 10 concludes by highlighting

important questions for further research.



2. The Players

       The market for popular music has many players and complex contracts. Figure

2.1 provides a schematic diagram of the organization of key elements of the popular

music industry. First and foremost, of course, are the musicians, who form a band. The

band may write its own music and lyrics, or it may purchase music from an outside

composer. In the Figure 2.1, we have illustrated a situation for a band that writes its own

music. The bands have managers who represent them and take a share of their earnings

in exchange for their managerial services. On behalf of the bands, managers make

contracts with promoters to promote live concerts. The promoter secures a venue,

advertises the event, and takes care of other arrangements. Successful bands also have

contracts with recording companies to produce and market CDs. Record companies are

occasionally involved in promoting concert tours, but they typically play only a

peripheral role in concerts, when they are involved at all.

       If a band composed its own music, it will also contract with a publisher to

copyright the music. The publisher will contract with a performing rights organization,

which licenses the music for radio stations, television and other users, monitors the use of

the music, and collects royalties. The publisher usually takes half the royalties, and the

composer receives the other half (some of which goes to the manager). The performing

rights organizations also coordinate with performing rights organizations in other




                                                                                             5
countries to collect and distribute fees for music played abroad. (See Section 8.) Costs

are not deducted from the publishing royalties the band receives.

        As is clear from Table 1.1, bands receive relatively little of their income from

recording companies. Indeed, only the very top bands are likely to receive any income

other than the advance they receive from the company, because expenses – and there are

many – are charged against the bands advance before royalties are paid out. In 2003 the

total value of recording sales (including CDs, singles, LPs, etc.) in the U.S. was $11.8

billion according to IFPI (2004), while the total value of concert ticket sales was $2.1

billion according to our tabulations. Thus, from the consumers’ perspective, recordings

are a much larger market, but from the artists’ perspective, concerts represent a much

more important income source. This point was made by Scott Welch, manager of Alanis

Morissette and LeAnn Rimes: “The top 10% of artists make money selling records, the

rest go on tour.”1

2.1 Contracts

        Contractual arrangements between bands, promoters and record labels are

heterogeneous, but the typical contract resembles a book contract, with an initial advance

and then royalties if sales exceed a certain level. The typical contract between a band and

a concert promoter is most easily illustrated with a hypothetical example. Consider an

agreement covering a single concert.2 The band receives a “guaranteed advance” – e.g.,

equal to the first $100,000 of ticket sales, and then, before additional revenue is

distributed, the promoter recovers his expenses and a “guaranteed profit” – say $50,000

for expenses and $22,500 for profit. The expenses could include advertising, rent for the

1

2
 It is interesting to note that as promoters have become more consolidated, more bands have signed
nationwide tours with a single promoter.


                                                                                                     6
venue, costs of unloading the equipment, etc. The band also has expenses (e.g., travel),

which it pays for out of its income. The promoter and the band split any ticket revenue

above the guarantee plus expenses and minimum profit (above $172,500 in this case),

usually with the band receiving 85 percent and the promoter receiving 15 percent of these

revenues.3 The band’s guaranteed advance and percent of revenue after expenses is

higher for bands with greater bargaining power.

         In its negotiation with the promoter, the band (or its manager on the band’s

behalf) agrees to the concert price, which naturally affects the amount of revenue

collected. In addition, the band usually receives 100 percent of merchandise sales (e.g.,

T-shirts) that take place at the concert.4 The venue usually receives the beer and parking

revenue. An interesting economic question is why the contracts for concerts take this

form. Because the parties receive revenue from the sources for which they are most

responsible – the band and promoter from ticket sales, the band from merchandise sales,

and the venue for parking and food – it is possible that this division of revenue streams

provides optimal incentives for efficient provision.

         Promoters contract with a ticket distributor to distribute tickets. Tickets may also

be distributed directly by the venue box office and by the band to its fan club. By far the

largest ticket distributor is Ticketmaster. Ticketmaster also has exclusive arrangements

to distribute tickets for some venues. Ticketmaster fees are usually around 10 percent of

the list price. Unknown to the consumer, in some cases the venue, promoter or

performers receive a portion of this fee, depending on their contract.


3
  These hypothetical figures were used by the head of a major management firm to illustrate a “typical”
contract.
4
  In some cases, the band will be required to give a proportion (e.g., 30 percent) of the merchandise sales to
the venue for the right to sell there, however.


                                                                                                             7
         Record companies tend to sign long-term agreements with bands that specify an

advance on royalties and a royalty rate. The typical new band has very little negotiating

power with record labels, and the advance rarely covers the recording and promotion

costs, which are usually charged to the band. Because fixed recording costs vary little

with band quality, only the most popular artists earn substantial revenue from record

sales.

         In the following passage from his book, So You Wanna Be a Rock & Roll Star,

Jacob Slichter (2004), the drummer for Semisonic (and grandson of former AEA

President Sumner Slichter), describes a typical recording contract:

         Thus, armed with an attorney and a manager, we began our negotiations
         with Electra. Dan [the lead singer] would relay the developments of those
         negotiations after our evening rehearsals, when we went out for drinks. I
         leaned back in my chair, sipped merlot, and listened as Dan and John
         tutored me in the basics of record contracts.

         Elektra would lend us money, called an advance, so we could pay for the
         recording costs of making an album. As I already knew, those costs would
         be high – studio rental could run $2,000 per day and recording could take
         months. Producers’ and engineers’ fees might add another $100,000, not to
         mention mastering, flights, hotels, rental cars – we could easily spend
         $250,000. If there were anything left over, we’d get to keep it, but it
         wouldn’t amount to much.

         In return, we would grant Elektra the exclusive rights to our recordings. As
         money from the sales of records came in, we would be allotted a percentage
         of the proceeds, known as points. In a typical deal, the band gets thirteen or
         fourteen percentage points. We’d have to give a few of our own points
         (four perhaps) to the producer of our record (producers typically get a fee
         and points). Then we’d be down to ten points. Before calculating the value
         of those ten points, however, Electra would subtract a large percentage of
         the gross sales to account for free goods, records given away for
         promotional and other purposes. Thus, the amount on which our 10 percent
         was calculated would be reduced by 20 to 25 percent. So we’d be down
         even further, perhaps 10 percent on 75 percent of the wholesale album
         revenue. If our CD was sold in stores for fifteen dollars, the band’s share of
         the revenue might be something between fifty cents and a dollar per CD.
         Would we get to keep it? No! Elektra would add up all of the expenses of



                                                                                            8
       recording and promoting our album – rock videos, radio promotion, touring
       costs, and so on. The total of those costs, which could run into the millions,
       would be our recoupable debt to the record company. Our share of each
       CD sold would be swallowed up by that debt. …. When it came time to
       record and release future albums, any unpaid debt from our past albums
       would carry forward. In fact, even if we sold millions of records (in which
       case the size of our share would increase), we might never recoup. As one
       friend of mine joked, we’d be rock-and-roll sharecroppers. (pp. 34-36)


       Caves (2000) analyzes the contractual arrangements in the music industry in

terms of the efficient division of risk, incentives and rewards. He emphasizes that

reputation and the prospect of repeated contracts are essential for contract enforcement.

Eliot (1993) provides many colorful examples of malfeasance in music contracts. For

example, the Beatles accused Capitol Records of failing to pay royalties on 19 million

albums and singles. An audit revealed more than 20 separate areas where Capitol/EMI

had “wrongfully accounted” for costs or revenue concerning promotion, manufacture and

sales, resulting in $19 million of unpaid royalties due the Beatles from 1969-1979. Caves

prosaically notes that, “From the artist’s viewpoint, a problem of moral hazard arises

because the label keeps the books that determine the earnings remitted to the artist.”

       An analogous problem arises with live concerts. The following remark by Sharon

Osbourne (2002; p. 56) underscores the difficulty of contract enforcement in the concert

industry: “My husband’s whole career, people stole from him. They walk off with

thousands of dollars that’s yours. So the only way, unfortunately, for me is to get nasty

and to get violent.” She described the following disagreement with John Scher, a

legendary New York promoter, who claimed advertising expenses for ads placed long

after a concert had sold out: “[H]e would not give in, and he was threatening that ‘Ozzy

will never work in the New York area again.’ All this crap. So I got up and nutted him




                                                                                            9
with my head, and then I kicked him in the ….” Caves notes that contract enforcement in

this industry relies heavily on repeated transactions among parties who value their

reputations. The Osbourne method is apparently another contract enforcement

mechanism.



3. Some theoretical issues regarding concert pricing

           Here we consider some of the main theoretical issues in concert ticket pricing, the

main source of performers’ incomes. As an economic good, concerts are distinguished

by five important characteristics: (1) although not as extreme as movies or records, from

a production standpoint concerts have high fixed costs and low marginal costs; (2)

concerts are an experience good, whose quality is only known after it is consumed; (3)

the value of a concert ticket is zero after the concert is performed; (4) concert seats vary

in quality; (5) bands sell complementary products, such as merchandise and records.

           Rosen and Rosenfield (1997) provide a thorough treatment of ticket pricing,

devoting particular attention to price discrimination, the practice of charging different

prices to different customers.5 Price discrimination tends to occur when marginal costs

are below average costs. Because fixed costs for a concert are high relative to variable

costs, and because high- and low-elasticity demanders can be sorted by seat location,

price discrimination is possible. Furthermore, bands are likely to have monopoly power,

deriving from the fact that they produce differentiated products and have loyal fans.

           Rosen and Rosenfield consider a case where there are two types of seats, high

quality and low quality. Buyers prefer high quality to low quality. The seller chooses

the total number of seats and the quantity of each class of seat, and a pricing policy for
5
    Also see Courty (2000) for a thoughtful summary of theoretical issues in ticket pricing.


                                                                                               10
complementary goods, such as merchandise. Buyers have reserve prices for high- and

low-quality seats, conditional on the seat quality and prices of complementary goods.

The seller knows the distribution of reserve prices, but cannot identify customers with

high and low reservation prices; ticket quality is used to sort buyers. Rosen and

Rosenfield show that the seller would solve the pricing problem in two steps: “First,

given the quantities and quality of the two classes of seats and the price of complements,

the seller chooses ticket prices to maximize revenue.… Second, given the optimum

pricing policy, the seller decides on the quantity and quality of seats and on the price of

complements.”

       The price of a concert ticket is set lower than it would be in the absence of

complementary goods, because a larger audience increases sales of complements and

raises revenue.

       One puzzle in actual pricing is that price discrimination is surprisingly rare, as we

will see in the next section. Another puzzle is that pricing results in excess demand for

many concert performances, which leads to scalping; scalping is addressed in Section 5.



4. Concert Industry Trends

       This section, which draws heavily from Krueger (2004), makes extensive use of

Pollstar’s Box Office Report database to describe developments in the concert industry

from 1981 to 2003. Pollstar is the trade magazine of the concert industry, and a widely

recognized authority on concerts. Since 1981, the magazine has collected and published

data on concert revenue, venue capacity, ticket sales and prices. The data are provided by

venue managers, who have an incentive to report their data because Pollstar disseminates




                                                                                              11
it to potential clients. Managers report data on a wide range of musical concerts, and

occasionally on other entertainment events, such as comedians, professional wrestling

matches and traveling Broadway shows. The data are most complete for concerts, and

we tried to exclude the non-concerts from the sample. Before restrictions, the database

contains 260,081 box office reports. After eliminating non-concerts, benefit concerts

(which we think of as charity events), and events that occurred outside the United States,

the sample contains 232,911 reports, representing 270,679 separate performances.

           Reporting of concerts to Pollstar increased substantially in the 1980s, so one

potential problem is that the dataset may not be representative of the entire concert

industry in all years. Major acts are more likely to be included in the dataset throughout.

As a partial adjustment for changes in sample composition, in some of the analysis we

restrict the sample to artists listed in The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll,

hereafter called Encyclopedia bands.6 This Encyclopedia contains information on 1,786

artists, and 1,275 of these artists performed at least one concert represented in the

Pollstar database. The edition of the Encyclopedia we use was published in October

2001; two earlier editions were published in 1984 and 1995. Thus, the Encyclopedia

contains something of a moving average of the leading bands in the period under study,

which produces more of a consistent sample. Bands listed in the Encyclopedia are

responsible for 75 percent of the dollar value of ticket sales in the Pollstar data from

1981 to 2003.

           Two other limitations of the data should be noted. First, the ticket price and

revenue pertain to the list price. Any service fees charged by the ticket distributor are

excluded. Because service fees have been growing rapidly in recent years, this omission
6
    George-Warren et al. (2001)


                                                                                            12
probably serves to understate the acceleration in ticket prices in recent years. Second, we

do not have information on the secondary market, and it might be common for tickets to

be resold in a scalper market. Nevertheless, the list price, not the resale price, is relevant

from the standpoint of artists and promoters, as their ticket revenue is derived from

tickets sold at the list price. Moreover, fragmentary evidence summarized in Section 5

suggests that scalping is a less common phenomenon than widely believed.

4.1 Trends in Prices

          Figure 4.1 displays the average price of a concert ticket (total revenue divided by

total tickets sold each year) for all concerts from 1981 to 2003, and the (ticket-weighted)

average high and low price of a concert ticket. The figure also shows what the average

price would have been had it grown in lockstep with the CPI-U. From 1981 to 1996,

concert prices grew slightly faster than inflation: concert prices grew a compound 4.6

percent per year while overall consumer prices grew 3.7 percent per year. From 1996 to

2003, concert prices grew much faster than inflation: 8.9 percent a year versus 2.3

percent a year. And if the sample of concerts is limited to those performed by bands

listed in the Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll in an attempt to hold constant changes in

composition and quality, the acceleration in concert prices after 1996 is slightly greater:

11.1 percent a year growth from 1996 to 2003 versus 4.9 percent a year in the 1981-96

period.

          The cost of the highest priced ticket in the house has grown even faster than the

average ticket (see the top dashed line in Figure 4.1). Weighted by total ticket sales, the

average high price ticket grew by 10.7 percent per annum from 1996 to 2003, while the

average of the lowest price ticket grew by 6.7 percent a year. Thus, price dispersion




                                                                                              13
increased across seats for the same concert. (The rise in income dispersion among

consumers may partially account for the rise in price differentiation; unfortunately, data

on consumers is unavailable.) Nonetheless, in 43 percent of concerts in 2003, all seats in

the house were priced the same, suggesting less price discrimination than might be

expected from Rosen and Rosenfield (1997).7 Even in venues with more than 25,000

seats, 26 percent of shows charged just one price for all seats in 2003. The amount of

price differentiation has grown over time, however: in the 1980s, 73 percent of concerts

with more than 25,000 seats charged just one price for all seats.

        Instead of overall consumer price inflation rate, probably a more appropriate

comparison for concerts is the price of other live entertainment events. Figure 4.2

reproduces Krueger’s (2004) comparison of concert prices to the CPI-U sub-index for

movies, sporting events and theater.8 To make the data as comparable to the CPI as

possible, a Laspeyres price index for concerts using the venue as the unit of observation

was computed. It is clear that price growth for entertainment events exceeded overall

price inflation throughout the period. Concert price growth tracked price growth for

movies, theatre and sporting events remarkably well from 1981 to 1996, but beginning in

1997 the two series diverged. From 1997 to 2003, the concert Lasypeyres index rose 64

percent, whereas the CPI for other entertainment events increased 32 percent.

4.1.1 More on Price Indices




7
  Larger concerts are more likely to vary prices. A quarter of all tickets in 2003 were for shows that had
just one price, as compared to 43 percent of concerts.
8
  To be precise, the BLS produces a CPI for movies, sporting events, theater and concerts. A separate sub-
index covering just movies, sporting events and theater is not available from BLS, so Krueger adjusted the
index as follows. In November and December 2001, concerts accounted for 8.4 percent of price quotes for
this sub-index (email correspondence from Patrick Jackman, Feb. 7, 2002). Consequently, Krueger netted
out the concert component using his Laspeyres estimate of the concert CPI.


                                                                                                        14
           Recall that the Laspeyres price index is defined as L = Σ p1Q0 / Σ p0Q0 and the

Paasche index is defined as P = Σ p1Q1 / Σ p0Q1, where p is the price and Q is the

quantity, and the subscript refers to either the base period (0) or the follow-up period (1).

Intuitively, the Laspeyres index gives the proportionate increase in money needed to buy

the exact same bundle of goods in the follow-up period as was purchased in the base

period, and the Paasche index gives the proportionate difference in money if the bundle

purchased in the follow-up period had been purchased in the base period at the base

period prices. If tastes are constant – a strong assumption for musical entertainment –

and other assumptions are met, the Laspeyres Index is expected to overstate the cost of

living, and the Paasche Index is expected to understate it. The Fisher Ideal index, which

approximates a true cost of living index, is the geometric mean of these two indices: F =

(LP)1/2.

           Left unstated in these formulas is the unit of observation. When the CPI is

computed, the sum is taken over products within stores. For entertainment events, the

venue is the unit of observation in the CPI. In essence, the BLS interviewers go to a

venue and ask for the price this month, and compare it to last month’s price, regardless of

what the performance is. This could obviously create a good deal of noise in the price

data, as the product being compared is not exactly the same. For example, in April 2004,

Beyoncé, Alicia Keys, Missy Eliott and Tamia performed a concert at Madison Square

Garden for an average price of $81, and in May 2004, Yes performed there for an average

price of $61. The within-venue price index would record this as a decline in price, while

it might more appropriately be viewed as a decline in quality. (As further support for this

view, we note that Beyoncé, et al. sold out, while Yes only sold 79 percent of the seats.)




                                                                                             15
        An alternative to using the venue as the unit of observation is to use the performer

as the unit of observation; that is, to follow the same movie or concert over time in

different venues. Krueger (2005) computed a Fisher Ideal price index using the headline

band as the unit of observation in an effort to hold composition constant. The artist was

selected to more directly control for composition effects, although there are clearly

problems with this approach as well: the venue could be larger or smaller, or in a more

remote location, so the experience is different from concert to concert.

        Thus, concerts by different performers in the same venue over time, or concerts

by the same band in different venues over time are not the same products. It is therefore

worthwhile to consider the impact of measurement error in prices on the various price

indices. Suppose the baseline price is measured correctly, and the second period price is

a noisy measure of the price of the same performance in the baseline. The simplest case

is classical measurement error. Let p1’ = p1 + e, where p1’ is the observed price, p1 is the

correct price (i.e., price for the same quality of performance), and e is a white noise,

mean-zero measurement error. In this scenario, the Laspeyres and Paasche indices are

still unbiased estimators, but the Fisher Ideal index will overstate the true rate of price

inflation. The expected value of the square of the Fisher Ideal index with the noisy price

data (F’) is:

                    ⎡ ∑ P1' Q0 ∑ P1' Q1 ⎤          σ 2 ∑ Q0 Q1
(4.1) E[ F '2 ] = E ⎢         •         ⎥ = F 2
                                                +
                    ⎣ ∑ Po Q0 ∑ Po Q1 ⎦           ∑ Po Q0 ∑ Po Q1

where σ2 is the (assumed constant) variance of e. Because the last term is positive, in

expectation the Fisher index will overstate the value of the index if prices were measured

without error. Intuitively, the reason the index is biased upward is because the error in




                                                                                              16
follow-up period prices appears in the numerator of both the Laspeyres and Paasche

indices.

        Table 4.1 explores the effect of the unit of observation on the various price

indices for the Pollstar concert data. The first three columns report the Laspeyres,

Paasche and Fisher ideal indices, respectively, using the headline artist as the unit of

observation. The next set of three columns report the same indices using the venue as the

unit of observation. The seventh column reports the CPI for movies, sporting events and

theater, based on BLS data, which also uses the venue as the unit of observation. The

weights used to compute the price indices for the concert data are updated each year,

which is more frequent than the CPI.

        Looking at Table 4.1, it is immediately clear that the price growth is much greater

if the artist is used as the unit of observation instead of the venue, especially for the

Laspeyres index. This is probably a result of sample selection: only artists who perform

in adjacent years can be used in the analysis if the artist is the unit of observation. These

artists may not be representative of all artists, and their prices appear to be growing very

rapidly, especially when base period quantities are used as weights. It is also interesting

to note that when the venue is used as the unit of observation, the growth in the Paasche

index exceeds that of the Laspeyres index in two of the three subperiods.

        A final issue about price indices worth mentioning involves rationing. The price

indices, which already have well known deficiencies as measures of the cost of living

(see Moulton, 1996), are even more problematic if there is rationing. If a concert is sold

out, there is likely some degree of rationing. In 2003, a third of tickets sold were to

concerts that were sold out, down from 55 percent in the 1980s. These figures may




                                                                                            17
overstate the amount of rationing, however, if artists perform multiple shows in the same

city, and tickets are available for some shows.

4.2 Shows, Sales and Revenues

         Figures 4.3a, 4.3b and 4.3c, taken from Krueger (2004), summarize trends in the

number of shows performed, tickets sold, and revenue collected from 1981 to 2003. The

figures restrict the sample to artists in the Rolling Stone Encyclopedia because coverage

in the Pollstar database should be more consistent for these artists.9

         Several trends are noteworthy. First, the number of shows performed rose in the

1980s, plateaued in the first half of the 1990s, and has declined by 16 percent from 1996

to 2003.

         Second, the number of concert tickets sold by these bands fluctuated around 30

million per year from the late 1980s until 2000, and has dropped since 2000. In 2003, 22

million tickets were sold to concerts performed by these bands. The drop in ticket sales

is also consistent with a Gallup poll, which found that the percentage of teenagers who

said they attended a rock concert fell from 40 percent in 1976 to 31 percent in 2000. (By

contrast, the percent of teens who said they attended a pro sports event rose from 43

percent to 63 percent over this period.)

         Third, despite flat or declining tickets sales, total revenues (in 2003 dollars)

trended upwards until 2000 because of price increases. Other things equal, these trends

suggest the elasticity of demand was less than 1 before 2000. Since 2000, however, there

has been a 10 percent drop in ticket revenue for these artists, suggesting that prices

increases have been offset by a larger than proportional demand response.


9
 The trend in capacity utilization for the full universe is similar to that for the Encyclopedia bands, but the
number of shows and tickets sold has trended upwards if the larger sample is used.


                                                                                                             18
        Another trend worth noting is that the capacity utilization rate, or the fraction of

available seats that are sold, has fallen over the last two decades. The fraction of tickets

sold fell from around 90 percent in the late 1980s to just over 75 percent in 2003.

Interestingly, the drop in the capacity utilization rate was much steeper for concerts held

in larger venues.

        One possible interpretation of these trends is that these artists are becoming less

popular. But this view is hard to reconcile with the sharp increase in ticket prices for

Encyclopedia bands. Instead, it seems that price growth is causing a movement up the

demand curve for tickets.

4.3 Distribution of Revenues

        As was documented, concert revenues increased in the 1980s and 1990s. Figure

4.4 displays the share of ticket revenue going to the top 1% and top 5% of all performers,

ranked by their total annual concert revenue. Bear in mind that these are ticket revenues,

and not income, but they still indicate how the fan dollars are allocated across the

distribution of acts.

        The figure indicates that concert revenues became markedly more skewed in the

1980s and 1990s. In 1982, the top 1% of artists took in 26% of concert revenue; in 2003

that figure was 56%. By contrast, the top 1% of income tax filers in the U.S. garnered

“just”14.6% of adjusted gross income in 1998 (see Piketty and Saez, 2003). The top 5%

of revenue generators took in 62% of concert revenue in 1982 and 84% in 2003. Surely,

this is a market where superstars receive the lion’s share of the income. We return to the

issue of superstar effects in section 7.




                                                                                               19
           To further investigate the distribution of concert revenues, we followed De

Vany’s (2005) and De Vany and Walls (2004), and fit a Pareto distribution to the revenue

data. As is well known, a Pareto distribution is characterized by thick tails (on one or

both sides), and thus provides a good fit for income distributions. The Pareto distribution

is part of a more general class of stable distributions, S(α,β,γ,δ), of which the Gaussian is

also a special case. The parameter of interest here is α, the tail weight, with 0 < α ≤ 2. A

tail weight of 2 implies a normal distribution. As α approaches 0, greater weight is

placed in the tail of the distribution. To estimate α, we used a simple regression

method.10 We first assigned ranks to each artist’s 2003 revenues, with rank 1 indicating

the highest revenue, rank 2 the second highest, and so on. Then we regressed log revenue

on the log of the ranks as follows:

(4.2) Log(Revenue) = a – b Log(Rank),

where the inverse of b is an estimate of α. Note that in the class of stable distributions,

the variance is infinite when α is less than 2, and when α is less than 1 the mean does not

necessarily exist either.

           We used this method to estimate α for the distribution of artists’ concert revenues,

as well as for promoters’ revenues, in 2003. We find a coefficient α of 0.45 for artists’

revenues, and 0.55 for promoters’ revenues. In comparison, De Vany (2005) and De

Vany and Walls (2004) estimate α to be in the range 1.3 to 1.7 for motion picture box

office revenues. This suggests that the concert performers’ revenues are not only very far

from being Gaussian, but they are also more skewed than movie revenues. Probably a

more appropriate point of comparison for artists’ revenues is actors’ lifetime cumulative

movie grosses, however, for which De Vany estimates an α of 0.4 – very close to what
10
     See De Vany (2004).


                                                                                              20
we find for artists’ revenues in 2003. Thus, the movie stars’ lifetime revenues are

positively skewed to about the same degree as concert performers’ annual revenues.

        Despite the infinite expected variance of revenues in the parametric distribution,

in the finite sample of data we have the distribution of artists’ revenues is fairly stable

from year to year, with a correlation of 0.75 between revenues in 2002 and 2003.

Promoters’ revenues are even more stable, with a correlation of 0.98 between 2002 and

2003.

4.4. Explanations: Baumol and Bowen’s disease; Cartelization; Bowie Theory

        Krueger (2005) examines several explanations for the coincidence of declining

ticket sales and rising prices, which he notes is consistent with the market becoming more

monopolized over time, and inconsistent with a downward shift in demand. We consider

these in turn.

        In some respects, popular music concerts are a slow productivity growth sector: it

takes just as long and about as many people to perform a concert today as it did 20 years

ago. As Baumol and Bowen (1966) point out, prices should rise faster than overall

inflation in low-productivity growth sectors because of cost increases. Baumol and

Bowen’s disease may well account for the mildly faster price growth in live

entertainment events than overall price inflation in the pre-1996 period. Yet it is unlikely

that there was a discrete jump in costs in the concert industry compared to other

industries – let alone other entertainment industries – after 1996. Indeed, reductions in

the costs of audiovisual electronics equipment probably reduced the cost of concerts.

Nevertheless, some concert promoters do point to an increase in production costs (e.g.,

pyrotechnics) and insurance costs as a rationale for the acceleration in prices.




                                                                                              21
        Another popular explanation for the acceleration in concert prices is that the

concert industry has become monopolized by Clear Channel Communications, the giant

multimedia conglomerate. On the surface, there is an air of plausibility to this story.

After the Telecommunications Act of 1996 relaxed constraints on radio station

ownership, Clear Channel acquired nearly 1,200 stations. It also owns amphitheaters,

billboards and TV stations. Clear Channel entered the concert promotion business in a

major way by acquiring SFX Entertainment in 2000. As shown in Figure 4.5, the share

of concert revenue that Clear Channel promotes rose dramatically from 1999 to 2001 and

then fell sharply in 2002 and 2003. Despite the recent dip, concentration in the industry

is still high at the national level.

        Many critics have accused Clear Channel of using its vertical and horizontal

concentration to monopolize the concert industry. Although anecdotal evidence abounds,

and some court cases have charged Clear Channel with anticompetitive practices,

Krueger finds little evidence linking Clear Channel to the sharp growth in concert prices.

        First, he finds that Clear Channel’s share of listeners in the radio market in a city

was unrelated to the share of ticket revenue for concerts promoted by Clear Channel in

those markets in 2000 and 2001. Additionally, at either the city or state level, Clear

Channel’s share of concert promotion dollars was insignificantly or negatively related to

the growth in prices. It is possible that Clear Channel uses its muscle to sign up concerts

for national or international tours, obscuring the city- and state-level correlations, but it is

surprising that the company does not exercise its monopoly position at a regional level as

well.




                                                                                             22
       Another fact that casts doubt on Clear Channel’s role is that ticket prices have

also risen sharply in Canada and Europe since the mid-1990's. Although, to some extent,

prices are arbitraged between countries because bands play across national borders, it is

unlikely that deregulation of radio in the United States and the rise of Clear Channel can

account for concert price growth worldwide.

       Perhaps the most important strand of evidence against the concentration argument

is that concert promotion has always been a highly concentrated business on a regional

level. In the 24 largest cities, the four-firm concentration ratio within cities has hovered

around 90%, on average, for the last two decades. The average within-city Herfindahl-

Hirschman Index (HHI) for promoters actually fell from a lofty 4,200 in 1986 to a still

high but less lofty value of 2,800 in 2001. (An industry with an HHI above 1,800 is

considered highly concentrated according to the Justice Department Merger Guidelines.)

Thus, the concert industry has gone from having regional monopolies to having a large

national firm, but within cities competition could quite possibly have increased.

       Krueger’s final hypothesis is that concert prices have accelerated because

recording artists have seen a large decline in their income from record sales, a

complementary product to concerts. Record sales slumped from 1999 to 2002, and were

flat for 5 years before then, putting downward pressure on artists' royalties (see

Weinraub, 2002). As discussed in Section 9, it is quite possible that record sales are

down because many potential customers frequently download music free from the Web

or copy CD’s, either legally or illegally.

       Formally, the problem is one of a firm with two complementary outputs, concert

seats and record albums, denoted good 1 and good 2, and monopoly power in both




                                                                                           23
markets (see Tirole, 1988 or Rosen and Rosenfield, 1997). The demand curves for the

band’s products are denoted D1(p1,p2) and D2(p1,p2), each of which depends on both

prices. Costs are independent of each other and depend only on the quantity of the

specific good produced, C1(D1) and C2(D2). A profit maximizing band will set the

proportionate markup of concert tickets over marginal cost so that:

              p1 − C1'    1 ( p 2 − C 2' ) D2 ε 12
(4.3)                  =      +
                 p1      ε 11     p1 D1ε 11

where the ε ij’s represent the value of the own- or cross-price elasticities of demand.

Bands will keep the price of concerts below the single-market monopoly price if greater

attendance raises record royalties, but if this is no longer the case because of file sharing

or CD copying, the price of concerts will rise.

         To some extent, this model was anticipated by the rock and roll singer David

Bowie, who predicted that, “Music itself is going to become like running water or

electricity” and he advised performers, “You'd better be prepared for doing a lot of

touring because that's really the only unique situation that's going to be left.” (Quoted

from Pareles, 2002.) Hence the name Bowie Theory.

         As support, Krueger (2005) notes that relative to album sales, jazz fans are much

less likely to download music from the Web than are fans of rock and pop, and that from

1996 to 2003 concert prices increased by only 20 percent for jazz musicians, but by 99

percent for rock and pop performers.11 The declining complementarities argument can

also account for the price growth in Canada and Europe. Section 9 provides a detailed

review of the direct evidence on the effect of file sharing on record sales, and concludes

11
  Oberholzer and Strumpf (2004) note that jazz is the genre least downloaded on the internet, but do not
provide a reason. Perhaps it is that MP3 files are of lower quality than CDs, and that jazz enthusiasts value
quality more than others.


                                                                                                           24
that the evidence is mixed. Thus, the reason for the sharp acceleration in concert prices

remains something of an open question.



5. Ticket Distribution and Scalping

        As was mentioned, promoters and venues utilize a variety of options for ticket

distribution, including the box office, Ticketmaster, and direct sales to fan clubs. Tickets

are almost always initially distributed at a fixed price, as opposed to a floating price

determined by an auction or other mechanism. Ticketmaster and other distributors have

recently begun experimenting with using auctions to sell tickets, however. We suspect

that ticket auctions will be more prevalent in the future, and a worthy topic for research.

        About a third of popular music concerts currently sell out. Tickets for the hottest

concerts are often sold on a secondary market, through unregistered scalpers, over the

web (e.g., eBay), or through ticket brokers (who can also be online). These distribution

channels are often lumped together and viewed as a scalper or secondary market.

Persistent pricing of tickets at a level that permits scalping is a puzzle for neoclassical

economic models of concerts. Why don’t performers or promoters raise the price of

tickets and capture some of the revenue from the secondary market for themselves?12

Below we consider theoretical issues and available evidence on scalping.

5.1 Scalping: Theoretical Issues

        Various theories have been proposed for why a firm – restaurant, ski lift, or rock

band – may price their services below the market level. None of them is entirely


12
  As an aside, we note that Warren Buffett recently came to this realization. Tickets for the annual
meeting of Berkshire Hathaway were given to shareholders, and then often resold. Apparently, Mr. Buffett
was distressed by this practice, and began selling tickets for $5 a pair on eBay in 2004 to capture the
secondary market.


                                                                                                     25
satisfactory. Becker (1991) presents a model in which eating at a popular restaurant (or

going to a concert) is a social event, so customers’ demands are positively related. The

bigger the audience, the more enjoyable the experience. Concert promoters and fans

often do treat concerts like social events, lending some credence to this view. As Courty

(2000) points out, however, although Becker’s model “explains why a firm may not raise

prices in the short run when capacity is fixed, it does not shed much light on the long run

outcome that firms typically do not raise capacity to meet excess demand.” Kahneman,

et al. (1986) argue that customers value being treated fairly, and the market clearing price

may be considered unfair. Fairness is likely to be a more important consideration if

attendance at a concert is viewed as a social event rather than an economic transaction.

       Courty (2003) makes the insightful point that customers for live entertainment

events have time-dependent demands. He presents a model in which there are two types

of consumers: die-hard fans who want to see a concert and secure a ticket in advance, and

others who are not sure if they will be free during the concert. As time elapses, the

uncertainty is resolved for the latter group. The late-demanders have higher valuations of

the event than the die-hard fans in his model. He further assumes that promoters cannot

compete with ticket brokers or scalpers, and that die-hard fans outnumber the late

deciders. With these assumptions, in equilibrium ticket brokers will buy tickets early at

face value and resell them for a profit. Although the model requires many ancillary

assumptions to prevent promoters from taking over the secondary market, the observation

that some customers learn about their demand over time is undoubtedly an important

feature of the ticket market.

5.2 Evidence on Scalping




                                                                                           26
        Because scalping is primarily an underground activity, little systematic empirical

analysis has been done on secondary ticket markets. In an effort to make a small step

toward closing that void, one of us (Krueger) conducted a survey of 858 fans at Bruce

Springsteen and the E Street Band’s concert at the First Union Center in Philadelphia on

October 6, 2002, with the help of 12 Princeton students.13 As was common in the past,

every ticket in the house was originally sold for a single price, $75 (plus service charge if

distributed by Ticketmaster). The concert was part of the group’s “The Rising” tour, and

it quickly sold out when tickets were put on sale. Thus, the concert would be expected to

have a high scalping rate.

        Several results of the survey are worth noting. First, only 20 to 25 percent of the

tickets were bought through a scalper or ticket broker or over the Web. Many industry

analysts had expected a higher reselling rate prior to the survey. Scalping at the stadium

was quite rare; it was much more common for the secondary market to clear through

purchases from licensed ticket brokers or the web. Second, the average ticket that was

resold went for around $280, yet most fans paid the list price. Third, tickets for the best

seats were less likely to be resold than were seats in the upper deck, even though the

consumer surplus was greater for the better seats. One interpretation of this finding is

that serious fans queued for tickets (or applied to Ticketmaster early), and if they

obtained a good seat they attended the concert and if they obtained a bad one they sold it.

This finding, which was not anticipated, is consistent with how one would expect tickets

to be allocated in a market: those who valued the best seats the most were the ones who


13
  The survey of fans was conducted shortly before the concert began. A stratified random sample of rows
and sections was drawn. Weights were computed to make the sample representative of the entire venue.
The response rate for the survey was very high. Ticketmaster and the First Union Center arranged for us to
have access to the venue before the start of the show.


                                                                                                       27
sat in them. But one could argue that the distribution mechanism is inefficient (e.g.,

because of time wasted queuing and uncertainty), even if it mimics the market in terms of

allocative efficiency.

       Fourth, fans were asked when they purchased their tickets, in an effort to test

Courty’s model of scalping. The results yielded mixed support. On the one hand, tickets

on the secondary market were purchased later than tickets sold by Ticketmaster or the

box office, as expected. (Ninety percent of those who purchased their tickets from the

box office or Ticketmaster bought their tickets more than a month before the concert,

compared with 47 percent of those who bought from ticket brokers.) On the other hand,

the price did not rise as the date of the concert approached, as Courty’s model would

seem to predict. Instead, prices on the secondary market fell as the day of the concert

approached, consistent with the literature on the declining price anomaly in auctions (see

Ashenfelter, 1989).

       Fifth, the concert would have earned substantially more revenue if tickets were

priced high enough to eliminate the secondary market. If the market price equaled $280,

the average price of a ticket in the secondary market, then $4 million [= ($280-$75) x

19,738 tickets ] of additional revenue could have been collected by Springsteen and his

band. Given that the actual revenues collected were $1.5 million, this figure is staggering

even if one allows for some error. The revenue foregone by the band in the secondary

market alone was sizable, between $1.1 and $1.4 million, according to our estimates.

These calculations suggest that, at least in the short run, performers sacrifice considerable

income if they price their shows below the market rate.




                                                                                          28
       An important cautionary note, however, is that these results pertain to just one

concert, and it is unclear whether they generalize to concerts for other performers. The

nature of the First Union Center, which is isolated alongside Intestate 95, may also have

led to less on-the-street scalping than in other, more centrally located venues. But we

would argue that replicating this type of survey in other concerts will yield valuable

insights into secondary markets.

5.3 Scalping and Price Trends

       An important question concerns the effect of the secondary market on the trends

documented in Section 4. We have seen that the secondary market can be substantial, at

least for some concerts. It is possible that the list price does not represent the price to

consumers, because of widespread scalping. Perhaps the rise in ticket list prices has only

cut out scalpers, and not affected the price to consumers.

       Although we have no doubt that the secondary market is important in the popular

music industry, the following three reasons lead us to doubt that a disconnect between the

list price and price to consumers is responsible for the major trends documented in

Section 4. First, the total number of tickets sold has declined. If concerts are no more

expensive to consumers than before, then one would not expect to see attendance fall.

Second, the decline in the capacity utilization rate also suggests that customers are

finding concerts more costly. Moreover, even in the early 1990s, most concerts did not

sell out, so it would have been possible to avoid the higher priced secondary market.

Third, Krueger (2005) found that prices surged in the late 1990s even when he limited the

sample to concerts that sold fewer than 90 percent of their tickets, events where scalping

would have been unnecessary.




                                                                                              29
6. Rankings

        It is common in the arts for various parties to devise schemes for ranking artists.

Music is no exception. For example, Billboard provides numerous “music charts” based

on record album sales and radio airplay. Being ranked high on the charts is important to

artists because future sales and recording contracts are related to their placement on the

charts. Evidently, many consumers turn to rankings to decide which music to purchase or

listen to, and radio stations rely on the charts to determine which music to play on the air.

When information is costly to obtain, rankings can be very valuable to consumers,

especially for goods that have social externalities (e.g., when you play music at a party,

you would like your guests to enjoy the music).

        Pollstar produces three sets of rankings of bands: one based on gross concert

revenue; one based on the number of tickets sold; and one based on the number of hits

seeking information about each band’s schedule on its web page. Although useful, these

methods have their limitations. An important limitation can be seen from Figure 6.1.

Hypothetical demand schedules for three bands, denoted A, B, and C, are reported. As

drawn, the demand curves all have the same slope but different intercepts. Band C is the

most popular: at any given price, it has the greatest ticket demand.

        We can write the demand curves in Figure 6.1 as:

(6.1) Log Qi = ai - , log Pi

where Q is quantity of tickets sold, P is price, ai is an indicator of band popularity, and , is

the elasticity of demand. The subscript i indicates the band. This constant elasticity

demand curve is, of course, a simplification, but it illustrates a serious problem with



                                                                                             30
current rankings, and provides an easily implemented solution. A more realistic model

would also allow for the elasticity (,i) to vary across bands, but greatly increase the

parameters needed for implementation.14

         Now if the market clears, the band’s concert supply curve also affects revenues

and ticket sales. (We will discuss disequilibrium shortly.) Bands have different concert

supply functions. Suppose band C hardly tours (e.g., Barbra Streisand) and band A tours

a great deal (e.g., Dave Matthews). Band A could sell more tickets than band C and

collect more revenue if it wanted. This framework highlights problems with Pollstar’s

methods for ranking bands. First, it is clear from equation 6.1 that as long as the band is

on the demand curve, the quantity of tickets sold is not a good indicator of popularity

because price varies. Second, total revenue would only be an appropriate measure of

popularity in the unlikely event that the elasticity of demand equaled 1. Third, bands that

tour frequently (or set prices lower) are likely to receive more hits from potential

consumers on the web, but that reflects concert supply as well as popularity.

         A simple solution is to rank the bands according to ai = Log Qi + , log Pi. To

implement this solution, one needs an estimate of ,. The first two columns of Table 6.1

provide rankings of the top 50 bands using ,=1 and ,=2.15 The former corresponds to the

Pollstar Top 100 Tour ranking, which is based on gross revenue.

         If the market is in disequilibrium, the price and quantity may not be determined

on the demand curve. In particular, if the band sets the ticket price below the market

clearing level, the quantity of tickets demanded at the list price will exceed the quantity

14
   Another addition to the model would be to allow for rival bands’ prices to affect the demand for band i’s
concerts, and then take into account the effect of all other band’s price on the choice of band i’s price. We
will leave this extension for IO economists.
15
   For simplicity, we have ignored price discrimination, and just used the average concert price as a
measure of pi.


                                                                                                           31
of tickets sold, and our method would not provide an accurate measure of ai. We can still

conceptualize notional demand curves in this situation, however. The challenge is to

determine how much excess demand exists. As we saw in the previous section, at the

Bruce Springsteen concert about 25 percent of tickets were purchased above the list price,

suggesting that excess demand was at least 25 percent as large as the number of tickets

sold. (An alternative method for estimating excess demand would be to use information

on the number of willing -- or at least interested -- buyers who sought tickets from on-line

sales venues after tickets were sold out.) A simple solution is to apply the 25 percent

figure to all concerts that sell out. Accordingly, in columns 3 and 4 of Table 6.1, we

inflated the quantity of tickets sold by 25 percent in all sold out concerts, and recomputed

the rankings for ,=1 and ,=2.

       For comparison, in column 5 we present the ranking based on revenue per show,

which can be thought of as a crude indicator of the performers’ wage rate. If demand for

artists’ performances were infinitely elastic, as in a competitive market, this would

provide a ranking of artists’ potential income. And lastly in column 6 we report the

ranking based on total tickets sold, which is one of Pollstar’s criteria.

       The results are sensitive to the type of ranking. Bruce Springsteen and the E

Street Band, for instance, move from the top ranked artists by revenue in 2003 to second

place when an elasticity of demand of 2 is used (or 3rd place if rationing is taken into

account), to fifth place when revenue per show is used, and back to first place when the

number of tickets is the basis of the ordering. Celine Dion is ranked second based on

revenue and 14th based on tickets sold. The Rolling Stones move from 13th to 5th place

when the elasticity is increased from 1 to 2. Overall, however, the rankings are fairly




                                                                                           32
similar if popularity (ai) is the criteria (the correlation between the ranks in column 3 and

4 is 0.91), and quite different if revenue per show or total tickets sold is the criterion (the

correlation between columns 4 and 5 is 0.56).

        We should emphasize that our framework misses many important features of the

concert industry. Most importantly, we have made an ad hoc assumption about the

elasticity of demand, and imposed the same elasticity for all bands. In addition, we have

ignored advertising and promotion efforts, which are endogenous and undoubtedly

influence ticket sales. A more complete approach would adjust for promotion efforts.

Nevertheless, considering rankings in the framework of a simple supply and demand

model highlights an often overlooked feature of existing rankings: popularity depends on

both price and quantity. This simple insight applies to record sales as well as to concerts.



7. Superstar Effects

        As we saw in section 4.3, the distribution of concert revenues is highly skewed,

suggesting that the music industry is a superstar industry, where a small fraction of the

performers earn a substantial share of the revenues. Sherwin Rosen (1981) was the first

to provide a formal theoretical model to explain why “relatively small numbers of people

earn enormous amounts of money and seem to dominate the fields in which they

engage.” Building on the intuition of Marshall (1947), Rosen models a market where

demand is characterized by imperfect substitution among the sellers (here, the

performers), and where “the costs of production (writing, performing, etc.) do not rise in

proportion to the size of a seller’s market.” At the heart of the imperfect substitution of

performers is the notion of quality, or talent, of a performer. As Rosen (1981) puts it,




                                                                                             33
“Lesser talent often is a poor substitute for greater talent. The worse it is the larger the

sustainable rent accruing to higher quality sellers because demand for the better sellers

increases more than proportionately: hearing a succession of mediocre singers does not

add up to a single outstanding performance.” When combining the demand and supply as

depicted above, Rosen ends up with a market equilibrium in which small differences in

talent at the top of the distribution can account for large differences in revenue.

       Borghans and Groot (1998) also address the issue of superstardom, arguing that a

certain degree of monopolistic power of the artist generates higher revenues for

superstars, on top of a difference in talent. They note that a stylized fact concerning

superstars is that those whose talent is "suitable for media replication" earn much more

than others. They argue that the availability of a mass media market gives the most

talented artists an endogenous property right, derived from the fact that the public prefers

to watch the best performances – consistent with the imperfect substitution assumption of

Rosen's model. Borghans and Groot conclude that, "Due to media production, only one

person is needed to serve the whole market, where without this technology many

producers are needed. Efficient allocation requires the most talented producer to be

assigned to this task, but in practice the situation provides this person with an opportunity

to exploit the number-one position."

       Adler (2005) takes exception with Rosen’s view of talent, and maintains that

superstars do not exist because of differences in talent, but because of “the need of

consumers to have a common culture.” Because Adler’s chapter thoroughly addresses

this and related issues, we tread lightly on theoretical aspects of superstar models.




                                                                                               34
       Empirical evidence and tests of the superstar model are not straightforward,

because of the lack of reliable income data and, more importantly, because of the

inherent difficulty of objectively measuring talent or quality in a meaningful metric apart

from economic success. What is a small difference in talent? On what objective,

cardinal metric is Celine Dion only slightly more talented than Rod Stewart? As Krueger

(2005) notes, “An objective measure of star quality for popular musicians is hard to

define and even harder to quantify.” Measuring talent on a meaningful scale

independently of economic success is an obstacle to testing the superstar model.

       Hamlen (1991, 1994) looks at singers of popular music, and uses a measure of

voice quality to assess the artist’s quality. The measure, which is external and objective,

is the harmonic content of a singer’s voice sample. Hamlen then regresses the value of

total record sales on harmonic content and a few observables for 107 singers, and finds an

elasticity of 0.14. Since the Marshall-Rosen model would predict an elasticity above

unity, Hamlen concludes that his empirical findings do not support the superstar model.

Krueger (2005) points out, however, that “it is unclear whether the scaling of units of

quality is appropriate (a different scaling could produce an elasticity above 1) and

consideration of other dimensions of star quality could possibly rescue the theory.”

       Krueger (2005) considers escalating superstar effects – perhaps due to the

revolution in consumer electronics equipment which reduce the cost of copying and

listening to music – as a possible explanation for the rising cost of concert tickets and

increased concentration in concert revenue, which were documented in section 4.

Specifically, he tests whether the increase in prices (or revenue per artist) could be linked

to a stronger superstar effect over in the 1990s. He uses a novel measure of star quality:




                                                                                            35
namely, the number of millimeters of print that are devoted to each artist in The Rolling

Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll.16 This information is then merged with the Pollstar

data on concert revenue and prices, and the following regression is estimated:

(7.1) ln Yit = α+ βt Si + x'itγ + δt + εit,

where ln Yit is the log average price (or log annual revenue or log revenue per show), Si is

the measure of Star Quality, x'it is a vector of covariates (number of supporting acts, years

of experience of the band, and dummies for genre, gender and foreign status), δt is a set

of 22 unrestricted year fixed effects, and εit is an error term.

           Notice that the coefficient on star quality, β, has a t subscript, indicating time

period (1981-86, 1987-91, or 1997-2003). This allows the effect of star quality to vary

across time periods. In the regressions, this is accomplished by interacting the amount of

print with dummies indicating the four periods. The test of the rising-return-to-

superstardom hypothesis amounts to a test of whether there is a discrete jump in βt after

1996.

           Krueger finds that the return to superstardom has indeed increased over time, but

that the timing does not coincide with the increase in ticket prices. He concludes that we

must look at other factors to explain the rising prices.

           Empirical testing of superstar models lags behind the development of new

theoretical versions of the model. At least when it comes to music, and probably for

many other branches of the arts, a major limitation of tests of superstar models is the

absence of natural units with which to measure talent. Rosen postulates that “small

differences in talent become magnified in larger earnings differences.” But what is a

“small” difference in quality of popular music performers? Surely there is an
16
     See Krueger (2005) for a more detailed explanation of the data and procedures.


                                                                                                36
intrinsically subjective component to quality; some music appeals to a subset of listeners

but not to others. Also, one might argue that talent should be measured within genres:

otherwise, how is it possible to compare a jazz band to a heavy metal band? More

empirical work could certainly be done on the superstar model, and perhaps the popular

music industry could help shed light on some distributional and marginal return to labor

issues in broader fields, but we are skeptical that current methods of measuring talent will

shed much light on the superstar model.



8. The World of Radio Broadcasting

        Ever since radio broadcasts started in the United States, England, and other

countries in the early 1920s, the business of radio has been intertwined with that of

music. As we will see, even if at first record companies and music publishers’ profits

were threatened by the supply of “free” music on the radio, they quickly learned to

promote their records and collect royalties from performing rights sold to radio

broadcasters. Now, bands and composers also benefit from radio exposure. From a

publicity standpoint, radio is an important part of record promotion. And from a royalties

standpoint, composers can garner substantial returns if they have a hit song on the radio.

Table 1.1 documents that artists receive substantial revenue from performing rights

royalties.

8.1. Royalties from performing rights

        Under Section 106 of the U.S. Copyright Act, a copyright on a musical work

grants an exclusive right to reproduce, distribute copies, publicly perform, and create a

derivative of the work in question. Thus, anyone who wants to legally play a copyrighted




                                                                                            37
song on the radio, or press it on a compilation CD, must acquire a license to do so from

the copyright owner. Artists generally transact with music publishing firms, which are

often but not always affiliated with their record company, to collect their publishing

income. Music publishers acquire administrative rights from the copyright owner, which

entitle them to find users, issue licenses, collect money and pay the songwriter. The

traditional split of publishing income is 50/50 between the publisher and the songwriter

(see Passman, 2000; and Krasilovsky et al., 2003).

         Various uses of a musical work are covered by different rights that must be

purchased separately. Table 8.1 summarizes these rights.

         The reproduction right is the exclusive right of a music copyright owner to

authorize the mechanical reproduction of the work in a record, cassette or CD. The

license granting such a right is called a mechanical license, and the fees charged for it are

the mechanical royalties, calculated at a certain rate per song and per unit manufactured

and sold.17 In the case of audiovisual productions, the license of reproduction rights is

often referred to as a synchronization license, because the music is to be synchronized

with the images.

         The public performance right gives the copyright owner the exclusive right to

authorize the use of the musical work in public. Radio and television broadcasts, as well

as jukeboxes and music played in bars, restaurants and any type of public establishment,

all fall under the public performance right. As such, broadcasters and establishment

owners must acquire public performance licenses anytime they want to use copyrighted

music. Because searching and bargaining with every single copyright owner and

17
  Once a work has been made available to the public (after its first-use), a copyright owner is obligated to
grant a mechanical license to anyone paying the statutory rate. For this reason, it is called a compulsory
mechanical license.


                                                                                                          38
publisher would prove costly and infeasible, and because an individual owner of

copyrighted music could not possibly survey all the radio stations to enforce his public

performance right, all licenses are handled by performance rights organizations (PROs).

PROs issue public performing licenses to broadcasters and establishment owners,

monitor and survey radio and television broadcasts to determine the amount of airplay for

each composition, and then remunerate the copyright owners.

        Performing rights also cover cellular phone ringtones, which cell phone owners

increasingly download from the internet. In 2003, ringtones were a $2.5 billion industry

worldwide (Flynn, 2004)! PROs have struck deals with the ringtone providers, and now

compensate composers for each ringtone downloaded. On their website, BMI, one of the

American performing rights organizations, boasts of having deals with 175 ringtone

providers reaching more than 90% of U.S. cell phone subscribers. BMI’s payments are

of 5¢ per ringtone, 2.5¢ each for the publisher and the composer.18

        In the United States there are three performing rights organizations, typically

known by the acronyms: ASCAP, BMI and SESAC. All offer blanket licenses, which

grant the right to use all the songs in their respective catalogs.19 Artists and composers

can sign on with only one PRO. Radio stations can contract with multiple PROs. A

radio station that wanted to play both Springsteen and Madonna, for example, would

need to contract with both ASCAP and BMI.

        Founded in 1914, the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers

(ASCAP) is the oldest of the performing rights organizations. It was the first organized

effort to collect fees for public performances of music, which had been protected since

                                                                                                     39
the inception of the Copyright Act of 1897. In its first few years, ASCAP struggled to

establish itself and persuade publishers to become members. Only in 1921 did it write its

first royalty checks to publishers and composers. That is also the time when radio

broadcasting began, suddenly creating a whole new market for ASCAP compositions.

Broadcasters, however, were reticent to pay for the performing rights, arguing that once

they had a copy of the record they were allowed to do whatever they pleased with it,

including playing it on the radio. By 1932, the radio lobby had convinced seven states to

outlaw ASCAP, on the basis of illegal racketeering practices and attempted extortion.

Eliot (1993) relates: “In 1940, as many of the contracts ASCAP held were about to

expire, the organization threatened to withdraw all member recordings if radio stations

didn’t agree to a broad-based, cohesive form of royalty payment. …. In retaliation, even

as the FCC was threatening to outlaw the paying of records on the air, which ASCAP felt

was largely the result of the broadcast lobby, station owners decided to start their own

organization, to break what they claimed was ASCAP’s monopolistic tactics.”

       Kleit (2000) notes that ASCAP’s blanket license rate rose from 2% to 7.5% in the

1930s, parallel with the popularization of radio. Needless to say, the radio broadcasters

were unhappy with the rising cost of the copyrighted music. To increase competition and

to provide an alternative to writers and publishers not represented by ASCAP, the

National Association of Broadcasters, together with NBC and CBS, created Broadcast

Music Incorporated (BMI) in 1939.

       ASCAP is now a not-for-profit entity owned by its members. The membership

totals more than 180,000, including composers, songwriters, lyricists, and music

publishers of every kind of music. Approximately 100,000 new songs are added to the




                                                                                           40
catalog every year. The fees charged by ASCAP for its blanket license are not based on

the amount of airplay its music gets, but on the station’s or venue’s gross revenues less

certain adjustments. The current basic rate is just under 2% of the adjusted gross

advertising revenue for radio stations. BMI is a non-profit company owned by

broadcasters. It now represents approximately 300,000 songwriters, composers, and

music publishers in all musical genres, and its website mentions a repertoire of about 4.5

million compositions. BMI’s blanket license rate for radio stations is about 1.6% of

adjusted gross advertising receipts.

       The Society of European Stage Authors and Composers, or SESAC, is the

smallest of the three American performing rights organizations, with a market share

estimated at 3%. Market shares are not easily computable, but Krasilovsky et al. (2003)

report that a 1990 court proceeding concerning pay cable determined the current market

shares at 54% for ASCAP, 43% for BMI and the remaining 3% for SESAC. SESAC is a

for-profit private licensing company founded in 1930. It currently represents over 8,000

publishers and writers and has a repertoire of more than 200,000 compositions. SESAC

specializes in country and Latin music, and operates differently from ASCAP and BMI.

It has a somewhat more selective procedure to accept new writers in their catalog, but

also it charges fees for blanket licenses based on fixed determinants, such as market

population served by the radio station and the station’s standard advertisement rates.

       While law papers on the topic abound, few articles have been written about

performing rights in the economic literature. Notable exceptions include Besen, Kirby

and Salop’s (1992) article on copyright collectives and Kleit’s (2000) study of

competition among PROs. Besen, Kirby and Salop present an economic model that




                                                                                            41
attempts to explain why copyright collectives are formed, how they operate and how they

may compete. They start with a model of an unregulated monopoly copyright collective,

where the cost for each individual copyright owner to collect fees from the broadcasters

is prohibitively high, justifying the formation of the copyright collective as a means of

saving costs. A collective also gives the copyright owners the possibility of cooperative

price setting, and thus of more market power vis-à-vis big broadcasters. Besen et al. look

at both models where the collective has the ability to limit the membership, and where it

lacks such ability. They analyze the competition between the collectives as well as the

effect of different types of government regulation. No formal statistical tests of their

models are presented, although their predictions accord with certain stylized facts. As

Johnson (1992) notes in a commentary, Besen et al. address the puzzle of the coexistence

of ASCAP and BMI, but cannot test their suggested answer.

       Interestingly, in most countries there is only one copyright collective. Besen et al.

suggest three explanations for this fact: “First, government regulation may authorize only

a single collective to administer a particular right. This is especially likely in countries

like Austria, Germany, and Switzerland, where collectives must be licensed by the

government. Second, government policies that mandate open entry and equal treatment

of members may lead to a single collective. …. Third, efficient negotiation between the

monopoly collective and user groups may eliminate any incentive for competitive entry.”

Why exactly did three organizations come to coexist in the U.S. is still something of a

mystery. Besen et al. suggest that perhaps ASCAP miscalculated its hold on the market,

and by requesting too high fees, it led excluded songwriters and broadcasters to form a

collective of their own.




                                                                                               42
       Kleit (2000) takes the blanket licenses offered by the PROs as a form of bundling,

or block booking. He proposes a model of competition between PROs using blanket

licenses, and shows that such licenses lead to higher profits for the PROs and higher costs

for the users of the copyrighted music when there are a small number of competing

licensing organizations.

8.2.   Music Publishing in the U.S.

       The United States is by far the largest market for music publishing. Table 8.2

gives a breakdown of revenues by source of income. In 2001, the performance-based

revenues alone almost reached $1 billion, for a total publishing income of nearly $2

billion. That represents 29.3% of the world publishing income. By comparison,

Germany, the second biggest market, shows a total income of just over $800 million, for

12.2% of world income (see Table 8.4 below).

8.3. Foreign markets

       In the U.S., both ASCAP and BMI earn just above 20% of their revenue from

foreign sources. Performing rights organizations have agreements with their affiliates in

other countries to share revenues. They both collect revenues from abroad for their

national members, as well as collect from users in the United States on behalf of foreign

PROs. Table 8.3 lists the PROs in the U.S. and the other top ten markets in the world.

       While figures on the flows of revenues from copyright licenses from country to

country are hard to obtain, we can observe total revenues for each country. Table 8.4

shows the top ten countries and the breakdown of the publishing revenues.




                                                                                         43
         Table 8.5 shows ASCAP’s flows of revenues from foreign publishing companies.

Overall, we can see that the balance is positive, meaning that the United States (or at least

ASCAP) is a new exporter of musical talent to the rest of the world.

8.4. Payola

         Payola is the practice of record companies giving cash or gifts to radio stations in

exchange for airplay. Payola is interesting both for its history and from an economics

standpoint because payola is an illegal economic transaction. Payola has been a federal

criminal offense since 1960.20 One may ask, What is wrong with payola? It could be

argued that payola only creates a market for radio hits, a market in which the amount paid

by the record company to the radio station becomes the price of a hit. It is akin to

advertisement and promotion of a song by a record company. Indeed, if record

companies are willing to pay to promote their songs on the radio, it must be that radio

promotion translates into higher record sales.21

         So why has payola become illegal? Perhaps an analogy is instructive. Payola is

analogous to a professor paying bribes to the editor of the American Economic Review to

publish his paper. The professor would be willing to pay since a publication is good for

career advancement, and eventually translates into higher future earnings. But AER

readers expect the published articles to be the best and most relevant to the field, not the

ones written by those with the deepest pockets or the most eager to get tenure. An

essential function of a scientific journal is to screen papers. One could argue that an

   It is legal for a record company to directly pay a radio station to broadcast a song as long as an
announcement is made to the public. Undercover and undisclosed payments are illegal.
21
   Liebowitz (2004a) points out that even though radio spins seem to increase sales of the particular record
being spun, it does not mean that the recording industry as a whole benefits from radio broadcasting.
Indeed, record sales fell in the first half of the 1920s after the popularization of the radio.


                                                                                                          44
essential feature of a radio station is to screen records, especially since the right to

broadcast on the radio waves is licensed by the government.

           Payola has a colorful history. Payola is a contraction of the words “pay” and

“Victrola”, an early type of LP record player.22 The first laws and court cases involving

payola were in 1960, but payola had been around for much longer, and still persists

today, albeit under a different name. Coase (1979) traces the history of payola, going as

far back as 1867 in England. Of course, back then the payments were not made to radio

stations, but to public performers, with a request to play a song from the publisher’s

catalog. The agents that involved in this business were referred to as song-pluggers, and

it became commonplace for vaudeville singers to be compensated for adding certain

songs to their repertoire. When radio came about, song-pluggers turned to big bands

performing live on radio stations to plug their songs. And then, when records made their

appearance on the air, radio stations and their employees were approached by record

companies to play their songs.

           Coase (1979) explains, “Payola took the form of cash payments (which might be

on a regular weekly or monthly basis), royalties on the sales of records, a share in a

record company, advertisements in the disc jockeys’ hit sheets, the reimbursement of

recording stars’ fees for appearances on the disc jockeys’ programs or at record hops

which they organized, expensive gifts, and mortgage loans on disc jockeys’ homes.”

Early on, payola was viewed as an impediment to competition. Many attempts were

made to outlaw the practice, but these attempts only succeeded in pushing payola

underground. The situation changed in 1959, when the president of the American Guild

of Authors and Composers wrote a letter to the FCC (Federal Communications
22
     See http://www.history-of-rock.com/payola.htm .


                                                                                           45
Commission) and the FTC (Federal Trade Commission) about payola and other deceptive

practices, urging a congressional enquiry.23 After a year of widely publicized hearings,

the FCC amended the Communications Act of 1934 to make unannounced payments to

deejays a criminal offense. Over twenty-five deejays and program directors were

exposed in the scandal, but the top two deejays in the country, Dick Clark and Alan

Freed, were the hardest hit.

        Most of the pressure to outlaw payola came from ASCAP, which lost ground to

BMI-licensed rock and roll records from small independent record labels during the

1950s. Coase (1979) points out that “during the period 1948 through 1955, 68% of the

tunes which were number 1 on Billboard’s top hits were controlled by ASCAP, and

ASCAP’s share was never less than 50% (in 1951). In 1956, its share was 23 %, in 1957

and 1958, 25% and in 1959, 31%. In the circumstances, it is hardly surprising to find that

the suppliers of ‘good music’ [ASCAP-licensed music] came to the conclusion that

something was wrong with the economic organization of the popular music industry.”

        After 1960, program directors took over the playlist and left the disc jockeys out

of the loop, shielding them away from payola charges. However, the pay-for-play

business did not stop there. Soon, what became known in the industry as “independent

record promoters” started acting as middlemen between the record companies and the

radio stations, blurring the transactions and making this sort of payment not quite payola,

but with a similar result and intent. Coase (1979) sees this as inevitable: “When a pricing

system is not used and something of value is provided for nothing, people are willing to

incur costs up to its worth in order to secure the benefits of that service.” He goes on to


23
  This came at the end of a Congressional hearing on a television quiz show scandal, in which shows were
exposed to be rigged and fixed in advance.


                                                                                                      46
argue that a payment system “is both natural and desirable,” and that a ban on payola

leads to a lower real income of the community. True enough, independent record

promoters, or indies, could also be compared to food and beverage distributors who pay

for placement in grocery stores, facilitating the connection between wholesaler and

retailer. But Boehlert (2001) warns that “radio isn’t really retail – that’s what the record

stores are. Radio is an entity unique to the music industry. It’s an independent force that,

much to the industry’s chagrin, represents the one tried-and-true way record companies

know to sell their product.”

       How big is the independent promoter business? Boehlert (2001) explains: “There

are 10,000 commercial radio stations in the United States; record companies rely on

approximately 1,000 of the largest to create hits and sell records. Each of those 1,000

stations adds roughly three new songs to its playlist each week. The indies get paid for

every one: $1,000 on average for an “add” at a Top 40 or rock station but as high as

$6,000 or $8,000 under certain circumstances. That’s a minimum $3 million worth of

indie invoices sent out each week.” While it is easy to think that big record companies

have a financial advantage in playing this game, Surowiecki (2004) argues that the big

players already have the biggest names in show business, the biggest sales staff and the

connections that go with it. Independent record promoters could thus enable small labels

to get their artists on the radio, much the same way payola helped propel rock and roll in

the 1950s. “Paying to play, then, creates a rough marketplace democracy: if you can

come up with the cash, you get a shot. But that’s all. Labels can buy themselves




                                                                                           47
exposure; they can’t buy themselves a hit. If people don’t want to hear a record, radio

stations won’t keep playing it of their own accord.”24

        So payola, even if disguised a bit, is still present.25 Whether or not the current

laws are optimal for the society is a good question for economists. Surowiecki (2004)

says that pay for play is simply a signaling mechanism enabling record companies to

signal which songs they think will be hits, thus reducing the radio station’s scouting

efforts. Interesting developments are sure to come, with the growing consolidation of the

radio business and power houses like Clear Channel Communications, which owns well

over 1,000 radio stations in the U.S., and with the advent of internet radio stations and

file sharing. Some stations, such as KROQ in Los Angeles and Clear Channel, also

refuse to accept payment from independent record promoters. Perhaps the record

companies will find new ways to promote their records, or perhaps big radio

conglomerates will need to exert caution and stay away from the independent promoters

business, to avoid payola charges or to enhance their reputation for independent

judgment. It is also possible that large media conglomerates will use their position in

multiple markets to extract even larger payments from record companies.

8.5. Digital Recordings in the Internet Era

        With the advent of new technologies, such as streaming and downloading on the

internet, the Copyright Act no longer provided adequate protection for copyrighted

works. In 1995, the Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act was passed in

an effort to strengthen copyright protection. The Act recognizes that digital

transmissions of sound recordings are required to have an appropriate license.

24
  Surowiecki (2004)
25
  Interestingly, these promotion payments are among the many costs that are deducted from record sales
before bands receive royalties.


                                                                                                         48
Interestingly, the license is administered by SoundExchange, a nonprofit entity created by

the RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America), and not by the performing rights

organizations. Krasilovsky et al. (2003) note that between 1996 and March 2000, 80

million performances were licensed by SoundExchange. The revenues are split: 50%

goes to the record company (NOT the publisher), 45% to the featured musicians and

vocalists, and 5% to an escrow fund for distribution to the nonfeatured musicians and

vocalists. In addition, the Act establishes a statutory digital mechanical license rate,

separate from the one for physical records.

       Another Act was passed in 1998, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. This

Act was designed to implement two 1996 World Intellectual Property Organization

Treaties dealing with copyrights in a digital environment. It provides restrictions on the

use of technologies to copy and transmit copyrighted works, by making it illegal to

circumvent measures put in place to guarantee the copyrights. The next section explicitly

addresses new technologies and copyright issues.



9. File sharing and other new technologies

       Throughout the 20th century, the rise and fall of various technologies have

affected and shaped the way the world listens to music. Broadcasting, first via radio,

jukeboxes, and movies, and then through television, cable television, and satellite

television – including music channels like MTV and VH1 – and, very recently, via

internet webcasts, has allowed music to reach more and more listeners. Sound recordings

also have evolved, with new formats –and along with them new playback machines –

being introduced, and most often completely replacing the earlier generations.




                                                                                           49
Recordings began with Edison’s cylinders and Berliner’s gramophone, then vinyl 33 1/3

rpm records, then 45 rpm singles, eventually followed by 8-track tapes, and then cassette

tapes and Sony’s Walkman. Records, as we know them today, in the form of laser

compact discs (CDs), were introduced in the mid 1980s. By 1992, CD sales eclipsed

cassette sales in the US.26 Since 2000, CDs account for more than 90% of the market,

whether one looks at total value of records sold or number of units shipped. In 2003, the

CD market share was 95%.27

        The supremacy of the compact disc is now threatened by a new format: the MP3,

which stands for MPEG-1 Layer 3, a standardized digital file format that compresses

audio to enable many songs to fit in a small amount of disc space.28 Along with the

spread of broadband internet connections, file sharing and peer-to-peer (P2P) software,

MP3 players have dramatically grown in popularity in the early 2000s. The actual

number of song downloads seems to be impossible to pin down, but estimates suggest

that more than one billion songs are downloaded each week! (See Oberholzer and

Strumpf, 2004; and Zentner, 2004.) While many music lovers rejoice and engage in

massive downloading and illegal file sharing, record companies and many music

copyright holders deplore the practice, alleging that file sharing is responsible for

declining album sales and lower profits. Industry executives were quick to put the blame

on MP3 sharing. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) successfully

sued to shut down Napster in 2001, and as P2P networks provided an alternative platform

for users, the RIAA is now suing thousands of individual users.29

9.1 Intellectual property issues

         Economists have begun to look into the question of file sharing and CD sales.

The situation can be considered from a normative perspective, questioning the legitimacy

of the existence of copyright protection, especially since it can be seen as hindering the

development of new technologies. Indeed, as Liebowitz (2004a) notes: “It is common in

the literature, particularly in the more popular press, to encounter the claim that copyright

owners always cry wolf when a new technology appears to threaten the old, only later to

discover that the new technology was nothing short of a bonanza. This claim implies that

foolish copyright owners misunderstood the new technology and were fortunate enough

to have been thwarted in their attempts to restrict the new technology.”30

         How far does intellectual protection go? Are rights strong enough to encourage

the optimal amount of innovation? The problem stems from the fact that musical

compositions are nonrival goods, whose property rights, as laid out by Nordhaus (1969),

generate a trade-off between under-provision of the nonrival good (with weak rights) on

the one hand and monopoly distortions (when the property rights are strong) on the

other.31 The RIAA is clearly pushing for stronger rights, and is lobbying for greater

governmental control over technology. Romer (2002) points out that “The relevant

economic question is whether the net harm (if any) created by a shift along the Nordhaus

trade-off justifies this kind of intervention.” He also warns that “giving an industry veto



30
   Liebowitz (2004a) goes on to argue that, for example, when the VCRs were introduced, television
broadcasters had a legitimate concern because of the possibility that users would be able to time-shift
television viewing and thus kill the possibility for broadcasters to sell advertisement, their principal source
of revenue.
31
   Musical compositions are nonrival goods, since once their reproduction cost is paid, they can be
simultaneously enjoyed by many. Efficiency would dictate a price (above reproduction costs) of zero, but
then composers would be underpaid, and the production of music recordings would be too low. See
Liebowitz (2003b).


                                                                                                             51
power over new technologies that threaten its current business model would set a very

dangerous public-policy precedent.”

        Boldrin and Levine (2002) argue against intellectual property protection. They

present a model of competition where downstream licensing, in this case copyright

protection, leads to the Pareto worst outcome, whereas a case without copyrights results

in first-best. “‘Intellectual property’ has come to mean not only the right to own and sell

ideas, but also the right to regulate their use. This creates a socially inefficient monopoly,

and what is commonly called intellectual property might be better called ‘intellectual

monopoly’.” Klein, Lerner and Murphy (2002) reject Boldrin and Levine’s model and

reach the opposite conclusion: file sharing technologies reduce the value of the copyright

to its holder.32 These models remain theoretical, without any support from empirical

evidence.33 The first question to ask here is whether or not there exists a causal

relationship between file sharing and the slump in CD sales.

9.2. Does file sharing lower CD sales? Preliminary considerations

        There is no unambiguous theoretical prediction regarding the effect of MP3 file

sharing, or other illegal forms of music piracy, on CD sales. Various effects have been

suggested that point in opposing directions. Furthermore, available evidence is, at best,

mixed. Liebowitz (2004b) and Peitz and Waelbroeck (2004b) present the most thorough

reviews of the existing theoretical and empirical literatures. Before we review the results,

it is informative to take a look at trends in record sales. Figure 9.1 shows the evolution of

recording sales (of all formats) worldwide and in the United States from 1969 to 2003, in


32
   Klein, Lerner and Murphy (2002) reject Boldrin and Levine’s model on the basis that it is based on “the
innocuous assumption that the copyright holder’s demand is elastic.”

   Hui and Png (2002) provide empirical evidence on the movie industry by estimating the impact of
economic incentives on the supply of motion pictures.


                                                                                                        52
constant dollars. It is apparent that the value of sales has declined in recent years, after

peaking in 1999 in the U.S. and in 1995 worldwide.34 Sales have dropped an average of

7% per year since 2000 in the U.S.. The picture is similar for the global music industry.

At least for the U.S., the downturn coincides with the launch of Napster and new portable

MP3 players, such as Diamond’s Rio in 1999. One should also note that CD copying

became widely feasible on home computers in the late 1990s. Could these technologies

be responsible for the drop in record sales?

         The timing for the U.S. is certainly suggestive, but it should be noted that there

have been periods of sharp declines in sales before. In the late 1970s and early 1980s,

sales plummeted, though not as sharply as in the last few years. Furthermore, the fact

that the decline in sales began outside the U.S. before it did in the U.S. is suspicious,

because Internet technology was more widespread in the U.S. than elsewhere in the

1990s.

         Before jumping to conclusions from the coincidence of these trends, one needs to

also consider other factors that affect record sales. Liebowitz (2003a, 2004b) lists the

price of records, income, population, changes in taste, and prices of substitutes and

complements as relevant factors. Liebowitz (2004b) looks at these standard demand

determinants and concludes, “They do not appear capable of explaining the decline in

sound recordings that had occurred.”

         On a theoretical level, file sharing, or more broadly piracy, can have many

potential effects on CD sales.35 The main argument set forth by Napster and other “pro-


34
   One limitation of these data is that the dollar value is based on the suggested retail list price, not on the
actual sales generated by the albums.
35
   This section focuses on file sharing. For more on piracy and the effect on CD sales, see Hui and Png
(2003). Using international data from 1994 to 1998, they find that piracy reduces CD sales by 6.6%.


                                                                                                               53
file-sharers” is commonly called the sampling argument. (See Gopal, Bhattacharjee and

Sanders (2004) for a formal model of sampling.) Sampling is thought to have a positive

effect on CD sales by allowing potential customers to hear songs before they purchase

them. Because of file sharing, customers would be better informed, making CDs a less

risky purchase. Like advertising, sample could have the effect of increasing sales.

However, Liebowitz (2004b) questions the force of the sampling argument, pointing out

that once someone has in his or her possession a song obtained for free, he or she might

not go the extra step of actually paying to legally purchase the CD. He concludes that

“the effect of sampling (more music-listening services at a constant CD price) is to lower

the price of music-listening services. The net effect should be to lower the revenues

generated by music-listening services. With a price per CD that is independent of the

sampling effect, this implies that the quantity of CDs will fall due to sampling.” Thus,

sampling could be viewed as a supply shift as well as an information source, with

opposing effects on sales.

       Another effect, known as the substitution or replacement effect, clearly is

expected to have a negative impact on sales: here, music downloaded simply replaces

purchased CDs. Even if MP3s and CDs are not perfect substitutes since CDs come in a

package with the CD jacket and perhaps lyrics and liner notes, and since the sound

quality of MP3s can be inferior to CDs, we would nevertheless expect that if people can

download a song for free, it will to a certain extent replace their purchases of music.

       A third effect that Liebowitz (2004b) cites is the network effect, but again, there is

no clear prediction as to whether this would have a positive or a negative impact on CD




                                                                                           54
sales. A network effect occurs when the value of a commodity varies with the number of

people that are using it.

          Another point to consider is that perhaps what has occurred is not just substitution

of CDs for MP3 files, but a shift in leisure activities brought about by the new

technologies. Internet and computers could have created a change in how people spend

their time, possibly reducing the demand for pre-recorded music. Peitz and Waelbroeck

(2004b) look at different surveys of time use and daily internet activities, and conclude

that “there is evidence that the increasing availability of broadband is changing the spare

time activities of consumers in favor of online activities.”

9.3. Empirical studies

          Perhaps the first empirical study of the effect of illegal file sharing on CD sales

was produced by the RIAA during the Napster trial. SoundScan’s CEO, Michael Fine,

(2000) had been engaged by the plaintiffs to produce evidence on the question. His

report is not very compelling. His main claim is that because sales declined more at

stores near colleges and universities, and because college students are heavier

downloaders than the rest of the population, then it must be that file sharing reduces CD

sales. However, this analysis does not take into account the fact that the students might

use the internet to legally buy CDs online, thus also reducing the sales at local music

stores.

          Liebowitz (2004b) surveys the existing empirical literature, classifying papers in

terms of their unit of analysis. He distinguishes between countries, records, cities,

households, and genres as possible units of analysis. Liebowitz (2004b) notes that a

methodology relying on genres would be interesting, but dismisses such studies because




                                                                                                55
of lack of consistent and reliable data. He reviews the household methodology quickly,

citing Michel (2004) as an example. Michel builds a model in which the consumer has

the choice between buying a CD and copying music illegally. He then derives the market

demand for CDs, and finds that the introduction of new file sharing technologies actually

brings to the market people who were not previously buying any music. This would

imply that CD sales should not decrease because of P2P networks. Michel uses

household level data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey, taking computer ownership

as a proxy for file sharing. This has obvious problems, since it measures neither internet

access nor file sharing behavior. Michel uses a difference-in-differences estimator to

assess the impact of MP3 downloads on CD sales between 1998 (pre-treatment) and 2001

(post-treatment). He finds an insignificant effect, and is therefore unable to reject the

hypothesis that “some file sharing (prior to 2002) was undertaken by consumers formerly

not in the market for music.” One caveat that we need to mention here is that this result

would hold if nothing else had changed between the two years studied. We can however

suspect that computer ownership and internet use has greatly expanded in that time

period, so we would not necessarily be capturing the behavior of the same type of

households.

       Liebowitz (2004b) also criticizes Boorstin’s (2004) study, which used cities as the

unit of analysis, with Census data from 1998, 2000, and 2001. Boorstin regressed CD

sales by city on the number of people with internet access. Liebowitz argues that the

regression is flawed because it includes dummy variables for the years 2000 and 2001,

which are likely to pick up the effect of file sharing. He redoes Boorstin’s analysis

without the year dummies, and regressing on per capita CD sales (not total sales), and




                                                                                            56
ends up finding that file sharing could explain a decline in CD sales of 12% in the U.S.,

when the actual total decline was of 15%. Liebowitz concludes that “These two values

are so close that we can say that this evidence is consistent with a view that all of the

decline is due to file sharing. This is a charming story, but it isn’t clear how reliable

these results are.”

        A study by Zentner (2004) uses data from a European consumer mail survey from

October 2001. In an OLS regression of a dummy for buying CDs on a dummy indicating

regular downloading, he finds an insignificant effect. However, as he points out,

“simultaneity between tastes for music and peer-to-peer usage makes it difficult to isolate

the causal effect of music downloads on music purchases.” Consequently, Zentner

instruments for regular downloading, using variables such as the speed of the individual’s

internet connection and measures of internet sophistication.36 He then finds a negative

and significant effect, indicating that music downloads reduce the probability of CD

purchases by around 30%, which would explain a drop of 7.8% in the sales of music in

the countries covered by the survey.

        Peitz and Waelbroeck (2004a) use countries as a basis of analysis, with data from

16 countries representing 90% of world sales and from an IPSOS-REID survey, for 2000

and 2001. Taking first-differences, they run a regression of CD sales (expressed in units

of CDs sold) on GDP, downloads (defined as the percentage of adults who downloaded

MP3s at least once during the period) the percentage of households with broadband

connection, and two variables indicating the sales of musical cassettes and the number of

CD players per household. They find a significant and negative effect of downloads on

36
  Zentner’s (2004) measures of internet sophistication include whether or not the individual publishes his
own webpage, participates in online auctions, asks for technical support online, reads computer magazines,
and how long he or she has used email and the internet.


                                                                                                       57
music sales, reducing the sales by about 11% between 2000 and 2001. They then use

survey data from the U.S. for the period 2000-2002 to try to assess the partial effect of

internet piracy on CD sales. After making necessary assumptions, they conclude that

“internet piracy alone can only explain 22.5% of the CD decline in 2002 and is most

likely not to be a significant factor in 2003 as the percentage of internet users who

download music is reported to have declined further after the series of legal actions

undertaken by the RIAA in the summer of 2003.” They note that this implies that a

coefficient more than 4 times bigger would be needed to fully explain the drop of 8.9% in

CD sales in the U.S. in 2002. Peitz and Waelbroeck note, however, that their “results

should be taken with caution since we consider a small number of countries in the

econometric analysis. Also, the use of aggregated data and the particular choice of

explanatory variable can be questioned.”

        One study that stands out from the others in terms of sophistication and data is

Oberholzer and Strumpf (2004), which reaches the controversial conclusion that file

sharing does not have a significant impact on CD sales. They have access to unique data

on actual downloads and sales, whereas the rest of the literature mostly relies on small-

scale survey data or national and international aggregates.37 Their data set contains 1.75

million file downloads, which represent about 0.01% of the world downloads for the

seventeen-week period spanning from September 8, 2002, to December 31, 2002. They

link this data set to album sales from Nielsen SoundScan from the second half of 2002,

and also merge on information on the artists and track time taken from the website

www.allmusic.com. They use the data set to regress observed record sales on album

37
 Their download data are logs from two OpenNap servers (centralized P2P network), which tells them
which files users searched for and which files they downloaded, for seventeen weeks from September 8 to
December 31, 2002.


                                                                                                     58
characteristics and the number of downloads for that album, using a fixed effects model

to control for album-specific, time-invariant characteristics. To avoid endogeneity

problems they instrument for the number of downloads, using shifters related to

download costs, which they argue influence downloads but should have no effect on

sales. The shifters they use as instruments are: album average and minimum track length,

time length of albums in the same music category, and also the percentage of German

students on vacation due to German school holidays. They maintain that the last variable

is a valid shifter of the supply of files available for downloads because in their sample,

one out of six U.S. download is from Germany. When German children are on vacation,

they would spend more time at their computer at home sharing files, thus shifting up the

supply of MP3s. This choice of instruments has been criticized on various grounds. One

criticism is that if, as the authors argue, file sharing leads to more CD sales through an

advertising or (sampling effect), then cost shifters should enter the demand equation for

CDs directly, rendering the identification strategy invalid. In any case, throughout their

various specifications, they find that downloads have an insignificant effect on album

sales. When comparing their estimates with the sharp drop in record sales, Oberholzer

and Strumpf conclude that “At most, file sharing can explain a tiny fraction of this

decline.”

       Liebowitz (2004b) criticizes this conclusion and the underlying methodology. He

warns about a potential fallacy of composition that would arise because records are the

unit of analysis. Just as the elasticity of demand at the industry level is expected to be

lower than at the firm level, downloading could increase the sales of one particular album

and reduce overall CD sales. This effect, as Liebowitz points out, can seriously change




                                                                                             59
the interpretation of Oberholzer and Strumpf’s results: “A regression using downloads to

explain sales would return a positive coefficient, assuming that all other simultaneity

problems were overcome. After all, increases in downloads, by assumption, lead to an

increase in the sales of the downloaded recordings in this example. But that does not

mean that downloads increase overall record sales. A positive coefficient could be

entirely consistent with record sales being severely harmed by downloads and thus

couldn’t answer the question about the overall impact of downloading.”

          Needless to say, the effect of file sharing on record sales remains a hotly

contested issue. This is one area where we expect a good deal of research in the near

future.

9.4. Searching for a new business model

          The jury might still be out on the effect of file sharing on CD sales, but one thing

is certain: the record industry is suffering. And it is likely that the business model for

distributing music will change dramatically in the near future. Zhang (2004) claims that

the current music distribution system is inefficient and that peer-to-peer file sharing

networks might be a solution: “P2P networks help to provide a better information

environment for music listeners to experience the music works.” He further predicts,

“While smaller labels and unknown artists welcome the new technology, the big labels

and stars suffer from the transition. The overall effect on social welfare is positive, but it

is harmful to the music industry if only a small proportion of P2P users buy albums.”

Gayer and Shy (2004) present a model of an artist and her publisher, and show that the

artist’s revenues are greater under file sharing since the more revenue comes from live

concerts, which get better publicity from the distribution of songs on P2P networks.




                                                                                             60
However, in that model, music publishers lose from file sharing. In an interesting twist

on Rosen’s superstar model, Gopal, Bhattacharjee and Sanders (2004) predict that

sharing technologies erode the superstar phenomenon widely prevalent in the music

business. This implies that top artists actually loose from file sharing, but that less

popular artists may gain from the extra exposure and lower distribution costs that the

internet has to offer. Michel (2003, chapter 3) similarly predicts, “It appears that the

artists and the consumers will reap most of the benefits of the new technologies.” It is not

surprising then to see how strongly the record companies react to the technological

changes.

         Legal issues are also prominent. Millions of people are infringing copyright laws,

and the RIAA, as well as the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), its

equivalent in the movie industry, are actively suing users and P2P software companies

alike. In the midst of all this, some are proposing new copyright systems. A compulsory

license system, much like the performing rights system right now, where radio stations

acquire a blanket license to have the right to broadcast songs, and artists and publishers

get compensated via a performing rights organizations (ASCAP, BMI, SESAC in the

U.S.), has been proposed, for example, in a recent book by Fisher (2004).38

Peitz and Waelbroeck (2004b) describe technology developments known as Digital

Rights Management, or DRM. DRM refers to technologies aimed at monitoring and

blocking the use of copyrighted files. Some companies have already included such

features in their software. It is unclear whether blocking technology will succeed in the

race against file sharing.

38
  See also Liebowitz (2003b), footnote 2 on page 2, for a list of references. Liebowitz (2003b) discusses
the pros and cons of the compulsory license, insisting on the cons and concluding that “only as a very last
resort should we replace the current system with a compulsory license.”


                                                                                                          61
9.5. New business models

         Napster is now back – as a legitimate service selling songs over the internet.

Other competitors include Apple’s iTune and RealNetworks’ Rhapsody. The terms they

offer vary. Some offer a sort of rental service where, for a monthly subscription fee, the

user can download an unlimited quantity of songs onto his PC or portable device, but

cannot burn CDs; once the subscription expires, the files can no longer be read. Others

sell songs for a fee – 49¢ or 99¢ per song, or $9.99 per album – and the tracks belong to

the buyers forever. These services originally received a lukewarm reception: why pay for

songs that are available for free on P2P networks? But interest at universities and

colleges, fertile grounds for illegal file sharing (and lawsuits) with their broadband

connections and student population, is growing. Some schools are starting new

partnerships with music providers, in order to save bandwidth and curtail piracy. Napster

has signed deals with eight colleges, including Penn State University, the University of

Rochester, Cornell and George Washington University, through which the students

receive free subscription to the regular Napster service (which is usually $9.99 per

month).39 Berkeley and the University of Minnesota have signed agreements with

RealNetworks.40 Others, including Yale, Duke, Wake Forest and the University of

Colorado at Boulder, have a similar deal with Cdigix (formerly Cflix), to receive not only

music but also movies.41

   See Young (2004b).
41
   The movie industry is also confronted with illegal file sharing, albeit perhaps on a smaller scale. Like the
RIAA, the MPAA has taken legal action. On August 19, 2004, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Los
Angeles ruled that P2P software developers were not infringing the copyright law by making products that
people use to illegal download copyrighted material. The case was against the Grokster and Morpheus
softwares. This is probably only an early opening round in the battles to come.


                                                                                                           62
10. Conclusion

Rather than summarize our lengthy survey, we conclude by suggesting some worthwhile

questions for further study, which might stimulate research on the popular music

industry. Below is our list of 11 areas that seem particularly worthy of further research:


z Why do contracts in the popular music industry take the form that they take? Are they
efficient?


z Why have prices for popular music concerts grown so much faster than prices of other
entertainment events since the late 1990s? Can more appropriate price indices for
concerts – that take into account price discrimination, rationing, shifts in demand, and
other factors – be constructed?


z What determines the amount of price differentiation within concerts, and why has price
discrimination grown since the 1980s? Is there less regional variation in prices for the
same concerts than one would expect in an efficient market? If so, why?


z How has increased concentration in promoters and media affected the popular music
industry? Will continued technological change cause the industry to become more or less
concentrated?


z There is a paucity of evidence on demand elasticities for concerts. As always,
identifying demand and supply parameters requires some assumptions or exclusion
restrictions. One potential approach is to use supply shocks, caused by factors like bad
health (especially for older performers), to identify the elasticity of demand for concerts.
Once a set of parameters is available, more elaborate rankings could be computed.


z The internet lowers the cost of band promotion. How will the continued development
of the internet change the music industry? If bands rarely receive much income from
record sales, will they seek other means for distributing their music? Will start-up bands


                                                                                           63
have greater bargaining power with record companies because they can directly promote
their music themselves on the internet?


z How will future technological developments, which are hard to predict at present,
affect the concert industry and the distribution of recorded music? Will the variety in
popular music increase because of new distribution technologies?


z We lack systematic data on concert production costs over time. What are the trends in
concert production costs? Can these costs account for the trend in prices?


z Tickets are beginning to be distributed in auctions. How do ticket auctions affect the
average price and the size of the secondary market? What strategies do fans use when
they have the option of purchasing tickets in an auction.


z Why is there a secondary market for tickets? Why do tickets appear to be under priced
for many concerts?


z Does the practice of legal payola (i.e., payments to radio stations via independent
record promoters) affect the popularity of bands? Will payola become a common
practice in new domains, such as webcasts, as technological change continues to shape
the popular music industry?

Notes: Rank1 assumes elasticity of demand is 1 (gross revenue); Rank2 assumes elasticity of demand is 2;
Rank3 assumes elasticity of demand is 1 and that latent demand is 25% greater than ticket sales for
sellouts; Rank4 assumes elasticity of demand is 2 and that latent demand is 25% greater than ticket sales
for sellouts; Rank5 is based on revenue per performance; Rank6 is based on number of tickets sold.
Rankings are computed for all artists, but only the first 50 according to Rank1 are shown.
