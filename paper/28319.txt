                                          ABSTRACT

Correspondence experiments probe for discrimination by manipulating employer perceptions of
applicant characteristics. We consider the gains from dynamically adapting the number and
characteristics of fictitious applications to the sequence of employer responses received so far.
Calibrating the employer callback process to data from a recent correspondence experiment by
Nunley et al. (2015), we find it is possible to cut the number of applications required to detect a
fixed number of discriminatory jobs roughly in half relative to the static benchmark design that
sends the same number and mix of applications to all jobs. These gains are achieved primarily
from abandoning jobs with very low callback probabilities and those that demonstrate a
willingness to call black applicants.

1    Introduction
A large social science literature uses correspondence experiments to measure discrimination
(Bertrand and Duflo, 2017; Baert, 2018). Kline and Walters (forthcoming) argue that exper-
iments sending multiple applications to each job can be used to reliably detect discrimination
by particular employers. A practical impediment to such exercises is that employer callback
rates are often very low, leading a large fraction of applications to be wasted on unrespon-
sive jobs. Sending many applications to a particular job may also compromise the callback
evidence by alerting an employer to the experiment.
    This paper considers the potential for dynamic correspondence experiments to reduce
the costs of detecting discrimination by particular employers. We consider an experimental
design in which the researcher adapts the number and characteristics of applications sent
to each job in response to prior callback outcomes from that job. Our analysis is inspired
by proposals in the medical sciences to personalize treatments based on time-varying health
information (Brown et al., 2009; Chakraborty and Murphy, 2014) as well as econometric
procedures that update estimators, decision rules, and experimental designs in response to
new data (Dimakopoulou et al., 2018; Kasy and Sautmann, forthcoming; Tabord-Meehan,
2020). In the discrimination context, adaptive experimentation provides a potential tool
for regulatory agencies charged with preventing and remedying discrimination, such as the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), to fulfil their regulatory mandates
with greater efficiency and rigor.
    We begin by building a statistical model of job callback decisions, which we fit to data
from a recent correspondence study by Nunley et al. (2015) (henceforth, NPRS). NPRS
submitted four applications with distinctively black or white names to each of 2,305 entry-
level jobs for new college graduates in the US. Though this study was conducted by academic
researchers, one can imagine such training data also coming from a pilot study commissioned
by the EEOC. We ask how an auditor who has learned the distribution of discrimination
from such a pilot might send applications to new vacancies to find discriminatory jobs at
minimum cost.
    Simulating the performance of the optimal auditing strategy, we find that adaptive exper-
iments can cut the number of applications needed to detect a fixed number of discriminators
by more than half without increasing the prevalence of type I errors. This feat is accom-
plished primarily by giving up early on jobs with very low callback rates and those that
demonstrate a willingness to call black applicants. These results reinforce the conclusion of
Kline and Walters (forthcoming) that correspondence experiments can potentially be used
by regulatory agencies to target investigations more efficiently. Similar adaptive methods

may be useful in other domains where racial bias is a concern and monitoring may be feasi-
ble, including criminal justice (Arnold, Dobbie and Hull, 2020; Rose, forthcoming), policing
(Fryer Jr., 2019; Feigenberg and Miller, 2020), healthcare (Alsan, Garrick and Graziani,
2019; Obermeyer et al., 2019), and education (Carlana, 2019; Bergman and McFarlin Jr.,
2020).


2    A model of callbacks
Following Kline and Walters (forthcoming), we model callbacks at each job as independent
Bernoulli trials. A fictitious applicant of race r  {w, b} (white or black) possessing observ-
able characteristics x has a callback probability pjr (x) of being called back by job j . We
assume that
                              pjr (x) =  (j - j 1 {r = b} + x  ) ,

where  (z )  [1 + exp (-z )]-1 is the logit link function, the parameter j governs the
white callback rate, j governs the callback penalty for being perceived as black, and x 
is an application quality index. We treat the parameters (j , j ) as random draws from a
bivariate distribution. Kline and Walters (forthcoming) were unable to reject the hypothesis
that white names are never discriminated against in the NPRS experiment. We therefore
assume that j = max 0,      ~j , which censors discrimination from below at zero. The model
is completed by the following distributional assumption:

                                                    2
                               j     iid      0       
                                      N         ,               ,                         (1)
                               ~j
                                              0       2



which allows for continuous heterogeneity in overall callback rates and discrimination sever-
ity, as well as a positive mass of jobs that do not discriminate at all.
    Maximum likelihood estimates of this model are presented in Table 1. We cannot re-
ject that  = 0, and therefore impose this restriction in what follows. Using the esti-
mates in column 1, the share of jobs with white callback probabilities lower than 1% is
         -ln(99)
 4.922  4.968
                  0.53, suggesting that a majority of the jobs in this study are essentially
unresponsive to applications of either race. The share of jobs with j = 0 is  5 .035
                                                                               6.347
                                                                                      0.79.
Hence, discrimination is confined to a small minority of jobs. However, the average severity
                                                                             (0 / )
of discrimination among this minority is intense, as E [j |j > 0] = 0 +    /  3.6,
                                                                              ( 0 )
which implies the odds of being called back by a discriminating job are roughly 36 times
higher for whites than equivalent blacks. This finding of rare but intense discrimination
accords closely with the non-parametric analysis of the NPRS data in Kline and Walters

(forthcoming) and suggests it may be possible to ascertain whether or not a responsive job
is discriminating with very few applications.1


3       The auditor's problem
Consider now a hypothetical auditor who knows the parameters of Table 1 and can draw
additional jobs from the same distribution. Her goal is to find as many discriminating jobs as
possible by sending fictitious applications. The auditor may send up to 8 applications to each
job and is free to choose the race and quality q of each application. To simplify the problem,
we coarsen applicant quality to two levels (labeled "high" and "low") that correspond to
setting the covariate index x  to one standard deviation above or below its estimated mean.
If the auditor believes a job is discriminating she can initiate an investigation. Once an
investigation is initiated, the job's true type is revealed and the auditor receives a payoff

    Kline and Walters (forthcoming) find that at least 17% of jobs in the NPRS data are discriminating
and that the distribution of discriminatory severity is highly variable and skewed.

where Sj gives the average severity of discrimination at job j and  is the cost of conducting
an investigation. Choosing not to investigate yields a payoff of zero. Hence, an auditor with
 = .01 is indifferent about investigating a job that contacts black applicants a percentage
point less often than comparable white applicants. The linear formulation in (2) implies
that the auditor cares about the expected number of callbacks lost to racial discrimination,
which reflects both discrimination severity and the baseline callback rate for white applicants.
Severity is unknown and must be assessed by sending job applications.
   Rather than send 8 applications to each job, the auditor solves a sequential problem: in
each period, she may send an application to a job and choose its race and quality, launch
an investigation, or give up. The auditing history Hn encodes the assigned race and observ-
able characteristics of the n prior applications sent to a given job along with whether each
application was called back. The auditor's value function can be written

                                       investigate

where vrq (Hn ) = -c + E[V (Hn+1 )|Hn ] is the expected value of sending an application of race
r and quality q net of the cost c of sending a new application. The value of giving up on a job
equals zero, while the auditor's expected payoff from investigating is vI (Hn ) = E[Sj |Hn ] - .
All expectations are evaluated via Bayes' rule starting from a prior distribution based on
the parameters in column 1 of Table 1. As Kline and Walters (forthcoming) emphasize, the
use of Bayes' rule allows the auditor to borrow strength from the experience of the pilot
study, which can generate informative conclusions about a particular job even when very
few applications have been sent.


4    Optimal auditing policy
The solution to the sequential problem was computed numerically by backwards induction.
Figure 1 shows the decision problem that arises after 3 applications when setting  = .13
and c = 10-4 . Seven distinct values of H3 arise under optimal auditing, which we have
ordered by the auditor's posterior expectation of discrimination severity. If sending another
application is optimal, the bar representing the value of that action is bolded.
    Least suspicious is the case where 3 high-quality white applications are sent and none are
called back. To ascertain whether a job is responsive, the auditor always begins by sending

Notes: This figure depicts the expected value associated with each possible action given a job history H3 .
Job history is characterised by the number applications of each of race and quality level that are sent and
the number that are called back (CB). On the horizontal axis, the values in parentheses are ordered as
follows: (LQ white, LQ black, HQ white, HQ black). If sending another application is the optimal action,
the bar representing the value of that action is bolded.



high-quality white applications. The estimates in Table 1 imply that 72% of jobs will fail to
call back any of the first 3 applications, at which point the auditor gives up. Doing so this
                             ×5
early saves the auditor 0.728
                                × 100 = 45% of the maximum possible number of applications.
    If the auditor's first high-quality white application is called back, her optimal response
is to begin sending high-quality black applications. Receiving no callbacks for any high-
quality black applications produces the most suspicious configuration in Figure 1. Because
the posterior probability that the job is discriminating is only about 18.8% in this scenario,
the auditor decides to send another high quality black application to obtain greater certainty
regarding the severity of any discrimination present.
    Receiving one callback for a high-quality black application produces the third most suspi-
cious configuration in Figure 1. While the callback to the black application makes it unlikely
that this job is discriminating, the evidence could also be rationalized by a very high baseline
white callback probability (j        0) in conjunction with non-trivial discrimination severity
(Sj > ). To assess this possibility, the auditor opts to send a low quality white application.
Similar logic applies to the auditor's choices for additional histories, the full set of which

appear in Figure 6 in the appendix.
    Once 8 applications have been sent, the auditor can no longer send additional applications
and the decision problem simplifies to a binary choice: either launch an investigation or give
up. Figure 2 shows the auditor's posterior expectation E[Sj |H8 ] of the job's discrimination
severity given its callback history H8 . The relevant values of H8 have been depicted by
the 23 distinct callback configurations that might arise under optimal auditing. Expected
discrimination severity is maximized when 3 high quality white and 5 high quality black
applications have been sent and all 3 white applications but only 1 black application have
been called back.2 A horizontal line gives the investigation cost . When the expected
benefit exceeds , an investigation is launched. Otherwise, the auditor gives up.


5        The gains from sequential auditing
To evaluate the performance of various auditing strategies, we borrow concepts from the
medical literature on diagnostic testing. The sensitivity of an auditing strategy is the prob-

        All histories with zero black callbacks lead the auditor to investigate or give up before n = 8.

Notes: This figure plots the average number of applications sent per job against the sensitivity of the
auditing strategy for strategies that result in 5.5-6% of jobs investigated. The number of initial pairs refers

ability that an investigation is launched when a job is engaged in discrimination (i.e., when
j > 0). The specificity of an auditing strategy is the probability that an investigation is
not launched when a job is not discriminating (i.e., when j = 0).
    Figure 3 plots the average number of applications per job associated with a given auditing
strategy against its sensitivity when jobs are drawn randomly from the data generating
process described in column 1 of Table 1. To enumerate auditing strategies, the parameters
(, c) have been varied over a range that results in the probability of investigation falling in
the interval [.055, .06]; each dot, therefore, corresponds to a different strategy that results in
roughly the same expected number of investigations.
    To illustrate the gains from sequential optimization, we include strategies where the
auditor's discretion is constrained by requiring her to send a fixed number of mixed race
application pairs (of random quality) before behaving optimally. Hence, the case where 4
pairs must be sent corresponds to a static auditing strategy, where the auditor must either
decide to investigate each job or give up. As the auditor is given more discretion, the number
of applications sent to each job falls. For example, when the auditor is allowed to optimize

                                        (sensitivity fixed)




Notes: This figure plots the average number of applications per job against the specificity of the auditing
strategy for strategies where 14-14.5% of discriminating jobs are investigated. The number of initial pairs
refers to the number of applications of each race that are sent before the auditor begins optimizing. The
curves are generated by varying  between 0.01 and 0.09 and c between 10-5 and 0.004.



after sending 3 pairs, it is possible to maintain a sensitivity of 14% by sending an average
of only 6.3 applications to each job. A fully unconstrained (0 pairs) auditor can achieve a
sensitivity of 14.5% while sending fewer than 3 applications per job. In sum, by giving up on
unresponsive jobs and jobs that call back some black applicants in early trials, the dynamic
auditor is able to correctly identify more discriminators than the static auditor with fewer
than half as many applications.
    Figure 3 held the probability of investigated fixed, which can be thought of as approx-
imating a setting where the auditor faces an ex-ante budget constraint on the expected
number of investigations to be conducted. Figure 4 depicts an analogous exercise fixing
the sensitivity of the auditing strategy in the interval [.14,.145] but allowing the marginal
probability of an investigation to vary. This scenario can be thought of as one where the
auditor plans to continue to experiment until a desired number of discriminators are inves-
tigated. Because investigations of non-discriminating jobs constitute type I errors, points
in the Southeast quadrant of Figure 4 are preferable. Evidently, an unconstrained auditor
(0 pairs) can achieve the same sensitivity as a static auditor (4 pairs) while incurring fewer

false positives and utilizing less than half as many applications.
    Figure 5 provides a histogram of discrimination severity for investigated and non-investigated
jobs for an auditor with cost parameters of  = .13 and c = 10-4 . The unconstrained auditor
investigates only 3.5% of the jobs, but the jobs she investigates tend to be heavy discrimina-
tors. Roughly 30% of investigated jobs are not engaged in any discrimination, far below the
79% prevalence of non-discrimination in the overall population. Given her low investigation
rate, the auditor's type I error rate evaluates to only 0.3× 0.035

tends to be much less severe among jobs that the auditor chooses not to investigate: 80%
of the jobs not investigated are not engaged in discrimination at all, 15% engage in negli-
gible discrimination with Sj  (0, 0.03], and the remainder exhibit only mild racial gaps in
callback rates.


6     Conclusion
Correspondence experiments are a widespread tool used throughout the social sciences to
detect discrimination in many contexts. While such experiments typically send a predeter-
mined number of applications to each job, substantial cost reductions can, in principle, be



                                                     9
achieved by giving up on unresponsive jobs. Our analysis suggests that adaptive correspon-
dence experiments can yield substantial reductions in the number of applications per job
needed to achieve a desired level of sensitivity and specificity of investigative decisions.
    Our analysis was predicated on the existence of a pilot study from which the distribution
of unit heterogeneity could be learned in a first step. While dividing the problem into sepa-
rate "exploration" and "exploitation" steps simplified our analysis considerably, in practice
it may be desirable to combine these steps to reduce the costs of making an initial determi-
nation of market-wide discrimination. Likewise, updating estimates of the job heterogeneity
distribution may be important for enforcement if one is worried that the parameters of the
callback process are drifting over the course of a study, perhaps because of the enforcement
activities themselves. An interesting topic for future research is the potential for reinforce-
ment learning techniques (e.g., Kasy and Sautmann, forthcoming) to balance the exploration
and exploitation goals of correspondence experiment design without relying on parametric
assumptions regarding the job callback process.
