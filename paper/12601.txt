                                           ABSTRACT

Over the past 30 years, eastern Massachusetts has seen a remarkable combination of rising home prices
and declining supply of new homes. The reductions in new supply don't appear to reflect a real lack
of land, but instead reflect a response to man-made restrictions on development. In this paper, we
examine the land-use regulations in greater Boston. There has been a large increase in the number
of new regulations, which differ widely over space. Few variables, other than historical density and
abundant recreational water, reliably predict these regulations. High lot sizes and other regulations
are associated with less construction. The regulations boost prices by decreasing density, but density
levels seem far too low to maximize total land value.

   I.      Introduction


Over the past 25 years, many U.S. cities have experienced a remarkable combination of
increases in housing prices and decreases in new construction (Glaeser, Gyourko and
Saks, 2005). Boston is an extreme example of this phenomenon. Its prices have risen
dramatically. Table 1 shows that based on Office of Federal Housing Enterprise
Oversight (OFHEO) repeat sales indices, three of the four metropolitan subdivisions with
the greatest price appreciation between 1980 and 2004 are in the Boston region (Boston-
Quincy, Cambridge-Newton and Suffolk). At the same time, as Figure 1 shows, the total
number of permits issued in the Boston metropolitan area declined from 172,000 during
the 1960s to 141,000 during the 1980s to 84,000 during the 1990s.


The combination of rising prices and declining new supply suggests that Boston’s high
prices reflect more than just rising demand. After all, without increasingly inelastic
supply, an increase in demand should lead to higher prices and more construction. One
hypothesis is that supply has become increasingly inelastic in the Boston area because
Greater Boston is running out of land. In Section II of this paper, we refute this
hypothesis. Within the Boston region, higher densities are associated with more
permitting, not less. Even if density did significantly decrease permitting, housing
densities in greater Boston just have not changed enough to explain a significant
downturn in permitting. We also follow Glaeser and Gyourko (2001) and show that the
value of land in a hedonic regression is very low relative to the value of land when it sits
below a new house, which suggests that there is no general shortage of land.


If increasing density levels cannot explain the decline in new construction, then one
viable alternative hypothesis is that increasingly stringent land use regulations have made
it more and more difficult for developers to build. To address this possibility, we turn to
a new data set collected by the Pioneer Institute for Public Policy Research on land use
regulations in greater Boston. The data set contains land use restrictions including lot
size, wetlands regulations, septic rules and subdivision requirements, for 187 cities and



                                                                                               1
towns within greater Boston.1 For many of the regulations, the data set also includes the
dates when the regulations where imposed so that it is possible to look at changes over
time.


In Section III of the paper, we establish three basic facts about land use regulation. First,
along most dimensions there has been a dramatic increase in regulation since 1980. For
example, the share of communities with rules restricting subdivisions has increased from
less than 50 percent in 1975 to almost 100 percent today. Second, as Ellickson (1977)
emphasized, there is a remarkable variety in the nature of these regulations; minimum lot
sizes, subdivision rules, and septic and wetlands restrictions that go significantly beyond
the state standards are only the most basic of regulations. Third, land use regulations are
often astonishingly vague. For instance, several communities use variations of “an
isolated depression … that confines standing water” to define wetlands (Dain, 2006).


We then turn to the determinants of land use regulations. We do not know the dates that
minimum lot sizes were established but all of them post-date 1915 and most of them
post-date 1940. Therefore, we use city-level controls in 1915 and 1940 to try to explain
minimum lot sizes. Like Evenson and Wheaton (2003), we find that historical housing
density is the most important determinant of minimum lot size. Beyond that variable,
more manufacturing and more minorities in 1940 are associated with smaller minimum
lot sizes. Septic and wetlands regulations are associated with the amount of standing
water, but it also appears that wetlands regulations after 1980 were used more
aggressively in places that built more between 1971 and 1985, suggesting that these
regulations may have been an attempt to reduce development.


In Section IV, we turn to the effects of these regulations. Unsurprisingly, we find a
robust negative effect of minimum lot size on the amount of building in an area between
1980 and 2004 and on density today. These results are robust to controlling for a number
of 1940 area characteristics and they are robust to using nineteenth century forest cover

                                                                                              2
as an instrument for minimum lot size. As the average acre per lot increases by one,
there is a .4 log point reduction in development between 1980 and 2002. Other
regulations also significantly reduce new construction. In a specification with town fixed
effects, where we combine wetlands, septic and subdivision rules into a single index, we
find that each extra rule reduces new construction by .1 log points.


In a housing price hedonic where we control for structural characteristics and lot size, we
find that each acre per lot is associated with a 15 percent increase in housing prices. As
economic theory predicts, this impact works through the average density in the
community. When we control for density as well as lot size, the impact of minimum lot
size disappears. The impact of other regulatory barriers on price is also positive. Each
additional type of regulation (wetlands bylaws, septic rules, subdivision rules) raises
housing prices by 7 percent, even controlling for housing density.


We end by asking whether restricting lot size maximizes the total value of land area in
the community. In a simple model, reducing minimum lot sizes will increase total land
value in a town if the share of housing prices associated with land is greater than the
elasticity of price with respect to unit lot size minus the elasticity of price with respect to
town density. We find that these two elasticities sum to approximately .1 while land’s
share of total value in the sample seems to be greater than .5. Together these results
suggest that community densities are too low to be maximizing total land value.


    II.     Is Lack of Land the Limit on Greater Boston’s Housing Supply?


In this section, we present evidence on whether the decline in permitting in greater
Boston is the result of increasing land densities. Throughout this paper, we will use a
sample of 187 cities and towns that lie between Route 495 and the city of Boston,
excluding Boston itself. This sample includes all of the cities and towns that are
physically closest to Boston except for those on Cape Cod.




                                                                                                  3
Our first, most obvious, piece of evidence is to examine the link within Boston between
housing density in 1980 and new construction since then. Using data on permits from
1980 to 2002 and housing unit density in 1980 (based on the U.S. Census), Figure 2
shows the strong positive relationship between initial housing unit density and later
construction; the places with the most land allow the least construction. This relationship
might be explained by higher demand in high density areas, but as we will show in
Section IV, prices are lower in less dense areas. As a result, controlling for price only
increases the negative connection between land per house and new construction.


Lincoln, Weston and Concord are three contiguous towns that illustrate low levels of
construction in land rich areas. Together, they have 12,889 homes and cover more than
39,000 acres. Yet despite being among the most expensive towns in the state, these areas
together permitted just 1,746 new homes between 1980 and 2002. In our sample of 187
towns, there are another 22 localities with less than one home for every two acres that
have allowed less than 30 units per year each since 1980.


A second piece of evidence, running counter to the view that greater Boston is running
out of land, is that density levels have not increased very much over the past 25 years.
For example, the total housing density in Suffolk County (which contains Boston)
increased by 4.5 percent in the 1970s, 4.6 percent in the 1980s and 1.1 percent in the
1990s. Middlesex County (which contains Cambridge) grew more, but even its housing
unit density increased by only 10.3 percent in the 1980s and by 6 percent in the 1990s.


In a simple regression, where the dependent variable is the logarithm of the number of
permits in a town in a year and where we control for town fixed effects and a dummy
variable that takes on a value of one if the year is after 1990, the estimated coefficient on
the dummy variable is -.267. The standard error is .049. This means that in our sample,
relative to the 1980s, the number of new units declined by about .27 log points in the
1990s.




                                                                                            4
Can controlling for increases in density drive this coefficient to zero and thereby explain
the reduction in the number of new permits? If we simply control for housing density in
the basic regression described above, the estimated decline in permitting becomes more
severe, since density is positively predicted with new permits and density is rising. Using
a national sample, Glaeser, Gyourko and Saks (2005) estimate a coefficient of -.1 on
density, so a 10 percent increase in density is associated with a one percent decrease in
permitting. If we fix the coefficient on density at -.1, then the estimated dummy variable
on the 1990s falls in absolute value to -.252. If we fix the coefficient on density at -.25,
the estimated dummy variable on the 1990s is -.229. As such, even taking an extreme
high estimate of the negative impact that density can have on construction, we estimate
that rising density levels can only explain 14 percent of the decrease in eastern
Massachusetts construction in the 1990s.


If land use restrictions didn’t exist, then in equilibrium, land that extends a lot would be
worth the same as land that sits under a new lot (Glaeser and Gyourko, 2003). A land
shortage would mean that land value estimated in a hedonic regression is extremely high.
Using data from Banker and Tradesman from 2000 to 2005, we estimate a standard
hedonic regression with structural characteristics and find that an extra acre of land is
associated with only an extra cost of only $16,000. The average lot size in the sample is
.7 acres and the average home sales price is $450,000, so multiplying the hedonic price of
land times the total acreage implies that land costs contribute only a small amount to the
overall housing costs, even if our hedonic estimate is off by an order of magnitude. The
natural explanation of this phenomenon is that the land market is not unrestricted and an
acre of land is worth a great deal more if it sits under a new house than if it extends an
existing lot.


A final piece of evidence on the land shortage hypothesis is that lot sizes for new homes
in the Boston area rose from .76 in 1990 to .91 in 1998 (Jakabovics, 2006). Rising lot
sizes are hard to reconcile with a land shortage. One explanation of this phenomenon is
that incomes were rising, but Glaeser, Kahn and Rappaport (2000) estimate an income
elasticity of demand for land among single-family homeowners of less than .2 and Boston



                                                                                               5
area income rose by less than five percent. Those estimates predict a one percent
increase in average lot size, not the 20 percent increase that is actually observed.


      III.    Data Description and the Causes of Land Use Regulation


The combination of increasing prices and decreasing construction can’t be explained by a
lack of land, but perhaps it can be explained by a man-made land shortage created by an
increasingly stringent regulatory environment. To consider this possibility, we now turn
to the Pioneer Institute’s Housing Regulation Database for Massachusetts Municipalities
in Greater Boston. This data was assembled by a team of researchers who interviewed
local officials about the rules facing local developers. This data was supplemented with
data from the MassGIS system which details for 1999-2000 the minimum lot size
required throughout the state.2 Our permitting and demographic data come from the
Census.


Minimum Lot Sizes


Before turning to the non-lot regulations, we will begin with the basic facts about lot size
requirements in eastern Massachusetts. Lot sizes are not uniform within most towns;
there are generally several different planning areas within a district. Since all of our other
data is at the town level, we aggregate sub-areas with the formula:



(1)
       Acre
            =
                         ∑   Sub − areas
                                           Acreage
       Lot                            Acreage
                ∑   Sub − areas
                                  Minimum Lot Size


The numerator sums all of the land available for building in the town. The denominator
sums the number of units that could be built in each sub-area based on existing minimum




2
    This system was used and described more thoroughly by Evenson and Wheaton (2003).



                                                                                            6
                    Acreage
lot sizes, or                    . The total expression therefore divides total area by
                Minimum Lot Size
total units to get an average lot size for new units.


Figure 3 shows the distribution of this variable and the share of towns, share of people
and share of land associated with different minimum lot sizes. Perhaps the most
remarkable thing is the degree of heterogeneity across towns. One-fifth of the population
and slightly under one-tenth of the towns have average lot sizes of 10,000 feet or less
(one quarter acre), which is slightly under one-tenth of the towns that have average lot
sizes of 70,000 feet or more. Unsurprisingly, people tend to live disproportionately in
areas with denser zoning and land tends to be disproportionately allocated to less dense
zoning. The model category in terms of both number of towns and amount of land is
between 30,000 and 40,000 foot minimum lot size, which is about one acre, and which is
also the average lot size of new homes found by Jacobovics (2006).


In Table 2, we show the distribution of town characteristics by minimum lot size broken
into four categories. The towns with smaller minimum lot sizes are larger, more likely to
be non-white and foreign born. The towns with larger lot sizes are further from Boston,
and have higher housing prices (not controlling for anything). Income and education
levels are mildly higher in the areas with high minimum lot sizes.


These correlations may be results of minimum lot size instead of causes of minimum lot
size, so to investigate the cross-sectional determinants of restrictive zoning, we regress
minimum lot size on characteristics of the town in 1915 and 1940. For most of these
towns, the lot size regulations were put in place after World War II, so 1940
characteristics can be thought of as pre-zoning initial conditions. However, the initial
wave of zoning occurred in the 1920s, so there is some possibility that those 1940
characteristics also reflect the influence of earlier zoning. To address this possibility, we
also regress minimum lot size on 1915 characteristics.




                                                                                             7
The results of these regressions are shown in Table 3. Missing data from the early
censuses causes us to lose a small number of cities. The 1940 results are given in
regression (1). The overwhelming determinant of current minimum lot size is the
logarithm of housing density in 1940, which has a t-statistic above 12. As housing
density increases by one log point (i.e. roughly doubles), minimum lot size falls by a
quarter acre. On its own this variable can explain 68 percent of the variation in current
minimum lot size. Regression (2) reproduces this finding using 1915 housing density.
Again, the t-statistic is over 12 and the coefficient is quite comparable. The best way to
understand the determinant of minimum lot size is that it is based on density levels
immediately before entry into World War I.


Other town characteristics are also correlated with minimum lot sizes, but the effects are
much weaker. For example, percent white in 1940 is associated with slightly more
stringent minimum lot sizes. This result does not appear in 1915 because there is almost
no variation in percent white during that year. The 1915 parallel is that towns with more
immigrants have less stringent minimum lot sizes. These results present weak evidence
for the view that high minimum lot sizes were used by white natives to restrict homes
built for blacks and foreigners.


There is also a modest negative correlation between share of the population that works in
manufacturing in 1940 and less restrictive minimum lot sizes. The same correlation
appears in 1915, but the coefficient is statistically insignificant. There are two plausible
explanations for this phenomenon. First, manufacturing may proxy for working class
residents who were less concerned with restricting building for the poor. Second,
manufacturing may proxy for the presence of businesses that have an interest in building
more to keep housing prices low so that they don’t need to pay workers more to
compensate them for high housing costs.


It is also useful to note the variables that don’t matter. For example, distance to Boston is
irrelevant once we control for housing density. The share of homeowners in the town is
actually associated with less restrictive zoning, but this effect is quite weak.



                                                                                               8
The connection between historical density and minimum lot sizes prompted us to look for
more ancient causes of minimum lot sizes. Using data from the Harvard Forest Survey of
Massachusetts, we regressed minimum lot size today on the share of the town that was
forested in 1885. There is a 52 percent correlation between this variable and minimum
lot size, which is shown in Figure 3. Forest cover in most of those towns in the 19th
century was determined by the value of agricultural land, so it reasonable to think that
current zoning patterns reflect, in part, whether a town was worth clearing and settling
based on the value of its pre-modern agricultural productivity.


Other Land Use Restrictions


While minimum lot size is the single most important land-use regulation, Massachusetts
cities and towns have increasingly adopted other rules that also impact new construction.
The bulk of these rules make new development more difficult, but some rules—like
cluster zoning— can make it easier to build. The Pioneer Institute survey categorized all
of these rules across the 187 cities and towns.


The three largest categories of added constraints on land use controls concern wetlands,
septic systems and subdivision requirements. Both wetlands and septic systems are also
regulated at the state level, so we are only considering additional requirements. At this
point, a majority of towns have gone beyond the state standards. A smaller number of
towns (54) have also instituted growth management policies that just act as a break on the
amount of new development. Finally, a majority of towns have also introduced some
form of cluster zoning that allows homes to be built on smaller lot sizes.


While it is easy to code whether a town has regulations of a particular type that go
beyond state standards, there is remarkable heterogeneity across areas in the nature of
these regulations. For example, the state Wetlands Protection Act protects all land within
100 feet of a wetland or floodplain, which includes all land that has 10,890 cubic feet of
standing water at least once per year. Of the 131 communities that have imposed



                                                                                             9
wetlands regulations that go beyond the state standard, 59 of them have introduced more
stringent definitions of floodplains. Eleven of them, for example, have defined
floodplains as including all areas that have 5,445 cubic feet of standing water. A number
of them have gone to 1,000 cubic feet of standing water or less. 24 of these communities
have adopted amorphous verbal definitions of floodplains, such as “an isolated
depression … that confines standing water” (Dain, 2006).


The range of rules that control septic systems is also remarkable. 109 towns go beyond
the state’s Title 5 septic rules. One particularly popular form of regulation is to require
percolation rates below the state’s maximum of 60 minutes per inch; 12 towns have
imposed requirements of a maximum 20 minutes per inch percolation rate. Other septic
rules increase the distance between septic systems and property lines, wetlands and wells.
These regulations generally increase the amount of land needed to build. The diversity of
these rules is shown in Figure 4 which shows the share of communities that have adopted
different rules. While one might think that since septic rules are justified by public health
concerns, there would be a relatively common standard throughout a small geographic
area, the basic pattern is one in which different communities all adopt their own
idiosyncratic permutations of the rules.


Subdivision requirements are similarly complex. All but six of our communities have
adopted subdivision rules, and while some subdivision rules are more than 50 years old,
amendments are frequent. The Pioneer database focused on subdivision rules concerning
roads and sidewalks. One fifth of the sample required roads that were 32 feet or more.
Some communities required roads that were 22 feet or less. There are also restrictions on
sidewalks and curb materials.


Rules regarding lot shape also restrict subdivisions. Sometimes these rules are
straightforward requirements that restrict the ratio of perimeter to area. In other cases the
rules are more amorphous, such as Millbury’s prohibition that “No pork chop, rattail, or
excessively funnel-shaped or otherwise gerrymandered lots shall be allowed.”




                                                                                              10
There are three sets of policies that enable developers to avoid the minimum lot size
regulations. First, a large number of communities have adopted cluster zoning that
enables builders to use smaller lot sizes in exchange for setting aside some quantity of
open space. In many cases, cluster zoning doesn’t actually have a density bonus because
the open space set aside must be enough so that the total density of the lot size still
conforms to existing minimum lot size rules. Inclusionary zoning can enable developers
to avoid minimum lot size requirements if they include enough affordable units. Towns
have an incentive to build these affordable units because if they have too few units,
developers can use the state rule, Chapter 40B, that allows them to ignore local zoning
ordinances. Still, we have only found 21 towns where builders have taken advantage of
inclusionary zoning rules. A third set of rules allow builders to develop at higher
densities if the units are restricted to the elderly.


In our empirical work, we will use a simple categorical variable that takes on a value of
one if the town has passed a rule that goes beyond the state standards regarding septic
systems, wetlands and subdivisions. We will also sum those three categorical variables
together for an overall regulatory barriers index (similar to Quigley and Raphael (2004)).
While there is surely information lost in using such a coarse measure, the advantage of
such coarseness is that it provides a simple measure with limited opportunities for data
mining. This metric is an attempt to capture the overall regulatory environment in each
community, while avoiding the loss of statistical clarity associated with trying to look at
the effects of all three regulations simultaneously. As Pollakowski and Wachter (1990)
argue, “land-use constraints collectively have larger effects than individually.”
Finally, we examine the impact of cluster and inclusionary zoning.


Figure 5 shows the adoption levels of the three forms of regulatory barriers and cluster
zoning. All forms of regulation show a dramatic increase over time. The subdivision
rules have now become ubiquitous. Figure 6 shows the share of communities that have
amended their wetland, cluster and subdivision bylaws by year. There was a dramatic
increase in the end of the 1990s.




                                                                                           11
To fully capture the increase in the barriers to new construction, we must also consider
the use of the court system. Lawsuits, particularly justified on environmental or nuisance
grounds are also a perennial developer’s complaint. Figure 7 shows the results of a
Lexis/Nexis search of Massachusetts Court Decisions containing all of the keywords
zoning, residential and either septic or wetland from 1964 to 2004. Again, there was a
steady rise in the 1990s.


We now turn to the determinants of these land use regulations. Since subdivision
requirements are so ubiquitous, we exclude those and focus on whether the town has
wetlands rules, septic rules and cluster zoning. We include 1970 controls that predate
these regulations. The results are shown in Table 4 which presents the marginal effects
from probit regressions. While we have included a rich bevy of controls, almost none of
these controls actually explain the adoption of these rules. This is not because we have
included a large number of controls—almost nothing is consistently, significantly
correlated with these outcomes when fewer controls are included either.


In the case of wetlands regulation, the variable that most reliably and significantly
predicts wetlands rules is the amount of recreation water in the township. Places with
more recreational water are unsurprisingly more dedicated to protecting wet spaces.
They are also more likely to regulate septic systems more stringently. Septic rules are
particularly associated with high levels of housing density, which seems quite reasonable,
since the health costs of septic problems are greater in dense areas.


We were surprised that so few of the other variables were statistically significant. In the
case of wetlands restrictions, there is a significant negative relationship between the
amount new development in the 70s and early 80s and adoption and a marginally
significant positive relationship between adoption and the share of the population with 16
years or more of schooling. More generally, these regulations which vary so much from
town to town, are surprisingly uncorrelated with most town characteristics. This may
either reflect an efficiency view of these regulations where they are being tied to un-
measured land characteristics or the view that these regulations are fairly random.



                                                                                           12
In the third regression, we look at the correlates of cluster zoning. In this case, bigger
and denser towns are much more likely to have cluster zoning, presumably because those
residents are less troubled by the occasional denser development. There is also a weak
correlation with education levels which may reflect the fact that “Smart Growth” has
become popular among environmentally oriented educated elites.


    IV.     The Consequences of Land Use Regulation


We now turn to the consequences of land use regulation. We first look at permitting and
density. We begin with minimum lot size and then turn to the other regulations.


In the case of minimum lot size, we can only look at the cross section of towns, since we
do not know when these rules were adopted. We include a bevy of 1940 era controls
including town area and housing, which are equivalent given our logarithmic
specification to controlling for density, distance to Boston, share of the population
younger than 18, share foreign born and percent white. We also include a dummy
variable for whether the town has a major university defined as being among the top 50
universities or top 25 colleges in the 2005 U.S. News and World Report rankings. We
stick to controls from the earlier era because of the possibility that later control variables
might themselves reflect the influence of minimum lot size requirements.


The first three regressions look at results single family permits for 1980-2002 and for the
1980s and 1990s separately. The coefficient for the whole period is .-547 which has a t-
statistic of 4.1. The coefficient in the 1980s is -.509 and the coefficient in the 1990s is -
.685. These coefficients should be interpreted as suggesting that as the town increases
the average lot size needed to build by one acre, the number of new permits declines by -
.5 log points or about 50 percent. The coefficient does rise between the 1980s and 1990s,
suggesting an increasing tendency of these rules to block new construction, but the
change is not itself statistically significant.




                                                                                             13
The only control variable that reliably predicts more construction is town area. Bigger
towns have more permits, but this is unsurprising since our permit measure reflects
overall permits, not permits per acre. The coefficient on town area is close to one which
suggests that the basic ratio of new units per acre is constant with respect to town size.
Major universities are negatively correlated with development in the 1990s, but not
before then. Percent white is positively correlated with development in the 1990s.


In the fourth regression, we use 1980 controls rather than 1940 controls and look at
development for the entire time period. The coefficient on acre per lot drops to -.415 but
remains statistically significant. Housing density now becomes significant and the share
of young people also predicts growth.


The fifth regression uses 1940 controls for total permits, single family and multi family.
In this case, the coefficient becomes -.442 which remains significant. More 1940 era
characteristics are significant such as share that is foreign born in this case because they
do predict multi-family development more than single-family development.


In the final regression of this table, we look at the impact of minimum lot size on total
housing supply in 2000. In this case the coefficient is -.337 which has a t-statistic of
3.69. Other variables like housing stock in 1940 and share that is foreign born are also
strongly correlated with the outcome variable. Distance to Boston also predicts density
as we would expect from the monocentric model. Perhaps unsurprisingly, minimum lot
size does predict less housing.


We now turn to the effects of other regulations. Since we know when these regulations
were imposed and since we have permits by year, we are now able to run panel
regressions both with and without town fixed effects. When we exclude town fixed
effects we include 1970-era controls, as we did in the regression explaining these
variables, including town area, housing stock, share of the population below age 18, share
of the population that is white and share of the population with college degrees. We also




                                                                                             14
include the dummy variable indicating the presence of a major university. All standard
errors are clusters by town.


The first two regressions show the three types of rules included simultaneously. In the
specification with town controls, wetlands and subdivision rules are negatively but
insignificantly correlated with development. Septic rules are extremely weakly positively
associated with development. In the specification with town fixed effects, all three
coefficients negatively predict development, but only the subdivision rules are
statistically significant.


In regressions (3) and (4), we aggregate these variables into an index by just adding them
together. In the specification without fixed effects, the coefficient is -.057, which is
statistically insignificant. In the specification with town fixed effects, the coefficient rises
to -.105 which has a t-statistic of two. This specification suggests that each new
regulation is associated with about a ten percent reduction in new construction. Of
course, we cannot be sure that these restrictions are actually causing the reduction in new
construction. The decline in new construction might reflect a general anti-growth
atmosphere that reflects itself in both new regulations and a reduction in permits.


The estimated coefficient of -.1 suggests new construction falls by about ten percent with
each new regulation. We think this estimated effect is fairly large. However, since the
variation in new permitting is also quite large, the estimate remains imprecise. This
variation helps us to understand why using annual permit data to estimate regulation
effects will always be difficult.


In regressions (5) and (6) we add cluster and inclusionary zoning, both with and without
town fixed effects. In the first specification, both coefficients are positive and cluster
zoning is statistically significant. In town fixed effect specification, neither coefficient is
statistically significant. Cluster zoning still has a sizable coefficient that is just
imprecisely measured. We take this as suggestive evidence supporting the view that
these rules may be having a positive effect on construction.



                                                                                             15
Price Effects


In Table 4, we turn to the correlation between lot size and sales prices. We use Banker
and Tradesman data on housing price transactions between 2000 and 2005. Our basic
regression is:


                                   Acre
(2) Log ( Sales Pr ice) = α •           + House Characteristics + Town Characteristics
                                   Lot


Our home characteristics include the year of construction, total number of room, interior
square footage and lot size. Our town characteristics include the set of 1940
characteristics used in the other regressions.


In the first regression, the coefficient on acres per lot is 0.156. This coefficient means
that each extra acre per lot is associated with a 15.6 percent increase in the value of a
house. This supports the view that minimum lot size rules do increase value for existing
homeowners. In the second regression, we include our control for the 1940 housing stock
and this coefficient flips sign and becomes statistically insignificant. This change reflects
the fact that there is no effect of minimum lot size beyond its correlation with local
density.


These results should not surprise us. These towns are all part of one housing market, and
standard urban theory tells us that there should be no effect on the town’s prices, relative
to other towns in the same market, once the characteristics of the town have been
controlled.3 A reasonable analogy is the impact of OPEC quantity restrictions on the
price of Saudi and U.S. crude oil. If OPEC restricts quantities, then this will raise the
price for all oil, but since Saudi and U.S. crude are identical, there should be no impact
on the price difference between these commodities. In the same sense, housing in

3
  Katz and Rosen’s (1987) examination of the price effects of growth controls compares much larger areas.
Maser, Riker and Rossett (1977) look at smaller areas, but they are focused on type of use zoning, not
restrictions on density, and they do not try to estimate a zoning effect separate from the uses in the area.


                                                                                                          16
Wellesley and Weston (two towns in our sample) are close substitutes. If Weston
restricts housing supply, this will push up prices in the entire sample, but it will not
increase the prices of Weston homes relative to Wellesley homes once we have
controlled for density.


In regression (3), we include the control for regulatory barriers. Our regulatory barriers
index is significant and positively correlated with housing prices. The coefficient of .101
suggests that each extra regulation is associated with a 10 percent increase in prices.
Again, this result gets weaker when we control for density, but it remains statistically
significant.


Land Value Maximization


While the previous regressions suggest that reducing densities through land use
regulation increases the value of homes in the area, this does not mean that the total land
value in the area has been maximized (Brueckner, 1990). Since we do not observe land
values, we can instead turn to the total value of housing which equals Land*Housing
Density*House Price. The total land available in the town is a constant and can be
ignored, so the question is whether decreases in density increase the product of density
times housing price.


We let H ( A, N / AT ) denote the price of a house which depends both on its lot size
(denoted A) and the total density in the town, which equals the number of homes (N)
divided by the total land area of the town (denoted AT ). The total land value in the town
equals N ( H ( A, N / AT ) − C ) where C is the cost of constructing each house. If each
house is identical and built on the town’s minimum lot size, denoted A ), then total land
value can be written ( AT / A)( H ( A,1 / A) − C ) . The derivative of total land value with
                                     2
                                         (                 −1
                                                                                            )
respect to minimum lot is ( AT / A ) A, H 1 ( A,1 / A) − A H 2 ( A,1 / A) − H ( A,1 / A) + C .
This is negative if




                                                                                                 17

or the share of housing prices not associated with construction costs is greater than the
elasticity of housing prices with respect to lot size minus the elasticity of housing prices
with respect to community density. If we let D denote density in the community, so that
housing prices are denoted H(1/D, D) then


      D dH (1 / D.D)   H (1 / D.D) DH 2 (1 / D.D)    A, H 1 ( A,1 / A) H 2 ( A,1 / A)
(4)                  =− 1           +             =−                  +                 .
      H     dD         DH (1 / D.D)   H (1 / D.D)     H ( A,1 / A)      A, H ( A,1 / A)


Condition (3) also implies that the share of housing prices associated with “land value” is
greater than the -1 times the total elasticity of housing prices with respect to total area
density, not controlling for individual lot size.


In Table 8, we look at the relationship between housing prices and area density
controlling for housing characteristics. We include the basic town controls, like distance
to Boston and the presence of a major university, but not the controls for demographic
variables that will reflect zoning decisions. In the first regression, we see that the lot size
coefficient is .06 and the town density coefficient is -.083. Together these suggest an
overall density coefficient of -.143.


These results are compromised since density levels may be driven by omitted housing
characteristics that increase demand. Larger lot sizes may be results from cheaper prices.
This concern means that standard hedonic regressions may understate the true negative
impact of density on housing prices. To address this concern, we use instruments for
current density level. In regression (2), we use our minimum lot size variable to
instrument for the towns’ average density level. In regression (3), we use the forest cover
of the town in 1885 to instrument for town density, and in regression (4) we use the log
of town density in 1915. In regressions (5) and (6), we exclude the control for the
individual houses lot size. In these specifications, the coefficient on the town’s average



                                                                                              18
density reflects the full effect of density on housing prices. Regression (6) again uses the
log of density in 1915 as an instrument.


In regressions (2) – (4), the density and lot size parameters shift a bit, but the combined
density effect remains quite small. The combined effects range from -.072 to -.164. In
regressions (5) and (6), we estimate a town density effect not controlling for individual
lot size. Again, the elasticity ranges from -.11 to -.14. These elasticity estimates must be
compared with land’s share in the value of homes.


In 2004, in our sample, the average home cost $450,000 and had 1800 square feet of
interior space. Using R.S. Means data on construction costs, Gyourko and Saiz (2004)
estimate a 97 dollar per square foot cost of new construction for the Boston area. These
figures suggest that the physical structure in the average home costs 174,600 dollars and
that land’s share in value is 61 percent. While we cannot be confident that this number is
exactly correct, the wide gap between 61 percent and our estimated density effects
strongly suggests that reducing minimum lot sizes would increase total land values.


There are at least two plausible reasons why these towns do not seem to be maximizing
land values. Perhaps current densities are based on historical conditions that don’t reflect
current demand. A second explanation is that zoning decisions are made without the
possibility of transfers between builders and current owners.4 The absence of these
transfers, which are essentially illegal in Massachusetts, makes it difficult for existing
homeowners to reap many benefits from new development.


       V.       Conclusion


Over the last 25 years, greater Boston has seen a remarkable increase in housing prices
and a decline in the number of new units. This change reflects increasingly restricted
supply. The reduction in supply doesn’t reflect an exogenous lack of land. There has
been no significant increase in density levels associated with declining construction.

Development is greater in dense places. Lot sizes are increasing, not falling. The value of
land when it extends an existing lot is not great. Instead, the decline in new construction
and associated increase in price reflects increasing man-made barriers to new
construction.


In this paper, we catalog the barriers to new construction. Minimum lot size is the most
important of these barriers, but wetlands regulations and septic rules have also become
increasingly tough. All barriers have all increased over time, but our ability to explain
where they have been adopted is quite limited. The two most important explanatory
variables are early twentieth century density patterns which correlate well with current
minimum lot sizes and the presence of recreational water which explains water-related
rules.


The impact of lot size on new development is quite clear. Each extra acre per lot is
associated with about 50 percent fewer permits between 1980 and 2002. The impact of
other controls on construction is weaker, but each extra rule appears to reduce new
construction by about 10 percent when we control for town specific fixed effects.
Minimum lot size is associated with higher prices, but as urban theory predicts, this effect
works by reducing density levels. Each extra regulation also appears to increase price by
.07 log points.


While regulations appear to increase prices, reductions in density in our sample are
associated with reductions in the total land value in a town. This finding suggests that
these towns are being too restrictive relative to land value maximization. Understanding
the failure to maximize land value is a good topic for future research.
