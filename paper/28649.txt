                                         ABSTRACT

Representation of women and minorities in a "selectorate"--the group that chooses an
organization's leaders--is a key mechanism for promoting diversity. We show that
representation, on its own, is not sufficient for selecting gender diversity: a supportive
organizational culture is also required. In the case of the Internet Engineering Task Force, a
random increase in female representation in its selection committee caused an increase in female
appointments only after cultural norms supporting diversity and inclusion became more salient.

1.       Introduction
    Increasing the representation of women and minorities in "selectorates," i.e., among
those who select an organization's leaders, is a key mechanism for promoting diversity. We
show that representation in selectorates is not enough: organizational culture as regards
diversity must change as well.
    This paper is a case study of the determinants of female representation among the
leaders of an important standard-setting organization. The Internet Engineering Task
Force (IETF) develops inter-operability standards for Internet hardware and software.
Without these standards, the Internet would not work. Because the IETF's decisions
have enormous technological and financial implications, many companies seek to place
employees in leadership roles. Within this context, underrepresentation of women in
IETF leadership is highly societally relevant.
    The top operational leaders in the IETF are appointed by a selection committee called
NomCom. NomCom has ten members who are randomly selected each year from a pool
of volunteers. We leverage this random variation to study whether female representation
on NomCom causes the committee to appoint more women. The expectation (which
is the basis for the random selection procedure) is that equitable female representation
within NomCom should ensure equitable female representation among those appointed
by NomCom to fill leadership positions.
    We find that random increases in female representation in NomCom cause the
committee to appoint more women, but only in recent years. During the first half of our
study, from 2005 to 2011, more women in NomCom caused fewer women to be
appointed. This counterintuitive result echoes some of the most credible findings in the
literature, which show that increased female representation in (academic and legal)
selection committees does not cause these committees to appoint more women, and
sometimes leads to fewer female appointments. We go beyond the prior literature,
however, by showing that the sign of the causal relationship flips from negative to
positive after some important organizational changes.
    We consider several mechanisms that could explain why female representation on
NomCom had its intended impact only after 2011. First, we examine changes in the
number of female IETF participants and their qualifications. Our findings are essentially
unaffected when we control for the "pipeline" of well-qualified women. Next, we ask
whether changes in the formal procedures that regulate the appointment process (before
and after 2012) might account for the difference. The radical transparency of IETF's
procedures,1 and our interviews with IETF leaders facilitated our task, but we found
  1
      Similar to a regulatory agency, the IETF publicizes proposed procedural innovations through


                                                 1
no evidence that our results were influenced by any procedural changes. In fact, the
interviews suggested a third alternative: changes in IETF "culture" around 2011. By
culture, we refer to holistic, informal norms, both societal and organization-specific, i.e.,
public speeches, codes of conduct, and other activities that are technically unconnected
with the appointment process, but whose effect is to change members' attitudes towards
certain gender stereotypes. There is strong evidence that IETF culture changed around
2012 because of both active efforts from inside the organization and a broader societal
shift in attitudes regarding gender diversity and inclusion in STEM professions. This
cultural change, we argue, explains why the relationship between female representation
within NomCom and the selection of female IETF leaders switches sign.
    In sum, the statistical evidence in this paper establishes a clear regime change: before
2012, a random increase in female representation in NomCom hurts the chances of female
appointments; after 2012, it helps them. This evidence indicates that representation is not
enough to select gender diversity. Our analysis of the mechanisms suggests that, in our
case study, whether or not representation helps diversity is not mediated by the quality of
the pipeline, or by the formal procedural rules connected with the appointment process.
Instead, the effect of representation is mediated by informal and holistic norms, both
societal and organization-specific, some of which are shaped by organizational leadership.


2.     Hypotheses and related literature
    There is broad support for the idea that representation in a collective decision-making
body helps protect a group's interests. Variation in the composition of the political
franchise, for example, has been shown to impact a variety of policies,2 with some papers
focusing specifically on the gender composition of the franchise and showing that policies
change in the expected directions.3 Similarly, variation in the representation of Blacks in
criminal juries has been shown to influence jury verdicts in the expected direction.4
    The benefits of representation are less straightforward when the decision-making body
is an organizational committee whose members are bound by a common set of professional
norms, because these norms often play an important mediating role. We focus on the
gender composition of selectorates, i.e., groups or committees that select other individuals
for leadership positions. These include boards of directors, promotion committees, and
selection panels (but not criminal juries).5 Relative to other decision making bodies,
"Internet Drafts" which undergo a "public comment period," and then all accepted changes are enshrined
into IETF's technical standards and organizational practices, or RFCs (from "Request for Comments").

talent availability is of primary importance to selectorates.
    Most academic studies lack access to random variation in the selectorate's gender
composition, leading to well-known concerns about the impact of (possibly unobserved)
confounds.6 There are, however, a few studies that exploit random selection into a
selectorate for casual inference: Bagues and Esteve-Volart (2010) in the context of
Spanish judges and Bagues et al. (2017) in the context of university professors. These
authors find, counterintuitively, that a random increase in the percentage of women on a
selection committee does not increase (and, for Spanish judges, decreases) the likelihood
that women are appointed. The decrease found by Bagues and Esteve-Volart (2010) is
tentatively attributed to female evaluators' bias in favor of male candidates. A third
causal study by De Paola and Scoppa (2015) finds the opposite result: more women in
the selection committee cause more women to be appointed professor. We reconcile
these divergent findings by proposing that organizational culture moderates the impact
of representation. This is the first paper where random variation in representation is
shown to have either a positive or a negative causal effect. Among the causal studies,
our work is also unique for its focus on STEM workers, as opposed to academics or
judges. This focus is important in light of broader societal concerns regarding women's
representation in STEM fields.
    From the prior literature, we draw three broad and mutually exclusive hypotheses:

H0 : Greater female representation in a selection committee leads to more
women being selected. Hypothesis H0 is the expected direction of the relationship.
This is why selection committees are designed to be representative in their composition
(which, incidentally, might be why the NomCom formation process is based so explicitly
on random selection). Among the causal studies cited above, De Paola and Scoppa (2015)
support this hypothesis. Related (but not focused on gender) studies support the idea
that changing the characteristics of the "political selectorate" has an impact on who
is selected;7 and that a random increase in the fraction of Blacks empaneled in a jury
decreases the likelihood that Black defendants are convicted.8

H1 : Greater female representation in a selection committee leads to the same,
or fewer women being selected. Hypothesis H1 is less intuitive, but it is the takeaway
"candidate." As such, issues such as "talent availability" are not applicable.

from the two largest and most credible studies in the existing literature.9 , 10 Bagues and
Esteve-Volart (2010), who find that fewer women are selected, speculate that this effect
might either be due to a female "inferiority complex" in regards to men, or to a stronger
"rally around the male flag" behavior on the men's part when more women are present
in the committee. The authors, however, provide no direct evidence with respect to these
proposed mechanisms. An alternative "signaling" hypothesis has that women take the
personally costly action of not promoting their peers to signal their commitment to other
values, such as technical excellence in the case of the IETF.

H2 : The relationship between female representation in a selection committee
and the gender of selected individuals is moderated by norms (both internal
and external to the organization). Hypothesis H2 holds that for representation to
matter, informal norms must be supportive of diversity and inclusion. This theory
reconciles the conflicting evidence from prior studies, because it implies that diverse
representation in a selectorate may or may not translate into diverse appointments.


3.      IETF's formal institutions
IETF in general. The IETF is the main forum for internet protocol development. It
is responsible for setting internet standards, including well known ones such as HTTP,
POP3, and FTP. Put simply, the hardware that makes the internet possible would not
work if it deviated from IETF-defined protocols.11
    The IETF is an open community and anyone can participate. Participants are
corporate employees, academics, engineers, and computer scientists. Participants offer
input in the setting of standards. They do so by sharing technical information within a
working group that, collectively, is responsible for creating a draft specification that may
or may not evolve into a new standard. Working groups are organized by topic into
broad technical areas (currently seven, including: Routing, Transport, Security, etc.).
For example, the HTTP standard was initially developed by the "HTTP working group"
which was part of the "Applications and Real-Time" area. Working Groups are
chartered to write RFCs (for "Request for Comments") that describe the IETF's
technical standards and organizational practices. Each working group must reach a
consensus on the contents of an RFC before it is published.
   9
     These are Bagues and Esteve-Volart (2010) and Bagues et al. (2017). The latter is similar to De Paola
and Scoppa (2015) in that both look at candidates for university posts, but Bagues et al. (2017) include
100 times the number of candidates in their sample.
  10
     Among the non-causal papers, Berlinski and Coppenolle (2014) and Larcinese (2014) find no
"selectorate effect" in political representation.
  11
     See Table A.I for notable examples of technological standards developed by the IETF.


                                                    4
Two powerful appointed positions: ADs and IAB members. Every area is
headed up by an area director (AD). The AD is a technical expert with knowledge
broad enough to oversee several working groups in her/his area. The AD is responsible
for the productivity of these working groups.12 When a working group produces a draft
about which the AD is able to create sufficient "community consensus" (including from
other ADs), the draft is elevated and tracked to become a standard. The AD can
charter new working groups and disband old ones. ADs are appointed for two years.
Not surprisingly, ADs are viewed as powerful:

          "[M]any people look at the ADs as somewhat godlike creatures."13

   IAB members are also powerful. Compared to ADs they are less technical wizards,
and more "wise (wo)men." The IAB is composed of twelve members who serve for two
years. Their mandate is as follows:

           "The IAB is responsible for keeping an eye on the `big picture' of the
       Internet. [...] IAB members pay special attention to emerging activities in the
       IETF. When a new IETF Working Group is proposed, the IAB reviews its
       charter for architectural consistency and integrity."14

  ADs and IAB members are appointed by a nominating committee (colloquially,
NomCom ). We refer to individuals in these two positions as "NomCom appointees."

The selection committee (NomCom). NomCom is composed of a (non-voting)
chair and ten members. NomCom's task is to nominate the ADs and the IAB members
"based on its understanding of the IETF community's consensus of the qualifications
required to fill the open positions."15 In practice, NomCom members collect proposals
for nominations and feedback from the community and then interview the candidates for
the open positions. They then vote to select the appointees using a voting mechanism
that is proposed by the chair.16 The individuals nominated by NomCom must undergo a
review process before being appointed, but the process is pro-forma, so henceforth we
will make no distinction between "nominees" and "appointees."17 NomComs are formed

     See Galvin (2004, p. 17). To our knowledge, the voting mechanisms are not made public.
  17
     Technically, NomCom only has the power to recommend, not to appoint. Once NomCom has
recommended candidates for the open positions, the candidates are reviewed and confirmed by another
body. In practice, however, confirmation is a mere formality.

in the second half of a given year t (formation year), and they make appointments in the
following year t + 1 (operation year).
    NomCom members are simultaneously selected from a volunteer pool and serve for
approximately one year. Anyone who has attended at least 3 out of the 5 previous
(tri-annual) IETF meetings can volunteer. In 2019, for example, there were 177
volunteers for 10 NomCom positions. Similar to serving as an AD or IAB member,
NomCom membership implies a significant time commitment.                  Volunteering for
NomCom signals that an individual and their employer are willing to commit the
necessary time.
    A random-number generator algorithm is used to draw members from the NomCom
volunteer pool.18 For example, in 2019 the algorithm ranked volunteers using the outcomes
of three public lotteries and a baseball game as "seeds," and the ten top-ranked volunteers
(by the random-number generator) became NomCom members.19 We use this random
variation in the selection of NomCom members to estimate the causal impact of gender
composition in the selectorate.


4.      Societal and informal norms change around
        2011­12
   At a societal level, the issue of gender diversity in STEM disciplines became of acute
concern around 2011­12. Figure 1 illustrates this shift using data from Google searches,
plotting the ratio of gender-gap STEM-related searches to all STEM-related searches on
a monthly basis from 2004 through 2020.
   Concurrently, IETF's ecosystem was also changing, a sentiment expressed by Kathleen
Moriarty, a former AD and an IETF leader in diversity issues:

          "Many companies were making an internal push for greater diversity, and
       that was imported to IETF via participants. Other standards consortia were
       experiencing similar issues."20

    Within IETF, meanwhile, things appeared to be at odds with evolving societal
attitudes. The NomComs operating in years 2009, 2010, and 2012 did not appoint a

single woman. Some inflammatory events in 2011­12 are referred to only obliquely in
internal IETF reports that describe a historical culture of "white, male technicians,
demonstrating a distinctive and challenging group dynamic."21 Finally, in calendar year
2012, an IETF affinity group called "Systers" created an experiment of sorts: they
quietly transmitted to the 2013 NomCom a slate of many qualified female candidates for
appointment to ADs. NomCom appointed none of them.22 These events generated a
perception that random selection of NomCom members was not working as expected.
Specifically, women were not being appointed at a rate commensurate with their
presence in the eligible pool.
    The earliest institutional response we could trace goes back to 2012, when a "Diversity
Design Team" (DDT) was established.23 In April 2013, the IETF chair wrote a blogpost
titled "Diversity" where he announced the creation of the DDT and foreshadowed a
mentoring initiative.24 In the same month, a diversity mailing list was set up to create
a forum for discussion. In 2013, the share of emails containing the word "diversity" shot
up to an all-time high of 1% of all IETF emails (see Figure 1). Based on this measure,
discussion of diversity was already increasing by 2011, and after 2013 it stabilized around

     Our data confirm that no female AD, and only one female IAB member unconnected with the Systers
experiment, was appointed in 2013. The experiment was later spotlighted by the online publication
Vice.com as "a pretty clear case of systemic bias" (Turk, 2015).

0.2% of all IETF emails (more than twice the pre-2010 average).
   The DDT reported out in an IETF plenary session in July 2013 and recommended,
among other changes, that a code of conduct be adopted and that more diverse ADs
and working group chairs be selected.25 In November 2013, the ADs collectively posted
a statement titled "IETF Anti-Harassment Policy."26 In early 2014, two draft RFCs
were posted: one proposing anti-harassment procedures,27 the other discussing practical
ways to boost diverse participation in IETF.28 Finally, the 2014 NomCom chair adopted
"equitable" as opposed to "rapid" shortlisting procedures, and inclusive interviewing for
her NomCom only.29 The changes worked. By 2015, Moriarty was able to report:

         "In short, I think we've come a long way since 2012. We do have more
      work to do and still have some issues, but there is a very quick and open dialog
      that typically follows any occurrence of inappropriate conduct now."30

    This section described the triggers, both societal and internal to IETF, that made
gender diversity a hot topic within IETF, and how IETF responded. The story is that
society changed, and the IETF found that its formal institutions of representation
(NomCom) did not deliver the desired effect. Change was imperative. The change in
IETF was promoted from the top and, critically for our interpretation, it was not a
change to the formal mechanism and procedures of NomCom but, rather, a push to
adopt more inclusive informal norms and attitudes. In the rest of the paper, we show
that these changes successfully activated the formal institution of representation to work
as intended.

     Allison Mankin, personal communication (August 7, 2020). We do not include these changes in
NomCom's nomination procedure as part of our proposed mechanism and, indeed, regard them as a
potential confounder of the "cultural change" channel. Thus, although 2014 happens to be a "peak
female" appointment year (see Figure 2), we conduct several tests to ensure that our main findings are
not an artifact of that year's outcomes.

(IAB member or AD).31 Gender was not recorded and so had to be imputed. To minimize
subjective judgment calls, we used a script called "genderizeR " that assigns a probability
to each name.32 This approach measures how appointees are perceived by others, which
may differ from how they self-identify or from their assigned sex at birth. The data
contain 13 appointments per year, on average, and each NomCom has ten members, with
the number of female members varying between zero and two.33 We construct two samples
for analysis. The first sample consists of all NomCom appointees (N = 209). The second
sample contains one observation for each IETF participant-year (N = 307,210), where a
participant is anyone who has attended an IETF meeting, authored a draft specification,
or emailed an IETF listserv.
    This paper asks whether female representation in NomCom causes more female
appointees, and Figure 2 illustrates our main result. The left panel of Figure 2 shows
that the share of female appointees declined prior to the shift in informal norms,
actually reaching zero in 2009, 2010, and 2012, before increasing sharply thereafter. The
right panel of Figure 2 shows the relationship between female NomCom representation
and female appointment rates: decreasing before 2012 and increasing afterwards.

Figure 2: Before 2012, greater female representation in NomCom did not translate
in more women appointed; after 2012 norm shift, it did. In the left panel, the horizontal
axis is NomCom year, which coincides with the calendar year in which a given NomCom makes
appointments. The vertical axis is the share of women among all appointees in a given year. In
the right panel, horizontal axes depict female representation in a NomCom. Vertical axes depict
the share of appointments by that NomCom that are female. The straight lines are best linear
fits. The slopes have opposite signs before and after calendar year 2012, suggesting a different
direction in the relationship before and after 2012.

NomCom draws from a large pool of well-qualified male and female candidates, as
suggested by the Systers' 2012 experiment, one might reasonably assume that no
adjustment is necessary. On the other hand, we might want to control for the relative
quality of male and female "appointables" given that female IETF participation has
increased over time (albeit, not very quickly).34 The next sections present statistical
evidence supporting the hypothesis that informal norms are required to activate the
effects of representation.


6.     Female representation in NomCom causes a
       decrease in female appointments before the 2012
       norm shift, and an increase thereafter
   Our first set of regressions takes the IESG/IAB appointee as the unit-of-analysis.
The outcome variable is an indicator variable that equals one if the appointee is coded
as female and zero otherwise. The key explanatory variables are the share of female
NomCom members and an indicator for years 2012 and later, where the latter serves as
a proxy for the change in informal norms. Our model is specified as:

                   F emaleit =  + P ret · (pre N omCompt + pre Xt ) +
                                    P ostt · (post NomCompt + post Xt ) +         it ,              (1)

where F emaleit codes the gender of the person i appointed in year t; NomCompt is the
share of women in the NomCom that operates in year t (which was formed at t - 1); P ret
and P ostt are indicators for the period before and after the 2012 norm shift; Xt measures
the share of females in the population at-risk of appointment; and it is an econometric
error term. We set F emaleit equal to one whenever genderizeR returns a probability
greater than 75% that person i's name is associated with a woman.35
    Because the shortlists created by each NomCom are confidential, we cannot observe
how many women are considered in each year. Instead, we set Xt equal to the share of
females in the NomCom volunteer pool.36 In addition to serving as a proxy for the pool
  34
     See Appendix Table A.XI, along with Figures A.2 and A.3, showing that female participation in
IETF and the share of women in the pool of NomCom volunteers increased between 2005 and 2020.
  35
     The results are robust to varying this threshold. At the 75% cutoff, about 89% of NomCom volunteers
and 92% of NomCom members could be assigned a gender. The rest are excluded from the sample.
However, we report the results of regressions obtained using the raw probabilities from genderizeR to
impute the sex of individuals (see Tables A.IV and A.VIII).
  36
     We choose the year in which NomCom was formed, as opposed to the year in which it made
appointments, because most appointments are made early in the calendar year, before volunteers for
the next NomCom are solicited.


                                                  10
of appointable women, this guarantees that NomCompt is uncorrelated with it , because
of the random selection process (i.e., each NomCom is formed by a random draw from a
population with a fraction Xt of women).
    We estimate Equation (1) by ordinary least squares regression, and cluster standard
errors at the year level because outcomes may not be independent within a NomCom
year.37 The coefficients of interest are the  's, which measure the relationship between
female NomCom representation and the probability of female IESG/IAB appointees before
and after the shift in informal norms. Estimates are reported in Table I.

Table I: Effect of NomCom gender composition on appointee gender is negative
before the 2012 informal norm shift, positive thereafter. In all columns, F emaleit is 1 if
probability that appointee i is female exceeds 75%, and N omCompt (resp., Xt ) is the average of
the "female dummies" among NomCom members (resp., volunteers). P ostt = 1[Y ear  2012]
for models (1) to (3); and 1[Y ear  2013] for model (4). Stars indicate significance at *10%,
**5% and ***1% level. Standard errors clustered by year.


    Model (1) fixes pre = post and pre = post in order to estimate a single NomCom
representation effect for the entire study-period. The point estimate for  is positive and
implies that adding one female to NomCom (a 10 percent increase) is associated with a
3.9 percentage point increase in female appointments. But the relationship is not
statistically significant at conventional levels. This null result is summarized in the title
  37
     OLS estimates provide an easy to interpret summary of the conditional probabilities, and are generally
quite close to the average marginal effects from a logistic regression (see Tables A.V and A.IX). The results
are robust to using alternative specifications (i.e. logit) more commonly applied to binary outcomes.

of the paper: representation is not sufficient for selecting gender diversity. Model (2)
estimates the pre- and post-period  's without any controls (making it directly
comparable to the right panel of Figure 2). The results show that    ^pre < 0 < ^post with
both inequalities statistically significant: the correlation between female NomCom
representation and female appointments is negative before 2012, and positive after.
    Model (3) adds the share of women in the volunteer pool as a control. Based on these
estimates, the causal effect of adding a woman to NomCom after the shift in informal
norms is an 11.9 percentage point increase in female IAB/IESG appointments, compared
to a 6.2 percentage point decrease beforehand.38 This is our preferred specification, and
it provides strong evidence in support of H2. While the coefficients on the share of
volunteers in model (3) are not statistically different from zero, the point estimate for
post is negative. Because the share of female volunteers declines after NomCom 2011
(see Figure A.2), this indicates that the number of female appointees grew even while
the share of "female appointables" declined, providing additional support for our regime
change assumption.
    Model (4) in Table I re-defines the variables P ret and P ostt , so that 2013 ­ the
NomCom of the Systers' experiment ­ is included in the pre-period. Although the basic
pattern of results does not change, we no longer find the negative impact of female
NomCom representation in the pre-period is statistically significant.          Additional
robustness checks are in the Appendix.39


7.     Alternative mechanisms
Pipeline. One critique of the estimates in Table I is that Xt is a very coarse measure of
the relative quality of female IETF participants. This might be a concern if the availability
of qualified female candidates increased over time. To address this issue, we estimate a
second set of models that include individual-level measures of IETF engagement and
leadership. For this analysis, we turn to the larger sample of all IETF participant-years,
where each individual enters the panel in the first year they are observed in any IETF
  38
     We obtain very similar estimates from models where we constrain j = j for j  {pre, post},
which is equivalent to using the de-trended explanatory variable Female  NomCom Female Share -
Volunteer Female Share. See Appendix Table A.VI.
  39
     Tables A.III and A.VII show that the results are robust to excluding IAB appointments. This is a
useful check because, based on our conversations with IETF former ADs, IAB members are often treated
by NomCom as a slate, as opposed to the ADs who are voted on position-by-position.

dataset. Our model is specified as:

       Appointedit =  + P ret · (pre N omCompt · F emalei + pre F emalei ) +
                           P ostt · (post NomCompt · F emalei + post F emalei ) +
                            Qualityit + t +      it ,                                           (2)

where the outcome Appointedit is an indicator equal to 100 if person i is appointed to
IESG or IAB in year t and zero otherwise. The variables P ret , P ostt , and N omCompt are
defined above, and F emalei is an indicator equal to one if genderizeR assigns a 75% or
greater probability that a name is female. The vector Qualityit contains several measures
of individual IETF engagement and leadership described below, and t is a vector of
calendar-year effects.
    Equation (2) is a triple-differences specification where the main effects of
N omCompt , P ret , and P ostt , along with all of their two-way interactions, are absorbed
by the calendar-year fixed effects. Once again, the coefficients of interest are pre and
post , which measure the association between female NomCom representation and the
probability that a woman is appointed to IESG or IAB before and after the shift in
norms. Estimates are reported in Table II.
    Models (1) and (2) parallel the first two columns of Table I. Without accounting
for the regime change, we estimate a positive and statistically insignificant relationship
between female representation and female appointments. After accounting for the norm
shift, we obtain ^pre < 0 <   ^post with both inequalities statistically significant. Model (3)
adds the stock of published RFCs, the number of emails sent to IETF listservs, and the
number of IETF meetings attended by individual i as controls.40 Each of these proxies
for individual IETF engagement is highly statistically significant, but collectively they
produce no measurable change in the parameters of interest. Model (4) adds the control
variable Incumbentit , which equals one if individual i served as an AD or IAB member
in any year prior to t, along with a set of dummies indicating how many times individual
i has previously served as a WG chair (top-coded at four). Adding these proxies for
IETF leadership substantially increases the overall model R-squared, and produces large
changes in the coefficient estimates for the other measures of individual IETF engagement.
It does not, however, change the estimates of pre or post . Finally, model (5) redefines
P ret and P ostt by assuming the shift in norms occurs one year later, retaining all of the
individual controls, and obtains estimates very similar to model (4) in Table I.
    Overall, the regression analyses confirm the visual pattern in Figure 2 (right panel):
  40
    Because all of these variables are highly skewed, we take natural logs (after adding one) before
including them as regressors.

a random increase in female representation in NomCom produces an increase in female
appointees after, and only after, the change in IETF's informal norms.

Procedural changes. The IETF is characterized by radical transparency, and our
investigation of NomCom's formal procedures revealed no major changes during the
sample period, with the possible exception of 2014. During our interview with Allison
Mankin, the chair of the 2014 NomCom, we were informed that she adopted
gender-blind shortlisting for that year's appointees, as well as inclusive interviewing
procedures. To address any concern that this outlier NomCom is driving the results, we
re-estimate Equation (1) for a subsample that excludes the appointments made in 2014.

Table III: Effect of NomCom gender composition on appointee gender ­ Excluding
year 2014 appointees. In this table, we run our OLS specification on the sample of appointees
excluding those from 2014. In all columns, F emaleit is 1 if probability that appointee i is
female exceeds 75%, and N omCompt (resp., Xt ) is the average of the "female dummies" among
NomCom members (resp., volunteers). P ostt = 1[Y ear  2012] for models (1) to (3); and
1[Y ear  2013] for model (4). Stars indicate significance at *10%, **5% and ***1% level.
Standard errors clustered by year.


   To be clear, we do not argue that the 2014 procedural changes did not matter. Figure 2
shows that 2014 is actually a "peak" female appointment year. Our point is that the 2014
NomCom, on its own, does not explain why the causal impact of female representation
on gender diversity changed sign in 2012.


8.       Discussion and conclusions
   What prevents more women from being appointed to leadership roles in business
organizations? One hypothesis is that women are under-represented within the formal
groups, such as boards and promotion committees, that choose leaders. A second
hypothesis is that the organizations as a whole might have failed to adopt norms and
 41
      Table A.X reports the results obtained running Equation (2).


                                                   15
values that promote gender diversity. We study a particular selectorate ­ the IETF
Nominating Committee ­ whose members are randomly chosen. This randomness
produces a natural experiment in female representation. We find that greater female
representation in the selectorate causes more females to be appointed, but only after a
change in IETF's informal and holistic norms.
    Although we do not measure "informal norms" directly, we show that societal interest
in the gender composition of STEM fields jumped around 2011-12 (as reflected in Google
search terms); that this shift coincided with a sharp spike in discussion of diversity on
IETF email lists; and that these broader shifts were reinforced by deliberate actions within
the IETF (e.g., the creation of a Diversity Design Team, and the organic emergence of
"codes of conduct"). Consistent with our interpretation, IETF's own diagnosis of the
problem places a particular emphasis on culture:

            "NomCom is itself a potentially diverse group of IETF participants,
        chosen at random from a pool of recent meeting attendees who offer their
        services. Hence, its problematic choices ­ or rather, omissions ­ could be
        seen as reflecting IETF culture generally."42

    Our analysis of the IETF NomCom contributes to a prior literature on representation
and selection for gender diversity that has produced mixed results. Well-designed causal
studies of selectorates report conflicting and counterintuitive findings that suggest female
representation both promotes and discourages the selection of women. For the first time,
this paper documents a change in the sign of the relationship between representation
and selection. This reversal does not reflect the availability of more female talent in the
pipeline or changes to the formal selection procedures. Rather, it comes from a change in
the informal and holistic norms and values that foster gender diversity, with support and
encouragement from IETF leadership. These findings suggest that representation in the
selectorate and "tone from the top" are both necessary to promote gender diversity in the
selection of leaders.

Table A.IX: Effect of NomCom gender composition on appointments controlling for
individual experience ­ Logit specification. In all columns F emalei is the probability that
individual i is female, and N omCompt is the average of the probabilities that NomCom members
are women. P ostt = 1[Y ear  2012] for models (1) to (3); and 1[Y ear  2013] for model (4).
The table reports average marginal effects (multiplied by 100 for legibility) and standard errors
computed using the delta method. Table 2 controls refer to all explanatory variables shown
in the corresponding column of Table II. Stars indicate significance at *10%, **5% and ***1%
level. Standard errors clustered by year.

Table A.X: Effect of NomCom gender composition on appointments controlling for
individual experience ­ Excluding year 2014 appointees. In this table, we run our OLS
specification on the sample of IETF participants excluding those from 2014. In all columns
F emalei is 1 if probability that individual i is female exceeds 75%, and N omCompt is the
average of the "female dummies" among NomCom members. P ostt = 1[Y ear  2012] for
models (1) to (3); and 1[Y ear  2013] for model (4). Stars indicate significance at *10%, **5%

Figure A.2: NomCom female volunteers and members. The horizontal axis in every
graph is NomCom year, which coincides with the calendar year in which a given NomCom makes
appointments. The left panel is the share of women among all NomCom volunteers (volunteers
must be NomCom-eligible). The right panel is the share of women among all NomCom members.
Individuals whose gender could not be determined algorithmically are excluded from the sample.
Comparing the left panel with Figure 2 indicates a pattern of non-decreasing female presence in
the pool of "appointables" during the years 2005­2011(as proxied by NomCom volunteering),
but a decreasing appointment rate.
