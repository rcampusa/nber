Is the GED an Effective Route to Postsecondary Education for School Dropouts?

JEL No. I2,J18

                                            ABSTRACT

We use data from the Texas Schools Microdata Panel (TSMP) to examine the extent to which dropouts
use the GED as a route to post-secondary education. The paper develops a model pointing out the
potential biases in estimating the effects of taking the "GED path" to postsecondary education. Lacking
suitable instruments that would allow us to directly address potential biases, our approach is to base
our estimates on a set of academically "at risk" students who are very similar in the 8th grade. We
observe that the eventual high school graduates in this group have much better postsecondary education
outcomes than do the similar at-risk 8th graders who dropped out and obtained a GED. Our model
explains the observed differences, and allows for a discussion of the policy challenges inherent in
improving the postsecondary outcomes of dropouts.

Introduction
      Every year approximately a million students leave high school without receiving a

diploma. Based on any indicator, these school dropouts face a bleak prospect in today’s

economy. One potentially ameliorating option for dropouts is the acquisition of the

General Educational Development (GED) credential. The use of the GED has grown over

the years and currently about three quarters of a million people per year try obtain this

“second chance” credential. A logical question is: a “second chance” for what? While

recent research indicates that acquisition of a GED is associated with increased earnings

for some dropouts,1 this same research points out that acquiring a GED is no ticket out of

poverty for those lacking a traditional high school diploma. At least to the extent that the

GED is an education endpoint, this is not a surprising result given what we know about

the labor market disadvantages faced by those who lack any postsecondary education.

Thus, any serious economic role the GED might play likely lies in the extent to which

this credential helps school dropouts move into postsecondary education programs. As it

turns out, however, GED acquisition as a route into postsecondary education is a

woefully understudied area, especially given the confluence of the rising importance of

postsecondary education, increasing concerns over the nation’s “dropout problem,” and

the large numbers of dropouts who obtain a GED each year.

           This paper addresses this knowledge gap using a unique data set constructed from

the Texas Schools Microdata Panel (TSMP) to compare the postsecondary education

enrollment outcomes of students who dropped out and obtained a GED and students who

remained in school and obtained a high school diploma. Our aim is to provide

information on the extent to which pursuing the “GED path” versus the “high school

                                                                                        1
graduation path” affects postsecondary education (PSE) enrollment. It is important to

think about “pathways” to PSE since it is probably not the education credential—GED or

high school diploma—per se that affects PSE, but rather factors associated with the

journey required to earn these credentials that are important.

         Our focus in this paper is on a comparison of the PSE enrollment outcomes of

GED holders versus high school graduates rather GED holders versus uncredentialed

dropouts. We are less interested in the GED-uncredentialed dropout comparison because

the enrollment policies of most two-year and four-year colleges and universities require

applicants to have some school leaving credential, particularly in degree-granting

programs.2 Given higher education enrollment policies, comparing GED holders to

uncredentialed dropouts may simply be an examination of the effectiveness of the gate

keeping mechanisms of postsecondary education admission and enrollment policies.

         A second reason for focusing on the GED-high school graduate comparison has to

do with the counterfactual most people may have in mind when they think about the

GED-PSE relationship. While there is no empirical evidence, our sense is that many

observers wonder what would have happened to GED holders had they somehow been

compelled to stay in high school until graduation. Of course, the relevant comparison to

answer that question is one between acceptably similar GED holders and high school

graduates.

         Given our focus, the thought experiment that lies behind our research is the

following: if one individual is “assigned” to the dropout/GED route and another identical

individual is “assigned” to the high school completion route, would they be equally likely

2
  For example, a 1988 National Center for Education Statistics study of a nationally representative sample
of postsecondary education institutions indicated that 90 percent of all postsecondary education institutions
require some type of “certification” for admission (Hexter and Anderson 1986).


                                                                                                       2
to participate in PSE? Our working hypothesis is that relative to remaining on a path to

high school graduation, there is likely no systematic “GED advantage” in terms of PSE

participation, and in fact, the GED route may confer disadvantages that inhibit PSE.

Thus, for our two hypothetical individuals, we would expect to see either no difference in

the probability of PSE enrollment or a lower probability for the individual relegated to

the GED path. Determining the extent to which this is the case is the empirical question

we pursue in this paper.

       Of course, the very tough challenge is constructing suitably comparable groups of

GED holders and high school graduates, as there are fierce selection issues at hand. The

selection problem potentially starts with the fact that those observed with a GED have

first dropped out of school. Subsequent to the dropout decision, a second selection

process takes place when individuals in the pool of dropouts make decisions regarding

acquisition of a GED. Finally, among those who have the requisite credentials for college

enrollment—that is, within the pool of GED holders and high school graduates—

individuals make selection decisions regarding PSE.

       To bring structure to the problem, we model this process. Our model makes

explicit the sources of potential bias in Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimates and with

plausible assumptions allows us to sign the overall bias. Lacking suitable instruments, our

approach to addressing bias is to base our estimates on a subsample of students who were

academically “at risk” in the 8th grade. While we will not argue that this approach

eliminates all bias, we do believe that our estimates have more information content than

estimates in past empirical work that has utilized more heterogeneous samples.




                                                                                       3
       This paper proceeds as follows. After discussing the prior research on the

postsecondary outcomes of GED holders, we present our decision model. We then

describe the data used in this paper, present our results, and close with a discussion of the

possibilities and challenges these results present to policy formulation aimed at using the

GED program to improve the postsecondary education attainment of dropouts.

       To preview our findings, our results show that GED holders have substantially

worse PSE outcomes than do observationally similar high school graduates. As our

model will illustrate, however, these negative results could be the result of either

unobserved heterogeneity or the persistent effects of random negative shocks that caused

students to leave school in the first place. Thus, we urge caution in drawing the inference

that, relative to high school completion, the “GED route” is a decidedly inferior route to

PSE.



Prior Research

       One of the most robust areas of study in labor economics during the 1990s was

the attention given to the rising return to a college degree. One strand in this research area

provides evidence that postsecondary education appears to be important even when it

does not result in a degree. Kane and Rouse (1995) find that a year of college credit,

regardless of degree status, is associated with a 4-7 percent increase in hourly wages and

annual earnings. They are unable to reject the hypothesis that credits earned at two-year

and four-year colleges are equivalent. This is a particularly important finding for GED

holders who go on to postsecondary education since they are much more likely to enroll




                                                                                         4
in a two-year institution and much less likely to obtain a degree conditional upon entering

college.3

        NLSY-based evidence in Murnane, Willet, and Boudett (1999) confirm that GED

holders do receive an economic benefit from postsecondary education that is equal to the

returns experienced by high school graduates. Their estimates of the return on an

additional year of college range from 5.2 percent in a random effects specification to 10.8

percent in a fixed effects specification. These estimates are similar to the returns that

Kane and Rouse estimated across all enrollees. Taken together, the lessons from these

two studies are that postsecondary education is economically beneficial to GED holders

even if they are less likely to complete degrees and, if enrolled, more likely to be enrolled

in two-year colleges.

        Given the estimated benefits that GED holders derive from postsecondary

education, what does the literature have to say about how much postsecondary education

they get? Basic descriptive analyses across several studies all indicate that dropouts who

obtain a GED tend to acquire more postsecondary education than do uncredentialed

dropouts, but less than observationally similar regular high school graduates. Berktold et

al (1998) use the 1994 National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS 88)

follow-up to observe the educational attainment two years after high school graduation of

individuals who never dropped out of school, individuals who dropped out but received a

credential, and dropouts who remain uncredentialed. They find that credentialed


3
  For example, using High School and Beyond data, Murnane, Willett, and Tyler (2000) find that eight
years after their expected high school graduation date, only 6 percent of GED holders had earned at least
one credit in a four-year college versus 24 percent with at least one credit from a two-year college. The
same figures for high school graduates were 48 percent and 32 percent at four- and two-year colleges
respectively. In the Texas data we use in this paper, we find that as of 2003, individuals who obtained a
GED in the middle to late-1990s had four-year and two-year college enrollment rates of 2 percent and 19
percent respectively.


                                                                                                     5
dropouts, relative to uncredentialed dropouts, are much more likely to have

postsecondary education. Forty percent of GED holders have some postsecondary

education compared to 14 percent of uncredentialed dropouts. Among those with some

postsecondary attendance, half of credentialed dropouts enrolled in degree programs

(either AA or BA) whereas almost all uncredentialed dropouts enrolled in certificate or

other non-credentialed programs. While credentialed dropouts have higher postsecondary

attendance rates than uncredentialed dropouts, Berktold et al find their postsecondary

attendance lags behind that of traditional high school graduates. Seventy-eight percent of

traditional high school graduates had completed some postsecondary education and

around three-quarters of this group were enrolled in a degree program. Credentialed

dropouts were less likely to be enrolled and, conditional on enrollment, less likely to be

in a degree program than high school graduates were.

       The descriptive patterns reported by Berktold et al have been confirmed using

other survey data. Murnane, Willet, and Tyler (2000) use High School and Beyond to

examine the postsecondary attendance of male GED holders. They also find that the

postsecondary attendance of credentialed dropouts falls between uncredentialed dropouts

and traditional high school graduates. This paper highlights two other important

characteristics of the postsecondary experience of GED recipients. GED recipients are

much more likely to be enrolled in 2-year community colleges, as opposed to 4 -year

colleges (6 percent had attended a four-year institution and 24 percent had attended a

two-year institution eight years after their expected high school graduation year). They

also accumulate very few credits (an average of 12.3 credits earned within eight years




                                                                                       6
after their expected high school graduation year). Tyler, Murnane, and Willet (2003)

report similar findings for the females in High School and Beyond.

       Murnane, Willett, and Boudett (1997) use data from the National Longitudinal

Survey of Youth to test whether the acquisition of a GED increases the probability that

dropouts will obtain postsecondary education. The authors estimate random effects probit

models using longitudinal data on all high school dropouts, and they find that obtaining

the GED does increase the probability of college attendance and that the postsecondary

gap between uncredentialed and credentialed dropouts grows over time. While it is

interesting to compare credentialed and uncredentialed dropouts, this study is most

informative about certificate or other non-degree-granting programs since, as reported

earlier in this paper, over 90 percent of all postsecondary education institutions require a

credential for matriculation.

       The most recent work on the topic is an update of the postsecondary outcomes in

the NELS 88 data. At the time of their paper, Berktold at al (1998) could look at

postsecondary education outcomes approximately two years after the expected 1992 high

school graduation date of the 1988 8th grade cohort in the study. Using the year 2000

follow up survey, Adelman (2006) is able to look an additional six years beyond the 1994

data available to Berktold at al. In his report Adelman finds that eight years after their

expected high school graduation date, approximately 85 percent of the regular high

school graduates had enrolled at some time in some postsecondary institution, and that

about 35 percent had obtained at least a bachelor’s degree by that time. Meanwhile, 52

percent of the GED holders in the sample showed postsecondary education enrollment by

2000, with only one percent of the GED holders holding a bachelor’s degree by that time.




                                                                                         7
Table 1 gives the complete distribution of education status for high school graduates and

GED holders based on the Adelman work. That table shows that six percent of the regular

high school graduates had achieved an associate’s degree as the highest earned degree,

compared to two percent for GED holders. Meanwhile, a slightly higher percentage of

GED holders had a certificate as their highest level of postsecondary education relative to

the percentage of high school graduates with a certificate as the highest level of

postsecondary education (4.9 percent for GED holders versus about 4 percent for high

school graduates).

                                       <Table 1 about here>

       While informative, the raw comparisons in Table 1 raise as many questions as

they answer since we know that GED holders and regular high school graduates differ on

many dimensions before students make decisions to leave school or engage in

postsecondary education. In this paper, we will first show that these same differences are

present among the 8th graders in the Texas Schools Microdata Panel (TSMP) that we will

use in our analysis. We will then demonstrate that students designated as being

academically “at risk” are very similar in the 8th grade on many dimensions, regardless of

whether they will later drop out and obtain a GED, or whether they will eventually

graduate from high school. This similarity at 8th grade “baseline” makes the at-risk group

a particular advantageous group to study from a research design standpoint. From a

policy standpoint, students found to be academically “at risk” in the 8th grade are also a

particular interesting and relevant group for studying how individuals on the academic

margin use GED attainment and high school graduation as separate paths into

postsecondary education.




                                                                                       8
A Sequential Decision Model

        We model the route from the pre-high school years to PSE as a sequential three

step process that begins with a pool of students who are all in the 8th grade at time t = 0.

In what follows:

    •   time period t = 1 is some time period after the 8th grade but before high school

        graduation or GED attainment when the dropout decision is being made,

    •   period t = 2 is a post-8th grade period where individuals who decided to drop out

        in period 1 are making decisions about whether or not to pursue a GED

        credential, and

    •   period t = 3 is a post high school graduation and post GED-attainment period in

        which high school graduates and GED holders are making post-secondary

        enrollment decisions.

At t = 1 following the 8th grade, student i in high school and community j is making the

decision of whether to dropout (Dropout = 1) or stay in school (Dropout = 0) based on

the following equation:

        Dropoutij = X ijt π ′ + wi + zit + τ i1 + ν ij                Equation 1| t = 1

In this equation:

   •    X is a vector of observable characteristics of the individual, school, and

        community,

   •    w is an unobserved, time-invariant individual fixed effect,

   •    z is a unobservable, time-varying personal characteristic of the individual,

   •    τ1 is a one-time, exogenous drop-out-influencing shock that occurs at t = 1, and



                                                                                          9
    •   υ is a well behaved error term.

        Given the exogenous nature of τ, we have τ ⊥ w and τ ⊥ z, and we assume that w

and z are orthogonal. In this formulation, examples of w associated with dropping out

would be permanent low tastes or high psychic costs associated with academic activities,

low motivation, persistent time preferences that overvalue the present relative to the

future, permanent misunderstanding about the individual returns to schooling, etc.

Examples ofτ, the one-time shock that might influence the drop out decision would be an

unexpected pregnancy, the sudden unemployment of a parent, parental divorce, or death

in the family. Examples of z that might influence a Dropout = 1 decision would be an

evolving dislike of and disengagement from academic endeavors such as school, a

growing preference for work relative to academic endeavors as a student becomes old

enough for full-time work, or an evolving network of friends who implicitly or explicitly

discourage academic endeavors.

        Among the individuals who decide to drop out rather than stay in school, a second

decision regarding whether or not to obtain a GED (GED = 1) or not (GED = 0) is made

at time t = 2:

        GEDij | (Dropout = 1) = X ijt π~ + γ~wi + θ zit + λ τ i1 + ξ ij
                                                  ~       ~
                                                                          Equation 2| t = 2

In Equation 2 the unobserved w, z, andτ terms have coefficients that allow for

relationships between these factors and GED that are different in size and sign than might

be the case in Equation 1.

        In Equation 2 we also allow for the influence of the exogenous “drop out” shock

τ1 that occurred at time t = 1. As an example, if τ1 at the earlier t = 1 period was an

unexpected pregnancy, then at t = 2 individual i might still be pregnant or might have a


                                                                                          10
young child. If the decision to obtain a GED at t = 2 is an investment decision that

requires the expenditure of time, effort, monetary resources, or opportunity costs, then

any persistent effects of a negative shock may negatively influence the decision to invest

in obtaining a GED.

       At time t = 3, the focus shifts to the subset of individuals from the original 8th

grade population who have either a GED or a high school diploma. In this time period the

sub-sample of GED holders and high school graduates (i.e., the sample conditional upon

[(Dropout = 1 & GED = 1) | Dropout = 0]) decide whether or not to enroll in

postsecondary education based on:

        PSEij = βGEDij + X ijt π + γwi + θzit + λτ i1 + ε ij          Equation 3| t = 3

Again, potential persistence of the t = 1 drop out shock is allowed to influence

postsecondary education decisions in this third period, and the unobserved w, z, and τ are

allowed to have different relationships to the postsecondary education decision than were

their relationships to the drop out and GED decisions in Equations 1 and 2.

       The parameter of ultimate interest is β in Equation 3, and we would like to

interpret estimates of β as estimates of the causal effect on PSE enrollment of going

through the GED path as opposed to the high school graduation path. As discussed in the

introduction, our prior is that β is either zero or negative. We begin our discussion of the

threats to this interpretation by pointing out that given the unobserved nature of w, z, and

τ1 the typical equation estimated in the existing GED-PSE literature is given by Equation

3′ below (where, as in Equation 3, the estimation is over a sample of GED holders and

high school graduates):

        PSEij = β GEDij + X ijπ + ε ij                                Equation 3′| t = 3



                                                                                        11
Given Equation 3 and our earlier assumptions regarding the orthogonality of w, τ, and z,

Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimates of β based on Equation 3′ will yield:


          [          ]     σ ,w
        E βˆOLS | X = β + γ GED
                             2

                                + θ GED
                                σ GED2
                                           σ ,τ 1
                                        + λ GED
                                            σ GED
                                             2
                                                           σ GED

        That is, failure to account for the role of time invariant w, time-varying z, and the

persistent effects of τ1 will potentially bias estimates of the GED path to PSE relative to

the high school graduation path. In what follows we explore the direction of the overall

bias from these three bias terms. In this discussion it will be important to keep in mind

the four different time periods, t = 0, 1, 2, and 3, and the fact that in the different time

periods we are dealing with different samples of individuals who are making different

decisions, and hence the relevant covariances are being considered over different pools of

individuals. For simplicity we will call the time periods t0, t1, t2, and t3. The samples and

relevant decisions across these time periods are:

              •   t0: all students are in the 8th grade,

              •   t1: in this post-8th grade period all students are deciding whether to drop

                  out or stay in school,

              •   t2: in this period all students who dropped out in t1 are deciding whether

                  to obtain a GED or remain an uncredentialed dropout, and

              •   t3: the students who did not drop out in t1 and the dropouts who obtained

                  a GED in t2 are deciding whether to enroll in PSE.

        Assume, without loss of generality, that w is negatively correlated with

educational investments. Given the time-invariant nature of w, this means that γ < 0 in

Equation 3 when individuals are deciding whether to invest in PSE. Furthermore, since

eventual GED holders had to first make the dropout decision at t1, it follows that among

the pool of GED holders and high school graduates at t3, σGED,w ≥ 0. Thus, the bias

attributable to w is either negative or zero.4



Bias attributable to the time-varying individual heterogeneity zit:

        Assume that z is a time-varying trait that is negatively correlated with educational

investments, and notice that this means that θ < 0 in Equation 3. At t1, eventual GED

holders made the decision to dropout when eventual high school graduates did not,

suggesting that σGED,z ≥ 0 at t1. At t2, within the pool of dropouts, some make the
                                            ~
decision to invest in a GED suggesting that θ ≤ 0 in Equation 2. At t3, GED holders and

high school graduates are making the PSE enrollment decision, and the sign on σGED,z at

this time is not obvious. It could be that the elements of z correlated with the dropout

decision at t1 are still present during the time to make PSE enrollment decisions and thus

σGED,z ≥ 0 at t3.

        On the other hand, the GED holders at t3 are those dropouts who decided to invest

in the GED at t2. Thus, it could be that, all else equal, GED holders at t3 have less of the

trait z that is negatively related to PSE-investment than do high school graduates yielding

σGED,z ≤ 0 at t3. While it is plausible that σGED,z = 0 at t3, we find it unlikely that GED


4
 Notice that if we had assumed that w was positively correlated with education investments the signs of the
two factors in the w bias term would be switched and the bias attributable to this term would still be
negative or zero.


                                                                                                   13
holders have less z that do high school graduates (i.e., σGED,z < 0). Therefore, given the

expected negative sign on θ in Equation 3, we find the most likely bias attributable to z

to be either negative or zero.



Bias attributable to persistent effects from the negative drop out shock τ1:

       If students left school in t1 because of a negative shock, it could be that the effects

of that shock are still present and affecting PSE decisions in t3. If these shocks are

persistent then σGED,τ1 ≥ 0 and λ < 0 in Equation 3, and the bias attributable to τ1 is either

zero or negative.

       In summary, it is likely that the overall OLS bias is negative. Given our

hypothesis that true β is either negative or zero, this means that negative estimates of the

“GED effect” on PSE should be interpreted as lower bounds on a negative effect.

Therefore, the estimates that we, and previous research, present may well overstate any

negative effects of taking the “GED route” to PSE, and without eliminating the OLS bias,

one could not rule out an inference that there is no negative “GED effect” on PSE.

       Lacking any suitable instrumental variables that might allow us to address the

potential bias, one way to reduce the bias is to define a sub-sample of GED holders and

high school graduates who tend to be more homogeneous than is the case in the general

population of GED holders and high school graduates. Seizing on this opportunity, we

will use a subsample of students who are academically “at risk” just prior to high school

entry in the 8th grade. For narrative simplicity, we will call this subsample of 8th grade at-

risk students the AR8 sample, and we will show that in the 8th grade, eventual GED




                                                                                         14
holders and eventual high school graduates in this sample were very much alike on key

dimensions, including test scores.

        Aside from their similarity to eventual high school graduates, a particular

advantage of using the AR8 sample for our purposes has to do with the potential

heterogeneity within the GED population, and the implications of this heterogeneity for

some key assumptions in our model. In particular, Heckman and Rubinstein (2001) find

that the average student who drops out and obtains a GED is close to the average high

school graduate in terms of academic ability, but that the average GED holder has

substantially worse non-cognitive traits than the individuals who complete high school. In

the terms of Heckman and Rubinstein, these GED holders are the “wise guys” in class

who could make it academically, but who are unable to function in a school environment

because of their poor non-cognitive skills. A concern for us is that these academically

able “wise guys” who end up with a GED do not view the decisions we have modeled at

times t2 and t3 as education investment decisions. In terms of the model, our concern is

that σ GED  , w < σ GED , w < 0 and σ GED , z
       wise guy     AR 8              wise guy
                                               < σ GED
                                                   AR*
                                                       , z < 0 at t3, and that any negative OLS bias



is worse with these academically strong but non-cognitively weak individuals than

without them. Thus, by using the AR8 group we potentially reduce the negative bias in

the OLS estimator and we have a group of individuals for whom our modeling

assumptions regarding education investment decisions are more likely to hold.



Data and Samples

        Our study uses TSMP data to examine the postsecondary outcomes of students

who, by age, were in the cohort that should have been in the 8th grade in the spring of



                                                                                              15
1994, and thus scheduled to graduate in the spring of 1998. In particular, we will examine

the AR8 subset of this cohort. The “at risk” indicator in our data used to construct the

AR8 sample is a variable in the TSMP data based on a designation generated by the

Texas Education Agency (TEA). When our sample was in the 8th grade, Texas school

districts were required to report a student as academically “at risk” of dropping out or

failing if any of the following criteria were met.5 The student…

            1. was not advanced from one grade level to the next for two or more school

                years;

            2. is at least two years below grade level in reading or mathematics;

            3. has failed at least two courses and is not expected to graduate within four

                years of entering ninth grade;

            4. has failed at least one section of the most recent state assessment exam; or

            5. is pregnant or is a parent.

        Relative to other potential data, the TSMP data present several advantages in a

study of the GED-PSE relationship. First, all of the K-12 information in the TSMP is

from administrative records collected by schools and school districts rather than from self

reports of students, teachers, or parents. Likewise, the postsecondary education

information we will use for our dependent variables is from state higher education

administrative records. Second, the TSMP data contain information from the state

assessment program, the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills (TAAS), a high stakes

test for public school students in Texas. Third, schools in the TSMP can be linked to the

U.S. Department of Education’s Common Core of Data data files. We use this feature of

source for this definition is Texas Education Code §29.081.


                                                                                            16
the TSMP to control for school-level variables of both the school of attendance in the 8th

grade and the last school of attendance before a student drops out or graduates from high

school. Fourth, the “at risk” designation in the TSMP for our 8th grade students is based

upon an objective, state-level definition that utilizes information from a student’s entire

prior educational experience. Finally, the sample size available is substantially larger than

is available in, for example, NELS 88. In that data set there are approximately 11,000

high school graduates and 800 GED holders available for study. In the 1994 8th grade

cohort of the TSMP data that we use there are over 142,000 high school graduates and

6,000 GED holders. The analytic data set constructed for this paper uses all of the GED

holders in the TSMP data and a random twenty percent (one in five) of the high school

graduates. All standard errors are adjusted accordingly.

        We focus our study on the 1994 8th grade cohort of the TSMP because this group

best capitalizes on two features of the TSMP data that are important to this study: good

8th grade data and data on postsecondary education outcomes after these students have

graduated from high school or obtained a GED. While the TSMP has data on Texas

schoolchildren from 1990 to the present, the state TAAS examinations were first given to

8th graders in Texas in 1994, hence our focus on the group that was age appropriate for

the 8th grade in 1994. The postsecondary education files in the TSMP data contain

information on all enrollments and number of “enrolled credits” at public postsecondary

education institutions in Texas through 2002 and information on awarded postsecondary

degrees and certificates at these institutions through 2003.6 Our method in using these

data will be to allow a three-year window for examining enrollments and credits, and a

 By “enrolled credits,” we mean that we have information on the number of credits in which a student was
enrolled in a given year, but we do not have information on the number of those credits that were
completed and received a passing grade.


                                                                                                 17
four-year window for examining earned degrees and certificates. The window for each

student in the sample will begin after either high school graduation or after GED

acquisition. Thus, one sample selection criterion is that a member of the 1998 graduation

cohort had to have graduated from high school or obtained their GED no later than 1999

to be included in our analysis. Within the AR8 sample in the TSMP, 69 percent graduated

from high school, 7 percent had dropped out and obtained a GED by 1999, and 20.5

percent had dropped out and had no GED as of 1999. An additional 2.5 percent got their

high school diploma between 1999 and 2001, and additional 0.9 percent obtained a GED

in this post-1999 period. The comparable figures for members of the 1994 8th grade

cohort who were not labeled as “at risk” are 86 percent high school graduates, 6 percent

GED holders, and 7 percent uncredentialed dropouts as of 1999, with 0.9 and 0.6 percent

receiving a high school diploma or GED post-1999, respectively.

        Appendix Table A1 shows the results of this and other sample selection decisions

we made in forming our AR8 analytic sample. As this table shows, there were 12,358

eligible eventual GED holders, of whom 6,520 were in the at-risk category in the 8th

grade, and 28,538 eventual high school graduates, of whom 11,937 were designated as at-

risk 8th graders.

        As row seven in Table A1 shows, the decision to use only those who graduated or

received their GED by 1999 affects the GED sample more than the high school graduate

sample, as the GED sample drops by 10 percent and the high school graduate sample

drops by only three percent on this decision. To examine the potential impact of this

sample selection decision, we used the middle years of the available TSMP data

(expected graduation cohorts of 1994, 1995, and 1996) to study the distribution of GED




                                                                                     18
acquisition dates relative to expected graduation date. We use these middle cohorts since

they have the most opportunity in the TSMP data for either early or late GED acquisition

dates relative to their expected high school graduation year. Depending on the cohort, we

find that between two-thirds and three-quarters of the GED holders in the 1994, 1995,

and 1996 expected-graduation cohorts obtained a GED before, on, or within one year

after their expected high school graduation date. We then use these data to examine the

TAAS scores of individuals who obtained their GED more than one year after their

expected graduation date. This examination shows that these “late GED” individuals had

8th grade TAAS math scores that were a third of a standard deviation lower than the GED

holders who acquired this credential before, on, or one year after their expected

graduation year. Thus, by not using these “late GED” individuals our sample will tend to

be composed of the most academically able GED holders in the AR8 sample, conditional

on being at-risk in the 8th grade. Since these individuals are more likely to engage in

postsecondary education, we expect that our estimates will be upwardly biased relative to

what we would find if we were able to include the “late GED” individuals in our study.

           Before turning to our AR8 sample, we use Appendix Table A2 to illustrate the

comparability of the TSMP to data that has been used in prior work. We first point out

that individuals who will drop out and obtain a GED have 8th grade math scores that are

about a third of a standard deviation lower than those of 8th graders who will go on to

become high school graduates, and 8th grade reading scores that are a quarter of a

standard deviation lower. A higher percentage of the eventual GED holders are male,

white, and “economically disadvantaged,”7 and they tended to go to school in urban areas

more than was the case for eventual high school graduates. The GED holders were more

                                                                                                      19
likely to have started first grade late or to have been held back prior to the 8th grade, and a

higher percentage of them were in the “at risk” category in the 8th grade.8 On the other

hand, the eventual GED holders and eventual high school graduates tended to go to 8th

grade schools that had similar characteristics.

         Not surprisingly, some of the biggest differences in the two groups appear in their

postsecondary education outcomes. Within the three-year window that we allow for

postsecondary education, high school graduates were much more likely to have ever

enrolled in a public Texas postsecondary education institution (58.5 percent versus 22.4

percent for GED holders), more likely to have earned a postsecondary certificate or

associate’s degree, and they had enrolled for more credits in the three years after

graduation than the GED holders.9 We note that the patterns of postsecondary education

attainment in Table A2 are similar to those using NELS data in Table 1. The higher

attainment figures in Table 1 for all groups reflect the fact that those data allow for a six-

year window for the high school graduates and longer for GED holders who obtained

their GED prior to 1994.

         In summary, the patterns in the TSMP data are similar to those consistently found

in the literature across time and across different data sets. Namely, GED holders have

worse postsecondary education outcomes than regular high school graduates, but GED

holders are also systematically different from high school graduates on observable factors

8
  Our examination of 8th graders in the NELS data set yields some similarities and differences to what is
seen in the TSMP data. Importantly, 8th grade test score differences between eventual GED holders and
high school graduates are very similar across the different data sets. Not surprisingly, in the Texas data a
higher percentage of both GED holders and high school graduates are Hispanic than is the case in the
NELS data. The NELS data are more balanced on gender across the two education groups than in the
TSMP, and there is a greater discrepancy in the percent who are at-risk in the 8th grade in NELS, 66 percent
of the eventual GED holders versus 37 percent of the eventual high school graduates.
9
  Because of the low enrollment rates of GED holders in four-year colleges versus two-year colleges
referenced earlier in this paper, we will focus our study on enrollment and credits in either a two-year or a
four-year college.


                                                                                                     20
that tend to correlate with postsecondary education attainment. In particular, like other

researchers, we find substantial differences in the underlying academic achievement of

eventual GED holders and eventual high school graduates.10

         Given the importance of early academic achievement on later postsecondary

education attainment, we want to examine more closely the 8th grade TAAS test scores in

the TSMP data. To do this we first account for the fact that delayed first grade entry or

being held back a grade at some point means that not all students take the 8th grade TAAS

exams in the same year and hence at the same age. In the 1994 8th grade cohort about 73

percent of the eventual GED holders took the 8th grade TAAS tests in 1994, 25 percent

took these exams in 1995, and 2 percent took the exams in 1996. Meanwhile, 83 percent

of the eventual high school graduates took the exams in 1994, 16 percent in 1995, and

one percent 1996. To account for any age effects on the TAAS scores we use the

residuals from a regression of the TAAS scores on year-of-test dummies and then

standardize the residuals to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.11

Relative to non-age-corrected mean test scores reported in Appendix Table A2, the

differences between GED holders and high school graduates are slightly smaller when

using these age-corrected scores. Nevertheless, the age-corrected math scores of eventual

high school graduates are still about one-fifth of a standard deviation higher than are

those of eventual GED holders, and the high school graduate reading scores are about

one-eighth of a standard deviation higher.



10
   An exception to this pattern is that Heckman and Rubinstein (2001) find that in then NLSY79 the age-
adjusted AFQT scores of GED holders and high school graduates are similar.
11
   Of course, in correcting for the age at which an individual took the 8th grade TAAS tests, we are also
correcting for anything else that is related to why an individual may have taken the TAAS scores in a later
year than expected given their age.


                                                                                                     21
       Of course, mean comparisons only present a partial picture of the comparability

of groups on a measure such as test scores. Figures 1 and 2 provide more information on

these age-corrected and standardized 8th grade test scores, as these figures present the

entire distributions of the math (Figure 1) and reading (Figure 2) scores for GED holders

and high school graduates. Figures 1 and 2 also present the test score distributions of two

other groups not yet discussed: 8th graders who eventually dropped out of high school and

never attempted the GED through 2003, and 8th graders who dropped out and attempted,

but failed the GED exams sometime before 2003. These test-score distributions make it

clear that in the 8th grade there are already underlying academic differences between

students who will later sort themselves or be sorted into different educational credential

groups. Figures 1 and 2 also make it clear that comparing the later outcomes of GED

holders and regular high school graduates may be a tenuous proposition because these

groups are already substantially different academically in the 8th grade.

                                   <Figures 1 and 2 about here>

       We turn next to the AR8 sample that we will use in the empirical work. As

discussed early, to the extent that this group is more homogeneous in w and z, estimates

based on the AR8 sample should reduce any negative bias in the OLS estimator of

Equation 3′. We also note that “at risk” students are an especially policy relevant group

when it comes to questions of how dropouts use the GED to access postsecondary

education. Not only are at-risk students often a focus of policy interest, but these are

students for whom it is more likely that a negative life or school event will prove be the

proverbial “straw that broke the camel’s back,” leading to a decision to drop out of

school. In terms of our model, it may be that within the AR8 sample it is more likely that




                                                                                       22
                σ GED ,τ 1 > σ GED ,w    and     σ GED ,τ 1 > σ GED , z ,

and thus more likely that the primary source of any bias in the OLS estimator comes from

the persistent negative effects of the random t1 shock rather than from unobserved

heterogeneity. Of course, we cannot bring direct evidence on the extent to which GED

holders and high school graduates are more similar in w and z in the AR8 sample than in

the general population. We can show, however, that on observable dimensions including

test scores, GED holders and high school graduates in the AR8 sample were very similar

in the 8th grade.

        Figures 3 and 4 give the same test score distributions as Figures 1 and 2 except

that only at-risk 8th graders are used to generate the distributions. While the dropouts who

never attempt or attempt and fail the GED still look very different from the eventual GED

and high school graduate groups, these latter two groups now have virtually identical 8th

grade test score distributions in both math and reading. There are statistically significant,

though substantively small, differences in the means of the GED and high school

graduate distributions, but interestingly, they favor the eventual GED holders. Among

these at-risk students, eventual GED holders have mean 8th grade math scores that are

0.03 of a standard deviation higher than eventual high school graduates (p-value = 0.03)

and reading scores that are 0.08 of a standard deviation higher (p-value < 0.00).

                                        <Figures 3 and 4 about here>

        Of course, at-risk students are a relatively more homogenous subset of all 8th

grade students and so it is not overly surprising that test score distributions of eventual

GED holders and eventual high school graduates in the AR8 sample would be more

similar than in the pool of all 8th graders. Figures 5 and 6 illustrate that stratification



                                                                                          23
along at-risk status is not in and of itself the driving force behind the similar GED-high

school graduate test score distributions. These figures display GED and high school

graduate test score distributions by at-risk status and illustrate that among future GED

holders and high school graduates, the distributions in the AR8 sample are much more

similar than those based on a sub-sample of “not-at-risk” students.12

                                         <Figures 5 and 6 about here>



Descriptive Statistics

         Descriptive statistics of the AR8 sample are in Table 2. While most GED-high

school graduate differences are statistically significant because of our large sample size,

there are few mean differences between these groups that are large enough to be of

substantive importance. The most substantial differences are that the eventual GED

holders are more likely to be male, white, and to have been “late” arriving at the 8th grade

relative to their cohort. Meanwhile, they are less likely to be black, in special education in

the 8th grade, and enrolled in an English Second Language (ESL) program than are the

eventual high school graduates. There are some statistically significant differences in the

schools attended by the two at-risk groups when they were 8th graders, but again, these

differences are all substantively small. Nevertheless, one would want to control for the

observable differences in the two groups when making comparisons of postsecondary

education outcomes.

12
  Turning to NELS data again, we see very similar patterns. Within the at-risk pool in NELS, eventual
GED holders have math scores that are only 0.05 of a standard deviation lower than high school graduates
and this difference is not statistically significant (p-value = 0.40). Meanwhile, in the not-at-risk pool in
NELS, the math score difference between the two groups is 0.42 of a standard deviation in favor of the high
school graduates and significant at the 0.001 level. These general patterns are the same for reading scores in
NELS. Reproducing the graphs in Figures 5 and 6 based on NELS data shows the same convergence of the
GED and high school graduate test score distributions in the at-risk pool, though the convergence is not as
complete as in the TSMP data.


                                                                                                      24
                                                 <Table 2>

       We now turn to these comparisons. Table 3 gives the means of the postsecondary

education outcomes that we will examine. This table not only provides postsecondary

education information for the AR8 sample, but for the sake of comparison, it also

presents information for the eventual GED holders and high school graduates who were

not categorized as “at risk” in the 8th grade.

       Panel A in Table 3 provides statistics based on everyone in each group. The

postsecondary education statistics in Panel B are all conditional on having been enrolled

in postsecondary education at some point. The first column of Table 3 gives us a first

look at how eventual GED holders in the AR8 sample use the GED credential to access

postsecondary education. Three years after obtaining a GED, only 18 percent had ever

enrolled in a public postsecondary institution in Texas, and less than one percent had

earned either a postsecondary education certificate or an associate’s degree. Furthermore,

these at-risk GED holders had enrolled for only 5.5 total credits on average during the

first three years after obtaining a GED. The companion statistics in Panel B are a bit more

encouraging. Individuals who had ever enrolled in postsecondary education enrolled in an

average of about 30 credits within the first three years of receipt of the GED. That is, the

average enrollee had enrolled for about a year’s worth of credits in the three years

following receipt of the GED. These enrolled credits rarely translated into either a

certificate or an associate’s degree, however, as only 1.8 and 1.2 percent of the students

who had been enrolled had earned a certificate or associates degree, respectively, within

the first four post-GED years.

                                        <Table 3 about here>




                                                                                       25
       The figures in the first column of Table 3 can be put in some context by

comparing them to the outcomes of eventual high school graduates in the AR8 sample.

Almost half of these students (46 percent) had enrolled in some form of postsecondary

education three years after graduation, and the mean number of enrolled credits was

about 22, four times as many as for the AR8 GED holders. Meanwhile, about four

percent of these high school graduates had earned either a certificate or an associate’s

degree. Conditional on having ever been enrolled, high school graduates had more

enrolled credits, were more likely to earn a certificate, and were much more likely to

have earned an associate’s degree.

       Not surprisingly, within education credential group all of the outcomes for the

not-at-risk students in the last two columns are better than those for the AR8 students in

the first two columns. It is striking, however, that the at-risk high school graduates,

represented in the second column, have substantially better postsecondary education

outcomes than do GED holders who were not at-risk 8th graders (third column). In

particular, the high school graduates are much more likely to have ever been enrolled (46

percent to 27 percent). Even among those who had positive enrollment figures, the at-risk

graduates have substantially better postsecondary education outcomes than GED holders

who were not “at risk” in the 8th grade.



Conditional Estimates of Postsecondary Education Outcomes

       We have shown that in the 8th grade, at-risk students have very similar test score

distributions regardless of whether they will later drop out and get a GED or graduate

with a high school diploma. Thus, if 8th grade academic achievement explains most of the




                                                                                          26
variation in later postsecondary education outcomes, the unconditional estimates of the

at-risk groups in Panel A of Table 3 should be good estimates of the mean postsecondary

education outcomes of the two at-risk groups. On the other hand, Table 2 indicates some

small differences between eventual GED holders and high school graduates, and one

would want to account for these factors when contrasting the postsecondary education

outcomes of these two groups. To this end, we will estimate conditional mean differences

based on models that control for:

           •   gender and race/ethnicity,

           •   8th grade variables at the individual level that include age at 8th grade,

               whether or not economically disadvantaged, and whether or not in special

               education, an ESL program, or a gifted and talented program,

           •   8th grade school-level variables from the Common Core of Data that

               include total number of students in the school, urbanicity of school

               location, average pupil teacher ratio in the school, separate variables for

               the percentage of white, black, Hispanic, and students on free or reduced

               lunch in the school,

           •   Common Core of Data information from the last school that the student

               attended before graduating or dropping out that is parallel to the variables

               we use for the 8th grade school of attendance, and

           •   district fixed effects.

       Table 4 shows our estimates from a series of nested models using the groups of

control variables detailed above. Each column gives three different estimates of the

“GED effect” on PSE outcomes, where each of the three regressions in each column has



                                                                                        27
the same set of control variables but a different dependent variable. For example, the

estimates in the first row are from regressions where the dependent variable is an

indicator of whether an individual ever enrolled in a two- or four-year public

postsecondary institution in Texas within the first three years of receiving a GED or high

school diploma. The second dependent variable (second row) is the total number of

credits in which the individual had enrolled in the first three post-credential years.

Because of the low percentage of at-risk students who garner either a postsecondary

certificate or an associate’s degree, we create the third dependent variable (third row) by

combining these two outcomes into a single dependent variable: whether or not an

individual received either a certificate or an associate’s degree within the first four post-

credential years.

                                              <Table 4 about here>

         All estimates are from models fit with Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) with robust

standard errors clustered at the district level reported.13 Model 1 in Table 4 controls only

for 8th grade school district fixed effects. The similarity of the estimated high school

graduate-GED differences in postsecondary education outcomes from Model 1 relative to

the unconditional estimates in Table 3 suggest that it is not going to be very important to

control for 8th grade district fixed effects. In addition, the estimates in the three

regressions change very little when controls for gender and ethnicity are added in Model

2.

         When individual level 8th grade variables are added, the “GED disadvantage” in

ever being enrolled drops by about 15 percent, and the disadvantage in terms of


13
  We obtain essentially identical results when using probit instead of OLS linear probability models to fit
the data when the two dichotomous variables are dependent variables in the model.


                                                                                                     28
accumulated credits drops by about five percent. In analysis not shown here, examination

of these individual-level 8th grade controls shows that by far the most important variable

in explaining the GED-high school graduate differences is the age at which an individual

enters the 8th grade. Entering the 8th grade late, either from being held back prior to the 8th

grade or because first grade was entered late, is negatively correlated with postsecondary

enrollment, and a higher percentage of GED holders tend to enter the 8th grade late (28

percent of the at-risk GED holders compared to 22 percent of the eventual high school

graduates who were at-risk in the 8th grade).

         There are few changes in the estimates as we add 8th grade school-of-attendance

and last-school-of-attendance controls in Models 4 and 5. In Model 6 we add a control for

whether or not a student was held back at some point between grades 9 through 12. There

are 334 students for whom we lack the data required to construct this variable; hence, the

reduction in sample size between Models 1-5 and Model 6.14 When this indicator of

being held back in high school is included in Model 6, the point estimates of the

postsecondary education “GED disadvantage” all fall to between two-thirds to three-

quarters of the Model 5 estimates. This result is being driven by the fact that students

who are retained in high school are much less likely to participate in later postsecondary

education, and GED holders are held back at higher rates in high school than are eventual

high school graduates.15 Our examination of the data show that 53 percent of the at-risk

GED holders were held back at some point in high school before they dropped out, while

only 14 percent of the at-risk high school graduates were held back at some point in

14
   We note that the estimates based on the Models 1-5 specifications are essentially unchanged if fit on the
same sample as used in Model 6.
15
   For example, the coefficient estimate on the “held back in high school” dummy variable in Model 6 is -
0.20 and highly statistically significant when the dependent variable is “ever enrolled in postsecondary
education.”


                                                                                                      29
grades 9-12. Given the impact on the estimates of including this indicator of high school

retention, a closer look at this phenomenon is warranted.

        Table 5 provides the distribution of retained grades for those ever retained in a

grade while in high school. We note two facts in Table 5. First, in keeping with the

literature on grade retention, the largest percent of students ever retained repeat the 9th

grade. Second, we have to remember that the lower percentages of GED holders who are

retained in the later grades relative to high school graduates reflects, at least in part, the

fact that fewer numbers of these students make it to these latter grades because they have

already dropped out.

                                        <Table 5 about here>

        Table 6 provides an interesting look at the unconditional relationships between

education credential status (GED or high school graduate), being retained in high school,

and later postsecondary education. First, students who were held back for at least one

grade while in high school had worse postsecondary education outcomes than students

who were never held back, regardless of education credential status. It is worth noting,

however, that the retention-postsecondary education relationships are substantially

different for GED holders than for high school graduates. Relative to those who were

never held back a grade in high school, ever-retained high school graduates were half as

likely to have enrolled in postsecondary education (23.6 percent versus 49.9 percent),

about a fifth as likely to have earned a certificate or associate’s degree (1.4 percent versus

4.9), and they had enrolled in a third as many credits (7.4 mean credits versus 24.3).

Meanwhile, retained GED holders did have worse postsecondary education outcomes




                                                                                          30
than never-retained GED holders, but the differences are not nearly as large as is the case

for the high school graduates.

                                       <Table 6 about here>

       One way to summarize the relationships between education credential status and

high school retention status is to refit Model 6 from Table 4 and include a GED by high

school retention interaction. Table 7 gives the results from such a regression for each of

the three different postsecondary education outcomes we study. Using the estimates in

the first column of Table 7 as an example, there are three comparisons of interest. First,

the coefficient estimate on the “retained in high school” variable indicates that eventual

high school graduates who were held back at some point while in high school have a 23

percentage point lower enrollment rate in postsecondary education than do high school

graduates who were never held back. Meanwhile, the estimated coefficient on the “GED”

indicator suggests that GED holders who were never held back have a 24 percentage

point lower enrollment rate than high school graduates who were never retained. In the

comparison between GED holders who were retained and eventual high school graduates

who were retained, the GED disadvantage is much smaller, an enrollment rate that is 8.5

percentage points lower (-0.243 + 0.158). This general pattern holds across the other two

dependent variables in Table 7. In summary, the lessons of Table 7 are:

           1. Students retained while in high school have worse postsecondary

               education outcomes than students never retained regardless of education

               credential status.




                                                                                      31
           2. GED holders consistently obtain less postsecondary education than do

               high school graduates whether looking within the retained-in-high-school

               category or in the not-retained group.

           3. GED holders and high school graduates who were held back at some point

               in high school tend to look more like each other than do GED holders and

               high school graduates who were never retained.

           4. However, the groups with the most similar outcomes are GED holders

               who were never held back and high school graduates who were retained at

               some point between the 9th and 12th grades.

                                      <Table 7 about here>

       Observation 4 above brings up an interesting point. It could be that the relevant

decision facing students who are about to be held back while in high school is whether to

repeat the grade and persist to graduation or “cut one’s losses” and drop out now and get

a GED. If one thought that most of the GED holders in the not-retained-in-high-school

group actually faced grade retention but opted to drop out instead, then the comparisons

with the high school graduates who were held back at some point between the 9th and 12th

grades is compelling evidence that the dropout-GED decision was not so bad. On the

other hand, it may be that few of the never-retained GED holders ever faced high school

retention and therefore the retained high school graduates are not a particularly good

comparison group. An examination suggests this is the case. In the 8th grade eventual

GED holders who were never retained in high school had math and reading scores that

were both about two-thirds of a standard deviation higher than the scores of eventual high

school graduates who were retained in high school.




                                                                                     32
Special GED Subsamples

       As a final exercise, we look at four subsamples of the at-risk GED group, where

each group is comprised of GED holders for whom the GED-postsecondary education

relationship might be substantively different than for the random GED holder in the at-

risk group. The first group of dropouts for whom the GED might be particularly

important are those students who have made it most of the way through high school, but

who, for whatever reason, drop out in their last years of high school without graduating

and receiving a diploma. These students ostensibly have most of the benefits of the high

school experience that might be important for positive postsecondary education outcomes

since they almost finished high school. Perhaps the GED is a more important “gateway”

to postsecondary education for these “late dropouts” who may have garnered most of the

human and social capital associated with the high school experience than for those who

leave school earlier.

       The second group we consider is composed of GED holders from the at-risk

group who obtained their GED within one year of dropping out of school. It might be that

dropouts who obtain their GED quickly are more prone to use the credential for accessing

postsecondary education than it typically the case. For example, this group might contain

a disproportionate number of students who either left high school because they felt they

were already prepared for postsecondary education or because they felt the quality of

their high school education was very low and would not further prepare them for

postsecondary education. Or, even among students who left high school for reasons

unrelated to any ex ante desire for postsecondary education, obtaining a GED quickly




                                                                                    33
after dropping out may reflect a desire to “stay on track” toward postsecondary education

as might have occurred had the student not dropped out.

       The third group we consider is composed of those at-risk GED holders who

scored in the upper quartile of the GED exams. It may be that the most academically able

GED holders disproportionately use the credential to access postsecondary education. To

explore this possibility, we form this “high scoring” subsample by using individuals who

scored in the upper quartile in terms of their average score over the five tests that make

up the GED exams: reading, writing, science, social studies, and mathematics.

       The final group we consider is composed of GED holders whose last school of

attendance before dropping out was a large urban high school. If these schools are

disproportionately of poor quality, then some dropouts in these schools may

systematically reason that they are better off to leave a low quality high school before

graduation, obtain a GED and then move directly on to postsecondary education rather

than spend more time in high school. The sample used to explore this question is

comprised of those individuals who attended a large high school in a large central city.

We define a “large” school to be one with a student body larger than 2,004 students, the

median student body size for a large central city high school in our data. For this analysis

only we limit not only the GED sample, but we also limit the comparison group to only

those high school graduates who graduated from large high schools in large central cities.

       The estimates based on these four different samples are in Table 8. The first

column of Table 8 is the examination of “late dropouts,” those GED holders who

attended at least the 11th grade before dropping out. Out of the 6,520 total at-risk GED

holders, 2,220 attended at least the 11th grade before they dropped out. However, in spite




                                                                                       34
of the advantage of the extra years of high school relative to earlier dropouts, the “late

dropouts” did not have better postsecondary education outcomes than the full sample of

GED holders that we have seen in earlier estimates.

       The second column of Table 8 presents the estimates for GED holders who

obtained their GED within one year of dropping out. Again, these estimates are little

different from the estimates of Model 5 in Table 4. In fact, looking across the other

columns, we see no real differences in the estimates for these special GED subsamples

relative to the fully specified model (Model 5) that uses the entire GED sample.

       Separate regressions using only white, black, Hispanic, male, and female samples

were also fit using the fully specified model that employs the full set of controls. As with

the results using the special GED subsamples, the estimates based on these racial/ethnic

and gender subgroups were very similar to the estimates in Table 4. Finally, and of no

surprise given Figures 3 and 4, none of our estimates change if we include math and

reading scores as controls in any of the regressions.



Summary and Conclusions

       This study focuses attention on a sample of academically “at risk” students who

were enrolled in the 8th grade in Texas public schools in the mid-1990s. After showing

that the eventual high school graduates and the eventual GED holders in this group were

very similar in the 8th grade, this study contrasts the postsecondary education outcomes of

these two groups as a way of examining the extent to which school dropouts use the GED

program as a route to postsecondary education relative to high school graduates.




                                                                                        35
       Our study confirms some well known facts about academically at-risk students

and the education they attain beyond high school. Namely, students who are on the

academic margins in the year before high school are more prone to dropout, more likely

to be held back a grade in high school, and they tend to have lower levels of

postsecondary education enrollment rates than students with a more solid 8th grade

foundation. We also found, however, that at-risk 8th graders who graduate with a high

school diploma participate in postsecondary education at non-trivial rates. Almost half

(46 percent) of the school graduates in our sample who were labeled as “at risk” in the 8th

grade had enrolled in some postsecondary education within three years of graduating, and

they had enrolled for about two-thirds of a year worth of credits (21 credits). While these

are lower rates than high school graduates not designated as at-risk 8th graders (67

percent enrollment rates and 40 mean credits), they indicate that many academically

marginal students who persist through high school and graduate with a diploma go on to

garner some postsecondary education.

       We present a less bright story for the 8th grade at-risk students who do not finish

high school but drop out and obtain a GED. The unconditional probability of these

students enrolling in postsecondary education within three years of obtaining a GED is 29

percentage points lower than the probability for the at-risk high school graduates. A wide

array of individual and school level controls (both 8th grade school and last school of

attendance), along with school district fixed effects, can only explain about 5 percentage

points of this disadvantage. Since the GED holders enroll at lower rates, they also have

enrolled for fewer credits, about 40 percent less. However, this difference in enrolled

credits is not completely driven by the relatively high percentage of never-enrolled GED




                                                                                       36
holders. Even among those who with positive postsecondary education enrollment rates,

GED holders have enrolled for substantially fewer credits than the at-risk high school

graduates.

         While the relatively worse PSE outcomes of the GED holders are consistent with

what one would find in the literature on the GED-PSE relationship, this study makes two

important contributions to this literature. First, prior to this paper, the question at hand

has been “answered” via simple mean comparisons or by OLS regression estimates that

have lacked any underlying model that would help us understand and interpret the results.

By explicating the sequential decision process from dropping out, to obtaining a GED, to

making PSE decisions, the model developed in this paper brings structure to this problem

and illuminates the potential biases that could cause us to potentially overstate the

negative PSE effects of taking a “GED path” to PSE.

         Second, while we do not argue that our estimates are free of bias, we do believe

that estimates based on the AR8 sample contain less negative bias than results typically

found in the literature. At least on cognitive skill measures that are closely linked to later

PSE outcomes, our AR8 sample is very well matched in the year prior to high school

entry.

         Given the similarities of these two groups when they were in the 8th grade, how

can we explain the results in this paper? We examine in turn four different possible

explanations.



The Post-GED Horizon in the TSMP Data is Too Short




                                                                                         37
       As explained earlier, the TSMP data do not provide any postsecondary education

information beyond a three year post-GED or post-high-school-diploma window. It could

be that given more time, we might see GED holders substantially close the postsecondary

educational attainment gap. We can use NELS 88 data to examine this proposition. We

first note that if we limit postsecondary education enrollment in a public institution in the

NELS 88 data to the same three-year window used in this paper, we get very similar

results. In a regression using NELS 88 students who were at-risk in the 8th grade and

controlling for gender, race/ethnicity, family structure, parental education level, primary

home language, and socioeconomic status (all measured in the 8th grade year), we find

that GED holders in the NELS 88 data had a 23.2 percentage point lower probability (p-

value < 0.0001) of having ever enrolled in a public postsecondary education institution

within three-years than did high school graduates. Recall that estimates using TSMP data

point to a 23.9 percentage point GED disadvantage (Model 5 of Table 4). Thus, results

using a three-year window are virtually identical using either NELS 88 or TSMP data

though the specifications are slightly different across the two data sets owing to the

available control variables in each.

       In an identical specification using NELS 88 data that allows for a six-year

window, GED holders do close the postsecondary education gap somewhat. If GED

holders and high school graduates are allowed six years after graduation or credentialing

to garner postsecondary education, the GED disadvantage drops to an 18 percentage

point lower probability of having ever enrolled in a public postsecondary education




                                                                                         38
institution.16 Thus, a longer horizon for observing postsecondary outcomes could explain

away some, but not very much, of the GED disadvantage that we observe in the first three

post-credential years using TSMP data.17



Selection on Unobserved Heterogeneity

         It could be the case that even though our two groups are very similar on

observables at “baseline” in the 8th grade, they are either already dissimilar on

unobservable dimensions related to postsecondary education outcomes or heterogeneity

related to these outcomes emerges over time. In the terms of our model, estimates of the

causal effect of taking the “GED path” to PSE suffer from negative bias due to either

                  σGED,w > 0 or σGED,z > 0

or both.

         While this gives us the econometric solution, there are also implications for policy

and practice since this scenario suggests that within the at-risk pool of 8th graders,

individuals with low unobserved potential for going on to college systematically select

into the “GED path” that includes as a first step, dropping out of school. What are the

policy implications of this explanation for our negative GED results?




16
   The raw enrollment percentages in NELS after six years are 0.60 for high school graduates and 0.41 for
GED holders. This compares to 0.56 for high school graduates and 0.31 for GED holders after three years
in the NELS data.
17
   Note that neither can we explain the GED disadvantage by the fact that the TSMP data limits us to public
postsecondary education attainment. If we fit the three-year and six-year NELS regressions using
enrollment in any postsecondary institution, public or private, the GED-high school gap widens in both
cases (-0.28 in the three-year regression and -0.22 in the six year regression). This is because while at-risk
GED holders do tend to go to either private, for-profit institutions or private less-than-4-year colleges at
slightly higher rates than do at-risk high school graduates (10.9 percent versus 7.9 percent), at-risk high
school graduates tend to go to private four-year colleges at much higher rates than do at-risk GED holders
(9.2 percent versus 1.6 percent).


                                                                                                      39
       To the extent that low college-going potential is largely driven by behavioral-

based barriers such as attitudes toward or beliefs about postsecondary education, policies

aimed at increasing the postsecondary education attainment of GED holders would have

to focus on changing behavior and beliefs rather than improving skills or removing

institutional barriers to postsecondary education participation. Difficulties in designing

such public policies are easy to imagine, beginning with the fact that barriers connected

to individual beliefs and attitudes do not appear in any administrative data in ways that

could be used ex ante to determine the optimal mix or targeting of GED-related programs

that might improve postsecondary education attainment. Thus, this explanation for the

worse PSE outcomes of GED holders suggests a limited, or at the least, not-well-defined

role that public policy might play in ameliorating the situation.



The Persistence of the Drop Out “Shock”

       As our model demonstrated, we would expect estimates of the causal effect of the

“GED path” to be negatively biased if the period t1 exogenous shock had a persistent

negative effect on education investment decisions. Thus, even if our use of the AR8

sample meant that

               σGED,w = 0 and σGED,z = 0,

any persistent effects of a teenage pregnancy, parental divorce, or family economic

hardship that dampened the PSE decisions of GED holders would lend a negative bias to

the causal effect of the GED on PSE outcomes. Again the question is, what is the

information content here for policy and practice?




                                                                                      40
       To the extent that these random shocks with persistent effects are responsible for

the results we see, rather than unobserved heterogeneity, policies aimed at improving the

postsecondary education outcomes of GED holders may be in a somewhat better situation

to have a positive impact. At least we would not be expecting adult education policy to

change beliefs and attitudes about postsecondary education. On the other hand, it is not

clear how to go about designing coordinated and systematic programming that could

address the different personal circumstances that would result from the wide variety of

negative shocks that could be influencing both the school-leaving and the postsecondary

education decisions. Nevertheless, there is potentially more promise in assessing and

addressing barriers to postsecondary education participation around tangible issues such

as child care, financial aid, or transportation than in trying to alter behavioral-related

barriers to further education.



The GED Program Is a Weak Route into Postsecondary Education

       A fourth explanation is that our estimates are free of bias and represent the true,

negative causal effect of “assignment” the GED path relative to the high school

graduation path. That is, this explanation assumes that

               σGED,w = 0, σGED,z = 0, and λ = 0.

        If these strong assumptions hold, then otherwise identical individuals who find

themselves in either the GED or the high school graduation path have very different

probabilities of going on to postsecondary education. What happened to the dropout who

obtained a GED that shifted the college-going probability? What is there about going




                                                                                         41
through the GED process relative to finishing the last years of high school that lower

GED holders’ probability of obtaining some postsecondary education.

       To the extent that our estimates are unbiased and reflect problems within the GED

program, then changes in policies and practices of the GED program hold some promise

for increasing the postsecondary education outcomes of GED holders. Under this

scenario, we would not have to develop programs designed to alter attitudes or beliefs of

individuals, nor would we have to address programmatically the great variety of life

circumstances that cause a person to drop out and then persist to affect the postsecondary

education calculus. In this case, we “only” need to figure out how to redesign or

supplement the GED process so that the very fact of using this route to “school

completion” as opposed to finishing high school does not negatively alter postsecondary

education probabilities.

       Of course, this may be a difficult task. For example, it might be that the actual

time spent in the last years of high school matriculation positively influence

postsecondary education attainment. Perhaps it is the additional human or social capital,

or maybe the college guidance one receives in the last years of high school that matter.

Perhaps it is the interaction between these and other factors that affects the postsecondary

education decisions of students and their families. The issue is that there may be

something about “the high school experience” that is difficult, if not impossible, to

replicate in the GED setting.

       On the other hand, improving the postsecondary education outcomes associated

with receipt of a GED might be a relatively straightforward task. Perhaps a substantial

difference could be made by de-emphasizing the role of the GED is a “terminal”




                                                                                        42
education credential, and shifting the emphasis to using the GED as a route to

postsecondary education. Moving to this model would potentially require changes in the

perceptions and attitudes of GED administrators, teachers, and students, as well as

changes in the formal and informal linkages between GED preparation and testing

programs and local postsecondary education institutions. There is evidence that the adult

education field has been moving in this direction in recent years as research emphasizing

both the relatively weak economic benefits of the GED and the growing economic

importance of postsecondary education have become widely disseminated and accepted

in the field. We note that the extent to which this “programmatic reform” approach might

increase the postsecondary attainment of GED holders depends on both the efficacy of

any changes in the GED program as well as the extent to which this last explanation is

responsible for the results we see. That is, if the “programmatic” explanation explains

only a small part of the results we see, then only small improvements in college-going

rates would result from even substantial and effective changes in the GED program.

       This study has shown that among at-risk students who look very similar in the 8th

grade, individuals who subsequently drop out and obtain a GED acquire substantially less

postsecondary education in the first post-credential years than do the high school

graduates. Given the importance of postsecondary education in today’s economy and

society, this is a fact that should attract public attention. Our closing discussion points to

the importance of trying to understand the underlying causes of the discrepancy in

outcomes between GED holders and high school graduates. The reason is that both the

policy prescriptions and the potential for the success of such prescriptions are very

different depending upon whether the observed differences in outcomes are the result of




                                                                                        43
behavioral factors related to GED acquisition, persistent negative effects associated with

drop-out-inducing shocks, or practices and policies of the GED program itself. Research

that could help sort out these explanations could inform public policy, lead to the more

efficient use of public monies, and potentially increase the postsecondary education

levels of students who are currently at the mercy of an economy that offers few routes to

economic stability and self-sufficiency for those lacking any postsecondary education.
