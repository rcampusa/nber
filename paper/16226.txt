                                                 ABSTRACT

Recent macroeconomic experience has drawn attention to the importance of interdependence among
countries through financial markets and institutions, independently of traditional trade linkages. This
paper develops a model of the international transmission of shocks due to interdependent portfolio
holdings among leverage-constrained investors. In our model, without leverage constraints on investment,
financial integration itself has no implication for international macro co-movements. When leverage
constraints bind however, the presence of these constraints in combination with diversified portfolios
introduces a powerful financial transmission channel which results in a positive co-movement of production,
independently of the size of international trade linkages. In addition, the paper shows that, with binding
leverage constraints, the type of financial integration is critical for international co-movement. If international
financial markets allow for trade only in non-contingent bonds, but not equities, then the international
co-movement of shocks is negative. Thus, with leverage constraints, moving from bond trade to equity
trade reverses the sign of the international transmission ofVKocks.

1. Introduction

        The recent international financial crisis has highlighted the critical role of financial

markets in the propagation of business cycle shocks, both in transmitting shocks from one

country to another and in magnifying the effects of those shocks. One key aspect of this

transmission mechanism, seen in both the recent crisis as well as the Asian and Russian crises a

decade ago, is the importance of balance sheet linkages among investors and financial

institutions across countries. This implies that asset price collapses in one country are transmitted

internationally through deteriorations in the balance sheets of institutions in countries holding

portfolios of similar assets.

        It is widely agreed that high financial leverage – a high ratio of assets to underlying

capital – is a critical factor in the magnifying effects of financial crises. As asset values decline,

highly levered financial institutions find their net worth sharply eroded and are forced to shed

assets to avoid unacceptable risks of insolvency. But asset sales drive asset values down further,

adversely impairing the balance sheets of other institutions. These institutions in turn are forced

to sell assets, creating a vicious cycle of balance sheet deterioration and asset sales. While the

financial dynamics of such balance sheet adjustments have been widely discussed elsewhere, it is

less well understood how this process affects macroeconomic outcomes, or that this process

alone may generate an immediate and powerful international transmission of shocks.

        A clear pre-requisite for balance sheet adjustments to have powerful macroeconomic

effects is the presence of financial frictions of some sort, or distortions in credit markets. After

all, in a Modigliani-Miller world, leverage is irrelevant. Thus, in order to capture the dynamics of

the financial meltdown, financial frictions will be of critical importance.




                                                   2
         In the context of the international transmission of business cycles, however, other puzzles

arise. Most models of business cycle transmission still rely on international linkages due to trade

flows. While global trade has been growing at remarkable rates over the past two decades, it is

still the case that the major world regions – the United States, Asia and Europe – are to a large

extent ‘closed’ economies, with the share of inter-regional trade representing only a small

proportion of overall GDP. Thus Kose and Yi (2006) find that it is hard to account for the

magnitude of business cycle co-movements among countries using conventional international

real business cycle models. In addition there is evidence that business cycle co-movement is

greater between countries with greater financial integration (Imbs 2004, 2006). Nevertheless, in

the standard international business cycle model, enhanced international financial integration

actually tends to reduce business cycle co-movement, since it allows for a more efficient

reallocation of resources across countries in response to shocks (Heathcote and Perri 2002,

2005). But Krugman (2008) suggests that traditional multi-country business cycle models lack a

critical ‘international finance multiplier,’ by which financial shocks in one country affect

investment both in the original country and in other countries, through financial or balance sheet

linkages.

         This paper develops a theoretical model of a balance sheet channel for the international

transmission of shocks. The model emphasizes how a process of balance sheet contractions,

generated by a downturn in one country, is spread across countries through inter-connected

portfolios. In the presence of leverage constraints, we show that this gives rise to a separate

financial transmission mechanism of business cycle shocks that is independent of trade linkages.1

  In the recent literature, for example Krugman (2008), the adjustment of balance sheets is sometimes referred to as
‘de-leveraging.’ This term is inaccurate as a description of our model since, as in Kiyotaki and Moore (1997), the
leverage ratio is constant. Nonetheless, the process of satisfying leverage constraints in the wake of asset price

                                                          3
The paper’s main contribution is to compare how macro shocks are transmitted under different

financial market structures. We do not attempt to provide an integrated explanation of the recent

crisis, or a full quantitative calibration, but instead highlight how the joint process of balance

sheet constraints and portfolio interdependence generate an important cross-country propagation

effect. We develop a two-country model in which investors borrow from savers, and invest in

fixed assets. Investors also diversify their portfolios across countries and hold equity positions in

the assets of the other country, as well as their own. Investors cannot commit to repay savers,

however, and in order to ensure payment, may face limits on the maximum amount of leverage

on their balance sheets.

        We analyze four different variants of the model. First we consider a version of the model

in which bond markets are segmented across countries but equity markets are integrated, both

with and without binding leverage constraints. In the case where leverage limits do not bind there

is no international transmission of shocks in final goods production. A negative productivity

shock, which leads to a fall in the value of assets in one country, will cause investors to sell some

assets and reduce their debt exposure, but this does not affect other countries. In fact investors in

other countries increase their borrowing. More broadly, business cycle fluctuations in final goods

production across countries are uncorrelated in the absence of limits on leverage.

        When leverage constraints are binding, however, there is a powerful transmission of

shocks across countries. A fall in asset values in one country forces a large and immediate

process of balance sheet contractions for that country’s investors. But the fall in asset values

leads to balance sheet deterioration in other countries that have internationally diversified asset

portfolios, causing a sell-off in assets and a forced reduction in borrowing around the globe.


declines does impart a magnification effect on real activity. Endogenizing the maximum leverage ratio represents a
separate issue, beyond the scope of this paper. For a recent contribution, see Geanakoplos (2009).

                                                         4
This, in turn, drives a further sell-off in the first country, establishing a feedback loop. The end

result is a large magnification of the initial shock, a large fall in investment, and highly

correlated business cycles across countries during the resulting downturn.

       We explore the relationship between financial integration and business cycle co-

movement further in a model with integrated bond markets. We assume that international bond

markets are integrated across countries and leverage constraints always bind. We then contrast

the properties of an economy without internationally diversified equity holdings with one with

fully integrated equity markets. In the case where equity markets are segmented, we find that

macroeconomic shocks are transmitted negatively across countries. A negative productivity

shock in the home country pushes down investment there, but the resulting decline in world

interest rates stimulates borrowing, investment and consumption in the foreign country. Hence

borrowing, asset prices, output and consumption all move in opposite directions in the two

countries.

       The final variant of the model we explore is one where both bond and equity markets are

integrated. Here we find positive co-movement across countries that is similar to a world without

integrated bond markets.

       The model has strong implications for understanding the effects of financial market

integration. In the presence of leverage constraints and internationally diversified equity

holdings, financial market integration (in equity markets) is associated with a ‘financial

contagion’ effect, in the sense that asset price movements cause negative shocks to be

propagated through balance sheets – propagation effects that would not occur in an international

economy without international portfolio diversification.




                                                  5
         The contrasting results between the final two variants of the model also suggests that it

may be important to distinguish the ex-ante from the ex-post gains to international portfolio

diversification. In the absence of equity market integration, the presence of negative co-

movement in returns suggests substantial gains from portfolio diversification. But, in a world

with binding leverage constraints, the process of integrating equity markets leads to strong

positive co-movement in production, reducing the ex-post gains from diversification.2

         The model draws heavily on a number of separate literatures. First, and most importantly,

we follow Kiyotaki and Moore (1997) in imposing leverage constraints on investors. This leads

to a wedge between the effective returns faced by investors and savers, and can act as an

amplification mechanism for business cycle shocks.3 Second, we emphasize the linkages among

countries through the presence of inter-connected portfolios. Portfolio linkages, in a somewhat

different context, have for some time been seen as important in the contagion effects of financial

shocks (see Rigobon 2003 and Pavlova and Rigobon 2008, for example). Finally, we introduce

endogenous portfolio interdependence through the recently developed techniques of Devereux

and Sutherland (2010a).4

         The paper is organized as follows. The next section provides some evidence of the

importance of a financial channel in the recent business cycle downturn. We then develop the

basic two-country model in which investors and savers interact, but investors may be limited by

  It is important to distinguish co-movement in final goods production from that of asset prices and consumption. In
almost any international macro model, greater financial market integration will give rise to positive co-movement in
consumption and asset prices. But, in the standard international RBC model with frictionless asset markets, financial
integration will tend to imply negative co-movement in production (and physical investment) – see, for example,
Backus et al. (1992), Baxter and Crucini (1995) and Heathcote and Perri (2002, 2005). The contribution here is to
show that leverage constraints, together with financial integration, tend to generate positive co-movement in final
goods production.

  An alternative mechanism where balance sheets play a key role in business cycles is the ‘financial accelerator’
model of Bernanke et al. (1999). This has been extended to a multi-country setting by Gilchrist (2004).
4
  Dedola and Lombardo (2009) develop an interesting model similar to the present paper based on the financial
accelerator model of Bernake et al. (2000), incorporating endogenous portfolios as in the present paper. They
emphasise a somewhat different type of transmission effect, unique to the financial accelerator model, coming from
the direct connection between risk-premia across countries.

leverage constraints. In section 4 we explore the effects of a negative productivity shock in one

country, and demonstrate the role of balance sheet adjustments in the propagation of business

cycle shocks across countries. Section 5 then extends the model to allow for integrated bond

markets, and section 6 considers the case of endogenous labor supply and investment. We then

conclude.

2. Empirical evidence

       We present some empirical evidence that supports our contention that balance sheet

contractions may have been an important propagation mechanism for the current international

crisis. First, Figure 1 documents the global nature of the economic crisis, demonstrating a

remarkably synchronous collapse in economic growth rates for a sample of OECD countries. It is

unlikely that trade linkages alone could account for the simultaneous downturns seen in all

regions. If we take the US economy as the ultimate source of the financial crisis then it would be

easy to explain the scale of the downturn in Mexico, for instance. But Figure 1 illustrates

dramatic reductions in economic growth in many OECD economies, including some only

marginally linked to the US through trade flows.

       In addition there is clear evidence that US banks reduced their outstanding claims on the

rest of the world. Table 1 contains short-term claims of US banks, for all OECD countries for

which data is available. This is the total stock among US reporting banks of all claims on the

destination economy with less than one year remaining until maturity. Under normal

circumstances new claims are issued and many maturing existing claims are rolled over each

quarter. A rapid decline in less than one year, then, implies little new issuance, and few existing

exposures being rolled over. There is a clear pattern overall that the largest OECD economies (by

size of claims) experienced a substantial fall in short-term US bank claims during 2008,



                                                 7
including France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Korea and Luxembourg. Further, total claims across

all countries declined by more than 20 percent, with half of that decline occurring in the final

quarter of 2008.

         Aside from bank balance sheets, we can also find evidence consistent with balance sheet

contractions in other instruments. Equities in particular were believed by some policymakers to

be a vector of contagion, as the following quote by Rakesh Mohan, Deputy Governor of the

Reserve Bank of India, indicated:

         “Our problems are mainly due to the sell-off by foreign institutional investors in the

domestic equity markets leading to a sharp reduction in net capital inflows and the sharp

slowdown in global economic activity and external demand.” (Mohan 2009)

This view is consistent with the data on international capital flows captured by the Treasury

International Capital System (Figure 2). The scale of the fall in both inflows and outflows

starting in late 2008 is unprecedented over the full sample of aggregate TIC data going back to

1980. In our model we will see that the balance sheet contractions implied by this, when

combined with binding leverage constraints among investors, can impart an independent

international transmission of shocks.

Financial linkages versus trade linkages

             The effects of global balance sheet adjustments should be expected to vary by country.

Some economies are more dependent on capital inflows than others, and countries with low

credit ratings may suffer more from a sudden reduction in flows than higher rated countries, for

example. Empirical evidence of the effects of a financial channel should reflect differences in

vulnerabilities across countries.

             We demonstrate the importance of balance sheet contractions as a propagation

mechanism for the crisis using regression analysis. As a rough measure of the international effect



                                                                                                                      10
of the crisis, we use the change in the growth rate of real GDP between the year ended December

2007 and December 2008. The vulnerability of countries to a sudden outflow of capital is

calculated as total capital inflows from the US, as a percent of 2007 GDP, using US Treasury

International Capital data (labeled TIC). Our sample includes all members of the OECD for

which TIC data is available. We also include trade linkages, measured using exports to the US in

2007 as a percent of GDP (X). Finally, we interact each of these variables with the sovereign

credit rating of the economy (CR), to capture the idea that capital withdrawals are likely to affect

lower rated economies more heavily than higher rated ones, due to “flight to quality.” Based on

the Standard and Poor’s sovereign foreign currency credit rating in December 2007, we convert

the credit rating to a numerical scale where a value of 0 corresponds to a AAA-rating, 1 to a

AA+ rating, and so on, down to 12 for a BB- rating, the lowest in our sample.

       The results are given in Table 2, and provide strong support for our argument that

financial flows were a significant causal factor in the propagation of the crisis, while trade

channels appear less important. First the export variables (X and CRX) are never economically or

statistically significant, and sometimes enter with the wrong sign. Second our measure of capital

flows (TIC) is statistically significant in all cases. Third, when we include an interactive term

between the credit rating and the size of capital inflows from the US, the interactive term enters

not only significantly, consistent with flight-to-quality, but the statistical support for TIC is also

further strengthened. Finally, the adjusted R-squared statistics are supportive of capital inflows

playing an important role in explaining the downturn, with trade channels being less important.

       In summary, this evidence suggests that a financial channel may be important for the

international propagation of shocks. Moreover, it is difficult to explain the scale and

synchronicity of the global downturn based on trade alone.

3. The model

          In this section we describe a basic two-country model with borrowers and lenders in each

country. The countries are called home and foreign. Within each country there are investors and

savers, both of whom use the same fixed asset and have infinite horizons. Investors purchase the

fixed asset and rent it to production firms, receiving a risky return in exchange. We may think of

this investment as the purchase of an equity claim in the production firm. Investors are more

impatient than savers, so they will borrow from savers in order to invest in the fixed asset.5


5
  Because they are more impatient than savers, investors will never accumulate enough resources to cover the cost of
investment in any period.

                                                          12
Savers also make use of the fixed asset in home production. Savers therefore choose a portfolio

in which they hold the debt of investors and the fixed asset. Savers do not hold domestic or

foreign equity by assumption. We work with two versions of the model. In the first version

savers lend only to domestic investors, so there is no cross country trade in non-contingent

bonds. In the second version we allow for an open international bond market, so that investors

may borrow from either domestic or foreign savers.

       Investors face leverage constraints. They issue debt, but the maximum amount they can

issue depends on their net worth. We will examine separately cases where these leverage

constraints are binding and non-binding.

       Whether or not leverage constraints bind, investors in either country may have the

possibility of trading claims with investors in the other country so as to diversify their portfolio

of equity holdings. Thus investors in each country finance their investment with debt, but may

also have equity portfolios that are inter-connected across countries. Finally, both investors and

savers in each country supply labor inelastically to production firms, and there is no physical

capital accumulation. In section 6 we discuss how the model may be extended to accommodate

endogenous capital accumulation and variable labor supply.

       The focus of the analysis is to explore the joint process of leverage constraints and

international portfolio integration in propagating macroeconomic shocks across countries.

Investors

       We normalize the population of each country to unity, with a measure n of investors and

1  n of savers. The representative investor in the home country maximizes:

                   
(1)             Et   sIU (CsI ) ,
                   s t




                                                 13
where CsI is consumption of the final good. To keep the analysis solely focused on financial

inter-linkages between countries, it is assumed that there is just one world good. Adding an

endogenous terms of trade to the analysis would enrich the response, but would not

fundamentally alter the cross-country transmission of balance sheet adjustments modeled here,

so long as the elasticity of substitution across home and foreign goods is not very close to unity.6

         We define the discount factor for investors such that:

                   sI1   I (CsI ) sI ,

with  I '(CsI )  0 where CsI is the economy-wide average consumption of investors. Thus the

rate of time preference of investors is increasing in consumption, but is taken as given by each

individual investor. The assumption of endogenous time preference for investors plays the usual

role of ensuring a stationary wealth distribution among groups, both within and across countries.

But it also plays a key role in allowing for a comparison of an economy in which leverage

constraints bind with one where they do not bind, as we discuss below.

         Investors receive income from their current holdings of domestic and foreign equity, and

labor income from working in the domestic production firm. In addition, they must repay their

debts owed to domestic savers. They then issue new debt, purchase equity claims on home and

foreign investments and consume. The home country investor’s budget constraint is written as:

(2)               CtI  q1t k1It  q2t k 2It  Wt I  ( q1t  R1Kt ) k1It 1  ( q2t  R2 Kt ) k2It 1  BtI  Rt 1 BtI1 ,




6
  As is well known, with an elasticity of substitution equal to unity, there is a high cross-country correlation of
consumption purely due to the risk sharing implications of a terms-of-trade adjustment. This is seen, for instance, in
the paper by Dedola and Lombardo (2009). Aghion et al. (2004) explore the importance of terms-of-trade
movements in affecting borrowing constraints in an emerging market economy framework. Extending our model to
a setting with an endogenous terms-of-trade would affect borrowing constraints through the impact of a terms-of-
trade adjustment on net worth in a similar way to the effects of asset price changes in the present version of the
model.

                                                                 14
where q1t and q2t represent the price of the fixed asset (or equity) in the home and foreign

country respectively, and k1It and k2It are the portfolio holdings of the fixed assets in each

country held by the home investor. The fixed asset of the home (foreign) country earns a

dividend of R1Kt ( R2Kt ). Wt I is wage income for the investor, who supplies one unit of labor.

Finally, BtI is the debt issued to domestic savers and Rt 1 BtI1 is payment on previously incurred

debt.

        One may question why only investors can purchase the fixed assets, which are then used

by final goods firms. As in Bernanke et al. (1999), we could assume that investors (or, in their

model, entrepreneurs) have some special capability for transforming a unit of the fixed asset into

a usable factor of production that is rented to production firms. Savers cannot do this, and so may

gain only indirectly from the investment, by lending to the investors. Savers can use the fixed

asset only for use in home production, as described below.

        In addition to constraint (2), investors face a constraint on total leverage due to an

inability to commit to repayment, as in Kiyotaki and Moore (1997). Total debt is assumed to be

restricted to be no greater than  times the market value of equity assets, where   1 . Thus

home investors’ choices are constrained by:

(3)             BtI   ( q1t k1It  q2t k2It ) .

        The full leverage rate (the value of assets to capital) for investors is then 1 / (1   ) in the

case where the leverage constraint (3) is binding. Leverage constraints in the form of (3) have

been used quite widely in the literature on asset prices (Aiyagari and Gertler 1999), emerging

market crises (Mendoza and Smith 2006), borrowing in a small open economy (Uribe 2006) and

monetary policy with credit frictions in housing markets (Iacoviello, 2005). Kiyotaki and Moore



                                                    15
(1997) show that  may depend on the borrowing rate and expected capital gains on equity

under some circumstances. We assume that  is a fixed parameter in our analysis.

          Investors in the home country choose a portfolio based on investments in the home equity

and the foreign equity, as well as their total borrowing and consumption, to maximize their

expected utility subject to their budget constraint (2) and leverage constraint (3), giving the

conditions:

                                                          (q1t 1  R1Kt 1 )
(4)                U '(CtI )  Et  I (CtI )U '(CtI1 )                        t ,
                                                                  q1t

                                                          (q2t 1  R2 Kt 1 )
(5)                U '(CtI )  Et  I (CtI )U '(CtI1 )                         t ,
                                                                  q2 t

(6)                U '(CtI )  Et  I (CtI )U '(CtI1 ) Rt  t ,

where  is the multiplier on the leverage constraint. This may be interpreted as the shadow price

(or marginal utility) of an extra unit of debt to the investor. If this is positive, it means that the

investor would like to borrow more, but is constrained by (3). Thus  is a measure of the value

of the opportunity to make a levered investment. To show this, put (4), (5) and (6) together to

obtain:

                                                   t r1,t 1  (1  t )r2,t 1  Rt 
(7)                 t  Et  I (CtI )U '(CtI1 )                                     ,
                                                                 1                  

where t  q1,t k1,t / ( q1,t k1,t  q2,t k2,t ) is the share in home equity, r1,t 1  ( q1,t 1  R1K ,t 1 ) / q1,t is the

return on the home equity and r2,t 1  (q2,t 1  R2 K ,t 1 ) / q2,t is the return on the foreign equity.

Equation (7) shows that, when   0 , the expected return on the portfolio, up to the first-order,

exceeds the cost of borrowing.




                                                               16
         Note that the leverage constraint does not directly affect the investors’ incentive to

diversify equity across countries, since (3) applies equally to borrowing for domestic or foreign

equity purchases. Thus we may put (4) and (5) together to get the standard portfolio selection

condition:

                                 (q  R ) (q  R2 Kt 1 ) 
(8)               EtU '(CtI1 )  1t 1 1Kt 1  2t 1       0.
                                      q1t             q2t 

         Given that the portfolio choice may be written in the form (8), we can derive the optimal

equity portfolio of each country’s investors following Devereux and Sutherland (2010a). We

discuss the details involved in portfolio choice more fully below.

Savers

         Savers have preferences given by:

                      
(9)               Et  sSU (CsS ) .
                     s t



As for investors, we define the discount factor such that  sS1   S (CsS ) sS , with  S '(CsI )  0 ,

where CsI is the economy-wide aggregate consumption of savers. Assume that savers are

inherently more ‘patient’ than investors, so that:

(10)               S ( x)   I ( x) ,

for all feasible values of x . Assumption (10) ensures that savers will lend to investors, even in a

steady state where the leverage constraint (3) is not binding.7

         Savers purchase the fixed asset, and buy debt from investors. They receive wage income

from working in the final goods sector, and returns on their lending to investors. In addition they



7
 An alternative, but considerably more difficult, approach to achieving an equilibrium with levered investment is to
assume that investors are less risk averse than savers. Solving a model with leverage based on risk preferences
would necessitate using a higher order of approximation to the full stochastic model.

                                                        17
have a residual ‘home production function’ that uses the fixed asset.8 An individual saver owning

k1,St of the fixed asset produces G (k1,St ) in terms of home production, where G '(k1,St )  0 . For

simplicity, we assume that home production is perfectly substitutable with the final good in

savers’ utility.9 With this assumption, we may write the saver’s budget constraint as:

(11)                CtS  q1t k1St  Wt S  q1t k1St 1  G ( k1St 1 )  BtS  Rt 1 BtS1 .

         Note that, by assumption, savers purchase only the domestic fixed asset. They do not

have access to the same investment opportunities as investors and therefore only have use for the

domestic fixed asset, as it may be utilized in home production. On the other hand, savers’

purchases of debt from investors are unconstrained.

         The first-order conditions for the optimal choice of k1St and BtS are simply:

                                                                (q1t 1  G '(k1,St ))
(12)                U '(CtS )  Et  S (CtS )U '(CtS1 )                                 ,
                                                                         q1t

(13)                U '(CtS )  Et  S (CtS )U '(CtS1 ) Rt .



Production firms

         Production firms in each country hire labor and fixed assets in order to produce. Firms

are competitive, and maximize profits given the production function:

(14)                Yt  At F ( Lt , K t 1 ) ,




8
  As in Kiyotaki and Moore (1997), we think of this fixed asset as being more productive when used to produce final
goods, and having a residual usage in home production for savers. According to this interpretation, savers do not
receive dividend income on the use of the fixed asset in home production, since this is paid only on the
‘transformed’ asset after its purchase by investors.
9
  Specifically, we define savers’ consumption as C  Cˆ  G ( k ) , where Cˆ is savers’ consumption of the final
                                                     S    S      S             S
                                                            t        t         1t 1            t

                S
good, and G ( k1t 1 ) is savers’ home production.


                                                                     18
where Lt is effective employment and K t 1  n ( k1,I t 1  k1,*tI1 ) is the firm’s fixed assets. Profit

maximization then implies that:

(15)             Wt  At F1 ( Lt , K t 1 ) ,

(16)             R1K ,t  At F2 ( Lt , K t 1 ) .

Equilibrium

        Equilibrium of the two-country world economy entails market clearing for the world

market of the fixed asset, as well as equilibrium in the debt market. First take the case where

national debt markets are segmented, so that domestic investors borrow from domestic savers

only. Then, for the home economy, it must be the case that:

(17)             nBtI  (1  n) BtS  0 .

In the case where there is a common world bond market, (17) is replaced by

(17’)            n( BtI  BtI * )  (1  n)( BtS  BtS * )  0 .

        For the home economy, equilibrium in the market for the fixed asset is defined as:

(18)             nk1,I t  nk1,*tI  (1  n)k1,St  1 ,

where k1,*tI represents foreign country investors’ real holdings of the home asset at the beginning

of time t  1 . In addition, the world market clearing condition must be satisfied:

                 n(CtI  Ct* I )  (1  n)(CtS  Ct*S )  At F (1, n(k1,I t 1  k1,*tI1 ))
(19)
                  At* F (1, n(k2,I t 1  k2,*It 1 ))  (1  n)(G (k1,St 1 )  G ( k2,*St 1 )).

This condition incorporates the fact that the total labor supply of investors and savers sums to

unity, and total use of the fixed factor by final goods firms is equal to total holdings by domestic

and foreign investors.



                                                                   19
          We solve for four variants of the model and, in the process, conduct two experiments. We

first assume that bond markets are segmented across countries, but equity markets are integrated

internationally. We then solve separately for an equilibrium where the leverage constraint is

slack and when the leverage constraint is binding.10 Next we assume that international bond

markets are integrated across countries, so that there is one world interest rate on bonds and, in

addition, leverage constraints always bind. In this environment we contrast the properties of the

economy where equity markets are separated (no cross holdings of equity) with an environment

of full integration of equity markets (full portfolio diversification).

          The first experiment allows us to explore the effects of leverage constraints in a global

economy where equity markets are integrated (although, as discussed below, we vary the degree

of diversification in this case). The second experiment allows us to explore the implications of

different forms of financial market integration in a global economy where leverage constraints

are binding in each country.

          The equilibrium conditions may be characterized as follows. First, for the model with

segmented national bond markets, integrated equity markets and slack leverage constraints, the

full equilibrium is described by equations (2), (4)-(6), (11)-(13), (15)-(17) and (18) for both the

home and foreign country, and the world market clearing condition (19). This gives 23 equations

in the 22 variables CtI , CtS , Ct*I , Ct*S , k1,I t , k2,I t , k1,St , k1,*tI , k2,*It , k2,*St , BtI , BtS , Bt*I , Bt*S , q1,t , q2,t ,

Rt , Rt* , Wt , Wt * , R1K ,t and R2 K ,t , with one equation redundant by Walras’ law (note that in this

case, because leverage constraints never bind, we have t  t*  0 ). In the case where leverage

constraints always bind, the full equilibrium is described by equations (2)-(6), (11)-(13), (15)-



10
  The solution approach we use does not allow us to accommodate an outcome with ‘occasionally binding’ leverage
constraints.

                                                                   20
(17) and (18) for both the home and foreign country, and the world market clearing condition

(19). This gives 25 equations in the 24 variables CtI , CtS , Ct*I , Ct*S , k1,I t , k2,I t , k1,St , k1,*tI , k2,*It ,

k2,*St , BtI , BtS , Bt*I , Bt*S , q1,t , q2,t , Rt , Rt* , t , t* , Wt , Wt * , R1K ,t and R2 K ,t , with one equation

redundant by Walras’ law.

            In the case with a common world bond market, leverage constraints and segmented

international equity markets, we have conditions (2)-(4), (6), (11)-(13), (15)-(16) and (18) for the

home country, and analogous expressions for the foreign country, while condition (17) for each

country is replaced by the single condition (17’) which, in conjunction with (19), gives us 22

equations in 21 variables CtI , CtS , Ct*I , Ct*S , k1,I t , k1,St , k2,*It , k2,*St , BtI , BtS , Bt*I , Bt*S , q1,t , q2,t ,

Rt , t , t* , Wt , Wt * , R1K ,t and R2 K ,t .11 Finally, in the case with a common world bond market,

leverage constraints and integrated world equity markets, we add condition (5) to the previous

list for the home country, along with its analogue for the foreign country, and we now solve for

two additional variables, k2,I t and k1,*tI .

            Although this fully describes the set of equilibrium conditions and endogenous variables

for each version of the model, the solution method involves taking a linear approximation around

a non-stochastic steady state version of each model. In this case, a well-known difficulty arises

due to the problem of determining the portfolio holdings of investors in a non-stochastic steady

state. In particular, if equity markets are integrated and both assets are to be held by investors,

equilibrium must be characterized by indifference among investors, at the margin, between

holdings of home and foreign equities. This implies that, in a non-stochastic steady state, the

assets must command identical returns, and there is no unique optimal portfolio share for an


11
     Note that in this case there are no international cross-holdings of equity.

                                                               21
investor. But using the method of Devereux and Sutherland (2010a), the characteristics of the

equilibrium portfolio may be approximated. The method allows for a derivation of the zero-order

(or steady state) component of the equilibrium portfolio using a second order approximation of

the portfolio selection equation, in conjunction with a first order approximation of the remaining

parts of the model. This approximation gives us the degree to which investors in each country

will choose to be exposed to equity markets in the other country, and allows an analysis of the

stochastic equilibrium of the first-order approximation to the model with integrated world equity

markets.12

           It is important to emphasize that this indeterminacy of portfolio shares up to a first order

approximation applies only to the choice of home and foreign equity conditional on the

allocation of the fixed asset between the final goods sector and the home production sector in

each country. This allocation itself, giving the total supply of equity, denoted by kˆ1,I t  k1,I t  k1,*tI

for the home economy and kˆ2,I t  k2,I t  k2,* It for the foreign economy, is clearly determinate in a

non-stochastic steady state, as evidenced by equations (19) (for the case without leverage

constraints) or (20) (for the case with leverage constraints). Thus, the total supply of equity is

determinate in a steady state, but the ownership pattern must be obtained using higher order

approximations. In the impulse responses discussed below, we report the dynamics of total

equity, which can be obtained from a simple linear approximation, rather than the dynamics of

the investors’ equity portfolios (which would require a second order approximation to the model

as described in Devereux and Sutherland (2010b)).

Properties of the steady state




12
     This aspect of the solution method is described in more detail in an appendix available from the authors.

                                                            22
        Before examining the dynamics of balance sheet adjustments within the model, we first

discuss some properties of the non-stochastic steady state. Since the model is symmetric and

there is a stationary wealth distribution, the steady state is identical in the two types of bond

market arrangements.

        When leverage constraints do not bind, it follows from a combination of (4) and (6),

together with (12), (13) and (16), that the fixed asset is allocated efficiently between the final

good sector and home production. That is, for the home economy, we have:

(20)            G '(k1S )  AF2 (1, nkˆ1I ) ,

Where nkˆ1I represents the total quantity of the fixed asset used in the final goods production

sector and kˆ1I  k1I  k1* I . Thus the marginal product of the fixed asset is equalized between home

production and final goods production.

        In combination with the resource constraint nkˆ1I  (1  n ) k1S  1 , this uniquely determines

the allocation of assets in final goods production. Therefore there is no interdependence across

countries in asset allocation in steady state when leverage constraints do not bind. In fact, we can

extend this result further. In the case where leverage constraints never bind it is easy to see that

there is no interaction between asset allocations across countries at all, at least up to a first-order

approximation. This can be seen by taking a linear approximation of (4), (6), (12), (13) and (16)

to obtain the condition:

                     dk1,St 1          dAt 1      dkˆ I
                1                Et            2 1,It 1 ,
                       k1S               A            kˆ1

where  1 and  2 are constant coefficients. Hence the dynamic paths of asset allocations are

independent across countries, despite the fact that, up to a first-order, expected returns on all

assets are equalized both within and across countries.

                                                                 23
        A more general feature of this environment is that the degree of financial integration does

not affect the allocation of real assets. That is, allocation of the fixed asset between home

production and investment in the final good is independent of the ownership of equities. This

property does not hold in an economy with binding leverage constraints.13

        When leverage constraints bind, we again use (4), (6), (12), (13) and (16) to obtain the

steady state condition:

                                        I (1   S )
(21)              G '(k1S )                             AF2 ( L, nkˆ1I ) .
                                 (1   )   (   )
                                 S       I           S I




        From condition (3) it must be true that  I (1   S ) / [  S (1   I )   (  S   I )]  1 . It

follows that, under binding leverage constraints, the final goods sector has an inefficiently low

level of the fixed asset. More generally, however, since discount factors are endogenous, the

allocation of fixed assets across sectors will no longer be independent across countries. With free

trade in equities across countries, returns to investors must be equal in both countries. Since

returns interact with movements in consumption through the endogenous rate of time preference,

(21) shows that the division of resources between home production and final goods must be

linked across countries as well. Even in the case of constant time preference, however, the

presence of leverage constraints would still imply a dynamic interaction between output levels

across countries, because productivity shocks to one country will affect the tightness of leverage

constraints across all financial markets. We explore this in detail below.

Portfolio choice



13
   In a more general model with endogenous capital accumulation and variable labor supply, the degree of financial
integration will affect business cycle correlations across countries. As discussed in the introduction, however,
financial integration generally reduces the co-movement of business cycles across countries in the standard model
(Heathcote and Perri 2004). The main point here is to show that the presence of balance sheet constraints introduces
substantial forces for positive cross-country correlations that would otherwise be absent. In section 6 below, we
discuss how the results extend to a model with capital accumulation and endogenous labor supply.

                                                          24
           Equations (20) or (21) determine the steady state allocation of the fixed asset in final

goods production, with non-binding or binding leverage constraints respectively. This determines

the total supply of equity in each country. But the share of each country’s equity held by home

and foreign investors (the portfolio shares k1I and k1* I ) must also be determined. Clearly, in order

to analyze the dynamic response to productivity shocks in one country, it is necessary to

understand the pattern of equity holdings of investors in each country. To do this we follow

Devereux and Sutherland (2010a) in using a second-order expansion of (8) to obtain an

approximation of optimal portfolio holdings.14

           In practice it is convenient to rewrite the model to determine the net international equity

position of each country. Since only investors have access to equity markets by assumption, it is

sufficient to look at the portfolio decisions of home and foreign investors. First take the budget

constraint for home country investors (2). This may be rewritten as:

(22)       CtI  NFAt  Wt I  R1Kt kˆ1It 1  q1t (kˆ1It  kˆ1It 1 )  r2t NFAt 1  rxt  q1t 1 (k1It 1  kˆ1It 1 )   BtI  Rt 1 BtI1 ,
                                                                                                                         

where NFAt denotes net foreign assets, defined as NFAt  q2t k2It  q1t (kˆ1It  k1It ) , which is the

excess of the home investors’ holdings of foreign equity relative to foreign investors’ holdings of

domestic equity. In addition, rxt is the ex-post excess return on the portfolio:

                                         q  R1K ,t         q2t  R2 K ,t     
                      rxt  r1t  r2t   1t                                  .
                                         q1t 1             q2t 1            

For given NFAt , the portfolio choice may be described as the choice of  t  q1t 1 (k1It 1  kˆ1It 1 ) ,

which is the net holding of home country equity by home agents. If  t  0 , the investors

diversify in the sense that less than 100 percent of all home equity is owned by home investors.


14
     A detailed description of the solution approach is contained in an appendix available from the authors.

                                                                      25
Given NFAt , home investors’ holdings of foreign equity are equal to NFAt   t and equation (22)

is the only part of the model where the portfolio term  t enters. But it is still necessary to obtain

a solution for  t in order to characterize how equity markets affect international transmission.

Devereux and Sutherland (2010a) show that, when the properties of the model are analyzed up to

a first-order approximation,  t is a constant and is determined by a combination of a second-

order approximation of (8), together with a first-order approximation of the rest of the model.15

            In the solution below, following Tille and van Wincoop (2007), we extend (8) to allow

for transactions costs of international financial trade that effectively limit international portfolio

diversification. This represents a brute-force technique for generating home equity bias. In

particular, we assume that an ‘iceberg’ cost factor given by exp(  )  1 reduces the returns that

home investors receive from foreign investment so that condition (8) becomes:

                                     (q  R ) (q  R2 Kt 1 )          
(8’)                  EtU '(CtI1 )  1t 1 1Kt 1  2t 1     exp( )   0 .
                                          q1t             q2t          

In addition, we follow Tille and Van Wincoop in assuming that  is a small, second-order term.

This means that while it does affect the solution for the equilibrium portfolio, which is evaluated

using a second-order approximation of (8’), it does not impact on the first-order dynamics of the

model, except insofar as it affects the choice of the portfolio itself.

            Note that given the definition of net foreign assets, the leverage constraint for home

country investors may be written:

(23)                  Bt   ( NFAt  q1t kˆ1It ) .

15
     Note that the constant approximation for  t is the only aspect of the portfolio solution that is explicitly
incorporated in the model. Given this approximation, all other aspects of the model can be analyzed using a first
order approximation, including the dynamics of total equity (the part of the fixed asset invested in final goods
production). As emphasized above, in order to compute the dynamics of the ownership of equity (the dynamics
of  t ), it would be necessary to solve the model using a higher order of approximation.


                                                              26
Thus, holding home asset prices constant, an increase in net foreign assets generated by either a

current account surplus or a capital gain on the external portfolio (i.e. valuation effects) will

loosen the leverage constraint. But since NFAt  NFAt*  0 , this will simultaneously tighten the

leverage constraint facing foreign investors. Therefore the degree to which leverage linkages

govern the transmission of shocks across countries depends on the dynamics of net foreign

assets, and these in turn are linked to the portfolio choices made by home and foreign investors.

Calibration

       Because this version of the model is such a stripped-down representation of a full-scale

DSGE framework, lacking capital accumulation and dynamics in labor supply and containing

only a single world good, there are many dimensions in which the model’s predictions will

depart from reality. The aim of the exercise is solely to explore the way in which the interaction

of leverage constraints and portfolio interdependence affect the cross-country dynamics of asset

prices, asset allocations and levered investments. To do this, however, we need to choose

parameter values for preferences, production technologies and the leverage constraint itself.

Table 3 gives the set of parameter values used in the baseline model.

           We assume that the measure of investors and savers is equal, so that n  0.5 . In the

leverage constrained economy, this accords with the estimates of Campbell and Mankiw (1990)

regarding the share of households that are subject to credit constraints in the US economy.

           In the model with binding leverage constraints, total leverage (investment relative to

capital) is equal to 1 / (1   ) . The leverage ratio has a significant effect on the quantitative

dynamics. We examine two alternatives. First we choose a relatively low ratio of 2 (   0.5 ), as

in Bernanke and Gertler (1999). But, given the high rates of leverage seen in the financial system

in recent years, we also explore the implications of a higher value of   0.75 , corresponding to

total leverage of 4. While the impact of shocks is greater for higher leverage (when the leverage

constraint is binding), qualitatively the results are similar for both leverage ratios.

           We assume a discount factor defined as:

                                                 i (C )   i (1  C )  , i  I , S .

Following Mendoza (2006), we set   0.022 . We choose  for savers to match an annual

interest rate of 4 percent, and the value of  for investors so that, in a steady state with binding

leverage constraints, investors face a shadow price of borrowing that effectively imposes an

interest premium on borrowed funds of two percentage points, which requires that  I  0.955 .16

This follows the calibration of the borrowing premium in Bernanke et al. (1999).

           In the model without leverage constraints, it is necessary to use a different approach to

calibrate the discount factor. In that case, we choose  S and  I jointly to match a steady state

annual interest rate of 4 percent and to ensure that borrowing by investors is such that the

leverage ratio matches that of the economy with binding leverage constraints. In the

case   0.75 , this requires that  S  .99 and  I  .9735 . When   0.5 ,  S  .9825 and

 I  .975 .

         We assume a Cobb-Douglas final goods production technology, and let F ( L, K )  L1 K  .

We set   0.36 , the conventional measure of the share of capital in US GDP.17 Regarding the

home production sector, we assume that G  Z (k1S ) and   0.1 , implying that the fixed asset

is less important in this sector.18 We set A  Z  1 in steady state. The combination of these

assumptions and other calibrated parameters implies that, in steady state, 80 percent of the fixed

asset is employed in final goods production.

         We follow the standard business cycle literature in setting an elasticity of intertemporal

substitution equal to 0.5, so that   2 in U (C )  C1 / (1   ) . Alternative values of  change

the volatility of asset prices, but have little qualitative effect on the results otherwise.

         What are the appropriate shocks to focus on? While the recent crisis has raised awareness

of shocks to the financial system, our model lacks any detailed financial structure. It is not easy

to pinpoint any key crisis-generating shock within the model. Instead, we follow the standard

macro-RBC literature and look at the international propagation of productivity shocks in the final

goods sector. The stochastic process for final goods productivity is modeled as:

(24)               log( At )   log( At 1 )  t ,


17
   In order to have substantial propagation effects from leverage constraints, Kiyotaki and Moore (1997) require that
production in the borrowing sector is linear in the fixed asset. Kocherlakota (2000) shows that, with a more
conventional calibration allowing for decreasing returns, credit constraints have much less impact. Cordoba and
Ripoll (2004) extend the Kocherlakota analysis to a general equilibrium, two sector economy similar to ours. They
show that borrowing constraints of the type used in Kiyotaki and Moore (1997) impart little amplitude to the effect
of shocks on total output unless sectors differ substantially in the share of capital in production. Our interpretation
differs from theirs by focusing on the distinction between the final goods sector and a home production sector. In
addition, our main focus is not on amplification per se, but on the impact of leverage constraints and portfolio
integration on the international transmission of shocks. Our results, showing that these two features enhance the
international transmission of shocks, still obtain under the alternative interpretation that aggregate output is the sum
of output from both sectors.

where   0.9 , Et 1t  0 and  2  0.022 . We assume that foreign productivity is driven by the

same process, and foreign and domestic productivity shocks are uncorrelated.




4. The effects of leverage constraints on international transmission

            In this section we compare the impact of a productivity shock in one country in an

environment where leverage constraints are absent with that where investors in both countries

are subject to binding leverage constraints. In both cases we assume that investors have

diversified equity portfolios, potentially constrained only by second-order iceberg costs of capital

flows, as described in (8’). The iceberg cost  is set so as to ensure that domestic investors hold

75 percent of the home equity portfolio. We will also examine the case without these costs, so

that investors have fully diversified equity portfolios. In addition, this section focuses on the case

where national bond markets are segmented. Section 5 below analyzes the case with a single

world bond market.

No leverage constraints

            Figures 3 and 4 describe the impact of a one percent negative productivity shock in the

home country, when the leverage constraint is not binding, relaxing (3). The figures describe the

response of total consumption of final goods,19 asset prices, investor borrowing, asset allocation,

the home country trade surplus and the internal lending rate in each country. Figure 3 represents

the case where portfolio diversification is restricted by second-order transactions costs, as

described above. Investors in the home country then choose values for k1I and k 2I to satisfy (8’),

evaluated up to second-order, where the parameter  has been chosen so that home investors

hold 75 percent of home equity ( k1I  .75kˆ1I ).

     We define total consumption of final goods as nCt  (1  n )(Ct  G ( k t )) .

Figure 4 describes the case of unrestricted portfolios. In this case, the choices of k1I and k 2I

satisfy (8). This involves home investors having a bias against home equities. Since investors are

exposed to non-diversifiable risk from wage income, and wages are positively correlated with the

return on home equity, they will hedge this risk by taking a larger position in foreign equity than

home equity, as noted by Baxter and Jehrmann (1997).

         A fall in At causes an immediate fall in current output in the home country and

temporarily reduces wages for both savers and investors. This would lead both savers and

investors to increase their desired borrowing at the initial interest rates, so that net saving falls. If

there was no cross-country equity trade, real interest rates would have to rise sufficiently so as to

ensure that net saving equals zero. At the same time, the direct fall in the return on the fixed asset

would lead investors to reduce their demand for this asset, leading to a reduction in within-

country borrowing of investors from savers, and precipitating a fall in the asset price. This fall in

the asset price would lead savers to purchase more of the fixed asset. Thus, without international

equity trade, adjustment would involve higher real interest rates, a lower asset price and a lower

share of the fixed asset in the final goods sector, with all these variables gradually returning to

their initial steady state.

         In the two-country world economy with equity trade, the adjustment process is facilitated

by the immediate valuation effects on home country net foreign assets, and the subsequent

dynamics in net foreign assets due to changes in equity holdings. The international transmission

of the shock to consumption depends on the degree of portfolio diversification, and the

movement in asset returns. The home country has a negative net position in its own stock

(  t  q1t 1 (k1It 1  kˆ1It 1 )  0 ). Since asset returns must be equalized, up to a first order, the fall in

asset prices in the home economy leads to a fall in the foreign asset price. But the ex-post excess


                                                         33
return on home assets immediately following the shock is negative ( rxt  0 ), and the combination

of this and the home country’s portfolio position ensures that the home country receives a

positive portfolio valuation effect. In fact, with fully unrestricted diversification, foreign

investors are more exposed to home equity, and suffer a bigger valuation loss on their portfolio,

than home investors because home asset prices fall by more than foreign asset prices. Thus the

home and foreign consumption responses in Figure 4 are more alike than in Figure 3, because

there is more portfolio diversification among investors.

         The subsequent adjustment in the two-country world economy is characterized by the

home economy running a persistent trade deficit. This is financed by home country investors

reducing their holdings of both home and foreign equities over time, and foreign country

investors increasing their holdings of both equities. Since world real interest rates are higher

following the shock, the foreign country as a whole increases its savings rate to absorb the

greater holdings of equity.

         The key feature of both Figures 3 and 4, however, is that there the shock does not affect

the allocation of the fixed asset in the foreign country.20 Since the foreign asset allocation is

governed by (20) up to a first order, optimal investment is unaffected by the shock to home

productivity. This means that there is no fall in lending between foreign savers and foreign

investors. In fact, within-country borrowing in the foreign country rises, moving in the opposite

direction to that in the home country.21 In this sense, there is no international transmission of

balance sheet contractions.



20
  Again, we note that in this and subsequent figures, the asset dynamics refer to total equity in each country (or
equivalently, the shares of the fixed asset in the final goods sectors) kˆ1,t and kˆ2,t , rather than the division of this
                                                                           I        I



equity between the portfolios of home and foreign investors.
21
   In fact, since foreign lenders do not interact with home agents, foreign investors are effectively borrowing from
foreign lenders in order to purchase more home and foreign equity during the transition. In the home country, the

                                                              34
        In the economy without leverage constraints, then, the international transmission of

shocks is limited, and clearly counterfactual, relative to the discussion of the empirical evidence

of financial spillovers in section 2. A negative productivity shock in the home country leads to

balance sheet contractions domestically as investors reduce both their borrowing and holdings of

fixed assets. But there are no foreign balance sheet contractions. Equity portfolio integration

allows for the consumption effects of productivity shocks to be diversified across countries, but

it does not in itself influence the real effects of the shock on investment and output.22

Leverage constraints and international transmission

        The impact of a negative productivity shock in the home country, when leverage

constraints bind in both countries, is shown in Figures 5-7. Figures 5 and 6 illustrate the case

where the leverage ratio is 4, the former when investors’ portfolios are only partly diversified

due to the presence of transactions costs and the latter with unrestricted portfolio diversification.

        As before, the fall in home country productivity leads to a fall in asset prices in both

countries and, through the valuation effects of ex-post asset return differentials between the

home and foreign portfolios, to an increase in net foreign assets for the home country, and a fall

in investors’ consumption in both countries. But in this environment asset prices have a

secondary effect, beyond the wealth redistribution channel, through the return on portfolios. The

fall in asset prices leads to a tightening of the leverage constraint in both the home and foreign

countries. For the home country, the fall in q1t leads to a fall in net worth and, for given NFA,

requires a reduction in borrowing. With a diversified portfolio, however, the shock also generates

a valuation effect, causing a compensating rise in NFA. But this leads to negative movement in

dynamic is the opposite – home investors reduce their borrowing from home savers (at least initially), financed by
sales of equity to foreign investors.
22
   Again, we note that, with endogenous labour supply and capital accumulation, the degree of portfolio
diversification would impact on the international transmission of shocks, but this would generally imply negative
transmission.

                                                        35
foreign NFA, and a tightening of the foreign leverage constraint, also requiring a reduction in

borrowing in the foreign country. The result is a reduction in borrowing by investors in both

countries, and a consequent reduction in investment in fixed assets in the final goods sector.

Thus Figure 5 illustrates that foreign investment falls sharply, by the same order of magnitude as

home investment. Note that, for the foreign country, there is no fall in the productivity of the

domestic final goods sector. Despite that, there is a fall in investment in final goods in the

foreign country. This fall in investment takes place purely through balance sheet linkages.

       The positive relationship between the movement in an asset price and demand for this

asset represents the essence of the ‘upward sloping demand curve’ for assets that characterizes

episodes of balance sheet contractions forced by binding leverage constraints (see, for instance,

Aiyagari and Gertler 1999). Here it is taking place as a spillover from one levered investor to

another, as emphasized by Krugman (2008). That is, a fall in the price of the asset held by one

investor leads to a tightening of leverage constraints and a fall in demand for both the original

asset and other assets held in the investor’s portfolio.

       Even in the case where portfolios are only partly diversified (Figure 5), there is a high

correlation across countries in borrowing and investment. The balance sheet contraction is so

great that the interest rate on debt in each country immediately falls. Again, note that this is in

response to a temporary shock so that future consumption of investors is expected to increase.

But because investors are subject to leverage constraints, the path of their consumption is de-

linked from the path of interest rates.

Since consumption falls for both home and foreign investors, but is expected to rise in the future,

real interest rates would tend to rise in an unrestricted environment.23 But this effect is more than

offset by the increase in the shadow price of borrowing due to the leverage constraint. This leads

to a large fall in the supply of debt to savers, and a fall in market real interest rates.

         There is a distinct difference in this model between the constrained and unconstrained

economy, not just in the direction of the international transmission of shocks, but also in the

scale of the effects. In the unconstrained economy, not only is there an absence of international

transmission via balance sheet contractions, but the domestic impact of the shock is also

relatively mild. A one percent decline in final goods’ sector productivity leads only to an

approximately 0.25 percent reduction in fixed asset investment. By contrast, the response of the

constrained economy is an order of magnitude larger. Domestic investment in fixed assets falls

by 1.7 percent. Even in the foreign economy the effect of the shock is very large – investment

falls by 1.3 percent. In both countries, the response to the shock is proportionally much larger

than the shock itself, due to the interaction between asset price declines and binding leverage

constraints. Consumption also falls by slightly more in the constrained economy than in the

unconstrained economy, although this decline is less persistent.

         When portfolio diversification is unrestricted, Figure 6 shows that the international

transmission of the shocks is heightened further. In fact, we get the surprising prediction that the

size of the balance sheet contraction and disinvestment is greater in the foreign country than in

the home country! Investment in the foreign economy falls by 1.6 percent, but only 1.2 percent

in the domestic economy.

23
  There is not a strict relationship between expected consumption growth and real interest rates, up to a first-order,
due to the presence of endogenous time preference. Nevertheless, since the time preference parameter  is very
small, for practical purposes the consumption growth-real interest rate linkage holds quite closely in the model. Note
also that, because interest rate movements are non-monotonic, the same will (approximately) hold for the non-
borrowing constrained savers in each country.

        Why does greater portfolio diversification magnify the international propagation effects

of the shock? The reason is clear from (3) or (23). Increased diversification leads to a greater

sensitivity of foreign balance sheets to the domestic asset price, and therefore a larger balance

sheet contraction in response to a negative shock to home productivity. In the completely

unrestricted portfolio equilibrium (when   0 ), the foreign country is over-weighted in home

equity as part of an optimal risk sharing arrangement. So the macroeconomic reverberations of

the shock are greater in the foreign country than the domestic country, despite the fact that the

actual shock takes place only in the home economy. Thus, in this example, the ownership pattern

of equity holdings, through its implication for balance sheet constraints, is more important for the

business cycle response than is the geographical source of macro shocks.

        Figure 7 shows the results with a lower degree of leverage (equal to 2), when portfolio

diversification is restricted by transactions costs (the case of full diversification is very similar

and is omitted for brevity). Qualitatively the results are very similar, although the amplification

effect of shocks is lower when leverage is smaller. The presence of binding leverage constraints

still generates a high positive co-movement in borrowing and real investment between countries.

5. Portfolio Integration and international transmission

         In this section we examine the version of the model that allows for an integrated world

market for non-contingent bonds. Now investors may borrow at the same interest rate from either

domestic or foreign savers. We use this version to explore the impact of equity market

integration in the presence of leverage constraints. That is, in contrast to the previous section

where we compared the effects of a productivity shock assuming integrated equity markets (to a

greater or lesser degree, depending on the value of  ), both with and without leverage

constraints, here we assume that leverage constraints are always binding, but we contrast the case

with and without equity market integration.24

         Figure 8 illustrates the impact of a shock to productivity in the home country in the model

with a common bond market, but without equity market integration. In this environment, the

transmission of macroeconomic shocks across countries is negative!25




24
   This was not possible in the previous section because, absent equity market integration, the two countries were
effectively in autarky, since bond markets were segmented by country. We note also that Dedola and Lombardo
(2009) look at various degrees of portfolio integration.
25
   We focus only on the high leverage case here. The impact of portfolio integration in the case with lower leverage
is qualitatively similar, in the sense that portfolio integration increases macroeconomic co-movement when
compared with the economy without equity market integration. However, in the economy without integration and
lower leverage (the counterpart of Figure 8), the co-movement is likely to be positive rather than negative since a
negative productivity shock will tend to raise rather than lower world lending rates with low leverage. Thus the case
of negative co-movement depends on both the absence of portfolio integration and high levels of leverage.
Nevertheless, the main result that follows – that equity market integration increases macroeconomic co-movement –
remains even with low leverage.

           As before, a decline in home country productivity reduces investment, borrowing and

aggregate consumption in the home economy. But because the borrowing rate is identical in both

countries, and the fall in the demand for funds on the part of home investors pushes down the

borrowing rate, the demand for funds in the foreign country rises, increasing borrowing and

investment in the fixed asset by foreign investors. Foreign total consumption rises, as the fall in

interest rates encourages an increase in spending, and the rise in foreign investment increases

production of final goods in the foreign country. In contrast to the case without an integrated

world bond market, the home country’s trade balance now moves into surplus, rather than

deficit.

           The different responses of home and foreign investment lead asset prices to move in

opposite directions in the two countries. There is an asset price decline in the home country, for

the same reasons as before. In the foreign country, by contrast, the increase in demand for the

fixed asset raises the price of that asset. Thus the end result is that consumption, investment, and

asset prices move in opposite directions in the two countries when there is an integrated world

bond market but no equity market integration. Notice also that the amplification effects of the

shock on domestic investment and asset prices are substantially bigger in this case than in

Figures 5 or 6. Because equity prices across countries are not directly related through arbitrage,

home country asset prices fall by more, and the impact on the leverage constraint is amplified,

relative to the case with equity market integration.

           Figure 9 now takes the same shock, but allows for both bond and equity market

integration, assuming unrestricted equity holdings (the case with iceberg costs on equity returns

is very similar, and is omitted for brevity). In this case there is a clear positive co-movement

across countries. Qualitatively, the transmission is similar to Figures 5 and 6, except now there is



                                                  44
a single world debt market. The shock leads to a fall in the price of the home asset and, from

arbitrage condition (8), the foreign asset price also falls. Given the hedged portfolio position of

the home country, the fall in the return on the home asset leads to an increase in home NFA due

to valuation effects. For the foreign country these valuation effects are negative, leading to a

tightening of the leverage constraint on foreign investors. As in Figures 5 and 6, total borrowing,

investment and consumption fall in both countries. The world real interest rate on debt also falls,

as the demand for borrowing by both home and foreign investors declines.

       A comparison between Figures 8 and 9 illustrates that, conditional on leverage

constrained investment, portfolio integration itself causes a dramatic qualitative shift in the

international transmission of productivity shocks. Absent equity market integration, shocks are

transmitted negatively to consumption, asset prices and investment. There would thus be a clear

incentive to diversify country specific risk through equity market integration. But integrating

equity markets in the presence of binding leverage constraints causes a sharp change in the

nature of international transmission itself. Without leverage constraints, as we have seen, there

would be no such effects. Real investment would be entirely independent across countries in this

basic model, and opening up financial markets in equity trade would have no effect on co-

movement whatsoever, aside from the direct effect on consumption risk-sharing. But with

binding leverage constraints, portfolio diversification leads to large shifts in net worth across

countries in response to country-specific shocks. These net worth changes interact with leverage

constraints to cause highly synchronized movements in investment demand across countries.

Thus, the ex-post gains to diversification, after financial integration, are diminished relative to

ex-ante ‘perceived’ gains from equity market integration.

       Equivalently we can observe that, while financial integration through equity markets

allows for a positive gain from cross country risk-sharing, it also generates a ‘contagion’ effect in

the presence of leverage constraints on investment. This contagion effect works through cross-

country changes in net worth, affecting investment and increasing the degree of macroeconomic

co-movement relative to that which would obtain in the absence of portfolio integration.

Unconditional moments

       Table 4 reports the unconditional moments of the model under the assumption that

productivity shocks in both countries follow identical but uncorrelated distributions, given by

(24). As is evident from the figures, the model with binding leverage constraints displays

substantially more overall volatility than the model where leverage constraints are absent.

Aggregate consumption is 50 percent more volatile with high leverage constraints. Asset price

volatility is relatively unchanged with and without leverage constraints, but investment volatility

is vastly higher, as is clear from a comparison of Figures 3 and 5. Investment is essentially

uncorrelated across countries in the economy without leverage constraints, but almost perfectly

correlated in the economy with leverage constraints. Table 4 therefore underscores the main

message of the paper. In the presence of credit market imperfections, balance sheet linkages

across financial institutions can generate a very powerful mechanism for the international

transmission of business cycle shocks. The table also shows that, in the presence of leverage

constraints, international portfolio diversification can lead to a dramatic change in macro-

economic co-movement. The cross-country correlations of consumption, asset prices and

investment switch from negative to positive when equity markets are opened and leverage

constraints are binding. Note, however, that overall macro volatility is still substantially reduced

by financial integration, as suggested by Figure 9.

6. Extending the model: endogenous capital accumulation and labor supply

         The paper has stressed the joint effects of leverage constraints and international portfolio

integration in generating positive international co-movement in macro aggregates. The key

mechanisms are based on interdependence in balance sheets and the magnification effects of

asset price shocks in face of leverage constraints. The model lacks many of the standard features


                                                              48
of the international real business cycle (IRBC) literature, however. In particular, labor supply of

both investors and savers is assumed to be inelastic, and there is no endogenous physical capital

accumulation. A natural question to ask is whether the forces for positive macro co-movement

outlined in the basic model extend to a full IRBC environment. In an interesting recent paper,

Faia (2007) provides some relevant results. She explores the role of financial integration in

DSGE framework where financial frictions in the manner of Bernanke et al. (2000) are present.

Her results show that these financial frictions lead to a greater synchronization of international

business cycles.

       Exploring the full implications of the leverage constraints and portfolio diversification

channels for international business cycles is beyond the scope of the present paper. However,

Devereux Sutherland and Yetman (2010) extend the basic model to a richer international

business cycle environment, incorporating endogenous labor supply, reproducible capital

accumulation and quadratic adjustment costs of investment, in conjunction with the channels of

portfolio diversification and leverage constraints described above. Under this extension, the

general features of the results described above continue to hold. In particular, the presence of

leverage constraints generates an ‘international finance multiplier’ which tends to reverse the

sign of the international macro-transmission of shocks. Nevertheless, a large number of questions

remain unanswered – in particular pertaining to the role of financial shocks relative to real

shocks, the comparison of different types of financial frictions and the role for financial

intermediaries in the international propogation of shocks.

       In some ways investors in our model may be thought to parallel the banking system. In

the model investors borrow money from savers and use this to invest in fixed assets, which might

be thought of as similar to the way in which the banking system intermediates between deposits



                                                 49
and loans. Also, the downturn in our model, amplified by leverage constraints, might be seen as

similar to the debt deflation and balance sheet deterioration within the banking system which

operated during the financial crisis. However, the analogy to financial institutions is not perfect.

For example, there is no maturity transformation in our model, which is a distinguishing feature

of the banking system. In addition, whereas it is generally assumed that banks lend to

entrepreneurs who then undertake investment projects, here the investors themselves take equity

stakes in the capital projects.




5. Conclusions

This paper has provided empirical evidence on the importance of balance sheet adjustments in

propagating business cycle shocks across countries. Financial interdependence, combined with

financial vulnerabilities, can open a channel for the transmission of shocks that may be as

important as standard trade linkages. We have used this evidence to motivate a simple two-

country model in which highly levered financial institutions hold inter-connected portfolios, and

may be limited in their investment activity by capital constraints. The combination of portfolio

inter-dependence and capital constraints leads a negative shock in one country to precipitate an

episode of global balance sheet contractions and disinvestment. In this sense our model may be

seen as a formal general equilibrium representation of Krugman (2008) who suggests that inter-

connections in financial markets may give rise to an ‘international finance multiplier.’ In our

model we find that, with high initial levels of leverage, the global effects of the shock may be

substantially magnified. While the model illustrates the importance of financial connections, it

abstracts away from trade inter-linkages. In a more elaborate model, it would be desirable to

quantitatively investigate the relative importance of the two separate channels.
