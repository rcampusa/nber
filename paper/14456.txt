                                              ABSTRACT

We analyze funeral arrangements following the deaths of 3,751 people who died between January
2003 and December 2005 in the Africa Centre Demographic Surveillance Area. We find that, on average,
households spend the equivalent of a year’s income for an adult's funeral, measured at median per
capita African (Black) income. Approximately one-quarter of all individuals had some form of insurance,
which helped surviving household members defray some fraction of funeral expenses. However, an
equal fraction of households borrowed money to pay for the funeral. We develop a model, consistent
with ethnographic work in this area, in which households respond to social pressure to bury their dead
in a style consistent with the observed social status of the household and that of the deceased. Households
that cannot afford a funeral commensurate with social expectations must borrow money to pay for
the funeral. The model leads to empirical tests, and we find results consistent with our model of household
decision-making.

1. Introduction

Since 1990, many countries in East and southern Africa have seen a reversal in the trend toward

greater life expectancy, largely as a result of the AIDS crisis. In South Africa, 1.8 million lives

have been lost to AIDS since the pandemic took hold (UNAIDS 2008). In one site in South

Africa that has been under demographic surveillance since the early 1990s, life expectancy

among females has fallen by 12 years, and among males by 14 years (Kahn et al. 2007).

       Economic research focusing on the long-run effect of AIDS finds, if the crisis results in

lower population growth, that AIDS could “endow the economy with extra resources which …

[will] raise the per capita welfare of future generations.” (Young, 2005). This earlier research,

however, assumes a constant savings rate over the life of the crisis, in order to focus on the effect

of a potential fertility decline. To the extent that productive resources are diverted into expensive

funeral celebrations, earlier predictions that the pandemic will benefit future generations

economically are less likely to come to pass. The financing of burials has implications for a

household’s ability to maintain a stock of productive assets, to stake migrants in urban areas until

they find work, to finance schooling, and more broadly to provide adequate nutrition and a

healthy environment within which to raise children.

       This paper documents funeral costs and financing for deaths that occurred between 2003

and 2005 in a demographic surveillance site in northern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.

Specifically, we analyze funeral arrangements following the deaths of 3,751 people who died

between January 2003 and December 2005 in the Africa Centre Demographic Surveillance Area.

We find that, on average, households spend the equivalent of a year’s income for an adult’s

funeral, measured at median per capita African (Black) income. Approximately one-quarter of all


                                                                                                1
individuals had some form of insurance, which helped surviving household members defray

some fraction of funeral expenses. However, an equal fraction of households borrowed money to

pay for the funeral.

       We also examine how households determine appropriate spending for funerals. To do so,

we set out a model, consistent with ethnographic work in this area, in which households respond

to social pressure to bury their dead in a style consistent with the observed social status of the

household and that of the deceased. Households that cannot afford a funeral commensurate with

social expectations must borrow money to pay for the funeral. The model leads to empirical

tests, and we find results consistent with our model of household decision-making.

       The next section introduces the data we use to quantify funeral behavior. Section 3

discusses funeral costs in more detail. Section 4 presents a model of household decision-making,

and tests the model using our data. Section 5 offers some thoughts on the sustainability of the

current burial practices, and the implications of current practices for the future wellbeing of

household members.



2. Data

In 2000, the Africa Centre for Health and Population Studies began demographic surveillance of

approximately 11,000 households in the Umkhanyakude District in northern KwaZulu-Natal.

The surveillance site includes both a township and a rural area administered by a tribal authority.

At six month intervals, every household is visited and demographic and health information is

collected on all household members. Individuals may be resident in the Demographic

Surveillance Area (DSA), or may be non-resident members of households that claim them as


                                                                                                  2
members. Approximately two-thirds of all persons under demographic surveillance are resident

in the DSA at any one time. (See Tanser et al. 2007 for details on the Africa Centre site and

surveillance protocols.)

         Upon learning of the death of a household member, a verbal autopsy nurse is sent to

interview the deceased’s primary caregiver.1 Symptoms and health seeking behavior of the

deceased are recorded, and sent to two clinicians, who independently assess the information and,

where possible, assign a cause of death. For deaths between January 2003 and December 2005,

information was also collected on the costs associated with the illness, and with the funeral. This

information, from the Illness and Death (IAD) Survey, forms the basis of our analysis.

         We augment these data with information that was collected on household socioeconomic

status in two rounds of data collection. Household Socio-Economic Survey 1 (HSE1) was

conducted in 2001, and Household Socio-Economic Survey 2 (HSE2), between January 2003 and

June 2004. When possible, we assign household SES information from HSE1, in order to

quantify the economic and demographic characteristics of the household prior to the death.



Characteristics of the Demographic Surveillance Area and of those who died

Column 1 of Table 1 presents information on individuals followed by the Africa Centre

Demographic Information System (ACDIS) in 2001, at the time of HSE1. Just over half of all

individuals followed by ACDIS are female. The population under surveillance is young, with a

mean age of 23 years. Employment opportunities in the area under surveillance are quite limited,

and many household members migrate to find work. This is reflected in reports that only 34

                                                                                                                3
percent of adults resident in the DSA worked for money in 2001, in contrast with 58 percent of

non-resident adults. Individuals in the DSA live in large households, with an average of 10

members, 7 of whom are resident in the DSA.2

        Column 2 presents information on individuals followed by ACDIS who died between

2003 and 2005. Household characteristics of those who died are similar to those of all persons

followed by ACDIS. Household sizes (10.08 vs. 10.35 members), number of working adult

members (1.96), and number of children (4.58 vs. 5.00) are all quite comparable. Employment

for adults who died between 2003 and 2005 are similar to reports for resident members as a

whole, with 32 percent of the deceased reported to have been working before they fell ill.

        Age at death over this period was 38 years, on average. This reflects the large AIDS

burden that this region is shouldering. Verbal autopsies diagnose that 48 percent of all deaths in

the DSA from 2003 to 2005 were due to AIDS, which is associated both with high infant

mortality and with death in middle age.

        Individuals old enough to have gone to school at HSE1 (ages 6 and older) who

subsequently died had a half year less education than other individuals followed in ACDIS, on

average. However, given changing educational attainment between cohorts and differences in the

age profile of those who died and others followed in ACDIS, this difference is much reduced

when one controls for age and age squared at HSE1 (so that those who died, age adjusted, had

attained 0.18 fewer years of education at HSE1).

  These numbers are presented at the level of individuals within the DSA, in order to compare their information with
that from people who died. At the level of the household, average household size is 7.6, with 5.5 resident members.
                                                                                                              4
3. Funerals in the DSA

It would be difficult to exaggerate the importance of funerals in South African life. Funerals

serve to honor the dead, who are entering a new life as ‘ancestors.’ In addition, funerals mark the

deceased’s status (and that of his family) within the community. They also strengthen ties with

neighbors and extended family, who may travel long distances to attend the funeral. More than

any other single rite of passage – births, graduations, marriages – funerals provide a focal point

for family and community life. (See Roth 1999 for discussion.)

         For some or all of these reasons, funerals are elaborate, and expensive. In addition to

expenses for a coffin, traditional burial blankets, and (often) a tent for the funeral, immediate

family must pay to entertain mourners. After a death, extended household members may arrive

for a lengthy visit. It is expected that the immediate family of the deceased will feed mourners

who have come for the funeral, for as long as they choose to stay. In addition, animals are

slaughtered to honor the dead. Precise customs vary from place to place, but in KwaZulu-Natal,

when an adult male dies, general custom is to kill a cow, and to use its meat to feed all present.

This is an expensive proposition: cattle during this period sold for approximately 2000 Rand a

head.3 With median per capita income among Africans (Blacks) approximately 400 Rand a

month, the cow represents more than a third of a year’s income for half the African population.

When an adult female dies, a goat is slaughtered. While less expensive than a cow, this is still a

considerable expense for the household.

3
 Prices are those reported by survey respondents during the 2003-2005 period of data collection. These are
consistent with other reports for this period. King (2004) reports sale prices for a cow fluctuated between R1500 and
R2000 in the former bantustan of KaNgwane, between 2000 and 2002. McCord (2004) reports that sale prices for
cows varied from R700 to R3000 in Limpopo in mid-2003. Since that time, prices for cattle have increased. The
Weekend Argus (2006) reports the market price for a cow in December 2006 as R3000.
                                                                                                               5
Burial societies and funeral policies

One mechanism that has evolved in South Africa to help individuals save for funerals are savings

clubs or accounts that pay out only upon death. These include membership in a burial society, or

the purchase of a funeral policy with a funeral parlor or an insurance company. Money paid into

a funeral policy can only be drawn upon at death. For approximately 20 to 30 Rand per month

(more, if one is insuring additional household members), individuals are guaranteed that some

expenses incurred for their funerals will be paid for by the insurer.

        Information on who participated in these policies, and what the policies paid at the time

of the death, is presented in Table 2. Twenty-eight percent of the deceased had a policy of some

variety, almost all of which paid something. Participation in burial societies and funeral policies

is closely related to individuals’ receipt of the South African state old-age pension. A generous

pension is provided monthly in cash to women over age 60 and men over age 65. (See Case and

Deaton 1998 for details.) Each month, after receiving their pension, pensioners can pay into their

burial account at the pension pay point. (Funeral parlors and insurance companies are the only

private firms allowed to conduct business inside pension pay points, which are generally

surrounded by a fence or barrier of some sort.) In the IAD data, 79 percent of pensioners

participated in a burial fund, true of only 18 percent of individuals who were not pension-

eligible.4

        Over half of these policies were held with funeral parlors; and 40 percent with other

private insurers. Nearly all of the policies (91 percent) paid money to the household at the time


4
 The probability of participating in a burial fund jumps by 35 percentage points as men and women move from
being slightly too young to receive the pension, to being just old enough to be age-eligible for the pension.
                                                                                                            6
of the funeral. The cash payments are large, averaging 4500 Rand. This money need not be spent

by the household on the funeral but, as we shall see below, in general it represents only part of

funeral spending for individuals who held policies.

       Policies were much less likely to provide goods in kind. Only 23 percent of policies

provided a coffin; 23 percent provided food; 13 percent, a tent. Even when a policy provides a

coffin or food, the deceased’s household may incur additional expenses for these items. While it

is rare in the IAD data to find that additional money was used to ‘upgrade’ the coffin provided by

the policy, it is not unknown (4 percent of cases). It is quite common for additional money to be

spent on meat and groceries, if the provision of food was part of the policy. (92 percent of cases

spent additional money on meat; 75 percent spent additional money on groceries.)



Funeral costs

Information on purchases for the funeral is presented in Table 3, where means are presented for

all deaths, and separately for those deaths for which the deceased had a funeral policy. With the

exception of expenditure on transport, spending on each funeral-related item was significantly

higher when the deceased had a funeral policy than it was when the deceased did not. Large

expenditures include a coffin, 858 Rand on average; meat, 1382 Rand on average; and groceries,

1084 Rand on average. Other expenditures, for example on burial blankets, are close to

universal, but are much less expensive. Overall, spending on funerals averages 4300 Rand per

burial. It is significantly higher if the deceased had a funeral policy (5900 Rand), or if we restrict

our attention to adult deaths (4700 Rand).




                                                                                                 7
        Table 4 presents information on who paid for these funeral-related expenses. (Note that

when a funeral policy paid money, and that money was used to purchase funeral-related items,

this is included in the household members’ contributions toward funeral expenses.) The vast

majority of expenses (90 percent) were paid by household members living with the deceased at

the time of the death. This is true both for funerals where a funeral policy paid, and for funerals

in which one did not. Other family, not in the household, contributed 6 percent of resources put

toward the funeral, with community, church, and employers contributing smaller amounts. In the

IAD questionnaire, expenses for funeral items were asked separately from reports on who

contributed to the funeral, and at what level. The reports nonetheless balance: the primary

caregiver on average can recall 4273 Rand worth of funeral expenses, and 4228 Rand of

contributions made by family and others.

        The second panel of Table 4 reports on borrowing that the households undertook to

finance funerals. Nearly a quarter of all deaths resulted in money being borrowed to pay for the

funeral. Conditional on borrowing, households took loans from money lenders over 50 percent of

the time; neighbors, 25 percent; and other family, 14 percent of the time. The statistics on money

lenders are troubling: in South Africa, money lenders charge exorbitant interest rates, 30 percent

per month or more (Siyongwana 2004). Poor households who borrow 1300 Rand from a money

lender for a funeral may find themselves paying back many multiples of that over several years.5

        In summary, funerals are expensive, and often leave households economically vulnerable.

In the next section, we examine the determinants of funeral spending and borrowing. We develop

a model of household decision-making on funeral spending, which provides tests for our data.

5
 Consistent with findings of Roth (1999), we rarely observe households selling assets to pay funeral expenses. Roth
argues that this is largely because the time between the sale of the asset and the receipt of cash is too long for
households who need immediate cash to pay for funeral-related items.
                                                                                                             8
4. Household decision-making on funeral spending and borrowing

The ethnographic literature and our own experience in training field workers to administer

questionnaires on illness and death modules suggest that social norms are held strongly and play

an important role in setting funeral spending.6 Denoting characteristics that mark an individual’s

status (sex and relationship to the head of household, for example) as X 1 and community and

                                                                                            ^
extended family perception of household income at the time of the death as Y , we hypothesize

that the community and extended family form an opinion about the appropriate size of the

funeral F * according to the deceased’s status and that of his household at the time of the death:



                 ^
F * = β1 X 1 + γ Y .



Here γ is the fraction of current household income that is thought to be appropriate to use for the

burial (0 < γ < 1) , net of the spending determined by the deceased’s characteristics.7 The funeral

expenses we observe in our data are the desired spending plus an idiosyncratic error:




6
  In training teams to capture information on funeral spending, we would play the role of the deceased’s primary
caregiver, and would be interviewed by field workers as a group, so that we could make sure they understood the
concepts, and filled in forms correctly. If we gave an answer on spending for particular items that did not match the
field team’s opinion on an appropriate amount to spend, given the scenario laid out about the deceased’s status and
that of his family, the field team would insist on explaining to us why our response was inappropriate.
7
  We have no evidence that pressure about the size of funeral comes from the community or extended family, rather
than from within the household itself. However, ethnographic work suggests that the community plays an important
role in setting the size of the funeral.
                                                                                                               9
                                  ^
(1) F = F * + u1 = β1 X 1 + γ Y + u1 .



        Community and extended family do not observe household income. Instead, they observe

a vector of household and individual characteristics that are correlated with income, which they

use to form an expectation of household income. Denoting these observable characteristics as

                                                        ^
X 2 , we can express perceived household income Y and true household income Y as:



            ^
(2) Y = Y + u2 = β 2 X 2 + u2 ,



so that true household income differs from perceived household income by an unobservable

idiosyncratic shock, u2 .

        Households that experience an unobserved income shortfall will be less able to meet

social expectations with respect to the size of the funeral, without borrowing money.

Specifically, the household will have inadequate resources to meet F * if



(3) Y < F * = β1 X 1 + γ ( β 2 X 2 ) .




The probability that the household will need to borrow ( B = 1) to finance a funeral of size F * can

be written, substituting (2) into (3):



(4) Pr[ B = 1] = Pr[u2 < β1 X 1 + (γ − 1) β 2 X 2 ] .
                                                                                             10
This provides us with several checks, and a formal test, of our model. First, characteristics

associated with lower individual status will have different predictions for spending and

borrowing than do characteristics associated with lower household income. Characteristics of the

deceased associated with lower individual status (that is, with lower values of β1 X 1 ) should

reduce both the size of the funeral, as in (1), and the probability of borrowing, as in (4). In

contrast, any information available to the community that causes them to revise downward their

                                       ^
estimate of household income, Y , should reduce the size of the funeral, as in (1), but increase

the probability of borrowing for the funeral. We examine these in turn.



Individual status, funeral spending and borrowing

We provide estimates of the association between individual status, funeral spending and funeral

borrowing in Table 5. The first set of columns presents results of OLS regressions for funeral

spending, with and without controls for household characteristics, and the second set provides

OLS results, using the same specifications, for borrowing money for the funeral.8

         Characteristics that enter individual status ( X 1 ) include sex and relationship to the

household head, and here we examine whether these characteristics move funeral spending and

borrowing in the same direction, as predicted by the model. Women have lower status in the

DSA than do men, so we would expect both that less would be spent on women’s funerals, and


8
  In our regression analyses, we control for age using indicators for 10-year age categories. Results are not changed
if, instead, we include age at death and that age squared in our regressions. In addition, regressions include
indicators for the year of death and an indicator that age at death is missing (true for 5 cases). All regressions allow
for robust standard errors, allowing for correlation between unobservables for observations from the same
homestead.
                                                                                                                  11
that the probability of borrowing for a woman’s funeral would be lower. We find that this is the

case: with or without controls for household demographics and SES, approximately 600 Rand

less is spent on a woman’s funeral, and borrowing for a woman’s funeral is 3 to 4 percentage

points less likely on average.9

        We also examine whether household members with a more distant relationship to the

head are treated differently from other members. Relative to a parent, spouse or child of the

head, we find all other relationships to be associated with lower funeral spending, and a lower

probability of borrowing for the funeral.10 Specifically, the funerals of ‘other’ relatives or non-

relatives of the head are approximately 800 to 1000 Rand less expensive, and the probability of

borrowing for their funerals is 4 percentage points lower.



Observable household characteristics, funeral spending and borrowing

We can also examine whether observable characteristics that are associated with household

income have different effects on spending and borrowing, as is predicted by our model. Table 6

presents OLS regression results for funeral spending (columns 1 to 6) and borrowing for funerals

(columns 7 to 12). We find that household assets are associated with significantly higher

spending on funerals, with an increase in spending of 316 Rand for each asset, and with a

significantly lower probability of borrowing, with each asset associated with a 1 percentage point

drop in the probability of borrowing, on average.

  This largely reflects the difference in cost between slaughtering cows and goats. With the exception of burial
clothing, for which a small (34 Rand) but statistically significant amount more was spent on men, meat was the only
funeral-related expense for which we find a significant difference in spending between the sexes.
10
   “Other” relationships are siblings, grandparents, grandchildren, sons- or daughters-in-law, other family and
individuals not related to the current head of household.

                                                                                                            12
        The maximum education of any household member is associated with significantly

higher household income in the DSA. Row 2 of Table 6 finds that maximum education in the

household at HSE1 is positively related to funeral spending, with each year associated with

additional funeral expenses of 325 Rand. As was true of household assets, education is

negatively associated with the probability of borrowing for the funeral, with each year of

schooling associated with a 0.5 percentage point decline in the probability of borrowing.

        Payments of medical expenses for the deceased prior to death also reduce household

resources. The next set of regressions in Table 6 examine the association between such expenses

and funeral outcomes, and finds treatments are associated with significantly lower funeral

expenditures (475 Rand on average), and a significantly higher probability of borrowing for the

funeral (3 percentage points). Half of all individuals who died in the DSA between 2003 and

2005 died of AIDS, which is associated with significantly higher medical expenditures prior to

death in our IAD sample.11 When an individual dies of AIDS, almost 1000 fewer Rand are spent

on the funeral, on average, while the probability of borrowing to pay for the funeral is 7

percentage points higher.

        The deceased’s own education appears to enter as a marker of household SES, rather than

of the individual’s own status. The coefficients on own education are much like those we

observed for maximum education in the household.

        Ninety percent of cases in which the deceased held a funeral policy, that policy paid

money to the household at the time of the death. Consistent with our model, it is the cash


        11
            Controlling for age at death, we find total treatments for individuals who died of AIDS to be 315 Rand
more expensive during this period than treatments for people who died of other causes. (See Naidu and Harris 2005
for a review of the literature on the impact of AIDS on household economic status.)

                                                                                                           13
transfer, and not the ownership of a policy, that is associated with significantly higher spending

on the funeral, and a significantly lower probability of borrowing to fund the funeral.

         Column 6 also suggests that borrowing money for the funeral is not a significant

predictor of funeral spending. This result is robust to specification,12 and we turn next to examine

why this might be the case.



Comparing the spending of borrowers and non-borrowers

Results presented in Table 4 showed that, conditional on borrowing money, 1400 Rand were

borrowed on average. However, we find no trace of borrowing on funeral spending. If

households are attempting to maintain a standard that is consistent with what is expected of

them, then money borrowed would be used to bring funeral spending in line with social norms.

         If family or community expectations are driving the decision to borrow, the coefficients

on individual and household characteristics in regressions of funeral spending should be the

same for those who borrowed and those who did not. We examine this in Table 7, where we

focus on two markers of individual status – sex, and relationship to the household head – and

three markers of household SES – asset holdings, maximum education of a household member,

and an indicator that the deceased died of AIDS. We present OLS regression results for total

funeral spending for non-borrowers (marked as column 1) and borrowers (column 2), and

compare these with results for total funeral spending net of what was borrowed among those who

borrowed (column 3). Bootstrapped standard errors are presented in parentheses for all results in

Table 7.

12
  An indicator that money was borrowed for the funeral is not significant in a regression of funeral expenses in
which the only other controls are indicators for age at death and for year of death, or in regressions that also include
other markers for household socioeconomic status. Results are available from the authors.
                                                                                                                 14
        We find that the association between individual and household status variables and

funeral spending are not significantly different when we compare regression coefficients

between non-borrowers and borrowers from columns (1) and (2). Differences in the regression

coefficients are jointly and individually equal to zero. In contrast, examining funeral spending

net of what was borrowed, we find significant differences in the responses to household SES

variables, when comparing regression results for borrowers and non-borrowers. In particular, the

coefficients on assets held and on the maximum education of a household member are

significantly lower in our regression of spending net of borrowing. Taken together, household

and individual coefficients from this regression are jointly significantly different from those

presented in column 1 for non-borrowers. This is consistent with households using funds

borrowed to keep funeral spending in line with expectations.



Formal tests of household decision-making

Our model also yields formal tests of the association between funeral expenditures and

borrowing decisions, which we analyze here. Rewriting the equation for funeral spending as



(1') F = β1 X 1 + γ ( β 2 X 2 ) + u1



and the equation for the probability of borrowing for the funeral as



                         u2       β1              β
(4 ') Pr[ B = 1] = Pr[        <      X 1 + (γ − 1) 2 X 2 ]
                         σ2       σ2              σ2


                                                                                              15
we can test several elements in our model.

        First, the ratio of each regression coefficient β1 , from vector X 1 in ( 1' ), relative to the

                                              β1
corresponding regression coefficient             from ( 4 ' ), should be equal for each element of X 1 .
                                              σ2

That is, for each variable X 1i , for i ∈ (1, k ) ,



        β1i             β1k
(5)             ... =           = σ2    .
      β1i / σ 2       β1k / σ 2



Such a test is of interest in its own right, in gauging whether the model fits the data. The ratio of

the coefficients on X 1 from (1' ) and ( 4 ' ) also yield an estimate of the scaling parameter σ 2

from (4 '). This is useful in what follows.

        In addition, the ratio of each regression coefficient γβ 2 , from vector X 2 in (1' ), relative

                                                      (γ − 1) β 2
to the corresponding regression coefficient                           from (4 '), should be equal for each element
                                                             σ2

of X 2 . That is, for each variable X 2i , for i ∈ (1, j ) ,




           γβ 2i                    γβ 2 j          γσ 2
(6)                      ... =                    =               .
      (γ − 1) β 2i / σ 2       (γ − 1) β 2 j / σ 2 (γ − 1)



The equality of these ratios provides a second test of our model. We can also use them, together

with our estimate of σ 2 from equation (5), to estimate the fraction of household income, γ , that

is expected will be spent on the funeral.
                                                                                                           16
        Results of these tests are provided in Table 8. In chi-square tests presented in the last

column of the table, we fail to reject the equality of ratios for X 1 variables (equation 5), or for

X 2 variables (equation 6). Moreover, these equations yield an estimate of γ , the fraction of

household income expected to be spent on funerals, equal to 0.56. In the next section, we

compare this estimate of γ , provided by reduced form estimation of (1') and (4 ') , with that

yielded by the maximum likelihood estimation.



Maximum likelihood estimates

To gain more precision in our estimates, we turn to maximum likelihood estimation. We denote

the latent variable driving the borrowing decision as B* = F − β 2 X 2 − u2 , where

B = 1 if B* > 0 , and 0 otherwise. We assume that funeral expenses and the latent need to borrow

are jointly normally distributed. The relevant joint density when borrowing occurs will be



                              F − β2 X 2
(7)   g ( F , B = 1) = ∫                   f ( F − β1 X 1 − γβ 2 X 2 , u2 )du2 ,
                          −∞




and for cases where no borrowing occurs is



                     ∞
g ( F , B = 0) = ∫             f ( F − β1 X 1 − γβ 2 X 2 , u2 )du2 .
                 F − β2 X 2




We can express the likelihood function to be maximized as



                                                                                                17
(8) L( β1 , β 2 , γ ) = ∏ [ g ( F , B = 1)]B [ g ( F , B = 0)](1− B ) .



To estimate (8), we re-write (7) as



                               F − β2 X 2
g ( F , B = 1) = ∫                          f (u1 , u2 )du2 .

Substitution of (10) and (11) into (8) provides the expression we use for our likelihood.

        We present maximum likelihood (ML) estimates for the structural parameters from (1')

and (4 ') in Table 9. We again use sex and relationship to the household head as our markers for

the status of the deceased, and household assets, an indicator that the death was from AIDS, and

an indicator that a funeral policy paid money at the time of the death as our markers for

household resources available for the funeral. Our ML estimation suggests households are

expected to spend a third of household income on a funeral ( γ = 0.34 ), net of the spending


                                                                                               19
expected based on the deceased’s status.13 Estimates for the impact of household socioeconomic

status variables are very similar to those presented in Table 8, once we multiply our β 2

maximum likelihood coefficients by our estimate of γ .


5. Conclusions

This paper provides quantitative evidence from KwaZulu-Natal on the extent to which funerals

place households at risk, taking potentially productive resources and turning them into

consumption (coffins, meat, groceries). In addition, in a quarter of all funerals for individuals

who died between 2003 and 2005 in the DSA, households borrowed money for the funeral,

which can be anticipated to drain household resources well into the future. Our point estimates

suggest that households are expected to spend a third of household income on funerals, in

addition to the spending expected given the status of the deceased.

       These results do not lead us to optimism on the impact of the AIDS crisis on the future

economic wellbeing of South Africans. Recent evidence from Demographic and Health Surveys

suggests that fertility rates may not have fallen in response to the AIDS crisis in the manner

suggested by Young (2005). (See Fortson 2008, and Juhn, Kalemli-Ozcan and Turan 2008.) To

this, we add evidence that households are taking what, in other circumstances, could be

productive capital and using it on coffins, meat and groceries to bury their dead.

       Such elaborate funerals are unlikely to be sustainable, if the AIDS pandemic continues to

take lives at such a rapid rate. New norms may develop. According to the BBC, the king of

neighboring Swaziland put a ban on lavish funerals

       13
         This estimate is smaller than that yielded by reduced form (0.56), however the latter is
imprecisely estimated, and we cannot reject that the estimates are the same.

                                                                                              20
(http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/2082281.stm). In South Africa, there is qualitative

evidence that some communities have tried to set new norms, but these norms are often not

acceptable to extended family who come in from far away to attend the funeral. The South

African Council of Churches has called repeatedly for “appropriate and affordable” funerals.

(See, for example, http://www.sacc.org.za/docs/AnRept05.pdf .) However, movement in this

direction has been quite slow. Indeed, our findings suggest that households forced to borrow

money to pay for funerals do not shade their funeral spending significantly: an indicator that

money was borrowed for the funeral is not a significant predictor of funeral spending.

Understanding coordination failures between communities, or among members of extended

households, will be important if there is to be an effective response working toward smaller, less

expensive funerals.

Note: When the IAD sample is restricted to those who were 18 and older (employment
variables), the sample size is 2840. Information on education comes from the first socio-
economic survey (HSE1). IAD sample is restricted to deaths that occurred between January 2003
and December 2005.

Notes: Cost of the funeral are those not covered by a burial society or funeral policy. These
include funeral purchases made with money received from a burial society or funeral policy at
the time of the death. The number of observations in each mean varies because respondents
sometimes did not know whether items were purchased. (For example, 3682 respondents knew
whether meat was purchased; 3666 knew whether a tent was rented.)

Notes: Cost of the funeral are those not paid for by a burial society or funeral policy. These
include funeral purchases made with money received from a burial society or funeral policy at
the time of the death. Sixteen observations were not used in calculating mean sum borrowed,
conditional on borrowing, because either two borrowing sources were mentioned (5 cases), or
none of our categories was mentioned (11 cases).

         Notes: OLS regressions with robust standard errors in parentheses. Unobservables are clustered
         at the homestead level. All regressions include year of death indicators, a complete set of age
         indicators by 10-year age categories and an indicator that age at death was missing (5 cases).
         Omitted category for relationship of the deceased to current head of household includes parents,
         spouse and children. ‘Other’ relationships are: siblings, grandparents, grandchildren, sons- or
         daughters-in-law, other family and individuals not related to the current head of household.
         Household characteristics in columns 2, 4, 6 and 8 are household size, household asset holdings
         and the maximum number of years of education in the household (all measured in 2001).
