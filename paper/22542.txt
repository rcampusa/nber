Are Publicly Insured Children Less Likely to be Admitted to Hospital than the Privately Insured
(and Does it Matter)?

JEL No. I13

                                           ABSTRACT

There is continuing controversy about the extent to which publicly insured children are treated
differently than privately insured children, and whether differences in treatment matter. We show
that on average, hospitals are less likely to admit publicly insured children than privately insured
children who present at the ER and the gap grows during high flu weeks, when hospital beds are
in high demand. This pattern is present even after controlling for detailed diagnostic categories
and hospital fixed effects, but does not appear to have any effect on measurable health outcomes
such as repeat ER visits and future hospitalizations. Hence, our results raise the possibility that
instead of too few publicly insured children being admitted during high flu weeks, there are too
many publicly and privately insured children being admitted most of the time.

       Inequalities in income and inequalities in health are clearly associated: In particular,

there is little doubt that poverty is associated with bad health outcomes. Yet, the extent to which

the relationship is causal is controversial because causality could run in either direction and

inference is often clouded by omitted variables. The existing literature is critiqued in Deaton

(2001), Deaton and Lubotsky, 2003, and Deaton and Paxson (2001, 2004). These studies show

that the relationship between income inequality and health inequality in aggregate data can

disappear or even change sign depending on what else is included in the models. They make a

strong case for careful investigations using individual-level data and research designs that can

help to deal with potential confounding. This study continues this line of research by

investigating the health effects of income-based inequalities in children’s access to health care

using unique longitudinal individual-level data.

       In the U.S., most poor and near-poor children are covered by public health insurance

under either Medicaid or SCHIP (State Child Health Insurance Program) while other children are

covered by private health insurance policies offered by their parent’s employers. Previous

research has shown that for uncovered children, gaining access to public health insurance

improved utilization of care and health outcomes (Currie and Gruber, 1996a,b; Dafny and

Gruber, 2005; Selden and Hudson, 2006; Howell and Kenney, 2012; Meyer and Wherry, 2012;

Brown et al., 2014). However, concerns about unequal access to care and disparities in health

outcomes between those with public and private insurance are of long standing and remain

unresolved.

       It is difficult to tell whether patients with different types of insurance are being treated

equally. For example, systematic differences in the unobserved characteristics of publicly and

privately insured patients could drive any observed differences in treatment. Publicly insured
patients may also be needier, since on average they come from families with lower income and

education, factors that are independently associated with poorer health. Moreover, publicly

insured patients may be more likely to delay medical attention, and so may be in worse health

when they do seek care. On the other hand, if publicly insured patients use hospital Emergency

Rooms (ERs) as a source of routine care, then they may be less sick on average when they

present at the ER (Gindi and Jones, 2014).

       There may also be differences between publicly and privately insured patients in the

extent to which they are likely to push back against the receipt of unnecessary care. There seems

to be an unspoken assumption in much of the literature that the publicly insured should receive

the same care as the privately insured. But it is possible that in many cases, the privately insured

are over-treated and that less care is actually better. This possibility is especially relevant for

hospitalization, which is costly, can be traumatic for both children and families, and exposes

patients to the risk of hospital acquired infections and other hazards.

       We investigate the issue of differential treatment of patients by insurance status using a

unique data set based on the health records of all children between three months and 13 years of

age who ever presented at a New Jersey hospital ER between 2006 and 2012. The first outcome

we examine is whether or not a child was admitted to hospital. We rely on exogenous variation

in the demand for hospital beds that is generated by local swings in the intensity of influenza

(flu) outbreaks in order to separately identify the effects of hospital and patient behavior. When

beds and other hospital resources are at a premium because of large influxes of adult flu patients,

we find that publicly insured children who present at the Emergency Room (ER) are less likely

to be admitted than in normal times. This result holds conditional on detailed diagnosis codes

and within hospitals.
       Our findings suggest that hospitals favor the privately insured for admission, especially

when they are capacity constrained. However, rather than the poor being unjustly denied care

when hospital beds are scarce, it could be that both privately and publicly insured children are

receiving too many hospitalizations when beds are plentiful. We attempt to distinguish between

these two scenarios by examining the effects of reductions in the probability of hospitalization

during high flu weeks on subsequent ER visits and hospitalizations. We find that for the publicly

insured, the marginal child who visits an ER during a high flu week is no more likely than a child

who visits during normal times to reappear at the ER (or any other ER in New Jersey) within 14

days (or within 30 days). They are also no more likely to be admitted to hospital within the same

time windows. These findings suggest that perhaps too many publicly insured children are

admitted in normal times (and by extension, privately insured children who have even higher

admission rates), rather than too few publicly-insured children being admitted in high flu weeks.

If unnecessary hospitalizations are common, then they may be imposing substantial costs both on

individual children and families, and on the public programs that pay for their care.

       The rest of our paper proceeds as follows. We first discuss the background literature

about the effects of public and private insurance. We then provide an overview of our data and

research methods. Results are presented in section 5, and section 6 provides a discussion and

conclusions.



2. Background

       While some have argued that public insurance is worse than no insurance at all, there is

little evidence to support this view (Gottlieb, 2011; Mocan, 2015). The uninsured fare worse on

most measures of access to care (Institute of Medicine, 2001). However, the question of whether
publicly insured U.S. children on Medicaid or the State Child Health Insurance Program

(SCHIP) have worse access to care than the privately insured continues to be controversial.

Since Medicaid/SCHIP typically reimburses providers at lower rates than private health

insurance plans, many doctors do not accept patients with public insurance or limit the number of

these patients in their practices (Sloan, Mitchell, and Cromwell, 1978; Mitchell, 1991; Fossett et

al., 1992; Newacheck et al., 1998; Decker, 2012). Nevertheless, a recent Department of Health

and Human Services report concluded that privately and publicly insured children were similarly

likely to have had a primary care visit in the past year (DHHS, 2012), a finding that is echoed in

another recent study (Kenney and Coyer, 2012).

       There may, however, be more subtle ways in which Medicaid/SCHIP children suffer

worse access. For example, Kenney and Coyer (2012) found that publicly-insured patients were

less likely to have a usual source of care with non-standard hours, which is one reason why these

patients may be more likely to use emergency rooms for primary care (Garcia, 2010; Kangovi,

2013; Rhodes, 2013). A great deal of concern has also focused on inferior access to specialist

care, which could lead to less preventive care and more medical emergencies (Bisgaier and

Rhodes, 2011; Skinner and Mayer, 2007; U.S. GAO 2011; Wang et al., 2004).

       Much less research has been devoted to the question of access to hospital care. Merrick

et al. (2001) study children who were admitted to the hospital for asthma in California, Georgia,

and Michigan. They find that publicly insured children received inpatient care of similar quality

to privately insured children, conditional on being admitted. There is some evidence that

children with public health insurance are more likely to be admitted to hospital than children

without insurance (Dafny and Gruber, 2005). However, it is not known whether the publicly
insured are more or less likely to be admitted than the privately insured, other things being equal,

or whether any differences in admission probabilities have effects on health outcomes.

        Finally, there have been consistent concerns that many pediatric hospitalizations are

unnecessary. Kemper (1988) conducted a retroactive assessment of visits to the University of

Wisconsin Hospital and found that 21.4% of admissions were inappropriate. Shorter admissions

were especially likely to be judged inappropriate (29%). Goodman et al. (1994) found that

pediatric patients in zip codes with high per capita bed supply had 9% more admissions than

children in areas with lower per capita bed supply. These findings suggest that many hospital

admissions may not be beneficial to patients.



3. Data

        The hospital discharge data come from the New Jersey Uniform Billing Records, which

cover 2006-2012. Since our focus is on admission through the emergency room, our estimation

sample consists of all records from general medical and surgical hospitals where the patient spent

time in the emergency room (regardless of whether they were eventually admitted); that is, we

include all records where there is an emergency room revenue code on the billing record. As we

are particularly interested in how insurance type interacts with admission decisions for children,

we further narrow our sample to visits where the patient is aged between three months and

thirteen years. We exclude children under three months old, as the hospital experiences of infants

(both in terms of realized experience and professional recommendations) is very different from

that of older children. 1



1We expect very young children to not contribute much to our estimates, as congestion effects should be the most
prominent for hospital visits that are marginal to admission. In the online appendix we exclude children less than
one, and the results are nearly identical as in our main specification.
       Figure 1 shows the age distribution of our sample, separately for publicly and privately

insured children, for all ER visits (panel 1) and for admitted visits (panel 2). Figure 1 shows a

very strong age-pattern for visits and admissions – younger children are more likely than older

children to be admitted (this pattern is also reflected in admission rates in Figure 10). Also, after

about two years of age, there are more privately insured than publicly insured children appearing

in the ER (and being admitted). This pattern is due in part to a continuously increasing

probability of being privately insured with age, as shown in Figure 2. However, even among the

oldest children in our sample, over 30% are covered by public health insurance.


       We are able to create a patient-level panel of hospital visits by matching patient records

across visits by sex, date of birth, and first and last names. This process creates a unique patient

identifier that allows us to follow each child over time and across hospitals. This feature is a

particular strength of our data, as we can follow patients after their hospital visit, and see if they

later returned to any hospital ER in New Jersey. This matching was performed on site in

Trenton, and the data was then de-identified. The matching algorithm does a good job of

catching slight misspellings, without lumping together people who appear to be separate

individuals based on a manual inspection. More details on the matching process and the quality

of the algorithm can be found in the online appendix.


       The hospital discharge data include up to three detailed payer code variables for each

visit (primary, secondary, and tertiary), which reflect the specific type of insurance used. Each

payer code is classified into seven payer types: Medicare, Medicaid, Commercial, Blue Cross,

Health Management Organizations (HMO), Self-Pay, and other. We re-categorize this

information into two groups based on the primary payer: The first category, “public”, consists of

Medicaid (Medicaid and Medicaid HMOs), NJ FamilyCare (New Jersey’s State Children’s
Health Insurance Program (SCHIP)), and the indigent. Indigent children make up just 1.16% of

the public insurance category, and all results are robust to their exclusion. We include them in

the public category because their expenses are likely to eventually be paid by public insurance

even if they are not publicly insured at the time of admission. The “private” category consists of

Blue Cross, non Medicaid/NJ FamilyCare HMOs, and other commercial insurers. Those with

military insurance (CHAMPUS) are classified as “private” since their coverage is similar to that

of the privately insured (CHAMPUS makes up 1.26% of the private insurance category). One

strength of the data is that we can identify both Medicaid fee-for-service and Medicaid HMO

patients as publicly insured patients. Further details about the construction of the categories and

about Medicaid and SCHIP rules in New Jersey can be found in the online appendix. 2


         The hospital discharge data also include detailed diagnosis information for each visit, in

the form of International Classification of Diseases, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnosis

codes. In order to control flexibly for diagnosis (and for severity within broad diagnosis groups),

we use the following grouping procedure. We start out at the most disaggregated level of the

ICD-9-CM codes, and record both the number of visits and admission rates within each group. If

there are more than 100 visits in the diagnosis group, and if the admission rate is between 5%

and 95%, a dummy for the diagnosis code is included. If there are less than 100 visits, we

aggregate up a level, and repeat the procedure, and continue the process until we are at the most

aggregated level of diagnosis. Finally, we create categories that denote diagnoses with less than

5% admission rates, diagnoses with greater than 95% admission rates, and diagnoses with less




2The Affordable Care Act (ACA) is unlikely to affect our sample of children, as it primarily targeted adults, and the
main components were implemented after 2012. That being said, the early portions of the ACA could indirectly
affect the admission rates of children (e.g. through changes in hospital congestion). However, when we exclude
2010-2012 from our main sample, we find nearly identical results in the pre-reform period (online appendix).
than 100 visits when aggregated to the highest level. In the end, we are left with 415 diagnosis

group dummy variables.


       While children in our data are being treated for a wide range of conditions, the bulk of the

visits for which admission is a real possibility are accounted for by relatively few diagnoses.

Figures 3 and 4 list the top twenty most common diagnosis categories for all emergency room

visits and admitted visits, respectively. Up to thirteen additional diagnoses may be recorded, but

as most children just have one reported diagnosis, we control for the number of secondary

diagnoses rather than including additional dummy variables for the secondary diagnosis

categories. Figure 3 shows that most ER visits are for conditions with very low rates of

hospitalization (such as a sprained ankle). The second panel focuses on diagnoses with higher

rates of hospitalization and indicates that of these, the most common reasons for visiting the ER

are “other;” unspecified noninfectious gastroenteritis and colitis (ICD-9-CM code 558.9); asthma

not otherwise specified with acute exacerbation (ICD-9-CM code 493.91); pneumonia, organism

not otherwise specified (ICD-9-CM code 486); urinary tract infection not otherwise specified

(ICD-9-CM code 599.0); acute bronchiolitis due to other infectious organism (ICD-9-CM code

466.19); and dehydration (ICD-9-CM code 276.51).


       Figure 4 shows that the top diagnostic categories for hospitalizations are similar to the

top ER visit categories, with asthma, bronchiolitis, pneumonia, non-infectious gastroenteritis and

dehydration again appearing prominently. Other important categories include acute appendicitis

not otherwise specified (ICD-9-CM code 540.9) and bronchiolitis due to other infectious

organisms (ICD-9-CM code 466.11).
       One reason for privately insured children to have higher admission rates is that they are

being treated for different conditions. However, Figure 5 shows that even conditional on

particular diagnoses, privately insured children tend to have higher admission rates. Figure 5

ranks diagnoses by the admission rates of the publicly insured, and then plots the admission rates

of the privately insured for each diagnosis for comparison. The size of the dots corresponds to

the number of visits in the category. One can see an overall tendency for the dots representing

privately insured patients with a particular diagnosis to lie above those for the publicly insured,

an effect that is particularly pronounced for asthma admissions and in the tails of the distribution.


       We construct weekly information about the intensity of influenza from the discharge

data, using patients aged 18 and over. By using patients 18 and over, we avoid the possibility

that children sick with the flu could crowd out other sick children with less severe conditions

(leading to increases in child admission in some categories and decreases in others). Figure 6

shows the number of adult flu cases per week in the hospital data over our sample period, and

Figure 7 shows flu intensity using the CDC “influenza-like-illness” measure for the mid-Atlantic

region. Both figures are dominated by the several large spikes in the number of cases due to the

H1N1 epidemic of 2009. The two time-series track each other quite well, making us confident

that we are indeed able to pick up variation in the strength and intensity of flu seasons using the

hospital discharge data.


       The main advantage of constructing a measure of flu intensity from the hospital discharge

data is that we can create local measures of influenza intensity based on the patient's zip code,

rather than using regional data for the entire northeast. As we will show, there is considerable

variation in the timing and intensity of flu shocks across different regions in New Jersey. For

each zip code-week, the flu variable is the inverse-distance-weighted average of flu cases per
hospital bed at nearby hospitals. We define nearby hospitals as those within a ten-mile radius of

each zip code centroid (though as the measure is inverse-distance-weighted, the 10 mile

boundary ends up playing a very small role). Figure 8 shows the locations of New Jersey

hospitals, as well as examples of the zip code-level hospital markets that are used to construct the

flu intensity variable. One can see that hospitals are most plentiful in the heavily populated

northeast of the state, and along the interstate-95 highway corridor from New York to

Philadelphia.


        Even within the small state of New Jersey, there is a lot of variation in the timing and

intensity of flu outbreaks, especially relative to the number of available hospital beds. Figure 9

demonstrates this variation, by plotting the inverse-distance-weighted flu intensity measure over

time in two different zip codes. Remarkably, there are almost twice as many flu cases per

available hospital bed in Trenton during peak flu weeks as there are in New Brunswick, only 26

miles away. Moreover, in Trenton the last wave of the H1N1 flu season was the most severe,

whereas in New Brunswick, the last wave was less severe than the first spike in H1N1 cases. It

is possible that these differences reflect variations in vaccination rates in different populations in

New Jersey, with African Americans and poorer people being less likely to be vaccinated than

more affluent whites. Unfortunately, however, little reliable information about vaccination rates

is available.


        In Figure 10, we relate flu intensity to differential admission rates for publicly and

privately insured children. The figure shows that privately insured children tend to have similar

age-specific admission rates whether it is a high flu or a low flu week. However, publicly

insured children over three years old are clearly less likely to be admitted in weeks when the

local hospital flu burden is high.
       One reason for publicly and privately insured children to be treated differently is that

hospitals tend to receive larger payments from private insurers. While list charges are available

for all observations, billing charges (the amount the hospital actually bills the insurer) are not

well reported. In fact, most hospitals report the same number for the list charge and the billing

charge. Billing charges are sensitive information; hospitals negotiate rates with insurers, and

may not want insurers to know the amount other insurers are being charged for the same service.

However, eight hospitals in New Jersey do report billing charges. These charges are consistently

much lower than the list charges as one would expect given that insurers negotiate deep

discounts from the list prices.

       We use billing data from these eight hospitals to explore the differences between list and

actual charges for Medicaid and privately insured patients, and to model the expected difference

between list and actual charges in the other 65 New Jersey hospitals. We do this by estimating

the following model using the eight hospitals that report billing data:



𝐵𝑖𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝐶ℎ𝑔𝑖𝑡 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑖𝑡 + 𝛽2 age2𝑖𝑡 + 𝛽3 𝑎𝑛𝑦 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑐𝑒𝑑𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑖𝑡 + 𝛽4 𝑤ℎ𝑖𝑡𝑒𝑖𝑡

               + 𝛽5 𝑏𝑙𝑎𝑐𝑘𝑖𝑡 + 𝛽6 ℎ𝑖𝑠𝑝𝑎𝑛𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑡 + 𝛽7 𝑓𝑒𝑚𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑖𝑡 + 𝛽8 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑣. 𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑝𝑖𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑦 𝑣𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑡

               + 𝛽9 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑣. 𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑝𝑖𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑦 ℎ𝑜𝑠𝑝𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑧𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑖𝑡 + 𝛽10 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑣. 𝑛𝑜𝑛𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑝𝑖𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑦 𝑣𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑡

               + 𝛽11 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑣. 𝑛𝑜𝑛𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑝𝑖𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑦 ℎ𝑜𝑠𝑝𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑧𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑖𝑡 + 𝛽12 𝑙𝑖𝑠𝑡 𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒 𝐵𝐶𝑖𝑡

               + 𝛼𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑦 𝑝𝑎𝑦𝑒𝑟 𝑡𝑦𝑝𝑒 + α𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑔𝑛𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑠 + 𝛼𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟 + α𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑡ℎ + α𝑑𝑎𝑦 𝑜𝑓 𝑤𝑒𝑒𝑘 + 𝜀𝑖𝑡



where age is age in days; any procedure is an indicator equal to one if the child received any

procedure; the variables female, white, black, and hispanic denote characteristics of the child; the

next four variables control for the child’s previous medical history (in order to take account of
the fact that patient population varies between hospitals); list charge BC refers to the mean list

charge for a child with no procedures and Blue Cross as the payer (in order to control for how

expensive the hospital is) and the alphas denote vectors of fixed effects for payer type, diagnosis,

year, month, and day of the week of the admission.

           After estimating this regression, we use it to predict billing charges for the whole sample.

This model does a good job of explaining the variation in billing charges for admitted patients,

with an adjusted R-squared of 0.50. It has a harder time fitting the variation in billing charges for

patients who are not admitted, and the adjusted R-squared drops to 0.11. For our purposes,

however, being able to predict billing charges for admitted patients is the most important, as this

is what determines incentives for admission. Note that all charges are expressed in real 2010

dollars.

           In figure 11 we first show average list charges for publicly and privately insured patients.

Within a hospital, all of the patients receiving the same procedure should have the same list

charge. Figure 11 indicates that list charges are systematically higher for publicly insured

patients than for privately insured patients at the same age. This gap may indicate that these

patients are sicker on average, since they are receiving more services.

           Figure 12 uses the predicted billing charges to explore differences in the payments

hospitals are likely to receive for treating publicly and privately insured patients. It is clear that

the private insurers are typically more generous, regardless of whether the patient is admitted or

not. When the hospital has the capacity, then it will take both private and public patients.

However, when beds are in short supply, hospitals have a clear reason to prefer privately insured

patients.
       Table 1 provides further information on patient characteristics by insurance type and flu

intensity at the time of their ER visit. On average, 43 percent of children are covered by public

insurance, and the average admission rate is 4.7 percent (Column 1). Columns 2 and 3 show the

average differences between visits in high flu and low flu weeks (defining high/ low flu as zip

code-weeks above/below the 90th percentile of zip code-weeks). Visits during high flu weeks are

broadly similar to low flu weeks, though with more flu cases and lower admission rates for non-

flu visits, which is consistent with some rationing of beds in high flu weeks. Columns 4 through

9 further disaggregate the sample by insurance type. Privately insured children are less racially

and ethnically diverse than publicly insured children, and live in lower income zip codes. In

addition, privately insured children have higher raw admission rates (column 5 versus column 8)

— a disparity which rises during high flu weeks.



4. Empirical Specification


       We have seen that the publicly insured are on average less likely to be admitted than the

privately insured. In order to investigate this phenomenon more formally, we estimate the effect

of insurance type on admission rates:




(1)    𝐴𝑑𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑖𝑡 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 𝐈[public]𝒊𝒕 + 𝜷𝑋𝑖𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖𝑡




where 𝐴𝑑𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑖𝑡 is an indicator variable equal to one if the child is admitted, 𝐈[public]𝒊𝒕 is an

indicator variable equal to 1 if the child is publicly insured, and the vector Xit includes dummies

for age in months (which control very flexibly for changes in admission by age), dummy
variables for the detailed diagnosis codes, the number of diagnosis codes listed, year, month, and

day of week; median income in the child’s zip code (from the ACS); and the child’s gender, race,

and ethnicity (white, black, Hispanic). In some specifications, we additionally control for

hospital fixed effects.


       A limitation of (1) is that the publicly insured may face different admission rates than the

privately insured because of differences in their unobserved characteristics rather than because of

insurance status per se. Thus, we additionally examine whether a shock to the demand for

hospital beds due to idiosyncratic spatial and temporal variation in flu severity exacerbates the

disparity in admission rates. One can think of the variation in demand tracing out the supply of

beds available to children as a function of the type of health insurance.


       We implement this idea by estimating the effect of flu intensity, interacted with insurance

type, on admission rates:


(2)

 𝐴𝑑𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑖𝑧𝑡 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 𝐈[public]𝒊𝒕 + 𝛽2 𝑓𝑙𝑢 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑦𝑧𝑡 + 𝛽3 (𝐈[public]𝒊𝒕 ∗ 𝑓𝑙𝑢 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑦𝑧𝑡 )

                 + 𝜷𝑋𝑖𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖𝑧𝑡




where 𝑓𝑙𝑢 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑦𝑧𝑡 measures the inverse-distance-weighted number of flu cases per hospital

beds within 10 miles of a patient's zip code, and all other variables are defined as in equation 1.

The parameter of interest in equation (2) is β3, which measures the differential effect of high flu

intensity on the publicly insured. A negative value of β3 indicates that publicly insured children

are less likely to be admitted when demand for beds is high.
        We estimate several versions of equations (1) and (2). We first look at children with flu

diagnoses, and then at the full sample of all non-flu visits (visits where the primary diagnosis is

not flu). We then use the same specifications to investigate the effect of flu intensity on total list

charges (a measure of the value of the procedures the child actually received that should be

unaffected by insurance coverage since the type of insurance normally determines discounts

from the list price), the probability that a child returns to the emergency room within 14 or 30

days, and the probability a child returns to the emergency room and is admitted within 14 or 30

days.




5. Results

        Table 2 shows our initial estimates of (1) and (2) first for ER visits with a flu diagnosis

listed, and then for all other diagnoses. On average, 9.6% of children presenting with flu are

hospitalized, but column 1 shows that publicly insured children are less likely to be admitted

than the privately insured. Column 2 shows that even children with flu are less likely to be

hospitalized in high flu weeks, suggesting that there are real constraints on the availability of

beds at these times. The insignificant coefficient on the interaction term shows that there is

however no significant differential effect of high flu weeks on the probability that publicly

insured children with flu are admitted to hospital.

        Column 3 of Table 2 shows that overall, about 4.7 percent of non-flu visits result in a

hospital admission, and that publicly insured children are 0.24 percentage points less likely to be

admitted than privately insured children with the same demographic characteristics, diagnoses,

and time of visit. Overall, our equation (1) explains about 35% of the variation in admission

probabilities for all non-flu diagnoses. Column 4 shows that including hospital fixed effects
actually raises the admission penalty associated with public insurance, which suggests that there

is more difference within hospitals than across hospitals.

       Columns 5 and 6 show estimates of equation (2) which add the controls for the number of

flu cases per bed locally, and the interaction of this variable with the indicator for public health

insurance. The main effect of public insurance remains much the same as in the corresponding

specifications in columns 3 and 4. The coefficient on flu cases per bed shows that, as expected,

children are generally less likely to be admitted in high flu seasons. Table 1 shows that the mean

number of flu cases per bed in the top decile of flu weeks is 0.093. Multiplying this number by

the coefficient of -0.0111 on flu cases per bed in column 5 suggests that the probability of being

admitted declines by 0.001 in high flu weeks on a baseline of 0.047, a relatively small effect.

However, for the publicly insured, the decline in admissions is three times larger in high flu

weeks at 0.003, reducing admission probabilities from 4.7 to 4.4 percent. This represents a

reduction of about 9,700 child hospital admissions among the publicly insured. The coefficients

in column 5, with hospital fixed effects, also suggest a public insurance penalty on admissions,

which grows larger in high flu weeks.



b) Effects on List Charges

        Table 3 examines the effect of public insurance on total list charges. We use total list

charges because list charges are generally independent of insurance status, and so any difference

reflects differences in the quantities and types of services received rather differences in price per

service actually charged. Column 1 shows that the list charges per ER visit are $107.85 cheaper

for publicly insured children, which is consistent with their lower probability of being admitted

even within hospital. Column 2 shows that list charges fall even more steeply in high flu weeks.
At the “high flu” mean cases per bed of 0.093, the coefficient of -560.86 translates into charges

that are an additional $52.15 lower per visit. The coefficient on the interaction between public

insurance and flu cases per bed indicates that list charges are even lower (by $62.22) for the

publicly insured in high flu weeks. Thus, column 2 suggests that within hospitals, publicly

insured children run up lower list charges that the privately insured, consistent with being less

likely to be admitted, and that this differential is greater in high flu weeks.



c) Effects on Future ER Visits and Hospitalizations

               The results discussed so far raise an important question: Are the publicly insured

receiving too few hospitalizations? It is at least possible that the privately insured are receiving

too many hospitalizations. It may be the case that public insurers and parents of publicly insured

children are less likely to decline unnecessary hospitalizations. Clearly these alternative

scenarios have very different implications for public policy.

       One way to try to distinguish between these stories is to examine health outcomes. If

children who need hospitalization are being turned away, then we should expect them to return to

the ER and/or to be hospitalized soon after. Tables 4 and 5 examine these outcomes, where the

variable “return to ER” is equal to one if a child shows up back in a New Jersey emergency room

soon after the initial visit, and future hospital admissions are similarly defined as a child being

admitted in a New Jersey hospital within a short window after the initial visit. The first row of

Table 4 shows that publicly insured children who present in the ER are more likely than privately

insured children to return to the ER. As the window of observation is extended from 14 to 30

days (comparing columns 1 and 2 to columns 3 and 4) this effect grows. This main effect may

reflect the subset of publicly insured children who tend to use ERs as a source of primary care.
        The second row of Table 4 shows that in weeks with many flu cases per bed, children are

more likely to return to the ER within 14 days, though less likely to return within 30 days. The

14 day estimate suggests that hospitals are genuinely capacity constrained during high flu weeks

and that some children who are not admitted when they first present at the ER need hospital care.

The negative effect at 30 days may reflect seasonality in flu in that high flu weeks may be

followed by low flu weeks in later months (as in Figures 6, 7, and 9).

        Turning to the key interaction term between flu cases per bed and public health

insurance, the estimated coefficient is not statistically significant. This means that although we

have established above that publicly insured kids are less likely to be hospitalized in high flu

weeks, this reduction in hospitalization apparently has no effect on the probability of returning to

the ER at either 14 days or 30 days following the initial visit.

        Similarly, Table 5 shows that although there is a very small positive main effect of public

insurance on future hospital admissions within 14 days or 30 days of the index visit, there is no

significant of the interaction of flu cases per bed and public insurance on future admission

probabilities.

        Together these null results on future ER visits and admissions suggest that the reductions

in hospitalizations among the publicly insured during high flu seasons have no adverse effect on

their health. In turn, this finding suggests that a real problem for the publicly insured, at least in

terms of their treatment at hospitals, may be that they are too likely to be admitted when

hospitals have excess capacity rather than being too likely not to be hospitalized during high flu

seasons when beds are in high demand.
d) Robustness checks

       Our preferred measures of a child returning to the ER or to be admitted do not require

that the return visit be in the same diagnosis group as the original visit. We use this broad

measure rather than requiring the return visit to be within the same ICD-9-CM code because the

codes are quite narrow, and complications that may arise from not being admitted would not

necessarily be recorded in the same code as the original visit. The downside to using this broad

measure is that we are likely picking up some noise from children who return to the hospital for

reasons completely unrelated to the index visit---for example, if they were involved in a car

accident. In the online appendix we explore this issue, first by excluding return visits with injury

codes as the primary diagnosis (ICD-9-CM 800-957), and second by looking only at visits within

the broad category of diseases of the respiratory system (ICD-9-CM codes 460-519). In both

cases, we continue to find null results, suggesting that any bias introduced into our main

estimates by unrelated hospital visits following in quick succession is minimal.

       Finally, while our main estimates report the average effect across all patient types, there

is also scope for heterogeneity, especially with respect to types of diagnoses. In the online

appendix, we rerun our analysis separately on visits for diagnoses with mid-range admission

rates (5-95%) and low admission rates (less than 5%). Since doctors treating patients in

diagnoses with mid-range admission rates face a more real choice over admission, we expect to

find larger negative effects on the likelihood of admission for publicly insured children with mid-

range admission rates during high flu times---and indeed we find a nearly identical pattern of

results, with point estimates 15-30% larger than in the full sample. However, we still find no

effect of these lower admission rates on health outcomes, as measured by the probability that the

children return to the ER or are admitted to the hospital soon after the initial visit. Conversely,
we find negative but small and statistically insignificant congestion effects for publicly insured

children with low admission rate diagnoses, which makes sense as very few of these children are

likely to be on the margin of admission.


6. Discussion and Conclusions:

       There is continuing controversy about the extent to which publicly insured children are

treated differently than privately insured children, and whether differences in treatment matter.

We show that on average, hospitals are less likely to admit publicly insured children than

privately insured children who present at the ER. This pattern is present even after controlling

for detailed diagnostic categories, suggesting that it is not simply a matter of publicly insured

patients being less sick on average. Controlling for hospital fixed effects increases the size of the

public insurance “penalty”, suggesting that it cannot be explained by differences between the

hospitals used by the privately and publicly insured. Another possibility is that the privately

insured are simply more profitable than the publicly insured, so that providers prefer to admit

privately insured patients, other things being equal. A related hypothesis is that the privately

insured (or their insurers) are more likely to accept unnecessary hospitalizations. Since

unnecessary hospitalizations are costly both to society and to families, and may expose children

to unnecessary risks, it is important to distinguish between these possibilities.

       We explore these questions using variation provided by influenza epidemics. The flu

increases demand for hospital beds in a way that varies across both time and space. And given

that we focus on adult influenza cases, these demands are arguably exogenous to other factors

that affect children’s probability of being hospitalized for conditions other than flu.

       We show that the difference between the probability that privately insured children are

hospitalized and the probability that publicly insured children are hospitalized is larger in high
flu weeks. This result suggests that hospitals prefer to fill available beds with privately insured

children, perhaps because they are more lucrative. One can think of the available beds being

allocated first to the privately insured, with any remaining beds being given to the publicly

insured. However, by itself this result cannot tell us whether it is good or bad for publicly

insured children to have a lower probability of hospitalization in high flu weeks.

       If publicly insured children were suffering from the reduction in admission probabilities

during high flu weeks, then we might expect to see evidence of harmful effects in the form of

returns to the ER and future hospital admissions. However, we see no such patterns. Hence, our

results raise the possibility that instead of too few publicly insured children being admitted

during high flu weeks, there are too many publicly and privately insured children being admitted

most of the time.

Notes: Patients aged 3 months to 13 years. High (low) flu denotes weeks where flu case per beds were above (below) the 90th percentile of
zip code-weeks. Flu cases per beds, by zip, is the inverse-distance-weighted average of the number of adult flu cases per beds of hospitals
within 10 miles of the patient’s zip code.

Appendix:

New Jersey Medicaid and CHIP Rules for Children

From state of NJ website and “Holding Steady, Looking Ahead: Annual Findings of a 50 State
Survey of Eligibility Rules, Enrollment and Renewal Procedures, and Cost Sharing Practices in
Medicaid and CHIP 2010-2011”

Eligibility

    •   The upper income limit of New Jersey’s combined Medicaid/SCHIP program is 350% of
        the FPL.
    •   Income eligibility limits for Medicaid are 200% FPL for children 0-1, 133% FPL for
        children 1-19. Income eligibility limit for CHIP is 350% FPL for children ages 0-19. The
        separate CHIP program is for children not eligible for Medicaid
            o Infants born to Mothers enrolled in Medicaid are covered up to 200% FPL;
                 infants born to non-Medicaid covered mothers are covered up to 185% FPL
            o Families above the 350% cut off for CHIP can buy into the program for a monthly
                 premium of $144. The child must have been uninsured for 6 months prior to
                 enrolling
    •   Pregnant women eligible for Medicaid at 185% FPL and CHIP at 200% FPL. An asset
        test is not required, and the program operates under presumptive eligibility. Pregnant
        immigrants are covered regardless of immigration status.
    •   There is the same eligibility system for Medicaid and CHIP


Application

    •   Streamlined application: there is a joint Medicaid/CHIP application, which requires no
        face-to-face interview or asset test. Applications are available online, and can be
        submitted electronically.


Enrollment

    •   Before enrollment in CHIP, a child must be uninsured for 3 months
    •   Streamlined enrollment: Medicaid and CHIP both operate on presumptive eligibility and
        use express lane eligibility for Medicaid and CHIP.
            o New Jersey implemented Express Lane Eligibility for Medicaid 5/1/09, and for
               CHIP 9/2012: “In an effort to avoid requiring families to provide the same
               information to multiple programs and to achieve administrative efficiencies, ELE
               allows states to use income and other eligibility findings from another assistance
               program as evidence of eligibility for Medicaid and CHIP. New Jersey uses data
              from NJ 1040 tax form.”
Renewal
   • Frequency of renewal for Medicaid/CHIP: 12 mo, no face to face interview required
         o There is a joint Medicaid/CHIP renewal form; Medicaid renewal uses the express
             lane since 5/1/09; CHIP in 2012
   • Both Medicaid and CHIP also have 12-month continuous eligibility
   • Disenrollment policies: grace period for non-payment is 60 days, with no lock-out period.
      To reenroll, must reapply for coverage and repay outstanding premiums.


Premiums and Copays

   •   Premiums in CHIP start at 201% FPL; copays start at 151% FLP
           o At 201% FPL premiums are about $40/mo, at 250% FPL $79/mo, at 301% FPL
                $133/mo
   •   Copays for services: At 151% FPL there is a $5 copay for non-preventive physician
       visits, $10 copay for ER visit, 0$ copay for inpatient. At 201% FPL the physician visit
       and inpatient visit copays stay the same, and ER goes up to $35
   •   Copays for drugs: At 151% $1 for generic, $5 for brand name; at 201% $5 for all.
 Information on Coding Medicaid/NJ FamilyCare HMOs:

 We categorize the payer information into two groups based on the primary payer: Medicaid, NJ
 FamilyCare, indigent, and other government (Medicaid, Medicaid HMOs, FamilyCare HMOs,
 Title XIX Medicaid, other government, and indigent which comes from the “other” category),
 and private (Commercial, Blue Cross, non Medicaid/FamilyCare HMOs, Champus, and New
 Jersey State Health Benefits).

 The HMO category is broken into Medicaid/FamilyCare and non-Medicaid/FamilyCare HMOs
 based on information about product lines from New Jersey HMO contracts. Six HMOs with
 Medicaid/NJ FamilyCare product lines were identified to be in operation during the time period.
 Four of these HMOs had no commercial product lines, and were easily classified as
 Medicaid/FamilyCare HMOs. The other two have both Medicaid/FamilyCare and Commercial
 product lines, and in the data there is no way to distinguish which patients are
 Medicaid/FamilyCare and which are not. All patients with these HMOs as primary payers were
 coded as Medicaid/FamilyCare, though some are likely private. The results are robust to whether
 these patients are coded as Medicaid/FamilyCare or private.

Information on the String Matching Algorithm

The matching algorithm creates a patient identifier by finding records with the same date of birth
and the same or very similar first and last names. Specifically, the Levenshtein edit distance is
used to match names, because of problems with typos and misspellings (stata command
strgroup). While it is possible that we are picking up a few cases of different people with the
same name and birthday, it does not seem to be a large problem. To examine the quality of the
matching algorithm, we looked all visits of children included in the main sample, during the age
window of 275 days around the first birthday.

The main worry is that there may be many children with similar names and the same birthday,
who are being aggregated by the algorithm. In order to assess whether this was a concern, we
looked at people with the most common first and last name combinations. We took first and last
name combinations that the algorithm assigned to at least eight children, and called this the
sample of “common names”.

In order to assess the match quality, we looked at the three-digit zip code of residence reported
for each visit. Of this sample of children with extremely common names, those with more than
ten visits reported all visits in the same three-digit zip code. This suggests that the algorithm did
not mistakenly aggregate people with common first and last name combinations – otherwise we
would expect the people with common name combinations and many visits to report multiple zip
codes. Of all people with these common names, 92.49% reported just one three-digit zip, 6.94%
reported two, and 0.58% reported three.

Furthermore, we manually inspected all patients in the top 1% of number of visits. None of these
children had “common names”, as defined above, and almost all reported either just one three-
digit zip code, or a combination of neighboring three digit zip codes.
