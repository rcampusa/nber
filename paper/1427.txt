perspective of the borrowing country. The first section sketches a formal

framework for optimal borrowing by a developing country, as seen from the

repudiation. The fifth section relates external   borrowing to macroeconomic

management of the borrowing country, and the sixth section pulls together the

many factors that suggest that external debt of a country should be subject to

central management or at least surveillance. Following that, we offer some

guidelines for limits to the magnitude of external debt, and then discuss the

character or mix of external debt. In an appendix, we present various

simalation exercises for optimal debt management in a discrete—time

Introduction

     External Debt has risen to the top of the agenda of international monetary

economics in recent years. This is partly because developing countries have

become much more dependent on external funding for their economic development

during the past decade than they were before, and partly because a growing

number of countries have experienced difficulties in servicing their external

debts since 1981. This paper addresses the question of external borrowing from

the perspective of the borrowing country, with a view to discovering principles

or guidelines that might be helpful to such countries in managing both the level

and the character of their external debt.

     The plan of the paper is as follows. The first section sketches a formal

framework for optimal borrowing by a developing country, as seen from a

planner's point of view. The next three sections use this framework for the

development of three important limits on external borrowing: the problem of

solvency, the problem of liquidity and the problem created by the possibility of

repudiation. The fifth section relates external borrowing to macroeconomic

management of the borrowing country, and the sixth section pulls together the

many factors that suggest that external debt of a country should be subject to

central management or at least surveillance. Following that, we offer some

guidelines for limits to the magnitude of external debt, and then discuss the
                                        —2—


character or mix of external debt. A brief concluding section pulls some of the

strands together.

       The   first four sections are more formal and algebraic in their approach to
the subject. That will appeal to some readers and offend others. It is offered
here not merely to appeal to those who prefer a formal approach to a subject
that   lends itself to formal analysis. It    also suggests a format that can be
adapted to the formal planning models used by many developing countries. An

appendix offers a numerical illustration of how the framework can he used.

The final four sections are written to be accessible to a wider audience, and to

offer some judgments on issues that are not fully covered in the more formal

treatment. Our discussion throughout on the links of borrowing and monetary

policies is necessarily brief, and we point the reader to Dornbusch's (198)4)

contribution in this volume for a detailed treatment.



Strategies for International Borrowing

       We approach the management of international borrowing as a formal problem

of dynamic resource allocation. (The formal approach taken here follows closely

the treatment in Sachs, 1982a and 198)4, wherein further details may be found.)

Admittedly, a formal approach may neglect some aspects of the borrowing

decision; we take up some of these in later sections. The formal approach,

however, has the advantage of showing how a quantitative assessment of borrowing

may be made using standard models of development planning. This section

illustrates how such development models can be used.

       All models of optimal borrowing have two features. First, they set out a
                                     —3—




dynamic budget constraint, which describes the country's long—term options with

respect to foreign borrowing.   Second, they specify a planning function or

social welfare function, which describes in a dynamic setting the desirability

of various possible paths for consumption and output over time.   The borrowing

problem is solved in a formal way by maximizing the social welfare function

subject to the dynamic budget constraint.

     We shall also insist upon a third feature, which is sometimes missing in

borrowing models, namely optimal implementation of a borrowing strategy. The

solution of a borrowing model typically yields a path of investment,

consumption, and foreign indebtedness that maximizes the social welfare

function. But, it may remain silent on what policies are needed to achieve that

path. Will the path result from decentralized market forces, with direct

private—sector access to foreign capital? Or does the path require active

government intervention in the borrowing process? In sum, in addition to

studying the correct path for borrowing, we must ask how that path may in fact

be reached.

     This section sets out the three key elements of the formal borrowing

problem: the budget constraint, the welfare function, and the instruments for

policy implementation. Later sections are devoted to a more refined treatment

of these elements that address special features of the actual borrowing

process.
                                      —It—



A.   The Dynamic Budget Constraint

     Many features of an economy determine how much and on what terms it may

borrow from the rest of the world. Potential lenders as well as equity

investors must assess the country's future ability and willingness to service

its external obligations. New credit may be limited because creditors doubt

that the economy can ever earn sufficient foreign exchange to repay a new loan.

In this case, the country is said to be rationed by a           constraint.

Alternatively, the country may   be deemed unsuitable for loans because of
short—run difficulties, even though its long—run prospects are bright. In this

case, the lending is bound by a liquidity constraint. Finally, the country may

have foreign exchange earnings sufficient to honor its obligations, but may be

deemed unwilling to do so, because debt repayment is too onerous or because it

is holding out for some sort of debt relief.    Lending may therefore be

constrained by repudiation risk.

     The country's capacity to borrow will therefore reflect creditors'

concerns about solvency, liquidity, and repudiation risk. The interaction of

these constraints determines the dynamic budget constraint facing an econormj.

For analytical simplicity, we consider each of these factors in turn. In

truth, a full model of optimal borrowing must consider them together.


     The Solvency Constraint

     Even assuming no liquidity or repudiation risks, country borrowing is

bound by its long—run capacity to service its debt. From the creditors' point

of view, long—run solvency does not mean that the debtor nation must have the
                                            —5—


prospect to become a creditor nation in the long—run (i.e. actually repay- its

debt). All that is required is that the debtor have the future resources to

service its debt, without the need to borrow forever in order to make interest

payments. To take two extreme cases, a $1 million loan has a market value of

zero if the debtor must forever borrow new money to service the loan, while the

loan is worth a $1 million if the country always services the debt out of its

own earnings, even though it never repays the principal.

        The country's resources for external debt servicing each period may be

measured by its trade surplus, TBt (when TBt < 0, the country is running a

trade deficit). If the maximum discounted sum of current and future trade
                            (i-t)
balances, max    .t(l+r)            TBt, is less than the current debt, the country

can never service the debt out of its own             resources   (r is the real interest

rate, assumed to be constant unless otherwise specified). It will have to

borrow forever, and in an amount growing at the real interest rate, in order to

continue debt servicing. Let Dt be the stock of debt at the end of period t—l,

so that (1+r)D is the debt due as of period t. The solvency constraint can be

stated simply as the requirement that:


                                       —(i—t)
             (l+r)D < max
(1)
                            =(1+i.)             TB.


       To gain some insight to (1), let us turn to the goods market. Suppose as a

first illustration that the country produces a single tradeable good, with real

GDP given by- Q. Output is a function of the capital stock Kt, with                      =
                                                                                             F(K).

d is the rate of depreciation and
                                                                       =
                                                                           (l_d)K
                                                                                    +
                                                                                        I'   where

Then, from (i)

The first term on the right—hand side of (2) is the maximum discounted sum of

Q. —    I.,   and nay be considered the productive wealth of the economy, in dynamic

terms. The second expression is the discounted sum of minimum consumption

expenditure. In words, the solvency constraint is that the economy's debt

      must be less than or equal to productive wealth net of minimum consumption

expenditure. For simplicity in the discussion that follows, we set              = 0 in

(2), and simply compare the external debt with the economy's productive wealth.

Re—introducing           in the later discussion is straightforward.

       If a country is always willing to repay its debt if it can repay it, and if

it can always borrow freely subject to the condition that it remain solvent,

then (i) or (2) defines the loan supply schedule to the country. In particular,

it can borrow to the point where (1+r)D just equals max
                                                                     =t(1+r)_(1t)(Qi_hi)
(ignoring •).       This    loan supply schedule is shown in Figure 1. We return

later to more refined measures of solvency, that take into account traded

versus non—traded goods, and the public versus private sectors.

       There are two important qualifications that must be added to equation (2)

and Figure 1. Note that if Q. —         I.   grows in the steady state at a rate n

greater than r, then the economy faces no solvency constraint. The sum

 =t(1+r)_(1_t)(Qi_hi) is infinite (i.e. the economy's productive wealth is

infinite). Starting from level of debt D, the economy has the future
                                       —8--




resources to repay the debt! Curiously, even if the win country is not

growing at a rate n greater than r, there nay be no solvency constraint if

lender countries are growing at n greater than r. This situation can arise if

creditors are always willing to make new loans to debtors to enable the debtor

to service its debt. In such a Ponzi scheme, the borrower's debt grows at the

rate of interest (and becomes infinite), but since the lenders' economies are

growing even faster, the debt remains a small (and even decreasing) fraction of

the creditors' wealth. As long as the creditors' economies are always growing

at n >   r,   such a Ponzi scheme is viable forever. The debtor cannot repay its

debt but never has to! No creditor calls in his loan, on the belief that future

lenders will keep the debtor afloat.2

     Note, therefore, that a rise in the real interest rate r above the growth

rates of debtor and creditor countries can have a profound effect on the

debtor's solvency constraint. When r is low, there may be no solvency

constraint on borrowing, while when r is high there surely is. Thus, the rise

in real interest rates after 19T9 may have severely jolted long—term

expectations about the debtor country's capacity to repay debt.


     The Liquidity Constraint

     In some theories, solvent countries can always borrow up to the point of

the solvency constraint. We suspect that a borrowing limit may be reached far

below the solvency limit, because creditors fear liquidity problems of heavily

indebted countries, and because they fear debt repudiation by these countries.

A liquidity constraint nay (but need not always) occur when a country owes more
                                        —9—



in a given period then it can service in the absence of new loans.

Specifically, if c percent of outstanding debt is coming due in period t,

amortization payments are cD and interest payments are rD, so that total debt

servicing is (r+a)Dt. It may well happen that (r+a)D exceeds
                                                                 Q   (especially
when       represents tradeable goods alone rather than total GDP), even though

(l+r)Dt         =t( r)_(1_t)(Qi_Ii). That is, the country faces a cash flow problem,.

though it is solvent by long—run criteria.

       In normal periods, such a country will be able to borrow (r+z)Dt —    in
order to honor its current debt service obligations. However, the loan markets

may not function well under a variety of circumstances, arid the country may find

itself unable to borrow. This rationing may result when each bank's lending

decisions are importantly affected by the actions of other banks. For example,

suppose that bank—capital regulations restrict each bank to make loans to the

country in amounts L less than L, where L <             —    Then, no single bank
                                              (r÷cL)D
can lend enough to the country to allow the country to honor its current debt

servicing. Two things can happen. Perhaps n banks will each make loans L such

that riL    (r+a)D -       They should be happy to do so, because the country is

fundamentally healthy (i.e. solvent).

       On the other hand, if each bank suspects.that other banks are not going to

make new loans, a panic may ensue. Assuming that no other banks are extending

loans, it is rational for each individual bank to stop as well since its loan

of size L is not big enough to keep the country solvent. Thus, two equilibria

are possible, one in which the country is able to refinance its debt and the

other in which it is forced into arrears by the inability to obtain new lending.
                                       —10—



Once the arrears appear, the banks may feel vindicated in their decisions to

pull out of new lending. It may become ever more difficult for the country to

attract new loans, and an eventual debt rescheduling or moratorium, injurious to

creditor and debtor alike umy, In time, be necessary-.

     There are several reasons other than bank—capital restrictions on new loans

why a panic might arise, some of which have been spelled out in other papers

(see Sachs, l981). A bank might be willing, individually, to loan the requisite

amount (r+a)Dt —     but only at a new interest rate r eh above the existing
rate r. The spread r —   r would   be necessary to compensate a new lender for

tying up a large fraction of bank capital. The rate r might be so high, therefore,

that a new loan at rate r pushes the country over the brink of insolvency.

Specifically, with a new loan Lt =
                                      (r+a)D
                                               -   at   rate r, indebtedness might

rapidly- rise above productive wealth. Once again, the individual bank would be

unwilling to lend in the event that the other banks also stop making loans.

     It is not hard to think of other reasons why banks may be happy to make

small loans as part of a group, but not large loans when standing alone. For

example, a syndicate may have stronger bargaining vis—a—vis a debtor country

then a single bank alone. A bank may- therefore fear to be the only lender

because it realizes that its future bargaining position vis—a—vls the debtor may

be weak. Also, banks may feel that they are more likely to enjoy central bank

protection from default risk if other banks are also involved in loans to a

defaulting country. The central bank might be content to let a single

irresponsible bank fail, as an example to others, but not to jeopardize the

banking system by letting several banks fail.
                                          —11—


     The upshot of liquidity risk is that credit rationing nay be far more

restrictive than the limits of Figure 1. Healthy countries with heavy

debt—servicing obligations can suddenly find the spigot turned of f, perhaps

requiring them to sake rather drastic short—run adjustments.


     Repudiation Risk

     Countries nay be unable to obtain new loans because there is little

confidence that the debtor will choose to repay the debt. To fix ideas, suppose

that the debtor country owes Dt, and has productive wealth        >      If the
country defaults, the creditors receive a fraction y of W1, perhaps by direct

confiscation of the debtor country's assets. Moreover, the creditors can impose

sanctions on the defaulting country in the amount OW. These sanctions include

the direct seizure of assets, YW, and other penalties that nay be costly to the

debtor without yielding direct benefits to the creditors. Generally, then, we

may assume that the sanctions exceed the payments to the creditors (0 >      y).
     Consider the default decision. A repudiation of debt yields a gain of

   and a loss of OW to the debtor, and a net loss to the creditor of D(l_Y).

For debtors and creditors within a closed economy, 0 is generally near 1.0,

since creditors can   use   the legal system to seize much of their debtors' assets

in the event of a repudiation. When 0 = 1, debt repudiation will make sense

only when    >        i.e. when the debtor is insolvent. In the international

setting, the seizure of assets on a large scale is very difficult and sanctions

such as trade embargoes against a defaulting country may have only limited

effect. Thus, 0 is generally much smaller than 1.0, so that it may     be   true that
                                        —12—



Dt > OW even when Dt is much less than W.

       The penalty function and institutional setting together determine the loan

supply schedule to a debtor country. In one extreme case, closer to 19th

century bond—financing than to 20th century bank—financing of LDC loans, there

is little negotiation between creditors and debtors before a loan is defaulted.

Debtors simply compare Dt and OW, and repudiate when Dt > OW.       Farsighted

creditors therefore restrict loans to assure that D OW, and therefore shrink

the loan supply relative to that of Figure 1.

       When active negotiation is possible between creditors and debtors, the

situation is far more complicated. Suppose that Dt >           so that the debtor
                                                        OWL,
has an incentive to repudiate the debt. Both creditors and debtors also have an

incentive to agree to debt relief in lieu of a complete debt repudiation, since

both sides can be left better of f with debt relief instead of default. In the

event of default, the creditor receives yW and the debtor loses          with

o >   y.   Clearly, if instead of default, an agreement is reached in which the

debtor pays OW of the debt while the creditors agree to forego retaliation, the

creditors are better off by (O_1)w, and the debtor is left as well off.

Alternatively, if the debtor agrees to pay 1W to the creditor in exchange for

no retaliation, the creditor is as well off as with repudiation, while the

debtor is better of f by the amount (O_Y)w. Any payoff by debtor to creditor

between yW, and QW, with no sanctions imposed by the creditors, therefore

leaves both sides better of f than with an outright repudiation.

      Inevitably, then, in the event that indebtedness approaches or exceeds the

repudiation threshold OWL, there will be a strong incentive to negotiate. In
                                             —13—



general, economic theory cannot precisely specify the outcome of these

negotiations, but standard ndels of bargaining can give us some indication of

likely results. In the Nash bargaining solution, for example, there exists a

so—called "threat point," which is the outcome if negotiations break down. Let

us assume that debt repudiation occurs in the absence of successful negotiation,

so that the creditor gets YW, and the debtor ends up with (i_O)w A successful

bargaining outcome is a payoff P, that leaves the creditor with P and the debtor

with     —   F, and in which the creditor agrees to impose no sanctions on the
debtor. Let U be the utility level of the creditor, and V be the utility level

of the debtor. The creditor's gain in utility from a successful negotiation is

u() —   u(yw),      and the debtor's gain is V(W_P) —
                                                          V[(i_e)w1.   In the Nash

bargaining solution, the product of the gains to the debtor and creditor is

maximized, subject to P D. That is:


(3) p maximizes [u(P) —       U(yw)I       {V(w_P) —   V[(i_O)w1}

       Suppose, for example, that both creditor and debtor are risk neutral, so

that LJ(P) =   F, V(w_P)        —   F, etc. Then, we maximize (P_1W)(OW_P) subject
to P D. The payoff schedule is then:


(it)         P =               for
                   Dt                      (O+1)w/2

             p =   (O+y)w/2    for     >   (8+y)W/2

Thus, for small levels of debt, the country has no bargaining power, and the

payoff equals the entire debt due. However, as             rises above OWt/2, the
                                        —14—


country ends up paying only (6+Y)W/2. Note that the payoff rises with a and y.

Thus, as the creditor is able to impose large penalties on the debtor (high a)

and to seize a large amount of assets (high y), the creditor's bargaining power,

and ultimate payoff, are raised.

      Now, it zkes sense to suppose that a potential creditor understands its

prospects in the event of negotiations, so that it limits its debt exposure

to levels that the country will choose to repay. In this case, the required

debt servicing will be kept below (O-I-Y)W!2. Note that the lower is the creditor's

ability to retaliate in the event of repudiation, as measured by 0 and 1, the

tighter is the lending limit that creditors will impose. At least in the absence

of uncertainty, borrowers are better off with higher 0 and 1, since the

existence of large penalties for repudiation frees up capital inflows.



B.    The Planner's Problem

      We have so far discussed three aspects of loan supply to a borrowing

country. While a country's ability to repay debt is probably a necessary

condition for it to attract new loans, its willingness to repay, and ability to

do so on a short—term basis are probably even more important. Our next task is

to study the optimal   borrowing choice in light of these constraints.
      Suppose   that the goal of debt policy is to maximize    a social   welfare

function that depends on the consumption flow over time. Specifically, we write

debtor utility V as:


(5)        V =

C. is real consumption (either per capita or aggregate) in period i, and U(C)

is an instantaneous utility in period t, with   U' >   0 and   U 0. Intertemporal
                                       —15—



utility is given by a discounted sum of instantaneous utilities, where 5

measures the rate of subjective time discount. A function like (5)      is   really an

economist's presumption about what borrowing policy should be about, and much

less a statement about the actual determinants of borrowing policies. The goals

of planners or economic authorities might be much more concerned with the growth

of GD?, the use of debt to stabilize a political regime, or even nationalist

sentiments against foreign indebtedness, rather than a careful calculation of

intertemporal consumption possibilities. Since our topic is an analysis of

appropriate borrowing strategies rather than an empirical account of actual

borrowing behavior, we choose to proceed with (5).

      Under certainty, and with no liquidity or repudiation risk, the optimal
borrowing problem is

(6)             v =

subject to:
           (a) K1 = K(l—d)       +


          (b)         =

          (c) Dt+i =

          Cd)   urn (l+r)_tDt = 0
                t+
          Ce) K0, D0 given

Condition (d) is a convenient way to impose the solvency constraint on borrowing.

Implicitly, we are taking the case in which n <   r,   so that foreign borrowing is

limited by the future capacity to repay debt. In that case, (d) is equivalent
                                                 —16—


to the condition (2) described earlier. Rather than proceeding to a complete

solution of (6), we shall simplify the problem further. (The complete solution

is found numerically in the Appendix.) With optimal policies, the maximum value

V is implicitly a function of K0 and D0. We write this value at time zero as V

=               Similarly, if the economy enters any period t with an inherited
    v(K0,D0).
capital stock K arid debt Dt. optimal policies from that period onward will

yield intertemporal utility of V(K,D). Now, consider the planner's problem at

time zero. He will choose values of C0 and 10, which then yield K1 and                       via

(6)(a)—(c). Thereafter, he will continue to borrow optimally, so that from

period 1 onward, the economy achieves V(K1,D1). From the perspective of period

zero, utility is therefore V(K0,D0) =                    +                        The infinite—
                                                 u(c0)       V(K1,D1)/(l-i-iS).
horizon problem becomes a one—period problem as long as V(K1,D1) is known.

      More usefully, we shall work with a two—period variant of the problem in

(6). We rewrite the planner's problem as:


()                          =           +                  +
                  v(K0,D)       u(c0)       u(c1)/(i+)
subject   to:

            (a) K
                   t+1
                         = K (1—d) +
                            t
                                            It   t = 0,1


            (b)      =
                         F(K)
            (c) Dt1 = (1+r)D +              (i+c)   —


            (d)   K0,D0 given

We shall assume that the function V(K2,D2) is known, and study the optimal

choices in periods 0 and 1. In fact, for many of our results we will not need

to know V(K2,D2). In general, V(K2,D2) may be found by more powerful methods of
                                           —17--




optimal control or dynamic programming, or the infinite—horizon problem in (9)

may   be   tackled head on, as in the Appendix.



Optimal Borrowing Without Liquidity or Repudiation Risks

      In this section we study the optimal borrowing decision when borrowing is

limited only by a solvency constraint. The solvency constraint is implicitly

built into the V(K2,D2) function. Let W2 = max
                                                          2(l+r)_(1_2)(Qi_Ii). W2 is
implicitly a function of 2' so that the solvency constraint (l-i-r)D2 (              is a
                                                                             W2(K)
constraint on debt relative to the capital stock. When (l+r)D2 =
                                                                        W2(K2), consump-
tion rmist be zero forever into the future in order to service the debt, so that

v[K2,w2(K2)1 =                            which is obviously a lower limit for V.
                     2(l+)_(1_2)U(O),
      The optimal borrowing strategy is found by direct optimzation of (7). The

first—order conditions are:


(8)    (a)   u0(c0) =   A




       (b) U1(C1)/(i+S) =       X/(1+r)

       (c) FK(Kl) =     (r+d)

      Cd) A is the marginal utility of wealth


The results of the optimization are straightforward and well—known. With a

perfect world capital market, borrowing and lending should be undertaken to

smooth the marginal utility of consumption over time. The marginal utility of

consumption in period i (Muc.) is given by U. (C.)/(i÷o)', where u1(c.) denotes
                                         —18—



au(c)/ac1. The present—value price of output in period i is n. =            (i+r),
where      is the number of units of output which must be saved at time zero in

order to yield one unit of the good in period i. The consumption smoothing rule

is then:


(9)        MUC./'n. = A for all periods i


We have described the major implication of (9)        in   earlier work (Sachs, 1982b,

and Sachs, l98). Basically, it captures the old dictum "Finance a temporary

shock, adjust to a permanent shock." When output is temporarily depressed, A

does not change much, and according to (9),     the   MUC    should also remain
unchanged. This involves maintaining a high rate of consumption in spite of

temporarily low output, by accumulating debt. When output is permanently

reduced, A rises, so that MUC   in   every period should also rise. In effect,

consumption is reduced in line with lower permanent income, and the country

should not borrow in order to maintain a high rate of consumption.

      (8)(c) expresses the second half of the standard borrowing strategy.

Investments should be undertaken to the point where the marginal product of

capital equals the world cost of capital, where the latter is measured as a

world real interest rate plus the rate of depreciation. In more complex

investment environments this rule would be re—stated as a rule to undertake all

investment projects with positive present value at the world interest rate.

      Suppose that these guidelines are to be adopted. By what set of policy

rules can they be implemented? Under a set of restrictive conditions, the

guidelines are those that would be adopted by value—maximizing firms and
                                      —19—


utility—maximizing households in a fully decentralized economy. The necessary

assumptions. are:

     •    perfect foresight (or rational expectations under uncertainty);

     •    the social welfare function V is also the representative household's

          utility function;

     •    unrestricted access of households and firms to the world capital

          market;

     •    no taxes on other distortions that cause the private marginal product

          of capital to diverge from the social marginal product of capital

          (FK);
     *    no taxes or other distortions that cause the post—tax real interest

          rate to diverge from the world real interest rate.

If these conditions hold, then the laissez—faire approach to foreign borrowing

will yield an optimal path of external indebtedness. When any of these

conditions is violated, the case for laissez—faire is substantially weakened.

Though nuch of the rest of the paper involves relaxing the assumptions needed to

justify laissez—faire, it is useful to mention a few examples of how these

assumptions may be violated. Some illustrative cases are described in Table 1.

     We now turn to some key extensions of the basic model, still assuming the

absence of liquidity and repudiation risk.


     Traded versus Non—traded Goods

     Suppose, now, that the economy produces non—traded as well as traded goods.

Sectoral output is written as a function of sectoral capital stocks (labor input

                                                                   (K )   and Q
                                                                                   N= NN
                                                                                       (K   ).

Let         signify the relative price of non—tradeables in terms of tradeables in

period t. Consumption is divided between N and T subject to an interteniporal

social welfare function of the form V =                                             For simplicity,
                                                            _0(l+fl_1U(C,C).
all investment is assumed to use the traded good (here, too, extension to the

general case is straightforward). Let                       be investment made in the non—traded

balance is QT — cT — (1T + 1N) and non—traded good equilibrium is                          = cN.

       From the point of view of the solvency condition, productive wealth must

be redefined as productive tradeables wealth, max

External debt debt cannot exceed the present discounted value of net tradeables

production, since by definition only tradeables goods can be used for exports

to service the external debt.

       Let us now consider the two—period borrowing problem with tradeables and

nontradeables:

The main insight from this optimization is that current decisions regarding

consumption and investment mast involve forecasts of the future relative price

of non—tradeables, At time zero, for example, the investment in non—traded

goods should equate PF(K) with (r+d). It will likely be the case that P

will not equal P ,          with    the result that myopic expectations regarding   will

result in a misallocation of investment expenditure. We provide a quantitative

illustration o this point in the appendix.


    Official Borrowing to Augment Private Savings

     In many economies private investment is deemed insufficient to generate

desired growth rates in the economy, and the public sector is regarded as an

"engine of growth" through the role of augmenting the rate of capital

                                  governments are fond of promising that there

                                  will be no exchange rate changes.



Social Welfare Function           The government's planning horizon and rate of

                                  "typical household." Ideally, governments

                                  may represent future generations that are

                                  under—represented in the interests of current

                                  households.


Access to World Capital Markets   Most LDC capital markets are highly

                                  segmented, so that "free" access to the world

                                  market may    imply a sharply different degree of
                                  of access for different groups within the

                                  economy, and may therefore have perverse

                                 Similarly, tariffs and domestic taxes may

accumulation.      Underdeveloped domestic capital markets may cause private

savings, and hence private investment, to remain low. Fiscal expenditures on

investment goods may then form a significant share of total capital formation,

with foreign official borrowing playing an important role in the finance of

government investment, and taxes playing a crucial role in generating official

resources for debt servicing. Not surprisingly, the optimal borrowing strategy

must be re—computed under these circumstances, for debt—servicing capacity

depends not only on national wealth but also on the public sector's ability to

tax that wealth. When there are weaknesses (either political or economic) in

the government's authority to raise taxes, governments must be especially

cautious in their foreign borrowing. The following illustration underlines this

need for caution. (This section relies heavily on Sachs, 1984).

      Suppose that because of an underdeveloped capital market, the private

sector in the developing country saves a fixed fraction of post—tax income,

rather than optimizing intertemporally. The government uses its taxing and

borrowing authority to supplement private saving. (See Arrow and Kurz, 1970,

Ch. VI, for a similar model of imperfect capital markets.) Private investors

have no direct access to the international loan market. The government taxes

domestic output at rate Tt, which may change over time. This rate must be less

than 1.0, and may be less than zero if the government is making net income

transfers to the private sector. There is no public consumption.

      With domestic output given by Q1, tax revenues are          and private sector

                                                              =                  In
savings are s(l_Tt)Q. Private consumption is given by             (l_s)(l_T)Q.
any   period,   the government borrows     and repays (1+r)D. Total investment in

the econonr is given r:
                                                  —25—



(12)           It =    s(1_Tt)Qt + TtQ + [Dt+i_(1+r)Dt]
                      (private       (tax      (net foreign
                       savings)       revenue) resource
                                                  inflow)

As written, it appears that all foreign borrowing is used for investment rather

than consumption, but this is true           only as an accounting matter. Suppose, for
example, that the government wants           to    raise private consumption while holding

investment levels fixed. It merely raises Dt+i while reducing
                                                                           Tt sufficiently
to keep         constant; in that case the borrowing finances consumption 100% on the

margin.

       Now, let us calculate the optimal financial policy of the government,

assuming again that it tries to maximize an interteinporal utility function of

the form u(c0) + u(c1)/(i+) + v(K2,D2)/(1+)2.

               (l_s)(1_tt)Q
       It =    s(lr)Q       + TtQt ÷ D1 — (1+r)D


As long as tax rates are completely flexible, the solution to this problem is

identical to the solution to (7), since the dynamic budget constraint facing
                                          —26—


the government is no different whether it chooses              and        as before or Tt and

   as here.

       To find the tax rates corresponding to this optional plan, note that

C. =   (l—s)(1—T.)F(K.),     so that Ti   l—IC./F(Ki1[l/(l—s)1. Assuming that s is

fixed, a typical optimal growth path will involve a rising t •               Low tax rates in

the early period allow households to benefit early on from the growth that will

be achieved in periods 1 and 2. Higher taxes later on are necessary to service

the international debt.

       Now let us introduce a simple yet crucial hitch into the model. Suppose

that the government can only raise tax rates to a limit I < 1, and that the

constraint is binding in the sense that the optimal T and/or T1 exceeds 1.

The first effect of the tax ceiling is to tighten significantly the solvency

constraint in (2). Debt repayment now depends on taxing authority as well as

national wealth. The new constraint is that D must be less than or equal to

the maximum level of tax revenues net of government investment. Government

investment is          minus private investment, s(1_Tt)Qt. Thus,

                                                     —     +
(ib)
            Dt(l+r)              =t(r)__t)IttQt                s(l_Tt)Qt]


it is more    likely   that (114) rather than (2) holds as a binding constraint, since

(114) does not   imply that future consumption must equal zero when the constraint
binds. Nonetheless, in the examples that follow, we do not consider the case in

which (14) binds. We focus rather on the constraint T =              T,   assuming Dt remains

below the maximum level in (114).

       Since the optimal tax path tends to involve rising I, a natural case to

consider is one in which the tax constraint does not bind in period 0 while it

does bind in period 1. Thus, we assume           <   and       =   r.     What are the
                                                —27—


implications of the tax constraint? Basically, first—period consumption C1

remains "too high" relative to the plan that an unconstrained government would

choose, since the fiscal authority would like to raise taxes in the first

period but cannot do so. Therefore, the marginal utility of income in the

first period is too low, and the returns to investment in period 1, namely

          should be given a weight less than 1.0 in project analysis. After some

algebra, we can prove:

(15)        FK(Kl) =   (r   + d)     C    where C > 1.


We have the key result:

           Under a regime of constrained tax levies, the marginal product of

           capital should no longer be equated with the world market cost of

           capital but rather should be kept g'ier, to reflect a lower

           shadow value of first—period output.

If the government follows the standard rule FK(Kl) =               r   + d, the country is led

to over—borrow, with the result that social welfare is reduced.

       Let us consider a graphic case of this issue that follows the analysis in

Kharas (1981). Suppose that the government only cares about growth, in the

sense that u(C0)                   0, and V(K2,D2) =           —              The government is
                       u(C1)                           F(K2)       (1+r)D2.
trying to maximize second—period national income (net of international

indebtedness). If           is not constrained, T0 and         should be set at 1.0, with

government revenue plus net foreign borrowing used to equate FK(K2) with r +

according to the classical policy prescription.

       Now suppose that t, t1            T < 1. Since consumption has no weight in

utility, it is optimal to set taxes at their maximum rate:                    =       . Then,
   and 1(2 are given by:
                                                     —28—

                                                                                      flFIic0(l—d)   +

       K2       K0(1—d)2       I0(i—a)

By setting V/I0 =                      = 0, we find the optimal investment policy. After
some algebra, we find:

                               (r+d)          r ÷ d; FK(K2) =         (r   + d)
(16)            FK(Kl) =
                           s(l—) +

Once again, the country should not invest enough to equate FK(Kl) and r +                                d.

       This model provides a powerful indictment against foreign borrowing, even

for productive investment projects, if the domestic fiscal system is not

equipped to handle rising debt—service ratios. Figure 2 illustrates how

aggregate growth is slowed by excessive borrowing in a tax—constrained regime,

for specific parameter values of the model. In the unconstrained regime,

optimal borrowing is at D, with growth at g*. In the constrained case, with a

low , the optimum is at                  <
                                             D,   with growth at g** <            g*;   and in the constrained

case with a high ,         the optimum is at D**, with growth at g***. If the
borrower with low           equates FK(Kl) with r +          d,    in spite of the tax

constraint, the growth rate ends up at                     (corresponding to D), which is lower

than can be achieved with less foreign borrowing, g**.


Optimal     Borrowin with       Liquidity Constraints

       Debt crises almost never involve the strict solvency constraint in foreign

borrowing. Well before consumption levels are driven to subsistence, countries

typically repudiate their foreign debt or succeed in gaining debt relief. Often

a    debt crisis has little to do with fundamental solvency considerations but

rather turns on the short—run difficulties of debt servicing. In this section,

we explore how borrowing strategies should be modified when short—run liquidity

risks are present. We establish two principal results. First, the optimal

level of borrowing depends importantly on the probability of a cutoff in

lending. Second, the possibility of a lending cutoff increases the importance

of   the   naturity structure of the debt. The standard prescription that long—term

projects    should be financed with long—term loans grows in importance as the
probability of a lending cutoff rises.
       We begin with an extremely simple version of the two—period model, with

physical investment ignored. The goal of borrowing is to maximize expected

utility.

             with probability it,        0 (i.e. no foreign borrowing)

             with probability (i—TI), D not restricted


With probability it, the country is unable to obtain new finance         in period 1,

and the country must borrow         without knowing whether    will in fact be

available. At this point, we assume that iT is independent of the level of debt.

Below, we introduce the more realistic assumption that it rises with D1, i.e.
                                              —31—



that high debt levels make potential creditors less likely to extend new debt.

       Consider first the case when ii =       0.    Then from our earlier results we know

that U0(C0) =                            and that u1(c1) =                When iT > 0, we

must consider two outcomes: either the economy is liquidity constrained (denoted

by superscript L) or it is not (denoted by superscript N).                 is borrowed

without knowing the outcome in the next period. Consumption turns out to be

C. = Q. —   (l+r)D.. if the borrowing constraint holds, and C =           Q. —   (l+r)D..   + D.

if it does not.3 Clearly C > C. In case N, D is selected according to the

standard criterion u(c)                               In case L, we have u(c) >
                                  _vD(D2)/(l+).
Parenthetically,         is an increasing function of

       By writing EV as U(C0) + ¶[U(c)/(i+6) + v(o)/(i+)2} + (i—x)Iu(c)/(i+)

+ V(D)/(l+t5)2], we find the optimal borrowing level               as the solution to

            = 0:
d(EV)/dD1

(18)        d(EV)/dD1 = 0     > U0 = [(i+r)/(i+)I [irU + (i-it)U]

By totally differentiating this equation with respect to D1, D, and it, we can

find the dependence of         on 'Ti.   After some algebra, we can show5


(19)                  < 0
            dD1/dit

Thus, as the probability of a second—period lending cutoff rises, optimum

first—period borrowing should decline.


       Liquiditj Crises and Borrowing Externalities

       Should governments regulate foreign borrowing if liquidity crises are

possible? Under some special circumstances, the answer is no, though more
                                                —32—



generally this form of market failure does provide a case for intervention. The

model we have just explored can justify laissez—faire, if the following

assumptions hold:

      •      the private sector has rational expectations of a liquidity crisis;

      o      the   probability 1'   is   not a function of the overall level of borrowing;

      •      the government can credibly commit itself to refuse to bail out

             private agents who find their credit cut off;

             the liquidity crisis causes no widespread bankruptcies, or if

            bankruptcies occur, they are handled efficiently, without social cost.

If these assumptions are maintained, then individual agents will choose their

intertemporal plans such that U0 =                               where E(U1) =         +
                                            E(U1)[(l+)f(l+r)1,                   irU       (i—ir)U.
This is precisely the first—order condition found in (18).

     All of these assumptions are highly suspect. Borrowers probably do not

have a good understanding of financial crises (neither do economists or

governments!), much less an ability to predict their occurrence. Moreover,

though it   is   hard to forecast, it is likely that the frequency of a loan cutoff

increases with the amount of debt outstanding. We have already argued that such

a crisis arises when no single lender is willing to lend the country as much as

it needs to remain current on debt servicing. That possibility cannot arise

when D1 is very low.

     Third, when liquidity crises arise, governments are almost inevitably

called upon to act to bail out debt—ridden firms. As Diaz—Alejandro has

recently argued (l981i., p. 19 and p. 22), based on the experience of Argentina,

Uruguay, and Chile:
                                      —33—



     Whether or not deposits are explicitly insured, the public expects

     governments to intervene to save most depositors from losses when

     financial intermediaries run into trouble. Warnings that

     intervention will not be forthcoming appear to be simply not

     believable....

          Foreign lenders take government announcements that it will not

     rescue local private debtors, especially banks, with non—guaranteed

     external (or domestic) liabilities even less seriously than

     depositors take the threat of a loss of their money....Foreign bank

     lending to both the public and private sectors of a country have

     considerable leverage to convince governments to take over ex—post

     bad private debts, especially those of financial intermediaries.


If the government is always expected to bail out bad debts, moral hazard

problems are rife. Debtors will no longer expect to feel the full brunt of the

crisis, since losses will be socialized (i.e. spread among borrowers arid non—

borrowers throughout the econortr). Obviously, over—borrowing may then arise.

     The fourth assumption, that bankruptcies impose no social costs, is also

likely to be far off the mark. In an ideal legal system, over—extended debtors

would simply transfer their equity claims to creditors without a loss of

production in those firms still covering variable costs. In practice, when

firms go bankrupt, they often cease operations in the short or long run, leading

to unemployment of resources. Indeed, it is precisely because bankruptcies

impose heavy social costs that governments are obliged to extend debt relief.

       It is not very easy to specify the appropriate borrowing strategy given the

above complexities. It is, however, worthwhile to take just one of the issues

and develop its implications analytically. Suppose that the model remains as in

(iT), but now with 'r an increasing function of D1. When we recalculate the

optimal borrowing level by setting d(EV)/dD1 = 0, we find:

                                            +            +                 -
(20)         U0 =   I(1+r)I(l+)1EU              (l-)U1       (d/dD1HV
where:
                =          +
                    u(c)
                = u(c)     +   v(o)/(l÷ô)

       and      —     >0

Compare the expressions for U0 in (18) and (20). We see in (23) that U0 is

greater than E(l+r)/(l+ä)] NrU + (i—ir)U1 by a term that reflects the effect of

   on it.    Basically,    (20) holds that r does not reflect the marginal cost of

external funds, since an increase in                also makes more likely a welfare—

reducing liquidity crisis.

       If the marginal borrower behaves as if it             is   given, the private marginal

cost of funds (r) will fall short of the social cost, and over—borrowing will

occur. Laissez—faire is no longer first best, even if all of the other

necessary assumptions hold true. The optimal borrowing strategy is then to tax

foreign borrowing, so that private and social costs are aligned. The situation

is formally equivalent to the Bhagwati—Srinivasan (1915) argument for a

disruption—tariff when high export levels raise the possibility of foreign trade

retaliation.

     Liquidity       Crises and Debt Maturities

     The possibility of a loan supply cutoff provides an important reason for

matching the maturity structure of the debt with the gestation period of

physical capital investment. Suppose that an incremental investment opportunity

d11 becomes available in the problem in (20). We call the investment

"short—term"    if    it pays off in the next period and "long—term" if it pays off

in two periods. For the short—term case, we assume that the yield is (l+O)d11,

with 0 >   r.   For the long—term case, the yield after two periods is (l+0)2d11,

again with 0 >       r.   We also assume the existence of short— and long—term loans,

with the same interest rate per period. A short—term loan D requires

repayment (1+r)D1 in the next period. A long—term loan D requires repayment
     2L
(l+r) D1 in two periods.

     It is easy to prove the following results:

     •     For any it,     the   short—term project should be undertaken with short—term

           finance.

     •     For any it,     the   long—term proj ect should be undertaken with long—term

           finance.

     •     The long—term project should not necessarily be undertaken with

           short—term finance. This is true even though the project has positive

           present value at the world interest. The project becomes more

           desirable the lower is it and the greater is 0 relative to r.

    The proof of these propositions is simple. Start at an equilibrium with no

investment. When maturities of I and D are matched, it is easy to show that

consumption plans can be left unchanged, and final indebtedness D2 can be
                                       —36—



lowered, by undertaking the investment project. For the case of short—term

finance for a long—term project, the demonstration is a little more involved.

Basically, a liquidity crisis is more severe the larger is D1. If 0 = r, then

undertaking the investment yields no net benefits, but it does impose a cost by

raising D1 (and therefore raising the welfare loss in the event of a liquidity

crisis). Therefore 0 must be sufficiently above r to justify new borrowing.6

     Generally, long—term debt reduces the costs of a possible lending cutoff.

This is for two reasons. First, and most obvious, for a given external debt,

the shorter is the maturity structure, the greater on average is the amount of

principal repayment in a given period. Therefore, the larger is the required

short-run cut in domestic spending if new lending suddenly ceases. Second, and

perhaps more important, a judicious use of long—term borrowing with short—term

lending (i.e., reserve accumulation) can help to obviate liquidity crises by

reducing the need to borrow in a given period. Suppose that without fear of a

debt cut off the optimal path of short—term borrowing would be       in the first

period and    in the next. Using long—term loans, this pattern can be

replicated without any second—period borrowing (assuming, as we have done, that

both short—term and long—term loans have the same interest rate per period).

The economy simply borrows ID1 +               in long—term funds, and puts D2/(l+r)
                                   D2/(l+r)1
into reserves. The reserves have value D2 in the next period, and these

reserves are then drawn down to zero in the next period. Thus, it becomes

irrelevant whether new lending is or is not available in that period!

     The fact that countries hold substantial reserves provides good evidence

that liquidity can be a serious concern. Governments borrow long—term to hold
                                       —37—


reserves even though the cost of long—term finance is higher than the returns to

official reserves. This behavior makes sense if governments are willing to pay

a premium to assure the availability of foreign exchange in a given period.

Other evidence in this regard is that countries often pay commitment fees to

guarantee the availability of loans at a future date.



Borrowing Strategies When Debt Repudiation is Feasible

     Now we turn to the case in which countries can repay debt in both the

short—term and long—term, but may be unwilling to do so (this section relies

heavily on Sachs and Cohen, 1982). The key to modelling debt repudiation is an

explicit assumption regarding its benefits and costs. The benefits are

straightforward: the borrower saves the real value of the outstanding debt,

which it no longer services. The costs are far more difficult to specify (see

Sachs, 1982, for a discussion of the historical experience). One aspect of the

costs may be a partial or complete inability to obtain new loans in the world

capital markets, at least for some time after the repudiation occurs. Another

aspect of the costs may be a direct seizure of the country's overseas assets,

including bank accounts, foreign direct investments, ships and aircraft. A

third and even more important cost may be a dramatic decline in the countrys

capacity to engage in trade, even if no net new borrowing is involved. Modern

trade is built on a sophisticated system of revolving trade credits. Even if a

country's net debt is zero, its gross stocks of trade—related financial assets

and liabilities are likely to be large. Because a borrower would have

difficulty arranging trade credits after a repudiation, the mechanics of trade
                                              —38—



would be made onerous. Moreover, merchandise at ports ready to be dispatched to

the debtor country could be subject to seizure by creditors.

     To introduce these elements, we assume that when a debt is repudiated the

creditors retaliate by imposing two costs: in all future periods, the

borrower's production is reduced, for given K, by a fixed fraction 3; and

second, the borrower is excluded from all further borrowing. Importantly, we

now assume that this retaliation yields neither costs nor benefits to the

creditors (or that the costs and benefits cancel). In terms of the discussion

in the first section, we set I = 0.

     As an easy start, we begin with a simplified version of the international

borrowing model (we simply drop V(K2,D2)). The tax considerations are ignored,

so that we implicitly assume that domestic tax levies are not constrained.

Loans are made to the sovereign borrower in period 0. If they are not repaid in

period 1, the penalty is enforced and output is reduced by 0Q1. The borrower

makes the repudiation decision in period 1; there is no way that it can

pre—commit itself to a decision before the period arrives. Moreover, in this

section the possibility of a negotiated settlement is ignored. (The general

principles of credit rationing are the same when ex post facto negotiations are

allowed.) Since second—period utility is simply u(C1), the borrower compares

consumption levels with and without repudiation. With repudiation, C1 equals

   — 8Q     =              (We denote this level as c.) With no repudiation,
                (l—O)Q1.
                 —              which we denote C. The borrower defaults whenever
C1 equals            (1+r)D1,
   exceeds C, and thus whenever (l+r)D1 >
                                                     XQ
     There are two choices with respect to the timing of loans. The level of

credit       may be extended before or after the investment decision I is made.
                                           —39—




We   shall see shortly that it is a great advantage to the country to be able to

choose 10 before going to the capital markets, since 10 may         then   be chosen to

make the credit terms on a given loan more favorable, or to increase the total

amount that the country can borrow. A more natural assumption, however, is that

loans are arranged first and that the government then allocates them to

consumption and investment. In this case the government will generally have an

incentive to renege on a promised level of 10 once a loan has been arranged,

even if ex ante it would be better off to fix I. Thus, promises concerning

     will be unconvincing. We term the case in which I is set first the

"precommitment"       equilibrium, and regard the other case as the "standard"
assumption.
       A linear model offers a vivid      illustration of the effects of repudiation

risk and of investment precominitment. Let:


(21)
            Q0=Q
               = + (l11)I,            I


           v =        +
                 C0




According to (21), there is a quantity I of       investment projects with a rate of
return   I exceeding the world interest rate r. The rate of time discount           is

assumed to be greater than the world interest rate. In the no—repudiation

model, utility V is maximized by setting 10 =       ! (all   investment projects are

undertaken).     Consumption is shifted entirely to the first period with no
consumption in the second (since 5 >       r and utility is linear). In sum:
                                                  —40—



(22) The Case of No Repudiation


            C0
                          +         + (i+y)Ti/(i+p)

            10 = T

            Cl = 0


                 =        +          —   Q
                     C0        10


     Now, we turn to the "standard" case of the repudiation model. Once a loan

    is arranged, the borrower will choose to set 10 =    0,    since 'S >   y.
Therefore        = Q, and the debt ceiling is given by   =    X/(l+p).      The complete

solution is:


(23) The Standard Repudiation Case


            C0 = Q +          )(l+r)
            10 = 0


                      —
            Cl =


            B1
                 =   X/(l+r)

Therefore, the presence of repudiation risk causes rationing of the borrower

(note that B1 is lower in (23) than in the previous equation). Investment is

reduced (all the way to zero in this example!) and consumption is pushed to the

second period. The presence of repudiation risk reduces the borrower's welfare

by restricting capital inflows.
                                                 —41—


      Finally, we turn to the precornmitment case. It turns out that the borrower

may be able to raise its welfare by promising a high level of investment 10.

Higher 10 raises              and thus raises the penalty for repudiation, which equals

OQ1 When 10 is high, creditors are therefore more willing to lend, and the

credit constraint is eased. In this version, the borrowing country will

choose to precommit to 10 =           I   when I is close to (S, and when (S is much greater

than r. Specifically we find:


(2k) The Pre—Commitment, Repudiation Case


             C0 =     Q   +    — 10

                  = 0 for (ô—r)O(l+y) <        (cS_y)(l+r)

             10 =     I   for ((S—r)O(l+y) >   ((S—y)(l+r)

             C1 =          — XQ1

                  =
             01       0Q1/(l+r)

      Thus, the pre—commitment case                be the same   as   the no—pre—commitment case,

but might (and generally will) result in an equilibrium somewhere between the

textbook model and the standard repudiation model. Pre—commitrnent makes sense

when (S   r (that is, the rate of time discount is not too high), and when I >>                r
(that is, investment is quite profitable). Pre—cornmitnient allows greater

borrowing,    greater investment in profitable projects, and higher first—period
consumption.

          Repudiation Risk with Uncertainty

          So far, an actual default never occurs in the model, though the threat of

default has a profound effect on economic welfare and the nature of macroeconomic

equilibrium. Once uncertainty is introduced into the model, debt repudiations

will actually occur as random events. The presence of uncertainty has

several effects. First, the loan supply schedule becomes upward sloping, rather

than perfectly elastic, up to a maximum debt level D. Second, and even more

perverse in ways now described. A more complete treatment of debt repudiation

under uncertainty may be found in Sachs and Cohen, 1982, and Sachs, l984.

         A recent theme of financial economics is that the various claimants on a

firm's income stream (e.g., the shareholders, bondholders, workers) have

differing interests regarding the firm's policies because alternative policies

affect the relative valuation of the different claims. Thus, the shareholders

may- urge policies that raise shareholder wealth at the expense of bondholder

wealth, as described in by Jensen and Meckling (1976). Or coalitions of' the

shareholders and banks may engage in policies at the expense of bondholders,

especially in the context of' bankruptcy actions (see Bulow and Shoven, 1978). A

notable feature of these examples is that the firm may pursue inefficient

policies that reduce the overall value of the firm, because some groups will

benefit even though other groups will be hurt more. A related theme is that all

groups are generally left better of f', ex ante, if the firm can he constrained

from pursuing inefficient policies.

         Several direct analogies can be made to macroeconomic behavior by the
                                      —43—


borrowing country. Like a firm, the country also has various claimants on the

income stream, including the government, domestic citizens, and international

creditors. Like the firm, the country may    be   led to select inefficient policies

to transfer income from the creditors to the "shareholders" (the government and

domestic private sector). Generally, the country would like to foreswear these

policies ex ante but may find it difficult to do so.

    There are several areas of behavior in which timing and default risk

interact to produce bad macroeconomic choices. The earlier discussion of

investment pre—comrnitment can be thought of precisely in these terms. From an

ex ante point of view it is best for the country to choose a high level of

investment, because high investment relaxes credit ceilings. However, once a

loan package is arranged, the country prefers to raise first—period consumption

at the expense of investment. Since creditors understand this, they will tend

to discount initial promises of high investment plans, and indeed they will be

right.

     A similar phenomenon occurs when countries borrow with long—term debt.

When a country owes long—term debt, each new amount of borrowing tends to reduce

the expected value of the original debt by making its eventual repudiation more

likely. In many cases, the borrowing country would like to be able to promise a

potential long—term creditor that it will not over—borrow once the long—term

debt is arranged. Such a promise would reduce the risk premium on the long—term

debt. However, there will generally be strong incentives, ex 2'         to   do

precisely the contrary. The result is, in general, that long—term debt will

command a high risk premium and that, as expected, over—borrowing will occur.
                                     —44—



     Market participants search for ways to reduce these deleterious incentives.

It may be the case that countries can establish reputations for maintaining

macroeconomic policies in line with announced plans. There is a growing

economics literature on establishing a reputation that may well give some

insights in this direction. Other specific actions, such as relying on

short—term borrowing rather than long—term borrowing, may reduce some of the

incentive problems. In domestic capital markets, and to a much smaller extent

in international lending, bond covenants can be used to pre—commit the borrower

to a future line of action. Smith and Warner, 1919, provide an excellent survey

of such covenants, indicating how they help to enforce an efficient borrowing

and investment plan by corporate borrowers. For example, covenants often

directly restrict dividend payments, which may be tantamount to requiring the

shareholders to invest rather than "consume" their loans. Other types of

provisions include restrictions on new borrowing, maintenance of the firm's

existing assets, financial disclosure requirements, and restrictions on merger

activity. Such provisions are typically unenforceable when foreign sovereign

borrowers are involved and thus are not part of most (international) syndicated

loan agreements.


     Further Aspects of Managing Repudiation Risk

    So far, we have derived the optimal borrowing behavior for an economy that

has the option of repudiating its debt. As in earlier sections, we should now

ask how these optimal borrowing policies can be implemented, What is the role

of the government in managing repudiation risk?
                                     —45—



     There is a profound externality in the borrowing process under repudiation

risk that leads governments into a central policy role. In many cases, a

default or debt repudiation by an individual agent affects markets judgments

regarding creditworthiness of the country as a whole. Most potential creditors

are unable to discern the ultimate causes of a default, and in particular

whether the action reflects a weakness of a particular debtor or is instead a

signal about government policy and economic health in the whole debtor economy.

An individual default raises subjective probabilities of structural weaknesses

or widespread mismanagement in an economy, and so causes credit to tighten for

all borrowers.

     The implications of this spiliover are immediate. First, governments ——

even the most laissez—faire —- must assume some responsibility for honoring the

external obligations of bankrupt firms in the private sector. Second, creditors

act on the expectation of such actions, and indeed may withdraw credits from

countries when such actions are not forthcoming. Naturally, therefore,

governments must at the minimum undertake the prudential supervision of

private—sector foreign borrowing in order to safeguard the economy's

international creditworthiness. In some cases, it may be necessary to make

government backing explicit to facilitate the appropriate levels of inflow.

     Even when all lending is to the private sector of an economy, creditors

will still be correct to aggregate the country's debt in assessing an economy's

incentive to repudiate. This is because a government always has ability to

nationalize a substantial part of the external debt, and bargain for the country

as a whole vis   vis the foreign creditors. This has been the experience of
                                         —46—



several Latin American countries in recent years.

     Since the risk of repudiation puts a limit on overall borrowing, the

interest rate on international loans may be a poor measure of the marginal cost

of funds to a borrowing country. Suppose that total lending is rationed at the

point D =   OQ/(l+r).   Those lucky enough to borrow at the world market rate will

pay a price r, while borrowers on the domestic market will be forced to pay a

higher price. The shadow price of capital appropriate for the marginal

investment decision will be the higher rate. Interestingly, an interest

equalization tax on foreign borrowing, raising its costs to domestic levels,

would improve the microeconomic allocation of investment funds without

necessarily increasing the overall supply of external credits.

     We have already noted additional scope for active policies. Governments

may have an incentive to spur investment projects for the purpose of enhancing

creditworthiness. Another possibility is that governments act to change A, the

cost of repudiation. Outward—looking trade policies probably raise the costs of

repudiation by making the country more vulnerable to trade embargoes, credit

cutoffs, etc. Thus, a bonus to export—promotion policies may well be enhanced

access to world credit markets. To a limited extent, governments may also be

able to raise B by offering to collateralize loans. There are cases in which

planes and ships have been offered as collateral on trade financing.

    The welfare effects of' policy—induced changes in B are not easy to discern.

On the one hand, higher B stimulates the inflow of capital by reducing the

likelihood of repudiation. On the other hand, if an econonr runs into severe

macroeconomic difficulties, the benefit of default is compromised by a high
                                          —47—


value of 0. Analytical work suggests that there is likely to be an intermediate

value 0 <    0< 1 that maximizes the debtor's expected utility under repudiation
risk.




External Debt and Macroeconomic Policy

     This topic is covered in detail by Dornbusch's (198It) paper in this volume.

Here we will focus on the possible complications for macroeconomic policy that

are created by: (1) the buildup of external debt; and (2) the presence of large

external debt.

     Despite the freedom that countries have to float their currencies under

present international arrangements, most borrowing countries in fact fix their

exchange rates —--   to   another currency or to a weighted average of other

currencies. Often there are periodic adjustments of the central rate, but in

the short run, the exchange rate is fixed by     the   central bank.

     Under   these circumstances external borrowing for local expenditure will
lead to monetary expansion. If undertaken freely and extensively, either by the
government   or by private economic agents, it interferes with monetary control,

since borrowing countries typically have little opportunity to "sterilize"

inflows of foreign exchange through domestic sales of securities or by other

means. Thus new external borrowing more or less directly increases the money

supply.   External debt that is acquired to cover directly the import of foreign

goods or services do not have these internal monetary effects. It is the

conversion to local currency at a fixed exchange rate that creates the

complication.
                                         —48—



       Of course, the counterpart in the short run to external borrowing for local

expenditure is an increase in international reserves, and these reserves are

available to finance imports. As monetary and income effects work their way

through the economy, the demand for imports will increase and reserves will be

drawn down, reversing the monetary expansion that initially took place. But

this corrective process is brought about by the monetary expansion itself, which

it might have been desirable to avoid under some circumstances. For this

reason, many developing countries operating under fixed exchange rates have

found it desirable to limit the inflow of foreign capital, especially that which

comes through the banking system. Unless their access to international credit

is restricted, banks and private firms with access to the international market

can escape the rigors of a tight domestic monetary policy. For example, a

multinational corporation that is denied credit at the local bank because of

monetary restriction can resort to borrowing from its head office or directly

from the international market and thereby bypass the local restrictions. In

sum,   a   commitment to a fixed exchange rate under these circumstances weakens

monetary control; its restoration may require limitations on capital flows.

       A high level of debt, not just its rate of change, can also create

problems for monetary policy. This is especially true when it comes to rolling

over a large external debt or correcting a misalignment in the exchange rate.

Changes in the exchange rate under such circumstances can have important effects

on the balance sheets of' business and financial firms. In particular, a

currency devaluation can transmute overnight a solvent firm into a technically

insolvent one as the local currency value of external debt is raised.
                                     —49—


     This process is sometimes necessary and even useful. Firms may have

overextended themselves with foreign credit on the basis of an overvalued

currency. Their operating costs may have been artificially reduced, insofar as

they have imported inputs, by the overvalued currency. Currency devaluation

puts a halt to the process and introduces some useful economic discipline both

for the debtors and for the foreign creditors, who under bankruptcy proceedings

would normally share in some of the losses.

     Governments are typically reluctant, however, to take steps that will throw

firms, especially major firms, into bankruptcy. The presence of extensive

external debt may therefore inhibit or force changes in exchange rates in order

to limit the financial difficulties of large firms. In 1967, for instance,

following the devaluation of sterling, Hong Kong at first devalued the Hong Kong

dollar. Not to have done so would have badly weakened the balance sheets of

some leading banks, which had assets in sterling, even though on other economic

grounds the devaluation was not justified (and, indeed, the action was reversed

after a few days when alternative methods for protecting the banks were worked

out). Similarly, some countries have put their local development banks into

technical insolvency by devaluing the currency. In this way also the presence

of external debt serves to limit macroeconomic policy.

     Finally, a large external debt of the government itself reduces the

flexibility of fiscal policy. Large interest payments cannot be cut if the

government desires to retrench. A government that has made total budget

expenditures or the total budget deficit a target of eocnomic policy will have

to put all the more pressure on domestic expenditures to the extent that
                                     —50—



external debt servicing is large. This is especially true following a currency

devaluation, when the local currency counterpart of external debt denominated in

foreign currency will rise in proportion to the devaluation. When framing

national stabilization programs, on the other hand, it must be recognized that

interest payments to foreigners do not stimulate the domestic economy. Thus,

interest on foreign debt should be treated differently from normal government

expenditures.



Is Laissez—Faire a Desirable Borrowing Strate&y?

    A useful reference point for evaluating the debtor's policies toward

external borrowing is the complete freedom of all economic agents to

borrow abroad without restriction by the borrowing country. This regime

generally existed in the 19th century and continues to exist in some advanced

countries today, e.g. Canada and the United States. Under these circumstances,

creditors must assess and take the risks borrower by borrower, just as they do

with domestic loans. If a particular loan cannot be repaid, the external

creditors share the loss through bankruptcy without, in principle, affecting the

creditworthiness of other (independent) borrowers in the same country.

     Perhaps regrettably, there are a number of reasons why the laissez—faire

approach is not at present likely to be suitable for most developing countries.

First, their governments have almost universally taken a strong hand in economic

management, including economic development. Government influence not only on

the macroeconomic environment but also on resource allocation is pervasive, to

the point where it is often difficult to say whether an enterprise's insolvency
                                           —51—


is due to bad judgment on the part of management or due to government actions.

Under these circumstances, creditors will not view the individual projects as

independent but will attach a heavy weight to the "country factort' as such.

       Second, even under true laissez—faire, creditors may find it prudent to

ration credit to individual borrowers because of the problem of adverse

selection in the presence of imperfect information (Stiglitz and Weiss, 1981).

If the borrowing is truly and persuasively decentralized, the rationing will be

by individual borrower, not (in general) by country except insofar as there is

identifiable countrywide risk. But insofar as there is country—risk, as there

is bound to be for the first reason above, prospective debtors can enlarge their

access to credit by taking steps to reduce the perception of country—risk. One

part of this nay be, paradoxically, to exert closer control over the external

borrowing of economic agents.

      Furthermore, many of the potential foreign borrowers in a country may be so

important for the continuing functioning of the national economy that bankruptcy

——   involving   a write down of the foreign debt —— cannot in practice be

contemplated. This is especially true of banks and of some other financial

intermediaries, as we have already seen. Both the external reputation of the

country and internal confidence in its institutions may be so closely tied to

particular firms that in practice the government must guarantee their external

debt or else avoid any actions that bring its servicing into question. External

creditors of the leading banks are thus guaranteed, whether formally or not, by

the national government, and their expectations reflect this fact. The same may

be true of other important commercial enterprises, including especially
                                    —52—



government—owned enterprises. In short, bankruptcy of certain institutions

would have strong negative reputational externalities for the debtor country.

Knowing this, the government should monitor closely and perhaps even limit the

external indebtedness of these institutions.

     The general point is that countries acquire reputations ——     for   prudence or

foolhardiness, for caution or boldness in economic planning, for market

orientation or dirigisme, and so on ——   that   are important to creditors in

assessing credit worthiness. Thus difficulties by some borrowers affect the

supply—of—funds schedule to the entire country (and, in periods of rapidly

moving crises, fraught by exceptional uncertainty, to neighboring countries as

well). In short, there is an informational or reputational externality arising

from the inability or unwillingness of lenders to make fine distinctions among

borrowers. This occurs in domestic markets as well. For example, virtually all

utility stocks are depressed in the United States due in part to the

difficulties of those relatively few utilities with nuclear power plants under

construction. These "pigeon—hole effects" dissipate over time as more

information becomes available, but perhaps only after a liquidity crisis,

discussed above, has occurred and much damage has been done ——    which in turn can

lead to self—fulfillment of pessimistic prophesies.


    Direct Responsibility

    There are three areas in particular where the government cannot really

escape responsibility for external borrowing and therefore must make decisions

on both the level and the character of external borrowing.
                                        —53—



       The first concerns borrowing by the government itself for the provision of

public goods and services. Much traditional external borrowing has been for

such purposes, and indeed the World Bank was created as a mediating lender in

part for the provision of funds for public investments.

      Some public infrastructure, such as railroads, is potentially

revenue—producing. But much of it is not. The government must raise the debt

service through general taxation, with all the implications discussed above.

While the old borrower's guideline to match the maturity of the loan to the life

of   the project does not strictly hold when the project is not revenue—producing,
it   is a good rule nonetheless: long—term projects, whose contribution to GNP

and hence to taxable income is spread over many years, should if possible be

financed by long—term borrowing. Not doing so places more pressure on the

on the internal terms of trade to generate the trade surplus necessary to

amortize the debt rapidly.

      The main point is that governments of developing countries are likely

to be borrowing abroad to finance public infrastructure, and perhaps operating

expenses as well, and they must take a position on the amount and character of

their external debt.

      PL second reason is the widespread government oinership of

revenue—generating commercial enterprises ——   the so—called parastatals. Rare is
the country that does not have some parastatals, and in many countries they

generate over half the output of the modern sectors of the economy. The

government, as chief or sole stockholder, cannot ultimately dissociate itself

from the parastatals, although varying degrees of association are possible. At
                                          —54--



one end of the spectrum, parastatals can be chartered with a high degree of

independence with respect to all business decisions, with a top management that

has   independent standing and is compensated in relation to profitability of the
enterprise. Some British firms approach this model. It would make as clear as
possible to lenders that they are dealing with a commercial     enterprise with all

the attendant risks, and that it does not have the full credit backing of the

government. Even in such extreme circumstances, it is unlikely that a

government—owner could allow such a firm to go into bankruptcy ——    at   some loss

to its foreign creditors ——   without   damaging the reputation of the country and

especially the government as a borrower. This kind of linkage is not limited to

government—owned enterprises. Several U.S. banks went to considerable expense

in the mid—1910s to bail out insolvent or weak real estate investment trusts

under their sponsorship —— which were legally separate and could have been

allowed to fail, as many did ——   for   the sake of perserving their overall

reputation with both creditors and customers.

      In any case most parastatals are not put at arms length from the government

that owns them, managers are not given full autonony, and managers are not

typically compensated on the basis of profitability of the firm. These factors

make it all the more difficult for a government to dissociate fully from the

economic performance of its state enterprises.

      In the first place, government often uses parastatals to pursue social

goals other than profitability, so it is inapprorpiate to hold management

responsible for profitability, as would be the case with a privately owned firm.

Major investment plans must typically be approved by the relevant ministry, and
                                          —55—


employment levels and practices are subject to government guidance (as is also

true, in lesser degree, of privately—owned firms in many         countries).   Secondly,

management is typically on salary ——      often   very low salary, compared with

compensation in privately—owned enterprises of comparable size —- and while

salaries are occasionally augmented by incentive bonuses, the bonuses are

typically not related to profitability. For these reasons, managers have no

direct incentive to gauge their borrowing to the requirements of profitability.

Indeed, since the main motivations of managers in parastatals in many countries

is some combination of personal enrichment (other than through direct

compensation) and political advancement, the principal incentive is toward

enlargement of scale rather than profitability. Yet enlargement of scale, if

not limited, is likely to lead to excessive external borrowing by the

enterprise. The now classic case is the rapid expansion and diversification of

the Indonesian national oil firm, Pertaniina, in the wake of its enhanced

borrowing power following the l914 oil price increase (Wellens, 19T6).

        The   divergence of interest between managers and owners is of course not
limited to state—owned enterprises and can be       found   in large privately—owned
firms   as well. One study has shown that U.S. firms managed by owners, or under

close control of owners, tend to be more profitable than those in which the role

of owners is nre remote (McEachern, 1975).

     For this reason too, therefore, governments will want to monitor closely

and perhaps even control directly the external borrowings of their parastatals.

Their managers under prevalent arrangements cannot be assumed to borrow abroad

to the socially optimal degree; in general, they will tend to over—borrow if
                                         —56—


left unrestrained.

        A third area where the government cannot in practice escape responsibility

f or the level and character of external borrowing concerns the local banks, and

perhaps other bank—like financial institutions. Banks are typically under heavy

regulation, presumably for protection of the public. Banks are, furthermore,

the repositories of public confidence in the functioning of an economic system.

If a major bank fails, it has potential ramifications going far beyond the

failure of one enterprise; both borrowers and lenders become much more cautious,

a development that on occasion is welcome but generally results in economic

recession and economic hardship. For this reason, governments must take an

active interest in the smooth functioning of the major banks under their

jurisdiction. This does not mean that they must protect bank managers against

their mistaken judgment; management can be dismissed. It does mean that the

mistaken judgments of bank management cannot be allowed to weaken the

institution at the expense of' depositors and creditors except at a cost that may-

go far beyond the institution in question. We are here speaking of the

financial system as a whole, and its major components. Minor banks whose fate

can be clearly separated from the financial system as a whole may be allowed to

fail.

        The reputation and fate of the banks can influence a country's reputation

with foreign creditors as well. Chile in the late seventies was widely

applauded in some circles for its return to a relatively unregulated, free

enterprise system. Chilean banks had borrowed heavily in international markets

for relending in the local economy. When in 1982 a private bank became
                                      —57—


insolvent, the government let it be known that the bank was private and

creditors had lent to it at their own risk. External credits to Chile

immediately dried up. Within a short interval the government felt obliged to

reverse itself and guarantee the external liabilities of the bank. Creditors

did not accept the dissociation of the government from the banks. Consequently,

the government must perforce be concerned with both the internal and the

external exposure of the banks. (Even a country as averse to governnient

interference as Switzerland has let it be known that the three largest banks

cannot be allowed to fail.)



Guidelines for External Borrowing

       Given that the government should take a strong interest in the total level

and character of external indebtedness, what would be its guiding principles?

Unfortunately, it is difficult to lay down universally applicable quantitative

guidelines for external debt. Because reputation so heavily influences the

possibilities a country faces and the difficulties it is likely to encounter in

international financial markets, and because reputation is based on history,

experience, and prevailing ideological views in the borrowing country, each

country confronts a distinctive set of issues and problems.

     Indicators such as the debt/GDP ratio or the debt—servicing ratio are often

used to signal when external debt is reaching dangerous levels. So long as such

indicators are widely used, they of course become important in establishing

creditworthiness. But unfortunately such indicators have little objective

basis, in that they can vary widely with safety, depending on the circumstances.

Quantitative assumptions: Return on investment = .15

                          Interest on debt = .1
                                          —59—


For instance, Table 2 sets out a series of debt/GDP ratios and their implied

debt—servicing requirements, all on the assumption that the (constant) rate of

return on investment is 15 percent and the (constant) cost of borrowing in

world capital markets is 10 percent —— numbers that were plausible, even

conservative, for many   countries   in the late l9TOs.

     The advantages of external borrowing so long as the return to investment

exceeds servicing requirements are quite dramatic. For instance, if the yield

on investment is 15 percent and the cost of borrowing is 10 percent a year, and

if external borrowing is the sole source of growth in output, a country can

increase its output to 2.5 times its initial level in steady state equilibrium

(where the debt remains outstanding but does not grow further), by borrowing an

amount equal to 14 times its post-borrowing GDP. Of course, under these

circumstances interest payments on outstanding debt will be very high, 140

percent of total output. Moreover, if import requirements are 20 percent of

GDP, the interest—servicing ratio (interest payments/total exports) will he

two—thirds. However, even after these large payments of interest to foreigners,

output available for the residents of the borrowing country (GNP) will be 1.5

times the initial, pre—debt level of GNP. This represents the net gains from

borrowing abroad, which as indicated can be dramatic. In this example, while

the final debt to GDP ratio is 14, total borrowings will be ten times the initial

level of GDP. Lower levels of borrowing will of course result in lower debt/GDP

ratios and lower debt—servicing ratios (see Table 2). The general point is that

quite high debt ratios are sustainable in long—run equilibrium provided the

country is not subjected to large uncertainty in output or exports.
                                     —60—


     A debt/GDP ratio of four, although sustainable on the assumptions given, is

far higher than anything we actually observe. Actual debt/GDP ratios even of

countries heavily in debt are in the vicinity of .6, well under unity. Israel

has the highest observed debt/GDP ratio, at 1.6, and much of Israel's external

debt is on concessional terms. Interest—service ratios as high as 50 percent

can be observed but are still well below the two—thirds given in the

illustration.

     We may well ask why countries do not borrow even more than they have, for

the illustration suggests much higher sustainable debt than we observe. One

possible answer is that debt on a much larger scale would depress returns to

investment, so that the assumption made here of a constant return is

unrealistic. In fact, however, we have observed roughly constant returns to

investment (abstracting from economic cycles) over a long period of time. If

the debt is acquired quickly, diminishing returns are indeed likely to set in.

But that is less likely to be true of investments made over several decades,

unless the investment itself depresses the external terms of trade of the

borrowing country.

     A second possible answer is that the cost of borrowing will rise with the

amount of outstanding indebtedness, or more generally, that countries are

rationed in their total borrowing well before the solvency constraint is

reached. This is particularly true if repudiation risk is a major concern of

the creditors. Again the pace of borrowing is important; a rapid increase in

debt is very likely to increase the cost to the borrowing country, but a slower,

more gradual increase is less likely to do so. Nonetheless, for debt/GDP ratios
                                      —61—


much higher than is normal, a risk premium is likely to be added to interest

rates even if the buildup is gradual, and after a given debt/GDP ratio is

reached, the borrower may be frozen out of further borrowing.

     A third possible reason is that debt must be serviced in tradeables, but

debt is often acquired to finance investment in nontradeables (although some

infrastructure investments—-- e.g. feeder roads or port facilities —— are

indirectly in tradeables, by lowering the domestic cost of getting exportables

to market). Several factors are important in determining the amount of

investment of external debt in nontradeables that is sustainable: the return on

investment in tradeables relative to the cost of investment, the share of

investment in tradeables as opposed to nontradeables, and the ability of the

government to raise revenues in tradeables in order to service debt acquired to

invest in noritradeables. If, as is likely, the investment in nontradeables will

require a decline in the domestic prices of nontradeables relative to

tradeables, the extent of decline that is tolerable may also influence the

amount of debt that can be acquired for this kind of investment.

     These points can be illustrated with a numerical example. Suppose, as was

the case in Table 2, that the yield on investment is 15 percent in both the

tradeable sector and the nontradeable sector of the economy, and that the cost

of foreign borrowing is 10 percent a year. Suppose further that import

requirements are 20 percent of GDP, domestic expenditure out of disposable

income is initially evenly divided between tradeables and nontradeables, and the

price elasticity of substitution between tradeables and nontradeables in

domestic demand is —2, but that the structure of production is not influenced by
                                     —62—


relative prices. The government must raise revenues to service the external

debt invested in nontradeahies, and it does so through lump sum taxation. On

these assumptions, and for the case in which external debt is twice GDP, Table 3

below shows the fall in the relative domestic price of nontradeables that must

occur in order to service the external debt (the overall debt—service ratio is

.5, from Table 2), given different shares of investment that is made in

nontradea'bles.T For instance, if 60 percent of the external funds are used for

investment in nontradeables, the relative price of tradeables will have to rise

by 13 percent to release enough tradeables from domestic consumption to pay

interest on the external debt. (An illustration of the time profile of the

relative price of nontradeables in an optimizing model is given in the

Appendix.)

     If there are political limits to the permissible change in relative prices,

that may in turn limit the amount of external debt that can be invested in

nontradeables. On the assumptions here, the world price of exports and imports

are unchanged. Therefore, alteration of the internal terms of trade will

require either a currency devaluation, which will raise the local currency

prices of tradeable goods, or a decline in the local prices of nontradeables.

Either course poses difficulties of its own.

    This illustration has assumed a debt/GDP ratio of two. A lower debt ratio

will reduce the required change in relative prices simply because it requires a

smaller increase in exports. This may be another reason for limiting external

borrowing for investment in nontradeables even when it augments GNP. A lower

demand elasticity of substitution will call for a larger change in relative

prices, while allowing the composition of output to respond to relative prices

(assuming investment decisions are made over a period time) will work in the

other direction.

     Finally, any practical limit to the taxing powers of government may in turn

limit the amount of investment in nontradeables. For instance, if 100 percent

of investment is in nontradeables in the example offered in Table 3, the

government must tax 20 percent of GDP (and 25 percent of GNP), valued at

   —ht. rrirc      in crc1r-r tr   zvri 1-T-i     'r1 T-P 1-h rr-r'1

taxation   are 10 percent of GDP, the country will be unable to service external

debt if more than 50 percent is invested in the nontradeable sector.

     A fourth possible answer to the question of why actual debt/GDP ratios are

not higher than they are is that countries face uncertainty in their output and

export receipts. If debt service takes priority and the country has exhausted

its reserves and lines of credit, any shortfall in exports must be met by

squeezing imports. In many developing countries this can be accomplished in

the short run only by cutting production. The necessity of cutting production

from time to time in response to unforeseen shortfalls in net exports in turn

will reduce the optimal level of foreign indebtedness. Usually a less costly-

way of absorbing these shocks is to hold sufficient reserves to cover normal and

even some extraordinary variations in net exports. Such reserves typically will

earn a lower rate of return than could real investment under stable conditions,

but they protect the country from large losses when conditions are not stable.

     One method for hedging against uncertainty in output and export receipts is

for foreign creditors to share the risks directly, as they would do with equity
                                         —65--



 investments. We believe that nst developing countries have paid too little

 attention to the advantages of foreign direct investment ——   not only for sharing
 risks, but also for the technolor transfer that they normally bring. More

 accurately, many countries have been equivocal in their official stance toward

 direct investment and ambivalence —— which is often understandable in historic

terms — does not provide the stable business environment in which foreign

 investment thrives. The political ambivalence is a reality in many countries,

however; and so long as it is there, the scope for proportionately large inflows

of direct investment will 'be limited.

     This brings us to the final section, a discussion of the appropriate mix of

foreign obligations.



The Mix of External Obliat ions

     The discussion so far has been in terms of external debt in conventional

form: interest—bearing debt with a fixed foreign—currency value at maturity.

In practice, a borrower may face several different kinds of opportunity for

drawing capital from the rest of the world: (1) concessional aid, including

grants; (2) equity investment by foreigners, which may involve some managerial

control 'by foreigners (direct investment) or simply minority foreign

shareholders; and (3) interest—bearing fixed value obligations, which in turn

may be directly linked with imports (trade credits), may' involve shorter or

longer maturities, and may be denominated in local or foreign currency-. We

offer some observations on each of these forms of obligation, and on the mix

among theme
                                     —66—


     So long as domestic investment opportunities with expected rates of return

exceeding the cost of foreign capital are available, a country can always raise

its expected level of income by borrowing abroad, but it should be cognizant of

the constraints that we have discussed in previous sections. In particular, it

should take as much concessional aid as possible, provided certain conditions

are met —— and leaving aside the question of political overtones that often

pervade bilateral aid. First, the country is able to service the debt

adequately from tax and other government revenues. Second,

supplementary domestic financing of the aid—supported projects does not draw

domestic savings away from investments that offer far greater returns to the

country. Third, the aid is not so tied up with procurement and other conditions

that it turns out to be much less concessional than it seems at first glance.

Many governments seem to give much greater weight to obtaining low interest

rates, if necessary at the expense of higher purchase prices or lower quality

products, than is economically warranted. This can be a serious mistake, which

arises in accepting medium term trade credits as well as aid—financed projects.

     Foreign equity investments have the obvious advantage over interest—bearing

obligations that they do not have to be amortized and that earnings are likely

to be positively correlated with the general economic performance of the

country. We believe that countries would be well advised to encourage direct

foreign investment so long as the attraction to foreign investors is not due

mainly to price distortions in the economy. In the presence of severe price

distortions, however, foreign investment can actually make the country worse off

(Brecher and Diaz—Alejandro, 1978). Given the high, selective import tariffs
                                             —67--



and other price distortions in many developing countries, this is a serious

problem in evaluating all projects, not merely those undertaken by foreign

investors.

       Direct investment in general has advantages that go beyond the provision of

foreign capital. It introduces technical know—how and useful managerial and

marketing skills. It nay also, in a world of imperfect capital markets, provide

access to additional debt capital for the country. It has the final advantage

that if the activity fails economically, there is no need to repay the capital,

since the foreign investor bears the commercial risk.

       Equity investments also have some disadvantages. First, while earnings

will generally be high when the economy is doing well, remittances of earnings

may not   be   so strongly correlated with   domestic or export performance. They may
actually be somewhat     perverse, since earnings tend to be reinvested more readily

when the economy is going well. More important, foreign investors' behavior ——

like   that of domestic firms engaged in foreign trade —— may aggravate a

liquidity crisis        exporting capital if a devaluation of the currency (or the

introduction of exchange controls) is thought to be imminent. This can be done

either directly or by manipiilating the timing of receipts and payments

associated with exporting and importing. These swings can often be large

relative to the equity stake of the foreign investor. The host country then

faces a dilemma. Absence of exchange controls invites the speculative movement

of capital, but the imposition of exchange controls damages the country's

reputation as a debtor. If exchange controls are in place, they can be used to

discourage speculative withdrawals of capital, but it is difficult to control
                                       —68—


firms that are heavily engaged in foreign trade.

     Finally, it is a fact of life that foreign direct investment, involving

management control and foreign ownership of land, is politically sensitive in

many countries. Too such foreign investment may result in a political reaction

that damages the country's overall reputation as a borrower. In some countries

fear of arousing political sensibilities may be the most significant restraint

on direct investment. And, of course, fear of expropriation is one of the

factors inhibiting investment by prospective foreign investors.

     Foreign purchases of non—controlling equity interests in indigenous firms

carries some but not all of the disadvantages of foreign direct investment, and

joint ventures are actively encouraged by many countries, But for a variety of

reasons, including the lack of well—developed equity markets, the scope for

equity investment in developing countries that does not involve some foreign

influence on management is quite limited.

     Our principal focus above has been on interest—bearing obligations, and

there is little more to be said here. Trade credits, whether officially

guaranteed by the government of the exporting country or not, are often

considered as separate and distinct from bank term loans or other forms of

interest-bearing investment. They represent, as it were, a somewhat separate

"pool" from which borrowing can take place. Because they tend to be less

centralized in the borrowing country, however, they can offer a troublesome

surprise when they begin to dry up during a liquidity crisis. The country then

senses, perhaps for the first time, how large the total of trade credit is and

how difficult it is for the economy to function if such credits suddenly
                                              —69—



  disappear. For this reason, countries that have heavy
                                                              debt obligations should
  monitor   their trade credits closely.

         When it comes to debt maturity,
                                            we ohaerved earlier that a serious mismatch
 between the maturity of cicdits and the maturity of the projeets
                                                                       tibey are
 financing increases the exposure of a
                                             country to liquidity crisis. Having to
 repay   a debt Ibefore the   returns to the project can be realized can be costly.
 For   this reason the id banke" rule of thumb that debt maturity should be
 matched to maturity of the underlying investment is a sound one.
       In principle, countries have the choice of borrowing in their own
 currency or in some foreign currency. Borrowing in the home currency shifts to
 the lender not only convertibility risk but also exchange risk, and he will
 extract   a price for that In reality, few developing countries have a practical
Possibility of borrowing abroad in their home currency on any scale in the
absence of exchange rate guarantees. Indeed, even most developed countries are
limited to borrowing abroad in one of the four or five leading currencies rather
than their own.


Concluding Remarks
       Actual   levels of external borrowing by developing countries are

considerably less than could in principle be serviced from productive

investments. This may      reflect   restraint on the part of borrowers arising from

concerns about their ability to raise the funds required for debt—servicing when

the   projects are   government_sponsored or are in sectors of the econormj that do
not   directly save or generate foreign exchange. It may also reflect concern
                                         —70—



about taking on fixed external obligations in an uncertain world when the

capacity of the domestic economy to absorb shocks at low cost is limited.

    But much of the reason for lower—than—sustainable external borrowing is no

doubt due to constraints imposed by lenders who fear that (1) mismanagement of

the borrowing economy may   reduce   returns on invetraents; (2) future difficulties

may lead the authorities to repudiate the debt, in whole or in part, openly or

(more likely) tacitly; or (3) waves of sentiment in world financial markets may

lead to periodic liquidity crises that prevent an otherwise viable economy from

servicing its debt. ku these factors lead to a supply—of—funds schedule

confronting each borrower that reflects borrowing costs that increase as a

function of outstanding debt and current borrowing levels. Beyond some (on our

calculation, modest) level, higher interest rates elicit no new lending at all.

     From the perspective of debtors, with many productive investment

opportunities, the task is to lower and to flatten the supply of external funds

schedule that it faces. It can thereby increase its gross national product and

per capita income after servicing external debt.      How can it do this?

     Since the main restraints on further borrowing seem to be concerns by

lenders, borrowers must pay attention to these concerns. We offer some

observations which flow from our earlier analysis of external debt.

     First, the debtor can improve lender perceptions of its ability to pay by

concentrating its external borrowing on productive investments (rather than on

consumption —— even though, as we have seen, consumption loans are sometimes

perfectly sensible), especially investments that will generate foreign exchange.

To accomplish the latter aim, the pricing structure of the economy cannot be too
                                       —71—


 far out of line with that prevailing in world markets. Where
                                                                possible, the
 debtor should become thoroughly committed to the investments in question so that

 the scope for diversion of funds away from the project is limited. From this

 point of view, World Bank or regional development bank loans and even

 medium—term trade credits are seen as being in a different and (to the lender)

 more comforting category than are straight term bank loans not linked to

 projects or to procurement of project—related equipment.

      Second, the debtor can improve lender perceptions concerning its

willingness to pay by raising the visible costs to itself that would be incurred

on non—payment. That could involve such traditional steps as offering central

government guarantees, posting collateral (e.g. reserves), pledging particular

export revenues, agreeing to third party arbitration or even to jurisdiction of

courts in the lending countries, and so on.

     Receptivity to foreign direct investment is taken as a positive general

attitude toward foreign capital even when direct investment flows themselves are

small. The country can over time establish a reputation for punctiliousness in

servicing its debts. Since good reputation is itself an important asset,

especially in the world of finance, loss of reputation is one of the visible

costs associated with non—payment. Cooperation of international institutions

such as the World Bank and the regional development banks in the investment

planning and financing can also improve perceived willingness to pay, since each

country's relationships with these institutions is a continuing one, and no

government likes to be a pariah in organizations that they must deal with on a

regular basis.
                                       —72—


     Finally, to reduce the harm from liquidity crises, and hence also the

probability of a liquidity crisis, the country should recognize the advantage of

longer maturities of debt, and balance these advantages against the higher costs

of long—term debt. Similarly, the debtor should recognize the gains from

diversifying the sources and character of its external financial support as much

as possible. Although trade credits and direct investment are not immune     to   the

forces involved in a liquidity crisis, as we have seen, they are influenced by-

somewhat different factors, and thus may help to forestall a liquidity crisis.

     When it comes to bank term lending, on the other hand, having a strong lead

bank whose leadership is accepted by other banks perhaps offers better assurance

against a liquidity crisis than does borrowing from a larger number of unrelated

banks. The former arrangement to some extent internalizes the externality that

generates liquidity crises.

     The conventional indicators of capacity to handle external debt, such as

the debt—servicing ratio or the debt/GDP ratio, have little theoretical basis,

at least in the vicinity where they are generally observed. Nonetheless, they

have become important indicators in the eyes of lenders, with each borrowing

country measured both against other countries and against the borrowing

country's own past, and that makes them important to borrowers. A sharp

increase in these indicators is taken as a warning signal even when they are

relatively low. Expectations concerning appropriate levels can be altered only

gradually,    and in the context of other actions that persuade lenders of the
soundness    of   the borrowing.

                     Simulation Models for Optimal Borrowing



      This appendix illustrates the use of simulation techniques to calculate

optimal borrowing paths, While we rely on fairly simply dynamic models, the

methods may be directly extended to more complicated, multi—sector models.

Earlier stadies using the techniques in this appendix include: Blanchard

(1983), Sachs (1983), Bruno and Sachs (1983), Lipton and Sachs (1983),

Blanchard and Sachs (1983),

     We illustrate three models from the text: (1) the one—sector optimal

borrowing model; (2) the two—sector (traded and non—traded goods) optimal

borrowing model; and (3) the one—sector model with a public sector facing tax

constraints.

     We make only one amendment to the models in the text, namely that

investment imposes adjustment costs on the economy, so that the marginal product

of capital FK should adjust slowly rather than instantaneously to equal the

world cost of capital. In particular, following Hayashi (1982), we distinguish

between gross capital formation         and total investment expenditure       which

includes adjustment costs as well as the direct cost of capital goods.

Specifically, let i be the per—unit adjustment cost, so that         =     +
                                                                                -
Now, we assume that 4'   is   not constant but rather a linear function of the rate

of capital formation, 4' =     (/2)(J/ic).   Thus, rapid investment rates impose

higher per—unit costs of adjustment than slow investment rates. The
                                                     -74—


accumulation equation is: Kt+i                    Kt(1_d) +        where d is the rate of geometric

depreciation. Since                 =   Jil   + (412)(JIK)I, we may derive that

     =               + (K/4)ll+2$(It/Kt). Plugging this into the accumulation equation

yields:

(Al)               K+i =   K(l_d)    + f(I,Kt)


where          =               + (K/)v'1+2(It/Kt)
                   _Oc/4)
For later reference, we note that                     =   —(l/)   + (l/wl+2$(It/Kt)

+                                   en              is small,          0.

         The infinite—horizon, one—sector borrowing problem is shown in Table Al.

The aggregate production function is Q(K). Implicitly, labor is held fixed

at        =   1.    Note that for completeness government expenditure has been placed in

the utility function. The entire system is set up as a Lagrangian and the

first—order conditions are solved in Part III of the table.                          is the co—state

variable (or dynamic Lagrange multiplier) attached to D, so it represents the

marginal utility of wealth.                    is the shadow value of installed capital. In

all, the system is a four—dimensional, non—linear difference equation system in

X, u.,, Kt, and D. We solve the system below, for particular numerical values.

         It is easy to extend the model to include non—traded goods, with

sector—specific capital and freely mobile labor. Thus, we introduce production

functions QT = FT(KT,LT) and QN = FN(KN,LN).                      Full employment of labor requires

L = LT + LN.          Capital     in each sector is governed by an accumulation equation

of the form                =             + f(I,K), where i = T,N.           For simplicity, we
                               K(l—d)
treat all investment expenditure as drawing on the traded good (this can easily

be modified). Thus, the market—clearing condition for non—traded goods is

non—traded goods relative to traded goods in the model. If the optimal

of the other variables may be expressed in terms of these six variables.

       The final model we consider is the one—sector, tax—constrained econon,

in which official borrowing is used to augment (sub—optimal) private savings,

but in which the maximum tax rate is constrained to be below some rate 't. As

explained in the text, private saving is assumed to be a constant fraction s of

after—tax income (l_t)Q, so that private consumption expenditure is

C =                        Total investment expenditure is equal to private savings,

government controls C,I, and G. In other words, when taxes are unconstrained,

the economy- can reach the first—best optimum of Table Al, even though private

savings are set in an ad hoc way as a fixed fraction of disposable income.

        The more interesting case occurs when the tax constraint t is binding,

      The tax management problem is shown in Table A3.        It is convenient to

re—write the tax constraint as a constraint on consumption, C.,

where       =   (1—s)(l--)Q.   Then we rewrite the first—order conditions (a) and

level of consumption that would be chosen assuming that the tax constraint is

not binding in the current period. Actual consumption is given by C =



      The problem in Table A3 presents a highly non—linear difference equation

system in four variables: D, K, ''                The other variables can all be

expressed as functions of these four variables.

Two simulations              are performed. In the first, we begin with K0 below the

steady state level in the one—sector model and compare the adjustment costs in

the tax—constrained (                   = 0.)5) and tax—unconstrained model ( = 1.0).   Remember

that the case t              = 1.0     in the model of Table A3 will give exactly the same

outcome as the solution to the model of Table Al. In the second simulation,

the process of capital accumulation in the traded/non—traded goods model is

studied.

     Figure Al illustrates the basic proposition with respect to the fiscal

constraint: with low t, the country should not borrow as rapidly as on the

unconstrained path. The solid line is the debt/GDP ratio for the unconstrained

case, and the dotted line is the optimum path in the constrained case (the

economy is assumed to begin in 19T0 with D/Q equal to 0.38). When taxes are

unconstrained foreign borrowing is more rapid and stabilizes at a much

higher level of debt than in the tax—constrained case. Note that the optimal

path in the unconstrained case involves a very high D/Q ratio, a point we made

in the text in a static context. Figure A2 illustrates the path of physical

capital in the two economies. The counterpart of the larger foreign borrowing

in the unconstrained economy is more rapid capital formation and a higher

steady—state capital stock.

    The two—sector model simulation is illustrated in part in Figure A3. Once
                                                          T
again, we assume that capital stocks klfl this case both K0 and    are

sufficiently low so that rapid accumulation of capital should take place in both

sectors. As shown in the Figure A3, the relative price of non—traded goods

declines over time, as the initial current account turns into eventual balance

and the initial trade deficit turns into long—run surplus. Figure A4 shows

the paths of    and KT. In the simulation shown, the optimal planner (or the

market, in its decentralized interpretation) has perfect foresight of the

long—run changes in N1T In practice, however, it is likely that many agents
                                                      NT
will underestimate the necessary long—run decline in P /P , and thereby

over—invest in the non—traded goods sector in the initial phase of adjustment.

Such over—investment would eventually necessitate even larger declines in

traded goods sector.

     The simulation techniques outlined here can be extended to larger and more

realistic models that include Keynesian and monetary features not explored in

this paper (see Blanchard and Sachs, 1983, for an example). Such models should

prove fruitful in improving medium—term assessments of an economy's

debt—servicing capacity and creditworthiness.

1.      Equation (2) implicitly assumes that               is independent of C. each period,

which is correct under the assumptions made. In more general models, with a

variable labor supply or with work effort a function of C, we cannot simply

maximize TBt each period by setting C =

2.      Such a Ponzi scheme is called a "rational speculative bubble" in the

finance literature, where it is shown that with n >                r the      bubble can last

forever.      In a sense, the debt is an "unbacked asset" that maintains value

because each creditor believes that future creditors will make the necessary

loans to the debtor country.

3.      Note that by writing C =              — (1+r)D1, we are assuming that the borrower
always repays             and never opts to repudiate if credit rationing on                 in fact

occurs.
