                                            ABSTRACT

This paper uses the records of the Union Army to compare the older age mortality experience of the

first black and white cohorts who reached middle and late ages in the twentieth century. Blacks faced

a greater risk of death from all causes, especially in large cities, from infectious and parasitic

diseases, from genito-urinary disease, and from heart disease, particularly valvular heart disease.

Blacks' greater risk of death was the result both of the worse conditions in which they lived at the

time of their deaths and of their lifelong poorer nutritional status and higher incidence of infectious

disease. Compared to the 1821-40 black cohort, the 1841-50 black cohort was both under greater

stress at a young age and had higher older age mortality rates.

1    Introduction

The first cohort of African-Americans to reach age 65 in the twentieth century faced tremendous

stress throughout the life-cycle. In most of the North schools and public transport were segre-

gated and employers were unwilling to hire for jobs other than common labor. Those blacks who

crowded into the large cities, where infectious and parasitic diseases ravaged the worse sections of

town, were described as the “poorest, the most thriftless, and perhaps the most troublesome part

of the population” (quoted in McPherson 1965: 247). An index of their misery is provided by

their experience during the 1832 cholera epidemic which in Philadelphia had a case rate twice as

high among blacks as among whites (Ewbank 1987). In the South the work routine of pregnant

women and the poor diet of slave children led to a mortality rate before age 5 of 385 per thousand

and to mean heights that by age 10 had only reached the first percentile of modern height stan-

dards (Steckel 1986). In contrast, between 1880 and 1900 black mortality rates before age 5 were

265 per 1000 (Ewbank 1987) and slum children in today’s developing countries attain the twelfth

centile of modern height standards. Although the mortality rates and heights of adult slaves al-

most caught up to those of whites because slaves who reached field-hand age were fed a diet high

in protein (Steckel 1986), the diet of African-Americans may have deteriorated under freedom as

southern food production declined (Rose 1989; Ransom and Sutch 1977). Contemporary observers

reported a high incidence of tuberculosis, pneumonia, typhoid, syphilis, malaria, pellagra, rickets,

whooping cough, and hookworm among blacks in the postbellum era (Kiple and King 1981: 189:

Holmes 1937: 39). The postwar migration of southern blacks to cities (Vickery 1977) probably

compounded nutritional distress, because rural blacks may have lacked immunities to diseases

common in urban areas and because only after 1900 did improved sanitation and water supplies

lower black childhood mortality rates in cities.

    This paper uses the records of the Union Army to compare the mortality experience of the first

white and black cohorts who reached middle and older ages in the twentieth century. It quantifies

                                                   1
the older age mortality penalty to being black and examines mortality differences between former

slaves and freemen. It analyzes the importance of cities (and their clean-up) to the mortality differ-

entials of the elderly, who are a particularly vulnerable group, and does so in a population that lived

both in large cities and in rural areas and in both the north and the south. With few exceptions (e.g.

Preston and Haines 1991), most studies of black and white mortality differentials have focused on

larger cities or the northern states because smaller cities and rural areas and southern states often

did not collect mortality statistics.

   The Union Army data also allow me to examine mortality patterns for the different black and

white cohorts born 1821-50. The 1830s and even more so the 1840s were a time of disease epi-

demics in both the north and the south (Kiple and King 1981: 147-157) and the decline in white

health is well documented. Among the white population, heights began to decline with the cohorts

born in the 1830s relative to earlier cohorts, reaching a trough in the 1880s (Fogel 1986). Genealo-

gies show a decline in white life expectancy at age 20 in the first half of the nineteenth century

(Pope 1992). The health evidence for the black population is mixed. Some data sources show a

decline in heights similar to that observed among whites and other sources showing none (Margo

and Steckel 1982; Komlos 1992; Komlos 1997; Bodenhorn 1999). Military records show a lower

lung capacity and higher waist-hip ratio of later black relative to early black cohorts at military

ages, suggesting that later cohorts may have had lower birth weights or a higher prevalence of

early life infections (Costa 2004).

   The implications of this paper extend beyond the Civil War cohort. The health of one generation

can have a long reach. Lower health leads to lower productivity and output and therefore reduces

investments in children’s health and education. The death of the breadwinner could leave the family

destitute. Because the Civil War cohort reached old age at the beginning of the twentieth century

its experience can help us understand the early life conditions faced by more recent cohorts. These

effects of early life conditions can persist to older ages, as seen in studies of the long-term effects


                                                  2
of place of birth, disease exposure, and season of birth on older age mortality (Preston, Hill, and

Drevenstedt 1998; Almond 2003; Doblhammer and Vaupel 2001; Costa and Lahey 2003).



2    Older Age Mortality Trends

Our knowledge of historic differentials in black and white mortality trends in the United States

is based upon scattered and selective pieces of information. Until 1933 the United States did not

have a complete death registration system and the states that did have a death registration system

tended to be the northern states where relatively few blacks resided. I therefore establish trends in

older age mortality rates by examining survivorship rates for ten year age groups of the native-born

across the available micro census samples of the decennial censuses. That is, I calculate ten year

mortality rates, mi , for each cell i, where a cell i consists of a race, age, sex, cohort, and region of

birth group and estimate weighted OLS regressions, where the weights are equal to cell sizes. The

estimating equations are


                                       mi = α + βBi + δXi + ui                                       (1)

                                 log(mi ) = α + βBi + δXi + ui                                       (2)


where Bi is a dummy variable indicating black race, Xi is a vector of controls for age, sex, cohort,

and region of birth and ui is an error term. Because a drawback of this method is mis-reporting of

age, I do not include the very old in my analysis and restrict the age groups to 50-79.

    Differential mortality rates by race at middle and late ages were at their highest at the beginning

of the twentieth century (see Table 1). The better fitting linear specification shows that for the

cohort born 1791-1810 and observed in 1870-80 there were no differential mortality effects by

race. In contrast for the cohorts born 1821-1860 and observed in 1900-1920, black mortality

rates were 25 percent higher than the mean. Within the 1821-1860 cohorts, mortality rates rose

                                                   3
for later black cohorts but not for later white cohorts (see Table 2). Black cohorts born after

1861 and observed beginning in 1940 started to catch up to their white counterparts in terms of

mortality, with mortality rates roughly 11-12 percent above the mean. Although black mortality

rates were 11-12 percent above the mean for both the cohorts born 1861-1900 and the cohorts

born 1901-1940, mean mortality rates for both races were much lower for the 1901-1940 cohorts

than for earlier cohorts. The absolute difference between white and black mortality rates declined.

(The logarithmic specification magnifies the effects of differences at low mortality levels.) Racial

mortality differentials were not statistically significantly different by region of birth. Data from the

death registration states also show that there were substantial differentials in older age mortality

rates at the beginning of the century and that these narrowed but are still sizable and persistent (see

Figure 1).1

       The large racial differentials observed for the 1821-60 cohort may be explained by both cohort

and period effects. Increased urbanization, greater migration and immigration, and developments

in transportation all facilitated the spread of disease and may explain why death rates rose over

the middle of the nineteenth century, especially in urban areas. In the 1880s urban mortality was

50 percent higher than rural mortality and nowhere was the urban mortality penalty as large as in

the poor areas of town where blacks lived. In Baltimore, Washington DC, Charleston, and New

Orleans in 1880 half of all black children may have been dead by age 5. Then, between 1880 and

1900 white death rates started to fall whereas those for blacks they were constant or even rising.

The biggest improvements in both black and white mortality rates occurred first in large urban

areas and then in smaller ones. By 1940 the urban penalty had disappeared for whites though it

still persisted for blacks (Haines forthcoming; Haines 2002; Preston and Haines 1991: 128-134;

Ewbank 1987). Within cities the decline in black childhood mortality rates lagged behind that in
   1
    The figure is likely to overstate black-white mortality differentials at older ages at the beginning of the twentieth
century because during this time period the death registration states were mainly urban, northern states and the urban
mortality penalty for blacks was large (Haines, forthcoming).

white mortality rates because of delays in the black population receiving basic sewer and water

services and because the lower relative income of blacks meant that a greater proportion of blacks

lived in houses without adequate sanitation facilities (Troesken 2004; Ewbank 1987). Thus initial

declines in white mortality rates should be accompanied by a widening of racial mortality differ-

entials. Data for other age groups also suggest that racial mortality differentials were particularly

high at the beginning of the twentieth century. Data from the death registration states (not shown)

show large differentials in infant mortality rates at the start of the century which then narrowed but

still persist to this day. Running regressions similar to Equation 1 for the same cohorts for ages 20-

49 shows that black-white mortality differentials were large in the 1870s, increased sharply in the

early 1900s, and then narrowed again.2 These regressions, however, also imply that the elevated

black mortality rates relative to those of whites observed for the cohorts born close to the end of

slavery were not just an older-age phenomenon. They are observed at younger ages as well. The

1821-60 cohort may have been disadvantaged even before reaching middle and older ages.



3        Econometric Framework

Why were racial mortality differentials at middle and late ages so high for the cohort that reached

these ages at the beginning of the twentieth century? The Union Army data can provide some clues.

These longitudinal data have many advantages over aggregate mortality statistics. I can control for

wartime experience, size of city of residence at both early and late ages, and socioeconomic and

demographic characteristics. Misreporting of age cannot increase as the population ages. I can also

examine causes of death and these provide some evidence on unobserved underlying morbidity.

        I analyze the penalty to being black and to being black in an urban area by examining waiting

     The coefficients on the black dummy were 0.042 (σ̂=0.020) for the 1821-50 cohort observed in 1870-80, 0.108
(σ̂=0.013) for the 1861-90 cohort observed in 1910-20, and 0.034 (σ̂=0.011) for the 1901-1940 cohort observed in
1940-1990.

                  λ(t) = exp(B  βB + C  βC + (B  × C  )βBC + X  βX )λ0 (t)                      (3)


where B is a vector indicating that the individual is black, C is vector of control variables indicating

city size, B × C is the interaction between black and city size, X is a vector of control variables

for wartime experience, socioeconomic status, and demographic characteristics, and λ0 (t) is the

baseline hazard which I assume to Gompertz, λ0 (t) = exp(γt). I examine both cities at enlistment

and city of residence circa 1900. I define a large city at enlistment as one whose population was

50,000 or more in 1860 (the top 13 cities). In previous work I found that among white veterans

those who enlisted in one of these cities had higher older age mortality even controlling for later

residence, but that there were no older age mortality effects to enlisting in smaller cities (Costa

2003). I define a large city of residence in 1900 as one of the top 100 cities in the United States

(a population of 38,307 or more). Because the sample of black veterans is not yet linked to the

1900 census, place of residence information is often not precise, but the top 100 cities are easily

identified. This classification will most likely underestimate the urban penalty. Relative to cities

with populations below 5,000 and to rural areas, cities with populations of 5,000 to 25,000 had

higher mortality rates in 1900 (Haines forthcoming).

   I test for cohort effects by looking within the black sample and using hazard models of the form


                                λ(t) = exp(Y  βY + X  βX )λ0 (t)                                   (4)


where Y is a vector indicating birth cohort, X is vector of control variables, and λ0 (t) is the baseline

hazard which I assume to Gompertz, λ0 (t) = exp(γt). The hazard ratios that I report indicate

whether a one unit change in an independent variable gives an increase or decrease in the odds of

an event.


                                                   6
       For men for whom cause of death is known, I also estimate independent competing risk models

for specific causes of death, treating other causes of death as censored. These provide some clues

on why mortality experience differed by city size or by cohort of birth. The primary causes of

death studied are the combined categories of 1) heart and cerebrovascular disease; 2) infectious

and parasitic disease and bronchitis, pneumonia, and influenza; and, 3) genito-urinary disease

(including all mention of the prostate and of kidney problems). I can further subdivide heart and

cerebrovascular into its two separate components. Although heart disease is often not classified by

type, in some cases I can identify valvular and ischemic heart diseases to investigate the etiology of

heart disease.3 Although the three categories were picked because of their importance in the Union

Army data, they were also important causes of death for the population as a whole. DuBois (1899:

159) wrote that in Philadelphia in 1884-90, “The Negroes exceed the white death rate largely in

consumption, pneumonia, diseases of the urinary system, heart disease and dropsy, and in still-

births; they exceed moderately in diarrheal diseases, diseases of the nervous system, malarial and

typhoid fevers.”

       High infectious disease rates among African-Americans could increase their mortality rates

from all three causes of death, particularly in large cities. Although black rejection rates for Civil

War service for pulmonary tuberculosis were lower than those of whites, the case rate for tubercu-

losis was 6.06 per 1000 for white soldiers and 7.26 per 1000 for black soldiers. The tuberculosis

death rate was 2.18 per 1000 for whites and 6.31 for blacks. Death rates per thousand for respi-

ratory disease were 7.40 for whites and 32.35 for blacks (cited in Holmes 1937: 75). The army

experience suggests that migration, particularly to large cities, may have led to a tuberculosis and

respiratory disease epidemic among the black population. However, some of the initial precondi-

tions may already have been present. Rejection rates for scrofula (a degeneration of the lymphatic

glands due to tuberculosis) were higher for blacks than for whites (Holmes 1937: 75). Kiple and
   3
    Valvular heart disease is defined as all deaths which mention valvular heart disease or rheumatism. Ischemic heart
disease is defined as all mentions of atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, heart failure, or myocardial insufficiency.


                                                            7
King (1981: 142) point out in that in the first and second generation exposed to tuberculosis, there

is extensive glandular involvement and that only in the third exposed generation is classic pul-

monary tuberculosis observed. Whooping cough in infancy predicts later pulmonary distress and

in Charleston, SC between 1822 and 1848 the average annual death rate for blacks from whoop-

ing cough was 650.5 per 1000 compared to 305.8 per thousand for the white population (cited in

Holmes 1937: 64). World War I statistics, which show that the rate of admission to sick report

for pulmonary tuberculosis was two and a half times as high among black soldiers as among white

soldiers (Holmes 1937: 81) suggest that the pulmonary epidemic was long-lasting.

       Infectious disease also has chronic sequelae. A substantial fraction of heart disease in the past

was valvular and therefore due to rheumatic fever, a disease associated with crowding. Other forms

of heart disease may have resulted from infectious disease as well. Infections that have cardiac

involvement include syphilis, measles, and typhoid fever. Syphilis can also lead to stroke. The

experience of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company from 1911 to 1930 led one researcher

to conclude that syphilis accounted for a third of all cardiac conditions among blacks and that

it could explain both premature deaths from cerebral hemorrhage and arteriosclerosis (cited in

Holmes 1937: 113). The category of genito-urinary disease may also include deaths due to tertiary

syphilis. Neurosyphilis can have urological manifestations; glomerulonephritis (a type of kidney

disease) is a sequelae of tertiary syphilis; and, syphilis may increase the risk of prostate cancer

(Hayes et al. 2000; Ertruk, Sheinfeld, and Davis 1989). Syphilis rates were higher among the

black population than the white population and racial differences were probably bigger in larger

cities because black men in metropolitan areas were more likely to live apart from their families

than men in non-metropolitan areas.4 During World War I, 12.63 per 1000 of white soldiers were
   4
     A higher prevalence rate of syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases in large cities is consistent with the
high rates of childlessness observed among ever married black women. In 1910 among ever married black women age
40-49 living in metropolitan areas 18 percent were childless compared to 8 percent of those living in non-metropolitan
areas. The comparable figures for white women of the same age were 12 and 9 percent, respectively (estimated from
the integrated public use micro census samples).

diagnosed with syphilis compared to 64.99 per thousand of black soldiers (cited in Holmes 1937:

4      Data

By the end of the Civil War, 186,017 black men had entered the US Colored Troops, 26 percent of

them from the free states, 22 percent of them from the border states and the District of Columbia,

and 50 percent of them from Confederacy. Three-quarters of all Colored Troops were former

slaves. The fraction of age-eligible black men who served was 78 percent in the free northern

states, 34 percent in the border states, and 11 percent in the Confederacy (Metzer 1981). In the

Confederacy there were active recruitment efforts whenever an area was liberated by the Union

Army and the states that were occupied before the end of the war provided the most men.5 In the

random sample of black soldiers used in this paper, 91 percent were volunteers (a fraction similar

to that for whites), 7 percent were substitutes, and 2 percent were draftees.

    The black sample used in this paper is based upon the military service and pension records of

5,673 black Union Army soldiers in 51 infantry companies.6 All of the men in the 51 companies

were sampled. The military service records provide information on events such as wartime deaths,

injury and illness, antebellum occupation, age at enlistment, and place of enlistment. Place of

enlistment is not as good a proxy for place of residence for southern enlistees as it is for north-

ern enlistees because there were fewer recruiting centers in the south and these would draw from

the neighboring countryside for enlistees. The pension records document postbellum mortality,
    5
      It was not just slaves who were mistreated who joined the Union Army. Among the first 10 slave narratives that
recounted own or a family member’s voluntary service in the Union Army (out of the first 12 narratives there are two
recounting capture in the Union Army while a servant in the Confederate Army), 6 mentioned that the master was
good, 3 did not mention the master, and 1 recounted escape to the Union Army after severe mistreatment. See the
database, American Slavery: A Composite Autobiography.
    6
      The sample represents roughly 2.7 percent of all blacks serving. The data were collected by a team of researchers
led by Robert Fogel. Once the data are completed and cleaned, they will be available from the Center for Population
Economics at the University of Chicago, http://www.cpe.uchicago.edu.

residence, occupation, and writing ability. The control variables that I create are dummies indi-

cating occupation at enlistment (farmer, artisan, laborer, professional or proprietor, and unknown),

dummies indicating occupation circa 1900 (farmer, artisan, laborer, professional or proprietor, and

unknown), a dummy indicating whether or not the veteran could write, dummies indicating region

of residence circa 1900 (east, midwest or west, border, and south), dummies indicating whether

the soldier ever was a POW and whether the soldier ever had specific medical conditions while

in the army (tuberculosis, stomach, rheumatic fever, respiratory, diarrhea, typhoid, malaria, fever,

and wounded), size of city of enlistment or residence in 1900, and age or cohort dummies.

       The black sample is representative of the US Colored Troops in terms of geography and slave

status. Twenty-nine percent of the men in the sample were free, 28 percent of them were from

the free states, and the remaining 72 percent were from the border and southern states. Twenty-

two percent of these men died while in the service, a higher service mortality rate than that of 14

percent for white soldiers, mainly because sanitary conditions for black troops were so poor.

       Comparisons are drawn with a random sample of white Union Army soldiers, which is based

upon the military service of almost 35,000 men and is described extensively elsewhere (e.g. Costa

2000; Costa 2002; Costa 2003).7 The white sample is representative of the northern-born and

pre-1861 immigrant population in terms of wealth (Fogel 2001). Although the white sample is

primarily a northern sample whereas the black sample is primarily a southern sample, recall that

the census data revealed no statistically significant difference in racial differentials by region of

birth.

       Two different subsets of the Union Army samples are used. Both restrict the data to men on the

pension rolls because the pension rolls are the only source of information on subsequent mortality.

One subset consists of everyone alive and on the pension rolls at age 60 and is used to examine

cohort effects. This subset provides data on 10,872 white native-born men and 894 black native-
   7
       The white Union Army sample is available at http://www.cpe.uchicago.edu.

born men. The second subset is of everyone alive and on the pension rolls in 1900 and allows

me to control for socioeconomic status and provides better controls for residence circa 1900. This

subset provides data on 9605 native-born white veterans and 954 native-born black veterans.

       Entry on the pension rolls used to obtain information about subsequent mortality was relatively

non-discriminatory by the standards of the time. Both black and white veterans were eligible for

a pension for war-related injuries. In 1890 pensions began to be paid for any disability, regardless

of its relation to the war, and the Pension Bureau began to consider age 65 or older as a disability

unless men were “unusually vigorous.” By 1907 old age was officially recognized by Congress

as a disability. Among all men who identified themselves as Union veterans in the 1910 census,

86 percent of the white veterans and 79 percent of the black veterans were found in the pension

records. Soldiers who survived the war were less likely to have a pension if they were deserters

(deserters who never returned to fight were ineligible), if they had never been injured in the war,

if they had never been promoted, if they were from a regiment that saw little fighting, if they had

been born in the Confederacy, if they were free men at enlistment, and if they were dark-skinned.

       The veteran samples contain men who circa 1900 were more northern, of slightly higher occu-

pational status, and more urban than the postbellum black population of the same age. Twenty-two

percent of black veterans in the sample lived in one of the top 100 cities in the United States circa

1900. Among non-veterans of the same age group in 1910 the comparable figure was 10 percent.

Veterans had higher urbanization rates than non-veterans in the south as well. Among black veter-

ans who were on the pension rolls by 1900, 41 percent of those reporting a last occupation were

farmers and 11 percent were professionals, proprietors, or artisans. The comparable figures for all

5    Mortality of Black and White Veterans

The survival probabilities of both black and white native-born Union Army veterans were substan-

tially lower than those of men of the same race observed in the first National Health and Nutrition

Examination Survey and followed until 1992 (see Figure 2) and the largest mortality improvement

has been for blacks. Even though black men first observed in the 1970s achieved roughly the sur-

vival probabilities of white Union Army soldiers, the survival probabilities of black Union Army

veterans were very low relative relative to those of white veterans. Adjusting for age differences,

after 20 years over 60 percent of native-born white veterans age 50-74 in 1900 were still alive

compared to roughly 40 percent of black veterans in the same age group (see Figure 2). When

black veterans are compared with white veterans born abroad, they most closely resemble the Irish

(see Figure 3).

    Figure 2 probably underestimates mortality improvements for both races for the population as

a whole and particularly so for blacks. Both black and white native-born Union Army veterans

had lower 10 year mortality rates at middle and older ages than their racial counterparts in the

population as a whole. Examining 10 year survivorship rates in the Integrated Public Use Census

data implies that the 10 year mortality rates for black men age 50-59 and 60-69 were 0.386 and

0.559, respectively. The respective mortality rates for black Union Army veterans were 0.346 and

0.431. Among white men in the census 10 year mortality rates at ages 50-59 and 60-69 were 0.232

and 0.412, higher than the rates of 0.215 and 0.347 in those age groups observed among white

Union Army veterans.

    Cause of death information provides some clues on the likely causes of the large racial mortality

differentials observed among Union Army veterans. This information is available for 44 percent

of black veterans and 48 percent of white veterans. It is more likely to be available if there was

a surviving spouse and is more common for later cohorts. Availability in the black sample does

not depend upon region of residence, but it does depend upon urbanization in 1900. Thus cause

                                                 12
of death is not known for 62 percent of black men who in 1900 lived in a city that was not one

of the 100 largest cities in the country. For black men who lived in one of the 100 largest cities

the comparable figure is 38 percent. Among black men with some cause of death information, 20

percent of those in the south had a vague or unclassifiable cause of death whereas only 10 percent

of those in the north did. Among both whites and blacks vague and unclassifiable causes of death

were also more common when there was no surviving spouse and are more common for earlier

cohorts.

        Table 3 shows that the proportion of deaths attributable to heart and cerebrovascular disease

rises for later white cohorts but remains constant across black cohorts.9 The proportion attributable

to infectious and parasitic diseases and to bronchitis, pneumonia, and influenza falls for later white

cohorts but remains constant across black cohorts. The proportion attributable to genito-urinary

disease rises for later cohorts of either race.



6        Death and the City

Large cities were deadly for both whites and blacks, but especially so for blacks. Figure 4 shows

that among men who enlisted in cities of 50,000 or more in 1860 there was a substantial urban

mortality penalty at late ages for white veterans. The magnitude of the urban penalty for whites

was equivalent to that of being a black slave. Although sample sizes are small, free blacks who

enlisted in cities with a population of 50,000 or more suffered a tremendous older age mortality

penalty. In contrast, there was no such urban penalty for black slaves. Perhaps place of enlistment

was not as good an indicator of place of residence or birth for slaves as it was for free men. Whites

who in 1900 lived in one of the 100 largest cities fared no worse than whites who lived in smaller
    9
     Note that cerebrovascular death rates are lower for blacks than for whites. The 1915 data for the death registration
states show that at ages 65+ deaths from cerebrovascular disease were lower for whites than for non-whites. By 1925,
non-white cerebrovascular death rates were lower only at ages 75+ and by 1980 they were lower only at ages 85 (see
the Center for Disease Control’s series hist290, http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/datawh/statab/unpubd/mortabs/hist290.htm.

cities (see Figure 5). In contrast, among blacks there was an urban mortality penalty by size of city

of residence in 1900.

   The urban mortality penalties observed in Figures 4 and 5 persist controlling for wartime ex-

perience, socioeconomic status, and later and earlier residence. Table 4 shows that there was a

permanent scarring effect of enlisting in a large city for whites (their odds of dying were 1.2 times

greater than those of whites enlisting in a small city) whereas for blacks there was none. (Blacks

enlisting in large cities had lower mortality rates than those enlisting in smaller cities, largely be-

cause this category is dominated by former slaves who enlisted in large southern cities but may not

have lived there.) The odds of death were 1.3 times higher for black veterans who in 1900 lived in

a large city than for black veterans who did not live in a large city whereas for whites there was no

effect on mortality of living in a large city in 1900. Odds of death and city size were not linearly

related (not shown). There was no urban penalty for either whites or blacks of living in one of the

top 13 cities in the country in 1900, perhaps because the largest cities were the first ones to install

a modern sewage and water infrastructure (and suggesting also that persistence of residence does

not explain the effect of city of enlistment on older age mortality). For whites there was no urban

penalty to living in the next 87 largest cities (the hazard ratio was 1.014, σ̂=0.049), but for blacks

there was a substantial penalty (the hazard ratio was 1.328, σ̂=0.144).

   A high urban mortality penalty for the top 100 cities explains roughly 15 percent of racial

differences in older age mortality rates. The difference in the predicted number of years lived

between blacks and whites in the sample was 2.0 years. Had there been no men in large cities in

1900 this difference would have fallen to 1.7 years. Even in a sample where blacks were more

urban than the black population as a whole, relatively few men lived in large cities and, as Table 4

shows, even in smaller cities the penalty to being black was substantial. The odds of death for a

black veteran in a small city and age 50-74 in 1900 were 1.3 times those of a native-born white

veteran in the same age group and in a small city controlling for individual socioeconomic and


                                                  14
demographic characteristics at enlistment, while in the service, and circa 1900.

   The penalty to being black was large in all regions of the country, but especially large in the

border states (not shown). When the white and black samples were restricted to men living within

a particular region, the hazard ratio on the black dummy variable was 1.538 (σ̂=0.153) for men

living in the border states, 1.366 (σ̂=0.144) for men living in the south, and 1.190 (σ̂=0.087) for

men living in the former free states. The racial mortality differential between the border states and

the former free states was statistically significantly different at the 10 percent level.

   Hazard regressions that examine the effects of slave status reveal the same patterns seen in

Figure 4 (not shown). Controlling for wartime experience, socioeconomic status, and later and

earlier residence, both ex-slaves and freemen fared worse than whites. Although the hazard ratio

on the interaction term between the dummy for a free black man and the dummy for enlisting in a

large city was not statistically significantly different from 1, suggesting that there was no additional

urban penalty for free blacks relative to native-born whites, the magnitude suggests that free blacks

did face an additional urban penalty. Both free blacks and the ex-slaves faced similarly sized urban

penalties to living in one of the top 100 cities in 1900 relative to whites.

   Table 5 illustrates the importance of infectious disease in explaining racial mortality differen-

tials. Elevated black mortality rates both in large cities and in smaller cities and rural areas are

due to infectious and parasitic disease and to bronchitis, influenza, and pneumonia. The odds of a

black veteran during from infectious disease were 1.5 times higher than those of a white veteran.

Although the magnitude of the coefficient on the interaction between the black dummy and top

100 city suggests that mortality rates from these causes were higher for blacks in large than in

small cities, the results are not statistically significant. Blacks living in a large city in 1900 faced

an odds of dying of genito-urinary disease that was twice that of blacks living in a smaller city or

of whites and an odds of dying from cerebrovascular and heart disease that was 1.5 times that of

blacks living in a smaller city or of whites. Excess black deaths in cities from the combined cate-


                                                   15
gory of cerebrovascular and heart disease were mainly due to cerebrovascular disease. In smaller

cities and rural areas blacks were at lower risk of death from cerebrovascular disease than whites

(the hazard ratio on the black dummy was 0.428 with a standard error of 0.146 and the hazard

ratio on the coefficient of the interaction between black and the top 100 cities was 3.327 with a

hazard ratio of 1.354). Recall that because black men in metropolitan areas were more likely to

live apart from their families than black men in non-metropolitan areas, syphilis and other sex-

ually transmitted diseases may have been more prevalent in large cities, leading to higher death

rates from genito-urinary disease and from cerebrovascular disease. Blacks in both urban and rural

areas suffered from a higher death rate from valvular heart disease (the hazard ratio on the black

dummy was 2.770, with a standard error of 0.662), but there was no urban penalty for valvular

heart disease. There is some suggestion of an urban penalty to ischemic disease, but the results are

not statistically significant.

    Certain wartime diseases predicted older age mortality by cause. Respiratory infections during

the war were associated with later mortality from infectious and parasitic disease and bronchi-

tis, influenza, and pneumonia. Wartime rheumatic fever predicted later heart disease mortality.

Among blacks (but not whites), wartime syphilis predicted death from genito-urinary diseases and

from cerebrovascular disease. Higher unobserved lifetime incidences of respiratory infections,

rheumatic fever, or syphilis and other sexually transmitted disease, among blacks are therefore

consistent with their higher death rates from infectious and respiratory disease, heart conditions,

and genito-urinary disease.

    Differences in socioeconomic status, as proxied by occupation circa enlistment and 1900, could

not explain racial mortality differentials. Among whites, men who were laborers circa 1900 had

higher mortality rates than men who were professionals and proprietors or farmers. Among blacks

only men who were servants circa 1900 had a mortality advantage.




                                                16
7    The Unfortunate Cohort

Within the Union Army data, as in the national census data, racial mortality differences at older

ages were much smaller for earlier than for later cohorts but widen as black mortality rates in-

creased (see Figure 6). Among men first observed at age 60 black life expectancy was lower for

the cohort born in 1831-40 relative to the 1821-30 cohort and even lower for the cohort born in

1841-50. Hazard models that control for wartime service experience and socioeconomic and de-

mographic characteristics at enlistment (not shown) indicate that the odds of death rose for later

black cohorts and fell for later white cohorts. Although black veterans born in 1821-30 had lower

mortality rates than white veterans, later cohorts had higher mortality rates. The odds that a white

veteran born 1841-52 would die relative to a white veteran born 1821-30 were 0.887 (σ̂=0.031).

The odds that a black veteran born 1841-52 would die relative to a white veteran born 1821-30

were 2.106 (σ̂=0.388).

    Competing risk hazard models show that relative to white cohorts and to black cohorts born

before 1841, black cohorts born 1841-52 were at greater risk of death from genito-urinary disease

and from infectious and parasitic disease, from bronchitis, influenza, and pneumonia (see Table 6).

The odds of death from genito-urinary disease for a black veteran born 1841-52 were 1.7 times

higher than those of a black veteran born before 1841 or those of a white veteran. The odds of

death from infectious and parasitic disease for a black veteran born 1841-52 were 1.8 times higher

than those of a black veteran born before 1841. In contrast, white cohorts born 1841-52 faced

a risk of death from infectious and parasitic disease that was 0.7 times lower than that faced by

earlier white cohorts.

    Infectious disease played a large role in the black-white mortality gap. Using the competing

risk specification, I estimate that eliminating infectious disease deaths would have reduced the

predicted racial differential in the average number of years lived past age 60 from 0.9 to 0.4 years,

a 56 percent decrease in the racial differential. This fraction underestimates the true effects of

                                                 17
eliminating infectious disease because it does not account for the impact of eliminating infectious

disease on deaths from chronic disease.

   Relative to earlier black cohorts later black cohorts also faced higher death rates from cere-

brovascular and heart disease. Although the hazard ratio is not statistically significantly different

from 1, its magnitude implies that the odds of death from cerebrovascular and heart disease were

1.3 times higher for the black cohorts born 1841-52 than for the black cohorts born earlier. In

contrast, white cohorts born 1841-52 faced a risk of death from cerebrovascular and heart disease

that was 1.1 times higher than those of earlier white cohorts. Excess deaths among the later black

cohorts relative to the earlier black cohorts are due not to cerebrovascular disease, but to heart

disease, especially valvular heart disease. When the sample was restricted to blacks only, the odds

of death from valvular heart disease for the cohort born 1841-52 were 2.147 times as high as those

for the cohorts born before 1841. Unlike blacks, later white cohorts faced lower risk of death from

valvular heart disease and a higher risk of death from cerebrovascular and ischemic heart disease

compared to earlier white cohorts. The hazard ratios on the 1841-52 cohort dummy in the com-

peting risk regressions on death from cerebrovascular, valvular, and ischemic heart disease were

1.153 (σ̂=0.099), 0.803 (σ̂=0.093), and 1.226 (σ̂=0.126), respectively.

   The higher mortality of late relative to early black cohorts was not just an urban phenomenon.

Table 7 shows that within the black sample the cohort born 1841-52 had higher all cause mortality

than the cohorts born before 1841, but that there was not a differential effect by city size. Deaths

from genito-urinary and cerebrovascular and heart disease were higher for the 1841-52 black cohort

than for earlier black cohorts and there was no differential effect by city size. However, the excess

infectious and parasitic disease mortality of the 1841-52 black cohort relative to earlier cohorts was

predominately an urban phenomenon. Although the hazard ratio on the interaction term between

city size in 1900 and cohort was statistically insignificant, its magnitude implies that a black veteran

who was born in 1841-52 and who lived in a large city in 1900 faced an odds of dying from


                                                  18
infectious and parasitic disease that was 2.5 times greater than that of a black veteran born in the

same years who did not live in a large city in 1900. The 1841-52 cohort may have been exposed to

worse conditions within cities. It may also have had less resistance to disease at late ages because

of poor environmental conditions, including heavy disease exposure, at younger ages.

       Why was older age mortality so high for later black cohorts compared to earlier cohorts? Kiple

and King (1981: 127-129; 147-157) document cholera epidemics in the United States in the 1840s,

including in the south, and what may have been pellagra epidemics in the south in the 1840s. The

1840s were poor agricultural years, following disastrous agricultural years, and nutritional intake

may have been reduced (Kiple and King 1981: 127). Height data suggest that later cohorts of

both white and black soldiers faced greater stress than earlier cohorts. Among white Union Army

soldiers mean heights of men age 23-49 declined by 1.5cm between the 1821-30 cohort and the

1841-50 cohort. Among black Union Army soldiers the mean decline across cohorts was 2.1cm

and declines are observed in all regions of the country.10 However, controlling for height in the

regressions had no effect on estimated cohort effects and height was not a significant predictor of

older age mortality. Among Union Army soldiers measured by the Sanitary Commission, African-

Americans had lower vital capacity (a measure of lung capacity associated with mortality from

respiratory disease and stroke) at all ages, but the difference was more pronounced at younger

ages. At younger ages African-Americans also had a higher waist-hip ratio (a predictor of stroke

and ischemic heart disease) whereas at older ages their waist-hip ratios were the same as those

of older white soldiers (Costa 2004). Thus the precursors of later susceptibility to respiratory

infections and to heart disease may already have been present among later black cohorts prior to

the Civil War. If nutritional and disease conditions deteriorated after the end of the Civil War, the
  10
     The height declines observed in the Union Army data contrast with the findings of Richard Steckel, who finds
that among young slaves listed in all of the available slave “manifests” (shipping documents used in inter-regional
trade) there was no decline in height (personal communication), a result consistent with that of Margo and Steckel
(1982) using a smaller sample of manifests. Komlos (1992) finds a decline in heights for later cohorts of free blacks
in Maryland similar to that observed among Union Army soldiers, but among Georgia convicts he he finds a decline
in the 1850s and 1880s (Komlos 1997). Bodenhorn (1999) finds a height decline for free Virginia blacks.

weaker, later cohorts would have been the most affected and, because the young are more likely to

migrate, later cohorts were more likely to be exposed to new diseases and the physical stress of a

move.



8    Conclusion

In the United States, African-Americans experienced a later epidemiological transition than whites.

The start of the sustained decline in black child mortality rates lagged the decline in white infant

mortality rates by 20 to 30 years (Haines 2002). At older ages, black Union Army veterans faced

higher death rates than white veterans and were more likely than white veterans to die of infectious

and parasitic disease. Had it been possible to eliminate deaths from infectious disease, the racial

mortality differential in years lived at older ages would have fallen by 56 percent. This is probably

an underestimate of the effect of eliminating infectious disease. Blacks’ death rates from genito-

urinary disease possibly resulted from syphilis and their higher death rates from heart disease

possibly resulted from rheumatic fever. Their odds of dying from such degenerative diseases as

stroke or ischemic heart were lower than those of whites. In large cities, where racial mortality

differentials were bigger than in smaller cities and where the epidemiological transition first began,

black veterans faced a higher death rate than white veterans both from infectious and parasitic

disease and from degenerative disease, partly because some degenerative diseases were caused by

infections such as syphilis. The urban mortality penalty faced by blacks accounted for roughly 15

percent of the mortality differential between blacks and whites. Blacks’ greater risk of death from

infectious and parasitic disease was the result both of the worse conditions in which they lived at

the time of their deaths and of their poorer nutritional status and higher incidence of infectious

disease throughout their lives. Compared to the 1821-40 black cohorts, the 1841-50 black cohort

both was under greater stress at a young age and had higher older age mortality rates, from all



                                                 20
causes, from infectious and parasitic disease, from genito-urinary disease, and from heart disease,

especially valvular heart disease. Although the 1841-50 white cohort suffered more stress in its

growing years than the 1821-40 white cohort, older age mortality rates were the same across the

different white cohorts.

   Racial older age mortality differentials fell during the twentieth century as infectious and para-

sitic disease rates among African-Americans fell. Why did these disease rates fall? The competing

explanations, while related, can be loosely grouped as ecobiological (e.g. a natural decline in the

virulence of a pathogen), public health, and socioeconomic. While scarlet fever represents one

of the few cases where a decline in virulence may have occurred, it is an important case because

scarlet fever often precedes rheumatic fever and decreases may help explain reductions in valvular

heart disease deaths at older ages. However, the decline in virulence was not necessarily “natural”

– the adoption of effective isolation practices between 1900 and the 1930s may have eliminated

the severer strains (Chapin 1926). The substantial effects of such public health investments as

sanitation and water filtration on mortality rates and such public health campaigns as those against

hookworm on child schooling outcomes have been well-documented (Troesken 2004; Condran and

Cheney 1982; Bleakley 2002). Cities also invested in disease reporting and quarantining systems,

and in conjunction with private philanthropists, in well-baby and -child care (including vaccina-

tion) and in campaigns against specific diseases such as syphilis. Foods were fortified with iron.

Because blacks and the poor could ill afford self-protection measures or treatment, they were the

biggest beneficiaries of these campaigns (Troesken 2004; Bleakley 2002; Costa and Kahn 2003).

However, public health interventions cannot fully explain the decline in disease rates. Death rates

from typhoid were falling in many cities even before public health interventions as knowledge

of the germ theory of disease spread and people adjusted their behavior accordingly (Troesken

2004: 137-78). Declining death rates from tuberculosis prior to any changes in medical technol-

ogy or in public health reforms led McKeown (1976) to argue that improved nutrition had to be


                                                21
a factor. Higher incomes can purchase more and better food, less crowding in which air-borne

diseases spread, and less work away from home for the mother. Woodbury’s (1926: 139) data on

infant mortality rates in large cities at the beginning of the twentieth century suggested that a large

fraction of the difference in black and white infant mortality rates was accounted for by blacks’

lower incomes. The estimated narrowing of the black-white wage gap between 1890 and 1940

(Smith 1986) may therefore have played a role in reducing racial older age mortality differentials.

The lagged improvement in black relative to white wages and in black relative to white infectious

disease rates may explain why older age mortality differentials by race still persist.

10,485 observations in the all cause mortality regression and 5,305 observations in the cause specific mortality regres-
sions. The sample consists of men who were alive and on the pensions rolls at age 60. All regressions are Gompertz
hazard models. Other causes of death are censored and assume independent competing risks. Additional control
variables include a dummy equal to one if the soldier could write, dummies indicating occupation at enlistment, and
dummmies indicating whether the soldier was ever a POW and whether the soldiers ever had specific medical condi-
tions while in the service. The symbols ‡, †, and ∗ indicate that the coefficient is significantly different from 0 at the 1,
5, and 10 percent level respectively.
