                                          ABSTRACT

Transportation costs are an important topic in international trade, but seldom have researches paid
attention to general equilibrium trade modelling with transportation costs and explored their
relevant effects. This paper uses different numerical general equilibrium trade model structures to
simulate the impacts of transportation costs on both welfare and trade for a Canada-US country
pair case. We compare two groups of model structure, Armington assumption models and
homogeneous goods models. Within these two groups of models, we also compare balanced trade
structures to trade imbalance structures, and production function transportation costs to iceberg
transportation costs. Armington goods models generate absolute welfare gains from
transportation cost elimination than homogeneous goods models. Welfare gains under balanced
trade structures are larger in production function transportation cost scenarios, but are larger in
iceberg transportation cost scenario under trade imbalance structures. Canada’s welfare gains
with iceberg transportation cost are significantly larger than gains with production function
transportation cost. On trade effects, homogeneous goods models generate more export and
import gains, balanced trade structures have more trade variations, and iceberg transportation cost
generate more trade effects.

1. Introduction

      Transportation costs (TC) are an important part of trade costs, and have begun to play a central
role in theoretical and empirical analysis of international trade, but existing empirical literature on
transportation cost and international trade is not rich and mainly focused on three fields.

     The first is transportation cost estimation with trade data. Moneta (1959) is the first to estimate
transportation costs in international trade, Hummels (1999) provides a detailed accounting of the
time-series pattern of shipping costs, Hummels and Lugovskyy (2006) reviews the method of using
matched partner trade statistics to measure transportation costs, Hummels (2007) systematically
reviews transportation costs calculation methods and empirically computes different kinds of
transport costs.

     The second explores the relationship between transportation costs and international trade both
theoretically and empirically. In the 1950s, Samuelson (1952, 1954) developed what has become
known as the “iceberg” model of transport costs, in which transporting goods costs reduce some
proportion of either the goods’ value or the physical quantity. After that, Mundell (1968) analyzed
models in which transportation costs were included, both did so under the assumption that these
costs were incurred in the form of sacrifices of the traded goods. Falvey (1976) included a
transportation sector in the standard trade model to explore their potential effects. He treated
transportation as services that need to be consumed in order for international trade to take place.
Cassing (1978) attempted to integrate transport costs into the H.O.S model and then contrasts this
model with a nontraded goods model incorporating elements of jointness in consumption. Hummels
and Skiba (2002) argued that economies of scale in transport are important and in part, these scale
economies may derive from large fixed costs of trade. Laussel and Riezman (2006) also explored a
model in which there are economies of scale in transport. Hummels and Skiba (2004) provided
strong evidences against the widely used assumption of “iceberg” form transportation costs. Ravn
and Mazzenga (2004) evaluates the quantitative effects of introducing costs of transportation into
an international trade model. Kleinert and Spies (2011) construct an international trade model with
endogenous transport costs and study the influence of transport costs on international trade.

     The third is to argue decline transportation cost to explain global trade growth. Baier and
Bergstrand (2001) explores how decline tariffs, declining transport costs and income similarity have
influenced world trade growth. Hummels (2007) also uses transportation costs to explain trade
growth. In addition, some researches (Finger and Yeats, 1976) explore the effective protection of
transportation costs and tariffs.

     Among existing literature, little attention has been paid to general equilibrium modelling of
transportation costs with both Armington and homogeneous goods assumptions, as well as both
“iceberg” form and production function form transportation costs. Additionally, little of research on
numerical general equilibrium models simulates the effects of transportation costs.

     We build a classical two-country four-sector produced by two-factor general equilibrium
structure, and introduce Armington goods and Homogeneous goods assumption in sequence and
compare transportation cost effects. Within the two types of model structures, we compare the

                                                   1
effects of “iceberg” and production function form of transportation costs, as well as the effects of
balanced trade and trade imbalance structures.

      We use Canada and the US data case to explore the effects of transportation costs with different
model structures. The reason is that this two countries’ economic scales are far apart, and traded
goods include both Armington type manufacturing goods and homogeneous resource goods. We use
real data for 2015 to build a benchmark model dataset. Each country produces three goods, resource
(tradable), manufacturing goods (tradable) and non-manufacturing goods (non-tradable), with two
factors (labor and capital). Under the production function transportation cost structures, models have
a fourth sector-transportation sector which determines transportation costs. In each model structure,
we compare the equilibria of benchmark models with transportation costs to counterfactual models
without transportation costs, so as to explore transportation cost effects. We pay attention to the
effects on both welfare and trade.

     We perform sensitivity analysis to both elasticities and ad valorem transportation costs to check
simulation results. Elasticities in preference and production functions change from 1.5 to 4.5 in
sensitivity analysis. Ad valorem transportation cost methodology is the main simulation analysis
from Hummels (2007). We also use an indirect transportation cost calculation method following
Anderson and Wincoop (2004) to explore simulation result sensitivity to transportation cost values.

     The remaining parts of the paper are organized as follows: Part 2 calculates transportation costs
between Canada and the US, Part 3 sets up general equilibrium models with transportation cost, Part
4 introduces data and parameters calibration, Part 5 gives simulation results, and last come the
conclusions.


2. Transportation Costs between Canada-US

     Transportation costs are a monetary measure of what the transport provider must pay to
produce transportation services. They come as fixed (infrastructure) and variable (operating) costs,
depending on a variety of conditions related to geography, infrastructure, administrative barriers,
energy, and on how passengers and freight are carried. Three major components, related to
transactions, shipments and the friction of distance, impact on transport costs (Rodrigue and
Notteboom, 2013). We introduce transportation cost briefly and calculate transportation cost
between Canada and the US in this part. The transportation cost between Canada and the US will
be used in our numerical general equilibrium calibration and simulation.

     2.1 Transportation Cost Components

      According to different transport facilities, transportation can be divided into railway transport,
road transport, inland waterway transport, pipeline transport, maritime transport, air transport and
intermodal freight transport. Figure 1 shows the transportation freight of Canada and the US, and
find that most types of freight are increasing steadily except coastal shipping of the US.

      According to transportation cost contents, it may include transport facility ownership, transport
facility operation, operating subsidies, travel time, internal crash, external crash, internal activity
benefits, external activity benefits, internal parking, external parking, congestion, road facilities,

                                                   2
land value, traffic services, transport diversity, air pollution, greenhouse gas pollution, noise,
resource externalities, barrier effect, land use impacts, water pollution and waste. We compile these
parts in Table 1.

                                                                                  3
     2.2 Transportation Cost Calculation with a Direct Methodology

     Trade related researches often express transportation cost in ad valorem terms, which equals
the cost of shipping relative to the value of the good. This of equivalent to the percent change in the
delivered price as a results of paying for transportation (Hummels, 2007).

     Transportation costs drive a wedge between the price at the place of origin and the price at the

destination. Denoting the origin price as   p , destination price as p* , and per unit shipping costs

             *
as f , so p  p  f . Then the ad valorem percent change in prices induced by transportation is

TC  p* / p 1  f / p . So our measure of transportation costs is


           impicif
     TCi          1                                                                           (1)
           impifob


where impicif is the c.i.f. value of imports of good   i , and impifob is the f.o.b. value of imports.
Most trade research papers are using this equation to calculate transportation cost, like Moneta
(1959), Geraci and Prewo (1977), Harrigam (1993), Baier and Bergstrand (2001), Limao and
Venables (2001), Ravn and Mazzenga (2004), Hummels and Lugovskyy (2006), and Hummels
(2007).

      There are several available data to calculate transportation costs, the most comprehensive one
is the IMF Direction of Trade Statistics (DOTS). The advantage of the IMF DOTS data is breadth
of coverage: they are available for many years and include many countries (Hummels and
Lugovskyy, 2006). Another available data is UN’s COMTRADE database. But the best data for
computing the ad valorem transportation cost comes from a few importers as the United States and
New Zealand that collect freight expenditures as part of their import customs declarations. These
data can examine ad valorem transportation costs for an individual good, or to calculate aggregate
expenditures on transportation divided by aggregate import value. This aggregate measure is
equivalent to an average of ad valorem transportation costs for each good, after weighting each good
by its share of value in trade (Hummels, 2007). Fortunately, we can use the US Imports of
Merchandise data to calculate transportation costs between Canada and the US.

     Computation data are from the US Census Bureau website, we get US-Canada general imports
by 3-digit NAICS (North American Industry Classification System) goods data from international
trade statistics part. These data include customs value basis general imports and C.I.F. value basis
general imports, so that we can calculate transportation costs of different goods and aggregate
manufacturing goods. Calculation results are reported in Figure 2 and Table 2.

     We find that ad valorem transportation costs of different goods and different years are different.
Ad valorem transportation costs for a particular product depend on how far the good is shipped, the
quality of the transport service, and the weight/value ratio of the good.

      In the numerical GE calibration and simulation part, we use 2015 as the base year. Therefore
transportation cost in 2015 between Canada and the US will be used in our numerical model, which
is 2.3%.

      2.3 Transportation Cost Calculation with an Indirect Methodology

     Anderson and Wincoop (2004) is a famous trade cost paper, and it mentions that “a rough
estimate of the tax equivalent of representative trade costs for industrialized countries can be broke
down as 21 percent transportation costs, 44 percent border-related trade barriers and so one”.
Therefore, we can calculate trade cost firstly, and use the transportation cost share in the trade cost
to indirectly compute transportation cost.

     We calculate trade costs following the approaches in Novy (2013) and Wong (2012), which
method had also been used in Li and Whalley (2014), and Li et al. (2016). Their method is to take
the ratio of bilateral trade flows over local trade, scaled to some parameter values, and then use a
measure that capture all barriers.

    The measure of trade barrier used here is based on the gravity equation derived from Chaney
(2008) model of heterogeneous firms with bilateral fixed costs of exporting. Trade barriers can take

two forms in the model, a variable trade barrier                ir   and a fixed cost of exporting Fir . The variable

trade barrier      ir   is an iceberg cost. In order to deliver one unit of good to i from               r ,  ir  1
unit of good has to be delivered. Defining the geometric average of trade costs between the country
pair i and r as

                               1
                X ir X ri  2
      tir  (             )                                                                                       (2)
                X ii X rr


Where X ir is the import of country i from country                        r,     is the Pareto parameter governs the

distribution of firm productivities. We then get a measure of the average bilateral trade barrier
between country i and r :

                           1            1              1   1      1
              X ii X rr 2                             (     )
      tir  (           )  ( ir ri ) 2 ( Fri Fir ) 2  1                                                     (3)
              X ir X ri

                                                                  6
     Therefore, the ad valorem tariff-equivalent bilateral average trade cost between country i and
r   can be written as

                               1
                       X X
     t ir  tir  1  ( ii rr ) 2  1                                                       (4)
                       X ir X ri

     Using the above trade cost equation, we can calculate actual trade costs between bilateral

country pairs in our general equilibrium model. In the calculation, X ir and X ri are separately

exports and imports between countries i and      r . Due to market clearing, intranational trade X ii

or X rr can be rewritten as total income minus total exports,


     X ii  yi  X i                                                                         (5)


Where X i are the total exports, defined as the sum of all exports from country i , which is


     Xi    X
            r ,i  r
                       ir                                                                    (6)



     In the trade cost calculation, all trade data are from the UN Comtrade database. For yi , GDP

data are not suitable because they are based on value added, whereas the trade data are reported as
gross shipments. In addition, GDP data include services that are not covered by the trade data (Novy,
2013). It is hard to get this income data according to such a definition, so here we use GDP data
minus total service value added. We get GDP data and the service share of GDP data from World
Development Indicators (WDI) of World Bank database, we then calculate results for GDP minus
services. We take the value of  to be 8.3 as in Eaton and Kortum (2002).

     Using this methodology, we can calculate trade costs between Canada and the US. As
                                                                            
transportation cost (TC) shares 21% of the trade cost, so TCir  21% t ir , then we can get ad
valorem transportation costs. Computation results are reported in Figure 3, so the transportation cost
between Canada and the US in 2015 is 8.1% under this indirect calculation methodology, we will
use this result to perform sensitivity analysis in the simulation part.

3. General Equilibrium Trade Models with Transportation Cost

      We use two different groups of general equilibrium model structures to explore the effects of
transportation cost on welfare and trade. One is Armington assumption GE model which assume
that the same goods from different countries are heterogeneous, Armington assumption is a normal
and prevalent assumption in GE models. The other one is homogenous goods GE model which
assume that the same goods produced in different countries are completely homogenous, and these
goods are perfectly substitutable. The Armington assumption is a widespread assumption in
literatures, the homogeneous goods structure can capture the characteristics of resource goods trade,
like oil and electricity, which are completely substitutional.

     We introduce both trade balance and fixed exogenous trade imbalance assumptions for each
group of models. Trade balance structure is a traditional assumption that each country’s total export
should equals to its total import. Exogenous fixed trade imbalance general equilibrium structure
assumes that trade imbalances for all countries are fixed all the time. We assume an exogenously

determined fixed trade imbalance, denoted as S i , which will be positive when in trade surplus and

negative when in trade deficit. Trade equilibrium will influence individual country’s budget
constraint. In the equilibrium, we have

     I i  Ei  S i                                                                                                                                                         (7)


which means that one country’s total income ( I i ) equals its total consumption expenditure ( Ei )

plus its surplus (trade imbalance), if one country has trade surplus then its income will more than
                                                                                          8
consumption expenditure, but if one country has trade deficit than its income will be less than
consumption expenditure. We added these conditions in the global general equilibrium model
yielding a fixed trade imbalance structure.

     3.1 Two Forms of Transportation Cost and Modelling

     We introduce two different forms of transportation cost into our general equilibrium models,
which are iceberg transportation cost and production function transportation cost. The iceberg
formulation of transport cost was first introduced by Samuelson (1952, 1954), in which part of the
good to be delivered “melts” along the way by the very act of transportation. Far from realistic, but
iceberg form is a tractable way of modelling transportation cost since it impacts no other market.
We assume ad valorem transportation cost to be TC , so when the exporting country export

(1  TC ) units of goods to the importing country, the importing country can only receive 1 unit of
goods, TC units of goods are melted in the transportation.

     Samuelson’s iceberg function is explicitly defined as a continuous function of geographical
distance, Krugman (1991) is one of many significant papers employing the assumption, and its
formation of transportation cost is


     TC (d )  e d                                                                            (8)


Where TC (d ) is a transportation cost,       is an iceberg decay parameter, d is a haulage
distance. Long distance means high cost for transporting goods.

    Under the iceberg transportation cost form, transportation costs are included in the melted
exporting goods, which means exporting countries pay the transportation cost directly with a
proportional share of exporting goods, so there are no transportation sectors in the model structure.

      Production function transportation cost treat transportation process as a service provided by
transportation sectors, so that transportation cost is the expense for transporting goods from export
country to import country. We assume that transportation costs are paid by import countries with
their transportation sector services. So that the transportation sector demand and supply in a specific
country is endogenously determined by its import volume and ad valorem transportation cost. Under
such assumption,

     QTCi   TCijr  IM ijr ;          i, j  countries, r  sectors                          (9)
                  j    r



Where QTCi is the total production of transportation sector in country i , is the ad valorem

transportation cost for country i to importing goods       r from country j . IM ijr denotes the
import of goods       r in country i from country j .
    Under the production function transportation cost form, transportation is a separate sector
which includes production side and consumption side, the consumption demand equals

                                                  9
transportation cost.

     3.2 Armington Assumption GE Models

     Our Armington assumption GE models have two different structures, one is the iceberg
transportation cost structure without transportation sector, and the other one is the production
function transportation cost structure with transportation sector. Meanwhile, for each structure, we
include both trade balance and imbalance forms.

     In the models without transportation sector (iceberg form transportation cost), three sectors are
tradable resource goods, tradable manufacturing goods and non-tradable non-manufacturing goods,
two production factors are capital and labor. The production function is a CES style, and the
consumption function is a two-level nested CES style. The fist level consumption is the choice
between resource goods, manufacturing goods and non-manufacturing goods, and the second level
consumption is the choice of resource goods and manufacturing goods from different original
countries (see Figure 4). In the equilibrium, goods market and factor market will clear, and goods
prices and factor prices are determined by their demand and supply.

          Figure 4: Structure of Armington Goods GE Models with Iceberg Transportation Cost

     In the models with transportation sector (production function form transportation cost), we
have four sectors which are tradable resource goods, tradable manufacturing goods, non-tradable
non-manufacturing goods and transportation sector. On the production side, production functions
are of CES type. On the consumption side, the function is a two-level nested CES type. The first
level is the consumption choice of resource goods, manufacturing goods and non-manufacturing
goods, the second level is the consumption choice of resource goods and manufacturing goods from
different countries (see Figure 5). Under this assumption, the transportation cost is one of service
provided by transportation sector, the ad valorem transportation cost will increase the consumption
price of imported goods. In the equilibrium, all goods and factors market will clear, and goods prices
and factor prices are determined by their demand and supply either. The transportation sector
clearing condition is that transportation demand by importing equals transportation sector
production.

     3.3 Homogeneous Goods GE Models

     For the homogenous goods GE model, same goods from different countries are homogenous,
so the goods market clearance condition will be that the total production of each goods in the world
equals the total consumption of this goods in the world.

      Homogenous goods in general equilibrium will cause specialization problem, in order to avoid
this problems, we use fixed sector specific inputs and diminishing marginal productivity production
functions in which the marginal productivity of labor equals zero as output in the sector approaches
zero. The form of this production function can be described as


     Qil  Ail ( Lli )i ,       il  1; l  goods, i  country
                        l
                                                                                                    (10)


where Qil is the output of the lth industry in country       i , Lli is the labor inputs in sector l , Ail

are the scale parameters,  il is the share parameter. Simple calculation implies the factor input

demand equations as

                    1
         Qil il
     L ( l)
       l
       i                                                                                            (11)
         Ai

     Therefore, our homogenous goods general equilibrium models have two countries (Canada
and the US), three (tradable resource goods, tradable manufacturing goods, and non-tradable non-
manufacturing goods) or four goods (tradable resource goods, tradable manufacturing goods, non-
tradable non-manufacturing goods, and transportation service sectors), and one factor (labor).

     In the models without transportation sector (iceberg form transportation cost), production
functions are fixed sector specific inputs and diminishing marginal productivity functions,
consumption functions are one-level CES type (see Figure 6). Transportation costs will be covered
by melted exporting goods. In the equilibrium, goods market and factor market will clear, and goods
prices and factor prices are determined by their demand and supply.

     In the models with transportation sector (production function form transportation cost), we
have four sectors, resource goods, manufacturing goods, non-manufacturing goods and
transportation service goods. The production functions are fixed sector specific inputs and
diminishing marginal productivity functions, and consumption functions are one-level CES type
(see Figure 7). Transportation costs are covered by transportation service. In the equilibrium, goods
market and factor market will clear, and goods prices and factor prices are determined by their
demand and supply, transportation production equals transportation cost demand in importing.

4. Data and Parameters Calibration

      We set 2015 as our base year in building a global benchmark general equilibrium dataset for
use in calibration and simulation according to the methods set out in Shoven and Whalley (1992).
There are two countries which are Canada and the US, and three goods which are resource goods,
manufacturing goods and non-manufacturing goods in our numerical model. For the three goods,
we add the industries of crude material, crude oil, mineral fuels, and manufactured good classified
by material together to denote resource goods, assume other secondary industry (manufacturing)
together to reflect manufacturing goods, and some primary and tertiary industries (agriculture,
extractive industries and services) to yield non-manufacturing goods. For the two factor inputs,
capital and labor, we use total labor income to denote labor values for inputs by sector. All data are
in billion US dollars.

    All data are from the World Bank database (World Development Indicate). We use 1-digital
SITC Rev 2 industrial data to yield production data of resource goods, manufacturing goods and
non-manufacturing goods, and use industrial capital ratios to yield capital and labor input in

                                                 12

     Trade data between each pair of countries are from the UN Comtrade database. For the
balanced trade structures, we adjust Canada’s manufacturing goods import value to make trade
balanced. For the homogeneous goods models, export value equals the net export value, we calculate
trade data with the actual export and import values. The trade data we use in Armington goods
structures are listed in Table 4 and Table 5, homogeneous goods trade data can be easily calculated
from the actual export and import data in Table 4 and Table 5. Using production and trade data, we
can then calculate each country’s consumption values.

     For the production function form transportation costs, transportation sector will be included in
our GE models. The transportation service sector production output are endogenously determined
by ad valorem transportation cost and trade value. Ad valorem transportation costs data between
Canada and the US are reported in the last part. We assume the transportation sector factor input
structure in production are the same as the non-manufacturing goods sector.

      There are no available estimates of elasticities for individual countries on the demand and
production sides of the model. Many of the estimates of domestic and import goods substitution
elasticity are around 2 (Betina et al., 2006), so we set all these elasticities in our model to 2 (Whalley
and Wang, 2010). We perform sensitivity analysis around these elasticities in the simulation part.

     With these data, we calibrate the model parameters. When used in model solution these
regenerate the benchmark data as an equilibrium for the model. Then, using these parameters we
                                                                  13
can form a numerical global general equilibrium system, and can use this system to explore the
transportation cost effects under different GE model structures.


5. Simulation Results

     We set the numerical GE models with transportation costs as benchmarks, then we remove
transportation cost in the benchmark models and get corresponding counterfactual models.
Transportation cost effects can be generated by comparing the counterfactual and benchmark
equilibrium results.

      Our simulation analysis emphasizes on the transportation cost effects on welfare and trade.
Welfare effect indicators in this paper include equivalent variation (EV), compensation variation
(CV), EV as a percent share of GDP, CV as a percent share of GDP, and percent change of total
utility. Trade effects include percent changes on both export and import.

     We have two groups of models in general to compare the impact of transportation cost, one is
Armington assumption models and the other is homogenous goods models. Under each group
models, we also compare the effects of iceberg transportation costs and production function
transportation costs, as well as the effects of balanced trade structures and fixed trade imbalance
structures. We perform sensitivity analysis to elasticities and ad valorem transportation costs for
each group of models.

      For each group of model, we use two different kinds of indicators to show the transportation
cost influences. The first kind of indicators are the absolute values or percent changes of variables.
The second kind of indicators are the percent share of gains from transportation cost elimination, in
which we add the gains of Canada and the US from transportation cost together, and report the
percent shares of Canada and the US.

     5.1 Results of Armington Goods Structure
     We report the effects of transportation cost under Armington assumption models in this part.
Simulation results of welfare and trade are both reported and compared separately, we perform
sensitivity analysis to elasticities by varying elasticity values, and also to ad valorem transportation
cost with an indirect transportation cost value.

     5.1.1 Simulation Results

     Effects on welfare show that eliminating transportation cost will definitely improve welfares
of both countries. Comparatively, both countries’ absolute welfare gains are close, but Canada’s
gains as a share of GDP are much larger than the US as Canada is a small country compared with
the US. These conclusions can hold under balanced trade and trade imbalance structures, as well as
under production function transportation cost structures and iceberg transportation cost structures.

     We take the balanced trade and iceberg transportation cost structure case as an example, EV
changes for Canada and the US are separately 14.794 billion US$ and14.614 billion US$, two
countries nearly divide the welfare gains equally in absolute value. The CV results show the same
trend as the EV. Percent changes of utility for Canada and the US are separately 0.947% and 0.081%,

                                                  14
results for both EV and CV as a percent shares of GDP are nearly the same. It is clear that Canada’s
comparative welfare gain variation is larger than the US (see Table 6).

     Comparing the transportation cost effects on welfare under balanced trade and fixed trade
imbalance structures, results under different transportation cost forms are different. Welfare gains
with balanced trade structures are larger than with fixed trade imbalance structures under production
function transportation cost cases, but just opposite under iceberg transportation cost cases (see
Figure 8). The reason for the result is that Canada is a trade surplus country with the US, so it export
more than import to the US, when under iceberg transportation cost will export countries pay the
transportation cost which means Canada will pay more transportation cost compared with balanced
trade structure, therefore the transportation cost effects to Canada are larger under trade imbalance
structures. Reasons for the results in production function transportation cost are the same.

     We take Canada’s EV gain shares as examples to specifically compare the results. Under
production function transportation cost structures, Canada’s EV gain percent share with balanced
trade case is 50%, but 47.1% with fixed trade imbalance case. It is clear that gains under balanced
trade are larger. Under iceberg transportation cost structures, Canada’s EV gain percent share with
balanced trade case is 50.3%, but 58.5% with fixed trade imbalance case, so that gains under fixed
trade imbalance are larger (see Figure 8).

      Comparing the transportation cost effects on welfare under production function transportation
cost and iceberg transportation cost, Canada’s welfare gains with iceberg transportation cost forms
are significantly larger than gains with production function transportation cost. This result is clearer
in trade imbalance structures (see Figure 9). The reason for the result is that Canada is a trade surplus
country to the US which means it export more than import, meanwhile exporting country pay
transportation cost under iceberg transportation assumption but importing country pay
transportation cost under production function transportation cost, so that Canada’s welfare gain
shares with iceberg transportation cost are larger.

     We take Canada’s CV gain share as an example to specifically compare the results under
different forms of transportation cost. Under the fixed trade imbalance structures, Canada’s CV gain
percent share with production function TC is 46.9%, but 58.4% with iceberg TC. Under the balanced
trade structures, Canada’s CV gain percent share with production TC is 50.0%, but 50.3% with
iceberg TC (see Figure 9).
                                                                       16
      Effects on trade show that eliminating transportation cost will increase both export and import
between two countries. Comparatively, under balanced trade structures, trade with iceberg TC cases
will increase more than production function TC. Under trade imbalance structures, exports of bigger
countries and trade deficit countries will increase more but imports decrease less, the trends are
more significant under iceberg TC cases (see Table 7).

     Specifically, both Canada and the US exports and imports under production function TC will
increase 4.646%, and increase 4.699% under iceberg TC. Under trade imbalance structures, the US
export and import will separately increase 5.439% and 4.244% with production function TC, and
separately increase 6.1% and 4.244% with iceberg TC (see Table 7).

     The ad valorem TC in the sensitivity analysis is about four times larger than the TC in main
simulation. We find that all simulation results are also nearly four times bigger than results in our
main simulation. All comparative effects under different model structures are the same as in main
simulation. These results reveal that TC effects to both Canada and the US are sensitive to ad
valorem transportation cost, and the comparative simulation results are stable and robustness to TC.

     5.1.3 Sensitivity Analysis II: with Different Elasticities

     We perform sensitivity analysis of TC effects to elasticities in this part. Elasticities in

                                                                  17
preference and production functions changes from 1.5 to 4.5 with interval of 1 to separately simulate
TC effects on welfare. Table 9 reports all of the sensitivity analysis results.

    Results show that TC effects only have very small changes under different elasticities, which
means that simulation results are not sensitive to elasticities. Our main simulation results are reliable.

     5.2 Results of Homogeneous Goods Structure
    This part reports the effects of transportation cost under Homogeneous goods models and
compare these results with Armington goods models. Effects on welfare and trade are both included.
We perform sensitivity analysis to elasticities and to ad valorem transportation cost either.

     5.2.1 Simulation Results

     Transportation cost effects on welfare in homogeneous goods models show that eliminating
transportation cost will improve welfares of both countries. Comparatively, both countries’ absolute
welfare gains are close, but Canada’s gains as a share of GDP are much larger than the US.
Comparative effect results between balanced trade and trade imbalance cases, and production
function TC and iceberg TC are all the same as in Armington models. So we focus on comparing
the effects between Armington structures and homogeneous structures in this part.

    Comparing the effects strength, TC welfare effects in homogeneous goods assumption are
apparently smaller than the effects in Armington goods. The reason is that trade in homogeneous
goods are net export so trade values are much less than in Armington goods.

      We take the EV effects under the balanced trade and iceberg TC structure as an example, EVs
for Canada and the US in Armington goods case are separately 14.794 billion US$ and 14.614
billion US$, but are separately 3.304 billion US$ and 2.216 billion US$ in homogeneous goods case
(see Table 10). The effect intensity in Armington structure is about 4-5 times larger than in
homogeneous goods structure.

     Under balanced trade assumption, Canada’s welfare gain shares are a little more than the US
in general, but nearly the same. Additionally, Canada’s gain shares in homogeneous goods cases are
significantly larger than in Armington goods cases with iceberg TC, but gain shares in Armington
goods cases are a little larger than in homogeneous goods cases with production function TC.
Therefore, when the importing country pay the transportation cost under production function TC,
welfare gain shares with Armington assumption are nearly the same as with homogeneous goods
assumption. When the exporting country pay the transportation cost under iceberg TC, Canada as a
trade surplus country can shift transportation cost burden to the US under Armington goods, but
cannot shift transportation cost to the US under homogeneous goods, so that Canada’s welfare gain
                                                                 20
shares with homogeneous goods are more than shares with Armington goods.

     We take the EV gain shares of Canada as an example to compare the results with Armington
goods and homogeneous goods. With production function TC, Canada’s EV percent gain shares
under the Armington goods and homogeneous goods are separately 50.01% and 49.99%, nearly the
same; but with iceberg TC, these two results are separately 50.31% and 59.86%, obviously gain
shares under homogeneous goods are larger (see Figure 10).

     Under fixed trade imbalance assumption, Canada’s percent welfare gain shares in production
function TC are less than the US’s, the reason is that Canada is a trade surplus country and so that
export more than import to the US, when TC are paid by importing countries which determines that
trade deficit countries will gain more from removing TC. The results are opposite in iceberg TC as
exporting countries pay the TC. Additionally, as countries in homogeneous goods structures are
hard to shift TC to trade partners using their market power, so Canada’s percent welfare gain shares
with homogeneous goods are less than shares with Armington goods in production function TC
models, but are more than shares with Armington goods in iceberg TC models.

     Canada’s specific CV gain shares can prove the above conclusions. With production function
TC, Canada’s CV gain share in the Armington goods model is 46.94% compared to 27.30% in the
homogeneous goods model. With fixed trade imbalance TC, Canada’s CV gain share in the
Armington goods model is 58.34% compared to 59.04% in the homogeneous goods model (see
Figure 11).

     Transportation cost effects on trade in homogeneous goods models are significant and
prominent. Compared with trade effects in Armington goods models, both export and import
increase much more in homogeneous goods models. The reason for this result is clear, homogeneous
goods trade and more sensitive to price changes caused by transportation cost. Meanwhile, balanced
trade structure case generates more trade variation than fixed trade imbalance structure, and iceberg
TC case generates severer trade variation than production function TC.

     Under balanced trade and production function TC structure, both export and import in two
countries increase 44.964%. But both export and import in two countries increase 64.44% under
balanced trade and iceberg TC structure. Under fixed trade imbalance structures, export for the US
in production function TC and iceberg TC increase separately 24.348% and 32.946%, and import
increase separately 9.146% and 17.043% (see Table 11).

     5.2.2 Sensitivity Analysis I: with Indirect Transportation Cost

      We perform sensitivity analysis for homogeneous goods structure to ad valorem TC in this part.
Indirect TC calculation results of 8.1% is used for the sensitivity analysis. All TC effects on welfare
are simulated and collected in Table 12.

     Sensitivity analysis results show that TC effects are sensitive to ad valorem TC, but the

     5.2.3 Sensitivity Analysis II: with Different Elasticities

     Sensitivity analysis to elasticities for homogeneous goods models is performed in this part. We
change elasticities in preference and production functions to 1.5, 2.5, 3.5 and 4.5 to separately
explore TC effects. All sensitivity analysis results are put in Table 13.

     Comparing these results, we find that TC effects are not sensitive to elasticities. Although the
simulation results are different, but changes are small. These results prove that our simulation results
in main analysis are robustness.

6. Conclusions

      This paper uses numerical general equilibrium models to simulate the effects of transportation
cost on welfare and trade with the Canada-US case. Two groups of models are used, which are
Armington goods structures and homogenous goods structures. Under each model structures, we
also compare the transportation cost effects of production function TC with iceberg TC, as well as
the transportation cost effects of balanced trade assumption with fixed trade imbalance assumption.

      Simulation results are gained by comparing variations from the scenario of benchmark models
with transportation cost to models with zero transportation cost. We use comparative percent change,
absolute value change and share of change to show the transportation cost effects. We focus on the
effects on welfare and trade (export and import).

     Our empirical simulation results on welfare reveal that absolute gains in Armington goods
models are apparently more than gains in homogeneous goods models. When we compare the
welfare gains of Canada and the US, both of their absolute gains are close but Canada’s gains as a
share of GDP are much larger than the US in both Armington assumptions and homogeneous goods
assumptions. When we compare the welfare effects under balanced trade cases to the effects under
fixed trade imbalance cases, gains under balanced trade structures are larger than gains under fixed
trade imbalance structures with production function transportation cost cases. But the results are
opposite with iceberg transportation cost cases. When we compare the welfare effects under
production function transportation cost to the effects under iceberg transportation cost, Canada’s
welfare gains with iceberg transportation cost are significantly larger than gains with production
function transportation cost.

     The transportation cost effects on trade show that both exports and imports under homogenous
goods assumption increase much more than the ones under Armington assumption. Additionally,
balanced trade structures can generate more trade variations than fixed trade imbalance structures,
and iceberg form transportation cost can generate more trade variations than production function
form transportation cost.

      Sensitivity analyses find that welfare effects of transportation cost are not sensitive to
elasticities but are sensitive to ad valorem transportation costs. Trade effects are very sensitive to ad
valorem transportation cost especially under homogenous goods models.
