          Adjusting Depreciation in an Inflationary Economy:
                     Indexing Versus Acceleration

      With the existing "historic cost" method of depreciation, higher
inflation rates reduce the real value of future depreciationdeductions
and therefore raise the real net cost of investment. The calculations in
this paper show that this rise in the net cost can be quite substantial
at recent inflation rates; e.g., the real net cost of an equipment invest-
ment with a 13 year tax life is raised 21 percent by an 8 percent expected
inflation rate if the firm uses a 4 percent real discount rate.

      The effects of inflation on the net cost of investment can be com-
pletely eliminated by indexing depreciation. A more accelerated deprecia-
tion schedule can also lower the net cost of investment and make that net
cost less sensitive to the rate of inflation. The current paper examines
a particular acceleration proposal and finds that, for moderate rates of
inflation and real discount rates, the acceleration proposal and full
indexation are quite similar. For low rates of inflation, high discount
rates, or very long—lived investments, the acceleration proposal causes
greater reductions in net cost than would result from complete indexing.
Conversely, for high rates of inflation, low discount rates, or very short—
lived investments, the acceleration method fails to offset the adverse
effects of inflation.

      Since the acceleration and indexation methods have quite similar
effects under existing economic conditions, the choice between them
requires balancing the administrative simplicity and other possible advan-
tages of acceleration against the automatic protection that indexation
offers against the risk of significant changes from the recent inflation
rates and discount rates.

             Adjusting Depreciation in an Inflationary Economy:

                         Indexing Versus Acceleration

                              Martin Feldstein*

     Under existing law, the depreciation of plant and equipment that firms may

claim in calculating taxable income is limited to the original or "historic"

cost of' the investment. The annual depreciation allowances are not adjusted

when there are increases in the general price level or in the cost of replacing

the particular asset. A higher rate of inflation therefore lowers the real

value of' the depreciation allowances on any investment.1 Since depreciation

allowances reduce a firm's net cost of making an investment, a higher rate of

inflation raises the net cost of investing.2 The combination of inflation and

existing tax laws thus discourages investment in depreciable plant and equipment

and, by making investment less profitable, may reduce the economy's rate of'

saving. Moreover, since the reduction in the value of' the depreciation that is

caused by inflation depends on the life of the asset, inflation also distorts

the choice between short—lived and long—lived equipment and thereby reduces the

productivity of the capital stock.

research and to the NBER and National Science Foundation for financial support

and the NBER Study of Capital Formation. The views expressed here are my own
and should not be attributed to any organization.

1-According to estimates by the Department of Commerce, the depreciation
allowances of nonfinancial corporations in 1978 would have been 140 percent greater
than the $1114 billion actually allowed if depreciation were based on the replace-
ment cost of the assets instead of their historic cost. Feldstein and Summers
(1979) discuss the comparable figures for earlier years.

2This is equivalent to an increase in the effective tax rate on capital income.
Feldstein and Summers (1979) show that in 1977 the use of' historic cost depre-
ciation raised the total effective tax rate on nonfinancial corporations and
their owners by nearly 114 percentage points.

      Several economists have pointed out that these adverse effects of inflation

on the value of depreciation allowances could be eliminated completely by

changing from historic cost depreciation to a method of indexed depreciation)-

The simplest such scheme would adjust the value of allowable depreciation each

year for the rise in the consumer price index since the previous year.2

Although depreciation allowances have been indexed in this way in a few

countries with very high inflation rates3, it has been common in most other

countries to deal with inflation by reducing the number of years over which an

asset can be depreciated.

      In the United States, some tax experts have advocated shorter depreciation lives

instead of indexed depreciation on the ground that acceleration is much simpler

than indexation for taxpayers to use and that such administrative simplicity

saves real resources. This is particularly true of proposals to "expense"

investment (immediate write—off) or to depreciate all kinds of equipment over

the same number of years. It is further argued that indexing depreciation might



'e, for example, Feldstein, Green and Sheskinski (1978), Feliner (1975),
Galper and Mendenhall (1976), International Monetary Fund (1975), Shoven and
Bulow (1975), and the papers in Aaron (1976) and Tax Foundation (1975.)

2An alternative method of indexing depreciation would adjust each type of asset
by a different price index in an attempt to reflect differences in the rates of
change of replacement cost. Since adjusting for changes in the relative prices
of different assets and in the relative prices of consumption and investment
goods is really a separate issue from overall inflation adjustment, I will limit
my discussion to adjustments based on the consumer price index.

3These include Argentina, Brazil and Israel. See the descriptions of the Brazil
and Israel methods in Nadiri and Pastore (1977.)

For  example, for a broad range of equipment investments, Canada allows a
two—year write—off while the United Kingdom allows immediate expensing.

lead to other kinds of indexing that reduce the overall stability of the

economy.1 Yet another argument in favor of acceleration is that it can be used

to provide an incentive for investment spending above and beyond merely of f—

setting the adverse effects of inflation.

     Proponents of indexing have countered that a shortening of depreciation

periods is inferior to indexing in three important ways. First, any speci-

fic shortening of depreciation lives may be either inadequate or too

generous at existing inflation rates. Second, since the proposed shorter

depreciation lives do not depend explicitly on the rate of inflation, the

benefit of shorter lives would more than offset the effect of inflation when

the future inflation rate is low but would fail to offset it when the infla-

tion rate is high. Third, for any rate of inflation, using an arbitrary

short depreciation life benefits long—lived investments more than short—lived

investments and thereby distorts choices among assets of different durabi-

lity. The correct choice between the administratively simpler acceleration

approach and the more precisely appropriate indexing depends on hoc well acce-

leration approximates indexing over the relevant range of asset lives, interest

rates and inflation rates.2'3

     The primary purpose of the present paper is to provide just such a

1See Fischer (1917) and Gray (1976) for analyses of the conditions under which
general indexing may be destabilizing.

2My colleague, Dale Jorgensen, points out that all of the benefits of
indexing could be achieved by allowing an immediate deduction of the entire
present value of the future real depreciation whenever an investment is made.
In practice, this would be equivalent to expensing a fraction of the initial
cost that varies inversely with the life of the asset. Selecting the frac-
tion requires choosing (actually or implicitly) a real discount rate for
calculating the present value.

3More rapid depreciation may also bias patterns of ownership and leasing because
of the differences in marginal tax rates.

comparison of the relative effects of acceleration and indexing on the

firm's net cost of investment. The effects of both methods are calculated

for a wide range of asset lives, interest rates and inflation rates.     With

these calculations, it is possible to analyze how the relative impact of the

two methods differs according to the inflation rate for a given asset as

well as how it varies among assets of different lives for a given inflation

rate. The paper also provides evidence on the extent to which inflation and

the existing historic cost depreciation method now raise the net cost of

investment and distort the mix of long—lived and short—lived investments.

     There are, of course, many different ways in which shorter lives, more

rapid acceleration schedules and increased investment tax credits can be

combined to reduce the net cost of investment. Although the calculations

described below were initially made for several different such acceleration

combinations, I decided to focus the presentation of results on a particular

acceleration proposition that has been receiving substantial attention in

tax policy circles. Two key members of the House Ways and Means Committee,

James Jones and Barber Conable, recently introduced a bill that would permit

 structures to be depreciated in 10 years, equipment (except automobiles and

 light trucks) to be depreciated in five years, and autos and light trucks to be

 depreciated in three years.1 The annual depreciation amounts2 for the shorter

 lives are calculated on an accelerated schedule which is essentially the sam—of—


 2he proposed legislation is HR}46146 of the 96th Congress, known as the Capital
 Cost Recovery Act of 1979. Jones is an Oklahoma Democrat and Conable is a New
 York Republican. The Senate sponsors of the bill are Lloyd Bentsen (D, Texas),
 Bob Packwood (B, Ore.) and Gaylord Nelson (D, Wisconsin.)

 2The bill refers to the annual depreciation amounts as "capital cost reco-
 very allowances" to emphasize that these are not intended as measures of
 actual economic depreciation.

the—years'—digits method.1 The proposal also calls for extending the full 10

percent investment tax credit (ITC) to all equipment (other than autos and light

trucks) and providing a six percent ITC for autos and light trucks.

     The first section of the paper describes the measure of the net cost of

investment that will be used to assess the impact of inflation and the effects

of the indexing and the acceleration methods. Section two then shows how, with

the existing method of historic cost depreciation, inflation raises the net

cost of investment. The third section presents the key comparisons of the net

costs of investment under the indexing and acceleration methods for different

inflation rates and asset lives.

     In the end, each reader must decide for himself whether the acceleration

method approximates the indexing method closely enough to justify the selec—

tion of the simpler but less accurate method of adjusting depreciation to

avoid the adverse effects of inflation.


1. The Net Cost of Investment

     The net cost to a firm of acquiring any piece of plant or equipment is

the difference between the market price of the asset and the present value of

the reductions in tax liabilities due to the investment tax credit and future

depreciation allowances. Consider, for example, a machine with a market price

of $100 and an allowable life of 13 years. The 10 percent investment tax cre-

dit (ITc) causes an immediate tax saving of $10. With historic cost depre—


TFor equipment, the percentages of the initial costs to be allowed in the
first five years are 20%, 32%, 21%, 16% and 8%; the low percentage in the
first year reflects the "half—year" convention of allowing one—half of a full
year's depreciation during the first year. For buildings, the depreciation is
10 percent in the first year, 18 percent in the second year, and then declines
at 2 percent a year. For vehicles, the depreciation is 33 percent, )45 percent
and 22 percent, which are the percentages obtained by using the double declining
balance method.
                                            —6—

elation, the $100 original cost of the machine causes a $100 reduction in

taxable income over the life of the machine. With a 146 percent marginal rate

of corporate income tax, the $100 reduction in taxable income lowers taxes by

$146. The present value of this tax saving depends on the method of depre-

ciation and the firm's rate of discount. This present value is greatest if

the firm uses    the   sum—of—the—years'—digits method. With this method of depre-

ciation, a 13 year tax life, and a discount rate of 10 percent, the $146

of tax savings through depreciation has a present value of $29.814. The net

cost of    the investment is thus the $100 purchase price minus the $10 ITC    and

the present value of     future   tax savings of $29.814, i.e. a net cost of $60.16.1

       Table 1 shows the present—value net cost of acquiring a $100 piece of

equipment under the existing tax law but in the absence of inflation.2

The calculations assume that the investor is subject to a 146 percent      corporate
tax   rate and chooses the depreciation method that achieves the lowest

net cost. The figures in Table 1 show how a higher discount rate, by reducing

the present value of future depreciation deductions, raises the net cost

of investment. Comparing the net costs for equipment with a three year tax

life and an 8   year   tax life shows that the eligibility of the 8   year equipment
for the full investment tax credit outweighs the slower rate of depreciation.

Further increases in the tax life of an asset raise the net cost of investment

wthenever there is a positive discount rate. Analogous calculations for

structures, presented in the lower half of the table, show the effect of

1The nearly 140 percent reduction in the net cost of the investment can he
regarded as a partial offset to the 146 percent rate of tax levied on future
earnings. Samuelson (19614) has shown that a tax on profits will not
distort investment decisions only if complete economic depreciation is
allowed.
2The calculations assume that the investment is not eligible for the 20 per-
cent   additional first year depreciation.

All figures indicate the net present value cost per $100 of equipment or
structures acquired. Calculations are based on equation 1.1 with the half—

limiting   the investment tax credit and the sum—of—the—years'—digits method to

equipment. The net cost of a given structures investment is higher than an

equal investment in equipment and the difference grows with the allowable depre-

ciation life of the asset for any positive discount rate.

     The net cost of acquiring $100 of investment goods is a useful measure of

how inflation and different depreciation methods affect the incentive to invest

and the choice among assets of different durability. An increased rate of

inflation raises the net cost under existing tax rules while a shorter depre-

ciation life lowers the net cost. To interpret changes in the net cost, it is

useful to bear in mind that a rise in the net cost of investment has essen-

tially the same effect on the internal rate of return as an equiproportionate

fail in the annual operating profits (i.e., sales revenue minus operating

costs, or quasirents.) Equivalently, the internal rate of return on an invest-

ment can be maintained when the net cost rises if the annual operating profits

rise by the same percentage.1

     The internal rate of return is of course an alternative measure of the

effect of changes in tax rules or the inflation rate. However, comparing

internal rates of return requires specifying the pretax income of the invest-

ment and the true pattern of economic depreciation.2 The relation between the

This homogeneity property holds precisely when the discount rate used to
calculate the net cost is the internal rate of return on the profit. This is
shown formally in Appendix A.

2There are other related ways of assessing the impact of inflation and the
depreciation method. Auerbach (1979) suggests the relative change in the gross
rate of return that must be earned on an investment to produce a previously
fixed real net—of—tax yield to investors; see also King (1977). Feldsteiri and
Summers (1978) suggest the maximum potential net rate of return that can be
paid to investors on the basis of a given pretax real return. Both of these
approaches are useful in other contexts but require specifying the economic
life of the asset, the time profile of output, the method of financing the
 investment, and the pretax or post—tax rate of return.
                                    —9—

change in the net cost of investment and the change in the internal rate of

return depends in particular on the economic life of the investment and the

allowable speed of depreciation. For an investment that lasts forever and pro-

duces a constant perpetual yield, a rise in the net costs induces an equal per-

centage fall in the rate of return. As the economic life gets shorter, the pro-

portionate change in the rate of return for any given change in the net cost

increases. For very short—lived investments, a relatively small change in net

cost can imply a quite large change in the rate of return if there is no change

in operating profits.1 With typical economic lives and pretax rates of return,

the relative changes in the internal rates of return are similar to the change

in net costs.2

     In practice, a change in the initial net cost of investments will cause

changes in both the internal rate of return and the annual operating profits.

The relative importance of these two changes will depend essentially on the

supply elasticity (with respect to the rate of return) of funds for business

investment and on the demand elasticity for the products of such investments

with respect to their relative price.3 If the supply of funds is perfectly

1To take an extreme example, consider an investment with a one year life, a net
cost of $100 and a rate of return of 10 percent. A 5 percent increase in the
net cost cuts the return in half while a 10 percent increase in net cost elimi-
nates the entire return.

2Consider, for example, an equipment investment with an 11 percent pretax
return, a 13 year allowable tax depreciation, and exponential decay of gross
operating profits at 7.7 percent a year until the equipment is scrapped at the
end of 13 years. As the inflation rate rises from 1 percent to 8 percent, the
net cost under the acceleration proposal rises by 5 percent while the internal
rate of return falls by 7.6 percent (from 10.5 percent to 9.7 percent.) A
further increase in inflation from 8 percent to 12 percent raises the net cost
under accelerated depreciation by an additional 5 percent while the internal
rate of return falls by an additional 7.2 percent. Other examples are presented
in Appendix B of this paper.

3This statement oversimplifies because the operating profits depend on the pro-
duct price relative to wages and other input prices and because the relative
price of the investment goods themselves may change in response to their demand.
                                     —10—

elastic,1 a change in the net cost must leave the rate of return unchanged

and therefore must raise the annual operating profits by the same percentage as

the rise in net cost. Appendix A to this paper presents a simple general

equilibrium model and analyzes the implications of differences in the relative

supply and demand elasticities.

     To appreciate the magnitude of any given change in net cost, it may also

be useful to compare it with the equivalent change in the investment tax cre-

dit. For example, a $100 investment with a 13 year life has a net cost of

$51.90 when evaluated at a real discount rate of I percent in the absence of

inflation. A 10 percent rise in this net cost is therefore equivalent •to

reducing the investment tax credit by $5.19, i.e., by 5.19 percentage points

from 10 percent to 1.8 percent.

     The remainder of this section specifies the formulae for calculating

the net cost of investment under the three depreciation methods that will be

compared empirically in sections 2 and 3:   (1) historic cost depreciation with

existing lives, (2) indexed depreciation with existing lives, and (3) the speci-

fic method of acceleration described above.


Historic Cost Depreciation

     Consider an asset that can be depreciated over T years. The economic life of

the asset, i.e., the number of years until it is scrapped, may also be T years

but it need not be; the economic life of the asset is irrelevant in calculating

-1-The elasticity of the supply of funds for business investment depends not only
on the responsiveness of saving but also on the competing demands for funds
(for housing and government spending) and on the international mobility of
capital. A common assumption in studies of investment behavior has been that
the supply of funds is perfectly elastic; see e.g., Hall and Jorgenson (1967) and
Eisner (1978). Feldstein and Summers (1978) found that the supply of funds
for business investment appears to be very elastic, i.e., that changes in the
potential internal rate of return caused by changes in tax rules cause only
very small changes in market rates.

and comparing the net costs of the investment.

    The fraction of the initial cost of the asset that can be deducted as a

depreciation expense in year t of the asset's life under the existing historic

cost method of depreciation will be denoted DHt. If T is the corporate tax

rate, the reduction in other tax liabilities in year t is TDHt. With the

straight—line method of depreciation, DHt =                l/T   in each year. As noted above,

the optimal policy is to use the sum—of—the—years'—digits method which makes

DHt = 2(T—t+1)/T(T+1).-'2
        Let r denote the real discount rate that firms use to calculate the pre-

sent value of the future tax savings that result from allowable depreciation3.

In the absence of inflation, the net cost per dollar of investment can be

written:
                                              T
(1.1)                CH = 1   -   ITC —   t   Z      DHt
                                              t1 (i+rY
where ITC is the investment tax credit rate for the particular type of invest-

ment. The subscript H on CH indicates that this calculation is based on

historic cost depreciation with existing asset lives.

        Inflation reduces the real value of the depreciation allowed in future

years. These future tax savings can be valued at the prices prevailing at the

time of the investment by dividing each year's depreciation by the ratio of

the price level in that year (Pt) to the price level at the time of the ml—

places the investment at the midpoint of a year.

2Most structures are not eligible for the sum—of—the--years'—digits method but are
eligible for the 150 percent declining balance method.
3Because the nominal values of these tax savings are essentially known when the
investment is made, the rate at which they are discounted may be lower then the
rate at which other net receipts are discounted.

               and the real value of the depreciation in year t is DHt(1+i)_t.

        The basic idea in indexed depreciation is to adjust each year's allowable

depreciation for the increase in the price level since the asset was

purchased. This has the effect of making the real value of depreciation in

each year of the asset's life independent of the rate of inflation. If

p denotes the price level at the time the investment is made and t denotes

the price level t years later, the allowable depreciation with the indexing

method is DIt =             DHt. If the inflation rate is constant at j, 't'0 =

 (l+i)t    and DIt =   (l÷i)t   DHt.   The increase in the nominal amount of allowable

depreciation exactly offsets the fall in the real value of the dollar and



Aiaive and essentially equivalent approach is to discount the nominal
 depreciation amounts by a nominal discount rate equal to the sum of the infla-
 tion rate and the original real discount rate. The resulting expression for
 CH differs from that in equation 1.2 only by a second—order term that disappears
 if discounting is continuous.

Reduced Depreciation Lives

         Shortening the allowable depreciation life changes the values of

the DHt's but does not make any explicit adjustment for changes in the price

level. If we let T* denote the new shorter depreciation life for the asset,

ITC* the new rate of investment tax credit, and DAt the fraction of the initial.

cost that is deducted in year t, the net cost of investment can be written:

                                                     T*
(1.14)                 CA = 1    —    ITC* —

                                                                        —
         If   the sum of—the—years'—digits               method is applied with the new shorter

life,     the depreciation in year t rises from DHt                     = 2(T—t+1)/T(T+1) to DAt =

2(T*_t+1)/T*(T*+1). For example, reducing T from T=lO years to T*5 years raLses
the first year depreciation from                18   percent of the initial cost to 33 percent
of   the initial cost.

         Comparing C1 n equation 1.14 and CA in equation 1.5 shows that

the relative net costs under these two ways of changing the current depre-

ciation method will depend on the rate of interest, the rate of inflation, the

depreciation life of the asset, and the proposed method of accelerating depre-

ciation.


2. Inflation and the Cost of Investment with Existing Tax Rules

         Before comparing the effects of indexing and acceleration, it is
                                     _14

useful to examine the way in which inflation raises the net cost of investment

with existing tax rules. Table 2 presents the ratio of the net cost of

equipment investment with the specified rate of inflation divided by the net

cost when there is no inflation. These relative net cost ratios are presented

for different combinations of the real discount rate and the allowable tax life.

The corresponding ratios for investments in structures are presented in

Table 3.

     Consider, for example, the effect of an 8 percent sustained rate

of inflation on the relative net cost of an investment in equipment. With a

real discount rate of 14 percent (i.e., a nominal discount rate of approximately

12 percent), the net cost of investment for a 13 year piece of equipment is 21

percent higher than it would be if there were no inflation. In comparison to

the net cost of $51.90 in the absence of inflation that was shown in Table 1,

the 8 percent inflation raises the net cost to $62.56.1 With a lower rate of

discount the increase in the net cost is greater; e.g., lowering the nominal

discount rate from about 12 percent to 8 percent (i.e., a real discount rate of

zero) raises the cost increase from 21 percent to 31 percent. Raising the nomi-

nal discount rate to about 15 percent reduces the cost increase from 21 percent

to 16 percent. Thus for any plausible discount rate, the 8 percent inflation

rate causes a substantial rise in the net cost of investment.

     An increase in the allowable tax life of the asset generally increases

the sensitivity of its net cost to inflation.2 With a real discount rate of 14

Thnce abolishing the entire investment tax credit would raise the net cost of
investment from $51.90 to $61.90, the 8 percent inflation has a greater effect
than eliminating the entire ITC.

2Only with high discount rates and very long lives is this reversed. Auerbach
(1979) shows that, with his alternative measure of the distorting effect of
investment, the extra cost decreases monotonically with the durability of the
investment if there is exponential depreciation and a fixed real net rate of
return.

percent or more, there is little extra rise in the relative net cost for

increases in the asset life beyond 13 years. But inflation clearly raises the

net cost of short—lived investments by relatively less than the increase in

the net cost of long—lived assets and therefore biases the pattern of invest-

ment in favor of short—lived assets.

      The relative increases in the net cost of investments in structures that

are shown in Table 3 are very similar to the corresponding figures for equip-

ment in Table 2.      This   represents two offsetting factors. Because structures

are not eligible for the investment tax credit or the suni_of_theyears'—digitS

method of depreciation, the net cost of an investment in structures is higher

in the absence of inflation; this was shown in Table 1. The lower rate of

depreciation   also means that inflation causes a greater absolute increase in

the   net cost of investment. Since the two increases are of approximately

equal proportions, the increase in the relative net cost is about the same.

For example, in the absence of inflation, a structure with an 18 year life

would have a net cost of $66.62 per $100 of investment at a 14 percent discount
rate. This is 23 percent higher than the net cost of $514.08 per $100 of equip-

ment investment with the same depreciation life and discount rate. An 8 percent

inflation   would raise the net cost of the investment in structures to $79.98, an

increase of $13.36 or 20 percent. Similarly, an 8 percent inflation would raise

the net cost of equipment investment by $12.11 or 22 percent. The cost of

 investment in structures is thus 21 percent higher than the cost of a comparable

              in equipment. As a result, the relative net cost ratios in Tables      2
 investment

and   3 are very similar: 1.22 for equipment and 1.20 for structures.

inflation. Although shortening the depreciation life to 5 years for equip-

ment- reduces the sensitivity of the net cost to the rate of inflation, it
stilt   leaves some dependence of the real net cost on the rate of inflation.
For low enough rates of inflation and for relatively long depreciation lives,
the acceleration proposal2 reduces net cost by more than indexing would. For
higher rates of         inflation and assets with shorter lives under existing tax

rules, the acceleration proposal fails to compensate for the increased rate of

infiat ion.

        Table   )4   shows the ratio of the net cost of equipment investment wider the

acceleration proposal to the net cost under the indexing proposal. Since

indexing would maintain the same real net cost under every inflation rate

(including no inflation), the figures in Table 1 also show the ratio of the

real net cost under acceleration to what the real net cost would be under the

existing tax law if there were no inflation.

        The figures in Table 1 indicate that the specific acceleration proposal

is a quite close approximation of indexing at moderate rates of inflation and

real interest. This also implies that the acceleration would essentially             of C—

Consider, for example, equipment with an allowable depreciation period of 13

       Table 14 also shows that acceleration favors longer lived investmentsJ

With a 14 percent real discount rate and an 8 percent rate of' inflation, the net

cost per dollar of investment is 9 percent higher for an investment with an 8

year life than for an investment with an 18 year life. With a real discount

rate   of' 7 percent,   the extra cost is 12 percent higher. This bias toward longer
lived investments is slightly stronger than the bias toward shorter lived
investments that prevails under existing tax rules.
       The relative net cost of acceleration and indexing remains between 0.9 and
1.1 for almost al]. combinations of real discount rates between 14 and 7 per-

cent, inflation rates between 14 and 12 percent, and lives between 3 years and

25   years.2 Within this "band" between 90 percent and 110 percent of      the

indexed     cost,   the "acceleration—to--indexatiOn" net cost ratio is higher for

short lived assets, higher inflation rates and lower real discount rates. If

the discount rate is very low or the inflation rate is very high, acceleration

 is not able to eliminate the effects of' inflation.

       The results are quite similar for investments in. structures. Table 5 shows

 that the acceleration proposal and complete indexing produce, approximately equal

      comparison is complicated by the change in the ITC under the specific
 acceleration proposal which would also reduce the cost of' very short—lived
 investments.

 2Note that a 5 percent difference is equivalent to changing the investment tax
 credit by 2.5 to 3.0 percent while a 10 percent difference is equivalent to
 changing the investment tax credit by 5 to 6 percent.

Each figure in the table is the ratio of the net cost of investment in struc—
tures with the acceleration proposal divided by the net cost of the investment
with complete indexing.

real net costs of investment if the real discount rate is between 1 percent and
1    percent    and the inflation rate is between 1   percent   and 12 percent. When
there    is    little or no inflation, the proposed shortening of lives obviously

reduces the net cost by more than indexing would. Conversely, if the inflation

rate is high or the discount rate is low, the shortening of lives does not

reduce the net cost enough to offset the effect of inflation.


b.     Conclusion
        A firm's real net cost of investing in plant and equipment depends on the

investment       tax credit and the present value of the future real depreciation

deductions. With the existing historic cost method of depreciation, a higher

rate of' inflation reduces the real value of future depreciation deductions and

therefore       raises the real net cost of investment.

        The calculations presented in the paper show that the rise in the net

cost per dollar of investment can be quite substantial. The real net cost of

an equipment investment with a 13 year tax life is raised 21 percent by an 8

percent expected inflation rate if the firm uses a real discount rate of 4

percent (i.e., a nominal discount rate of 12 percent). For any real discount
rat.e, inflation raises the net cost relatively more for long—lived assets than

for assets with shorter tax lives, thereby distorting the pattern of invest-

ment in favor of short—lived investments.

        The effects of inflation on the net cost of investment can be completely

eliminated by an indexing rule that adjusts the cost base for the rise in the

general price level. A more accelerated depreciation schedule can also lower

the net cost of investment and make that net cost less sensitive to the rate
                                          —23—



of   inflation. The current paper examines a particular acceleration proposal

(that essentially provides a 5 year life for all equipment and a 10 year life

for all structures) and finds that, for moderate rate of inflation and real

discount rates, the acceleration proposal and full indexation are quite simi-

lar. For low rates of inflation, high discount rates, or very long—lived

investments, the acceleration proposal causes greater reductions in net cost

than would   result   from complete indexing. Conversely, for high rates of

inflation, low discount rates, or very short—lived investments, the accelera-

tion method fails to balance the adverse effects of inflation on the net cost

of investment.

      Advocates of the acceleration method argue that it can achieve the same

desirable offset to the adverse effect that inflation has on the cost of

investment as indexing can, but without the administrative complexities of

indexing or the risk of an economically destabilizing extension of the

indexing principle to other aspects of the economy. The analysis in the present

paper of a particular acceleration proposal indicates that this claim is essentially

true if the inflation rate is in the range of 14 percent to 12 percent and the

investor's real discount rate is between 14 percent and 7 percent. With higher

or lower inflation rates or real discount rates, the acceleration method can

he substantially different from indexation. The accelerated depreciation

schedule could of     course   be altered in the future if   economic conditions

change   significantly, but the possibility of such ad hoc adjustments is
 inherently destabilizing and the lack of retroactive adjustment introduces
unnecessary risks into current investment decisions.
     Since the acceleration and indexation methods have quite similar efrects

under existing economic conditions, the choice between them requires balancing

the administr@ive simplicity and other possible advantages of acceleration against

the automatic protection that indexation offers against the risk of significant

changes from the recent inflation rates and discount rates.

                                             Appendix A

                       Total and Partial Responses of the Internal

                          Rate of Return to Changes in Net Cost

     This appendix shows how a rise in the net cost of investment affects the

internal       rate of return on   investment in a general equilibrium context in

which    the    price of the product can vary. The analysis here thus elaborates the

remark on page 9 of       the text about the importance of       the elasticities of the

supply of funds and the demand for the product. For simplicity, the appendix

takes the wage rate as numeraire and assumes that there is only a single cton—

sumer good in the economy.1

        Consider a "standard machine" to be one that uses one unit of labor per

period, has a durability of T years, and produces output y(t) for O<t<T. Let

the gross price of the machine be g, the price per unit of output be constant at

p and the wage rate be unity. The net operating profit (quasirent) in year t of'

the machine's life is thus q(t) =            p.y(t)—l.    Let the tax rate be T, the annual

depreciation deductions be d(t) and the investment tax credit be ITC. The inter-

nal rate of return on the investment (x) is then defined implicitly by:

                                      T
(A—i)                    g = (i—T)    f q Ct) e —xt dt + ITC
                                     0
                                                                  T
                                                            + fd(t) e — xt     dt.
                                                                 0
If   the net cost of      investment C c) is calculated at the same internal rate of'

return equation A—l implies:
                                         T
(A—2)                    c =   (i—T) fq(t) e —xt dt.
                                      0

1This ignores changes in the relative prices of the final goods produced with
capital, the capital goods themselves and other goods like housing. The gross
price of the investment good is treated as exogenous on the implicit assumption
that the investment goods are made by labor alone. The analysis also assumes
only a simple technology of production.
                                                 A-2

Thus an increase in c and an equiproportionate increase in the q(t)'s keeps the

internal rate of return unchanged.

      We now extend this analysis from a single standard machine to the entire

capital stock. For any equilibrium age structure of the capital stock, the

distribution of machine outputs (y(t)'s) remains constant and therefore the mean

output remains constant at .               The mean quasirent is therefore also a constant,

qp37—l. On the basis of equation A—2 we can write the function relating the

internal rate of return to the net cost and the average quasirent as

(A—3)                  x =    x   (q, c)

with the understanding that this function is homogeneous of degree zero in q and

C.

         Let the supply of capital be an increasing function of the net rate of

return:

(A—1ii                KS = S       Cx),          s'>O.
The   demand for capital depends on the demand for the product1- and therefore
on the price of the product:
(A-5)                        + D (p) ,           D'<O.

Equating the supply and demand for capital gives the equilibrium condition:

(A-6)                  S[x(p—l, c)] = D(p)

         Totally differentiating and collecting terms implies:

(A—7)                               _________________

        Before going further to simplify and interpret the right hand side of A—9,

it is useful to not that when the supply of funds                      is   infinitely elastic with

respect to the net yield (s' =       °°), dx/dc         =   0,   i.e., the net return is unaffected

by changes in the net cost of investment. Similarly, for any S'>O, if the

demand for the product is completely inelastic, consumers bear the entire burden

of any rise in c and dx/dc =       0.
        It is easier to interpret A—9 if it is rewritten in terms of elasticities.

Let       =   xK S' and liD =   — pK —1 Dt be the relevant supply and demand elasti-

cities. Let exq = qx —l (x/q) and exc = q x1 (x/c) be partial elasticities

of the rate of return with respect to q and c. Let ct                        = q/py,    the share of the

quasirent in the total value of output. Finally, let Exc be the total elasti-

city of the rate of return with respect to c.

Equation A—9 simplifies directly to

(A—b)                  Exc =
                                   1—y x S

(A—li)                 Exc =                exc

                                        a   fl

But since x Is homogeneous of degree zero in c and q, exq = — exc and A—il implies

(A—l2)                 Ec =                 exc

        The implication of         ooand          = 0 have already been noted. Consider now

                                                                              =         regardless of how

investments for which the partial   elasticity    is a very large      —10, the

total elasticity is only Ec = iOcz/(ct +   10).    Since a <1, this is bounded by only

10/11; a more plausible value of a 1/3 implies Exc = 10/31 or 0.32. Of course,

this reflects the assumption that     =      and a higher ratio of     and    Would

raise Exc relative to       But for a wide range of plausible elasticities of

supply and demand, the total response of the rate of return will be substan-

tially smaller than the partial response.

                     After—Tax Internal Rates of Return

                       With Indexing and Acceleration

     This appendix presents the real after—tax internal rates of return for

investments under the indexing and acceleration methods of depreciation.

Results are presented for assets of different life and for different inflation

rates. Separate figures are given for equipment and for structures.

     The gross operating profits of each investment are assumed to decline

geometrically over the life of the investment. The rate of decline is the

inverse of the life of the investment. The initial level of gross operating

profit is selected to make the pretax internal rate of return 11 percent. The

allowable tax depreciation life is assumed equal to the economic life.

     The calculated internal rates of return are presented in Table B—i.
