                                              ABSTRACT

We use a unique, nationally representative cross-national dataset to document the reduction in individuals’
usage of routine non-emergency medical care in the midst of the economic crisis. A substantially larger
fraction of Americans have reduced medical care than have individuals in Great Britain, Canada, France,
and Germany, all countries with universal health care systems. At the national level, reductions in
medical care are related to the degree to which individuals must pay for it, and within countries are
strongly associated with exogenous shocks to wealth and employment

        The global economic crisis, beginning roughly in July of 2007, took an historic toll

on national economies and household finances around the world. Stock markets plummeted

and unemployment rates rose markedly. What is the impact of such large shocks on

individuals and their behavior? In this research, we examine the relationship between the

crisis and medical care usage and show that the economic crisis had lead to reductions in

individuals seeking care.

        Economic distress’ impact on medical care usage is mediated by its impact on

individuals’ health and their resources to pay for care.    Previous research suggests that

economic distress, especially unemployment, can have severe negative effects on health.1 In

addition, individuals’ willingness to seek care may decline with reduced financial resources to

pay for it, as evidenced by a voluminous literature documenting a negative association

between economic circumstances and health status and medical care usage.2 Evidence from

developing countries also finds that individuals reduce their usage of medical care following

economic crises.3 However, some recent studies find that health conditions may improve

rather than decline in economic downturns,4 in part attributable to the additional time that

reduced work hours or unemployment create for seeking routine medical care.5

        Whether medical care increases or decreases in the face of the economic crisis is

ultimately an empirical question. Our paper draws on new unique cross-national survey data

to assess how the economic shocks brought on by the global economic crises affected the

use of medical care in five developed economies: the United States, Great Britain, Canada,

France, and Germany. We focus on changes in the utilization of routine medical care. This

focus on routine medical care allows us to separate out the contrasting predictions of (a)

reductions in care due to tighter resource constraints, (b) increases in care due to more time

availability, and (c) increases in care due to severe deterioration in health. While the former


                                                                                             3
two processes should be related to changes in routine care usage, the latter process should

instead impact hospitalizations and other forms of acute care.1

           If the primary barrier to not seeking routine care is having time to do so, we would

expect to find that (1) the use of routine care should have increased since the economic

crisis, (2) reductions in the usage of routine care should be negatively associated with

unemployment, (3) but have no association with wealth loss, and (4) not vary substantially

across countries. If instead the decision whether to seek care is constrained by financial

resources, then (1) the use of routine care should have declined overall since the economic

crisis, (2) reductions in the usage of routine care should be positively associated with

unemployment and (3) have a positive association with wealth loss, and finally, (4) there

should be differences across countries depending on the privately borne portion of the cost

of care.

           This last factor merits some additional explanation. While there is some cost to

routine care in most of the countries under study, the amount of that cost varies

considerably. While all individuals in Great Britain, Canada, France, and Germany are

covered by national health care systems, only 85.3% of individuals in the United States are

covered by health insurance.6      But, even in countries with universal coverage, individuals

pay some medical care costs out of pocket. Using economy-wide data, in 2007 these

payments accounted for 0.8% of GDP in France, 1.0% in Great Britain, 1.4% in Germany,

1.5% in Canada, and 2.0% in the United States.6 Among counties with national health care

systems, France has the highest level of cost sharing for routine care; patients generally pay a

30% coinsurance for outpatient physician services and a 35% coinsurance for prescription

drugs.7     In Germany, co-payments of 5 to 10 Euros are required for physician visits and

outpatient medications.8 There is no cost sharing in Great Britain and Canada for routine



                                                                                              4
care; however, prescriptions are not covered by the Canadian system. 9 In the United States,

the 15% of the population that is uninsured is fully responsible for the cost of routine care,

and those who are covered still face copayments and coinsurance costs. Even in countries

that provide ―universal‖ health care, we might expect to find reductions in routine medical

care usage following the economic crisis and to observe associations between such

reductions and wealth losses and unemployment. As a general principal, we expect to find

greater reductions in routine medical care usage in the countries where seeking medical care

has a greater economic cost, e.g., the United States.



Study Data ad Methods:

        Data Source: To assess how shocks to family resources affect medical care usage,

we analyze a new data source, the TNS Global Economic Crisis survey, which we helped

design and which was administered in June and July of 2009 in the United States, Great

Britain, Canada, France, and Germany. The global market research firm TNS fielded the

survey using an online questionnaire. In total 6,485 respondents were interviewed, including

2,148 in the United States, 1,001 in Great Britain, 1,132 in Canada, 1,097 in France, and

1,107 in Germany. The samples were designed to be nationally representative of each

country’s population 18–65 years of age and were subsequently weighted to reflect each

nation’s population. Nevertheless, it remains likely that our sample under-represents the

most vulnerable groups of the population, including migrant workers and homeless people.

This sampling will work against finding a result if the economic crisis has had the most

severe effects on these individuals.

        Medical Care Usage: Our survey assessed how respondents in each of the five

countries changed their routine medical care usage. Respondents were asked, ―Since the



                                                                                            5
economic crisis have you increased, decreased, or kept the same trips to the doctor for

routine medical and non-emergency treatment?‖ We chose this wording as opposed to

asking about ―preventive‖ care so as not to bias respondents toward selecting the socially

acceptable answer. Self-reported measures of medical care usage are widely employed in the

literature and have been shown to have good association with measures of care based on

administrative and medical records.10

        Economic Distress: To explore how changes in household economic conditions

relate to changes in routine medical care usage, we use two other variables in the survey.

First, we asked respondents to report any changes in the value of their financial assets since

the onset of the crisis, indicating whether their assets increased in value (by 0–10% or greater

than 10%), stayed the same, or fell in value (by 0–10%, 10–29%, 30–50%, or greater than

50%). Respondents could also state that they did not know the answer or could refuse to

answer. If these self-reported metrics are noisy, measurement error will bias against finding

a relationship between shocks to wealth and reductions in routine medical care usage.

Second, we collect information on employment status, using a variable that is set equal to 1

if the respondent is unemployed and looking for work and 0 otherwise.                 Data on

unemployment were not collected for the Canadian sample, so analyses that include this

variable are restricted to a sample of 4,405 respondents in the United States, Great Britain,

France, and Germany.

        Empirical analysis: We begin by presenting descriptive cross-country analyses of

respondents’ reports of changes in medical care usage and respondents’ reports of wealth

loss and unemployment. Next, we show the bi-variate association between our measure of

reduction   in   routine   medical      care   usage   and   our   measure    of   change    in

wealth/unemployment. Finally, we estimate a set of multivariate regression models to



                                                                                              6
examine whether the link between shocks to resources and changes in routine medical care

usage persists after controlling for additional demographic characteristics (age, gender, and

education), income, and wealth. In addition, we test whether the changes in usage are more

pronounced in the United States, which does not have a national health care system and in

which out-of-pocket health costs at the national level are the highest among the countries

considered in this work.

        We limit the sample to respondents who had complete data on our dependent

variable as well as information on education, age, and gender, variables that we include in

our multivariate regression model. We include dummy variables for respondents missing

data on two key independent variables, our measure of income, and our measure of post-

crisis wealth. This leaves us with a sample of 5,347 respondents. To test for robustness, we

used alternative estimates that used multiple imputation to construct data for those reporting

missing values or where we simply deleted the cases with missing data (Exhibit T1). These

robustness tests yielded substantively similar results.



Study Results:

        Reductions in Usage of Routine Care: Tabulating results by country shows

substantial cross-national variation in post-crisis changes in routine medical care usage. Of

American respondents, 26.5% reported reducing their use of routine medical care since the

economic crisis (Exhibit 1). This proportion dwarfs the 5.6% of Canadian, 7.6% of British,

10.3% of German, and 12% of French respondents reporting such reductions.                This

ordering tracks with the level of privately-borne out-of-pocket routine medical costs across

countries. Both absolutely and comparatively, Americans, who face higher out-of-pocket




                                                                                            7
health care costs, reduced their routine medical care more than respondents in the other four

countries.

        Small minorities of respondents also reported increasing care, with between 5.4%

and 7.9% of respondents giving that response. The fraction increasing care did not vary

substantially across countries. We subtract the share increasing care from the share reporting

decreasing care to generate a measure of net change in care. For most countries, we observe

a net decrease in medical care. Specifically, on net, 19.5% of Americans reduced their use of

routine care (Exhibit 1).     In Canada and Great Britain, where few copayments or

coinsurance payments are required, there is essentially no change in aggregate country-level

routine medical care usage (-0.04% and -0.31%, respectively). In France and Germany,

where larger copayments are required, we observe intermediate levels of net reductions in

routine medical care usage, 6.6% and 3.6%, respectively. This exercise further highlights the

disparity in routine medical care reductions between the United States and the four

comparison countries.

        Changes in Wealth and Unemployment: Wealth losses were pervasive among

households in the United States, with nearly 55% of American respondents reporting some

decline in their wealth since the start of the economic crisis and one-fifth reporting a decline

of 30% or larger (Exhibit 2). Losses were smaller in Great Britain, Canada, France, and

Germany, with between 45% and 34% of respondents reporting any loss of wealth and

between 13% and 9% reporting losses in excess of 30%.

        Unemployment increased sharply during the crisis. The share of respondents who

reported being unemployed and looking for work was largest in Germany (14.4%) and the

United States (13.8%), somewhat less in France (10.1%), and lower still in Great Britain

(6.6%). These figures indicate that the economic crisis took a greater immediate economic



                                                                                              8
toll on Americans than on individuals living in France, Canada, and Great Britain.

        Economic Distress and Medical Care Usage: These negative shocks to wealth

and employment are strongly associated with reductions in routine medical care (Exhibit 3).

The greater the reported loss in wealth, the larger the net reductions in routine care across all

countries. Similarly, net care reductions were more pronounced among the unemployed.

        Exhibit 4 presents selected marginal effects from a multivarite probit regression

model run on the pooled cross-national sample (the complete model specification is

presented in Exhibit T2). Even after controlling for post-crisis wealth, income, education,

age, and other characteristics, wealth loss is significantly associated with reductions in routine

medical care usage (Model 1). As compared with respondents who reported no change in

their wealth since the crisis, surveyed individuals who lost between 30% and 50% of their

wealth are 23.3 percentage points more likely to have reduced routine medical care usage,

and those who lost at least 50% of their wealth are 24.9 percentage points more likely to

have reduced care. Unemployed respondents looking for work are 6.7 percentage points

more likely to have reduced routine care than others (Model 2). In other words, we see

substantial reductions in routine medical care usage as a result of shocks resulting from the

economic crisis, even after accounting for many household characteristics.

        We also find that reductions in routine medical care were higher for the young and

for those with lower incomes. In particular, relative to those aged 50 to 65, respondents

aged 16-24, 25-34 and 35-49 were 11.7, 6.8 and 4.6 percentage points more likely to reduce

care respectively. Relative to individuals in the top income quartile, those in the bottom

quartile, 26-50th percentile, and 51 to 75th percentile were 5.7, 5.9, and 2.0 percentage points

more likely to reduce medical care respectively.11




                                                                                                9
        Exhibit 5 reports selected results from a multi-nomial probit regression that jointly

analyzes the determinants of those who decreased, kept the same, and increased routine

medical care usage (the complete model specification is presented in Exhibit T3). While

there are few statistically significant associations between changes in wealth or

unemployment and increases in care (relative to no change in care), we continue to find large

and statistically significant associations between reductions in care and wealth loss and

unemployment. Focusing on wealth loss, respondents who lost between 30% and 50% of

their wealth are 22.8 percentage points more likely to have reduced routine medical care

usage, and those who lost at least 50% of their wealth are 23.1 percentage points more likely

to have reduced care as opposed to keeping care the same relative to those whose wealth is

unchanged. Unemployed respondents 6.7 percentage points more likely to reduce care than

those who are not unemployed. These estimates of the marginal effects of wealth loss and

unemployment are quite similar to those from the simpler bi-variate model discussed above.

        Exhibit 4 also reports country fixed effects that capture the levels of reduction in

routine medical care use by country, after holding household factors constant. Reductions in

care were far greater in the United States than elsewhere, even after controlling for

household characteristics. Compared with Great Britain, Americans were 16 percentage

points more likely to reduce care. In contrast, French and German respondents were only

4.5 and 3.8 percentage points more likely, respectively, to reduce care than British

respondents, while Canadian respondents were actually 3 percentage points less likely to

reduce care. As with the descriptive statistics reported in Exhibit 1, the magnitude of these

country effects aligns with the size of the required coinsurance and copayments for routine

care.

        Finally, we tested whether the strength of the relationships between our markers of



                                                                                          10
economic distress (wealth loss and unemployment) and reductions in care varied by country.

We first re-estimated our models separately by country and found strong relationships

between wealth loss and unemployment and reductions in medical care usage in each

country, with the exception of Great Britain (Exhibit T4). To test whether the relationship

between routine heath care usage and wealth loss and unemployment varies among

countries, we also re-estimated our models to include interaction terms between country

dummies and each of the two variables measuring economic shocks.               Generally, the

relationship between wealth loss and reduction in routine medical care levels is statistically

indistinguishable in the United States as compared to the other four countries. Similarly,

there is no variation in the relationship between unemployment and reduction in use of

routine care in the United States as compared with the other four countries (Exhibit T5).

This result aligns with previous research that finds similar income gradients in access to care

in the United States and Canada.12



Discussion:

       We find strong evidence that the economic crisis—manifested in job and wealth

losses—has led to reductions in the use of routine medical care. More than a quarter of

Americans reported reducing their use of such care as did between 5% and 12% of

Canadian, French, Germany, and British respondents. These cross-national differences align

with differences in the out-of-pocket costs of care across countries. Moreover, reductions in

routine care are strongly related to wealth and job losses, showing that households in

economic distress were more likely to reduce medical care usage. In contrast, we find that

relatively few households reported increasing medical care and that there was no significant

relationship between unemployment and increased use of medical care.



                                                                                            11
       This research confirms that resource constraints have large impacts on the usage of

routine medical care. Further, the across-the-board reduction in medical care usage by

Americans may speak to behavioral changes that reflect the national psyche broadly. The

economic crisis in the United States—deeper and more widespread than elsewhere—may

have touched the population at large, perhaps via negative expectations about the future.

Furthermore, the cutbacks in health care usage by people losing wealth or jobs, even in

countries with ―universal‖ systems, may reflect that seeking care entails not only out-of-

pocket expenses, but also costs of time away from work or job hunting.

       President Obama has embarked on twin efforts to bring the United States out of the

severe economic crisis and make reforms to the American health care system. We show that

these are by no means separate areas of policy; the economic distress brought on by the

crisis is related to large reductions in routine medical care usage. Historical demography and

economics has shown that famines and epidemics that have short-run effects on health and

well-being often have long-term consequences.13 While we cannot observe long-term

consequences of the reductions in use of routine medical care that survey participants

reported to us, today’s penny-pinching might well lead to tomorrow’s undetected illness and

the more-distant future’s reduced individual health and well-being.
