                                             ABSTRACT

An important dialogue between theorists and experimentalists over the past few decades has raised
the study of the interaction of psychological and economic incentives from academic curiosity to a
bona fide academic field. One recent area of study within this genre that has sparked interest and debate
revolves around the “hidden costs” of conditional incentives. This study overlays randomization on
a naturally-occurring environment in a series of temporally-linked field experiments to advance our
understanding of the economics of charity and test if such “costs” exist in the field. This approach
permits us to examine why people initially give to charities, and what factors keep them committed
to the cause. Several key findings emerge. First, there are hidden benefits of conditional incentives
that would have gone undetected had we maintained a static theory and an experimental design that
focused on short run substitution effects rather than dynamic interactions. Second, we can reject the
pure altruism model of giving. Third, we find that public good provision is maximized in both the
short and long run by using conditional, rather than unconditional, incentives.

I. Introduction


        According to Greek mythology, mankind’s first philanthropist was the Titan,

Prometheus, who gave fire to mortal man. Since Prometheus’ initial act of charity, providing

assistance to others has become a cornerstone of many cultures and belief systems.1 Despite the

historical link with religious activity or duty, the role of charitable fund-raising and the number

of organizations involved in such activities has been expanding rapidly.2 In the United States

alone, there are now more than 1.5 million registered non-profit organizations and nearly 90

percent of all American families contribute to charity.

        While fund-raisers have developed a variety of strategies to achieve specific funding

targets, such strategies frequently rely upon rules of thumb rather than hard scientific evidence

on what induces donors to give. For example, a popular belief amongst fund-raisers is that

potential donors are more generous when gifts are included with solicitation requests. While

there is ample empirical evidence that unconditional gifts enhance fund-raising success (see, e.g.,

Alpizar et al. 2008; Edlund et al. 2007; Falk 2007; Regan 1971; Whatley et al. 1999), there are

numerous other ways charities organize gift exchange in field settings – i.e., making gifts

conditional and varying the minimum donation required to obtain such gifts.

        Viewed through the lens of behavioral economics, the use of conditional gifts is a puzzle.

Within the context of principal-agent games, such incentives have been shown to influence

behavioral in an unexpected manner – the use of explicit threats to sanction shirking backfires

1
  For example, the concept of giving (zakat) is among five duties incumbent upon every Muslim. Similar notions of
giving are fundamental to other religions such as Judaism (tsedakah), Buddhism (dana), and Christianity (tithing)
and appear as central themes in writings such as Cicero’s On Moral Obligations or Alexander Pope’s “An Essay on
Man” that cross generations and cultures.
2
  Starting in the mid-1800s, non-profit organizations introduced fund-raising techniques that targeted individual
donors for financial assistance. Perhaps spurred by the desires of entrepreneurs such as Andrew Carnegie, Edsel
Ford, and John D. Rockefeller, many of these approaches were designed to assure donors that their funds would be
used to further the development of deserving individuals. For a more detailed history of charity and philanthropy,
we refer the interested reader to Giving: Charity and Philanthropy in History, by Robert H. Bremmer.

                                                                                                                 1
and serves to crowd out motivation (see, e.g., Falk and Kosfeld, 2006; Fehr and List, 2004; Fehr

and Rockenbach, 2003; Sliwka, 2007). Accordingly, the use of conditional incentives (control)

entails “hidden” costs that escape our attention if reasoning is based on models that assume

individuals are exclusively self-interested (Fehr and List, 2004). Despite this evidence, whether

and how reciprocity and control influence charitable donations is an important open issue.

         In this study, we present an empirical approach that is composed of a set of field

treatments that parallel the important economic features of the environments in previous studies

examining the costs of control. To do so, we organize a series of capital campaigns for the

Center for Natural Hazards Research at East Carolina University. Importantly, we use natural

incentives to change exogenously the solicitees’ action space.3                      In one set of treatments,

solicitees are provided an unconditional small or large gift. In another set of treatments, the most

opportunistic actions are ruled out by making the gifts conditional—i.e., the solicitee must

contribute a positive dollar amount to obtain the small or large gift. The final set of treatments

restricts the choice set even further by enforcing greater control over the donor—the donor

receives the small (large) gift only if she contributes at least to the level of a certain price point

($1 ($25)), the approximate retail value of the gift.                   In this way, if solicitor trust is a

characteristic rewarded by solicitees, then the control evoked in the final set of treatments via

introduction of the price point might crowd out donations.

         We observe several interesting data patterns. First, unconditional gifts enhance fund-

raising success.       Relative to individuals approached in the baseline treatment, solicitees

approached in our unconditional large gift treatment are nearly twice as likely to contribute

(36.8% versus 21.3%) and, on average, donate more than twice as much ($4.48 versus $1.90) to


3
 In this regard, our work shares similarity with Landry et al. (2011) who explore the effect of conditional and
unconditional gifts on the productivity of solicitors raising money for the Hazard Center.

                                                                                                                  2
the Hazard Center. Second, both average contributions per contact and participation rates are

reduced when we introduce conditionality. For example, average contributions in our no price

point treatment are approximately fifty percent lower than those observed in our unconditional

large gift treatment. Moreover, both rates of giving and average donations per contact are

decreasing in the contribution level (price point) required to obtain the large gift. These results

are consonant with our theoretical model.

       Third, we observe an increased propensity for donors in our conditional gift treatments to

pool at the minimum contribution level required to obtain the gift. Whereas 2.04 percent of all

households approached contribute $1.00 in our unconditional small gift treatment, the percentage

of households that contribute this amount in the corresponding price point treatment increases

nearly six-fold. We observe similar data patterns in our large gift treatments – the percentage of

households contributing $25 nearly triples when we move from the unconditional to the price

point treatment.

       Finally, net public good provision per household – average contributions less the costs of

purchasing the gifts – is increasing in the price point. In fact, gross proceeds in both the

unconditional and no price point large gift treatments were insufficient to cover our costs of

purchasing the large gift. Net revenues per contact in these treatments are thus significantly

lower than that observed in both the baseline and price point large gift treatments. Hence, our

data suggest that in the short-run a charity is better off providing gifts conditionally to screen

non-reciprocal types for whom gift exchange is a net loser.

       However, as conditional gifts serve to crowd out donors, it is not clear whether

conditionality is an optimal long-run strategy. Since households in our unconditional large gift

treatment were approximately 74.4 percent more likely to give than counterparts approached in



                                                                                                 3
the corresponding price point treatment, it is plausible that unconditional gifts enhance

profitability in the long-run. To better ascertain long-run impacts, we returned to the field and

implemented a second door-to-door fund-raising experiment.

         In designing the second field experiment, we made use of detailed information on

whether and how households were previously approached. Two distinct household types – (i)

those who contributed in experiment I (warm-list households) and (ii) those who have never

contributed to the Hazard Center (cold-list households) – were randomly approached and asked

to contribute using a simple ask strategy. As small gifts had no discernable impact on outcomes

in experiment I, we restrict the sample of warm-list households to those previously approached

in either the baseline or one of the three large-gift treatments.

         Results from the second experiment highlight two main findings. First, feelings of

reciprocity – as triggered by the receipt of an unconditional gift – wane over time. Households

initially attracted by an unconditional gift are approximately 60.2 percent less likely to contribute

in our follow-up experiment and provide average gifts that are approximately 63 percent lower

than counterparts initially attracted by a conditional gift. This suggests that the conditionality

served as an effective screen of those who were truly interested in giving to our charity. Second,

households initially attracted via a conditional gift are significantly more likely to contribute and

provide larger average gifts than counterparts who initially gave in the baseline. Taken jointly,

our data therefore suggest that conditional gift exchange proves a superior fund-raising strategy

in both the short- and the long-run.4

         Our results therefore can be interpreted as speaking to several distinct literatures. For the

reciprocity literature, our results suggest that gift exchange is important, but that it is limited to


4
  This result is consonant with Landry et al. (2011) who find that the use of conditional rewards to incent solicitors is
a profit enhancing wage structure.

                                                                                                                       4
the immediate source of kindness; that is, all effects of gift exchange are contemporaneous.

Speaking to the fundraising literature, we can reject the pure altruism model and instead find

evidence in favor of the signaling and warm glow models (Vesterlund, 2003; Andreoni, 2006;

List and Lucking-Reiley, 2002). Further, our results shed light on the puzzle of why some

charities use conditional gifts whereas others choose unconditional gifts.                    For behavioral

economics, we find new evidence of the hidden benefits of control: whereas the benefits arise

because conditionality is an effective technology to screen donors, such effects would have been

missed had we followed the standard approach of using a static model and an experimental

design that focused on measuring short run substitution effects.


II. Theoretical Model


        We provide a simple model to focus our attention on the most important determinants of

giving. Our framework augments Andreoni’s (1989, 1990) impure altruism model to allow for

reciprocal preferences over gifts provided either conditionally or unconditionally. We consider

an agent i   who receives utility from consuming a numeraire good, yi , a public good

provided at level G , and (possibly) from their contribution to the public good b . Receiving a

gift generates some consumption utility, vi ( g ) , where g measures the perceived cost of the gift

to the charity and vi (0)  0 . Receiving a gift may also trigger reciprocity captured by an

additional utility component, ri (bi ,  g ) . Feelings of reciprocity are assumed to depend both on

the consumption value of the gift and its perceived generosity – represented by a parameter

  [0,1] .5 Throughout, we assume that   1 for a gift provided unconditionally and that  is


5
  That is, if the gift is provided conditionally – i.e., linked to some minimum contribution level – rather than
unconditionally, the perceived generosity is reduced. Intuitively, this assumption captures the hidden costs of
control noted in the earlier literature (Falk and Kosfeld, 2006; Sliwka, 2007).

                                                                                                              5
reduced if the gift is conditional on specific requirements.

         Assuming that utility is additively separable in these different components, agent i ’s

utility facing a budget constraint yi  bi  wi and receiving a gift g with conditionality factor

 is defined as:

                             Ui (bi , g ,  )  wi  bi  vi ( g )  hi (bi  Bi )  fi (bi )  ri (bi ,  g )

where B i   j  i b j . We assume that hi () , fi () , and ri  are each increasing and concave

in b. Finally, for a given donation size, we assume that marginal benefit from reciprocity is

                                       ri
decreasing in gift size – i.e.,             0 , while the marginal utility from giving is increasing in gift

        2 ri
size           0 . As solicitees in many naturally-occuring settings are able to refuse an offered
       b g

gift, we define an indicator variable as ai  1 if agent i “accepts” the gift and ai  0 if the agent

instead “refuses” the gift.6 For simplicity, we thus specify the donor’s utility function as,

                   ,   , ,                                                                               ,         (1)

i.e., we assume that rejecting and not receiving a gift are viewed by the donor as equivalent

outcomes.

         The agent maximizes (1) by choosing bi and, if possible, ai  {0,1} . The first order

condition for agent i's utility maximization problem is given by:

                                    U i                                                   r
                                         (bi , ai , g ,  )  1  hi '( B )  f i '(bi )  i (bi , ai  g )  0      (2)
                                     bi                                                   b



6
  Note that this assumption is different from much of the literature on gift-exchange and may not hold for mail
solicitations where donors would incur added costs to return the gift to the charity. We assume that if a donor
rejects a gift, he receives the same utility as in a VCM setting. One could imagine that the act of offering a gift itself
might lead to reciprocal behavior by a potential donor. Our predictions of the model therefore give a conservative
estimate of the effect of gifts on donation decisions.

                                                                                                                         6
and holds with equality if bi  0 . This leads to an optimal contribution level denoted by

bi opt ( a, g ,  ) .   Importantly, condition (2) implicitly shows the extent to which the agent

reciprocates gifts:

                                                                        2 ri                  2 ri
                           bi   opt
                                       (1, g ,  ) /  (  g )                (bi ,  g ) / 2 (bi ,  g )  0   (3)
                                                                     b (  g )              b

Intuitively, the effect of (accepted) gifts on contribution levels is increasing in the perceived

generosity of the gift,  .

Contribution Levels and Unconditional Gift Exchange

           We can now apply these preliminaries to examine how the way in which a charity elects

to implement gift exchange influences donor behavior.                                 From condition (3), we have that

contributions are increasing in the size of an accepted gift for any agent with reciprocal

preferences. Yet it need not be the case that all agents have reciprocal preferences and/or accept

available gifts. However, in such instances, contribution decisions coincide with the voluntary

contributions mechanism (VCM). We can summarize these results as follows:

           Proposition 1. Provided at least some subset of agents has reciprocal preferences, the
           introduction of an unconditional gift unambiguously increases both the number of agents
           who contribute and average contribution levels.

Intuitively, provided agents can refuse an unconditional gift (UG), they cannot be made worse

off than if the charity were to simply ask for a voluntary contribution. However, individuals with

reciprocal preferences that accept an unconditional gift increase contributions relative to this

baseline case. Thus, we would expect both higher participation rates and average contributions

when a charity offers perspective donors an unconditional gift.

           Before proceeding it is worth noting that Proposition 1 is at odds with the pure altruism

model. Under this model, the sole impetus for donations is a concern for the well-being of others

                                                                                                                    7
and aggregate public good provision. Hence, ulterior motives – i.e., reciprocity – should have no

impact on donor behavior. As the receipt of unconditional gifts is delinked from contribution

decisions, the pure altruism model would thus predict that unconditional gifts have no impact

along either the intensive or extensive margins.

Contribution Levels and Conditional Gift Exchange

        We distinguish between two different versions of conditional gifts (CG). In the first (or

weak) version of conditionality, the gift is granted if the agent contributes any positive amount.

The second version imposes a stronger constraint on the agent – the gift is only granted should

they contribute more than a specified minimum amount, i.e. bi  b min  0 . In our model we

assume that introducing stricter conditionality reduces the perceived generosity of the gift and

thereby lowers  . That is we assume that  CG   UG , where  CG is decreasing in the required

threshold b min . Hence, in the limit as μ→0, both participation rates and average contribution

levels will converge towards those observed in an equivalent VCM.7

        Unfortunately, the effect of changing the required minimum donation level is less clear.

While an increase in b min serves to crowd reciprocity and therefore lowers the contributions of

agents for whom bi opt (1, g ,  CG )  b min ,     it may also serve to crowd in contributions via a

consumption effect. That is, agents who contribute exactly the minimum level b min may increase

their contributions so that they remain eligible to receive the gift. Importantly, however, all such

agents will contribute b min to “purchase” the conditional gift and we would thus expect to

observe pooling at the required threshold.




7
 Of course, if one were to allow negative values for μ than it would be possible to observe lower participation rates
and average contributions than in a VCM.

                                                                                                                   8
         Provided that demand for the gift is well-behaved, the number of agents that are willing

to “purchase” the gift should be strictly decreasing in the threshold contribution level, b min . As

such, we would expect participation rates to be strictly decreasing in this threshold level. Hence,

as the required b min grows sufficiently large, the relative importance of the consumption effect

dwindles and donations will converge to those that would be elicited via a VCM. This suggests a

second proposition:

         Proposition 2. For agents with reciprocal preferences, imposing conditionality- i.e.,
         requiring that b  b min  0 in order to receive a gift – leads to a decrease in average
         contributions. However, conditionality may “crowd-in” donors through a consumption
         effect and thus has an ambiguous effect on participation rates. Further increases in b min
         serve to crowd out donors but has an ambiguous effect on average contribution levels.


Proposition 2 highlights that the overall effect of changing b min depends on the trade-off between

two effects – the crowding of reciprocity and increased contributions by those who pool at b min

to “purchase” the gift.8

Net contributions to the charity

         Since the provision of gifts is costly to the charity, the use of conditional gifts may prove

a profit maximizing strategy for a charity in both the short- and long-runs. In the short-run,

conditional gifts provide a way for the charity to screen donors and avoid entering into a gift-

relationship with types for whom such a strategy is a net loser. In particular, the charity will

want to avoid entering into a gift-exchange relationship with any agent for whom                              1    0

as such agents increase their contributions by less than the cost of the gift. Hence, providing




8
 Note that the latter effect is zero when moving from an unconditional gift to conditionality given by             0.
The net effect on contributions of introducing conditionality without a positive minimum contribution is therefore
predicted to be negative.

                                                                                                                   9
such types an unconditional gift guarantees net losses for the charity that could be reduced by

introducing conditionality to the gift-exchange relationship.

       Further, by manipulating b min the charity can increase contributions from any agent for

whom the consumption effect applies – i.e., those who contribute exactly b min in order to

“purchase” the gift. However, there is a cost of conditionality – increasing b min crowds out

participation and contributions from reciprocal types for whom bi opt (1, g ,  CG )  b min . Which of

these effects dominates in the short-run is ex ante unknown and will depend upon the realization

of key model parameters.

       In the long-run, the relative superiority of a particular form of gift exchange depends

crucially on the persistence of reciprocity and the proportion of reciprocal types in the

population. As noted above, unconditional gifts maximize the number of donors. As previous

givers are more likely to contribute and provide larger average gifts than other donor types

(Landry et al., 2010), it is thus plausible to intuit conditions under which unconditional gifts

prove a superior fund-raising strategy in the long-run.

       Yet, such conditions require that feelings of reciprocity, as triggered by the receipt of a

gift in a prior fund-raising campaign, persist and influence behavior in subsequent fund-raising

efforts. If not, our model predicts that those initially attracted via conditional gifts should be

more likely to give and provide larger average donations. As conditionally serves to crowd

reciprocity, reciprocal agents who contributed any given amount in a conditional gift treatment

implicitly revealed a higher value for the public good than a counterpart contributing this same

amount in an unconditional gift treatment. If feelings of reciprocity are fleeting, we would

therefore expect donors initially attracted via conditional gifts to be weakly more loyal to the

charity than counterparts who initially received the same gift unconditionally.


                                                                                                    10
         That such possibility exists highlights a heretofore “hidden benefit” of control that arises

as conditionality provides an effective technology for screening donors. Yet, such benefits are

“hidden” in the sense that they would escape one’s attention if reasoning were based upon the

standard approach of using a static model and assuming that all donors are reciprocal. In such

models, there is no benefit to screening donors and conditionality can only have negative

impacts. However, as our model highlights, there are many reasons why a profit maximizing

charity could benefit from screening donors.

III. Experiment I – Design and Results

         To examine the main conjectures of our theory, we designed a door-to-door fund-raising

natural field experiment. The experimental treatments are guided by our theory, and are meant

to provide a test of its predictions. We make use of seven different treatments, composed of a

VCM baseline and gift variants that include small and large gifts provided both conditionally and

unconditionally.

A. Experimental Treatments

         In each of the seven treatments, households in predetermined neighborhood blocks in Pitt

County, North Carolina were approached by a paid solicitor and asked if they would like to make

a contribution to support the Center for Natural Hazards Research at East Carolina University.9

Households that answered the door were provided an informational brochure detailing the

activities of the Hazard Center since its inception in 2004 and read a fixed script that outlined the

reason for the solicitors’ visit. The script included a brief introduction that informed the resident


9
  The neighborhood blocks were selected to provide a representative sample of three distinct household types: (i)
households that contributed to the Hazards Center in a previous fund-raising effort, (ii) households that were visited
in previous fund-raising efforts but elected not to contribute, and (iii) households that did not speak to a solicitor in a
previous fund-raising drive. A companion paper (Landry et al., 2010) explores these variations in more detail. For
our purposes, we simply include controls for these different household types.

                                                                                                                       11
of who the solicitors were, the purpose of their visit, a two-sentence summary of the non-profit

organization, and when applicable a description of the gift (see the Appendix).

          Our first two variations from the baseline VCM treatment are unconditional small and

large gift treatments. For the small gift, we used an attractive bookmark with the Hazard Center

or East Carolina University logo. For the large gift, we used a copy of the New York Times

bestseller Freakonomics. In the small (large) unconditional gift treatment, we simply added the

following to the baseline script:

             As a token of our appreciation, we would like you to have this bookmark (copy of
             Freakonomics) as a gift to you. The bookmark (book) is yours to keep whether or
             not you make a donation.

These treatments permit a test of whether unconditional gifts enhance both the extensive and

intensive margins, and whether the magnitude of such effects are related to gift size.

          To operationalize exogenous changes in the perceived generosity of the gift we introduce

a conditionality variant to these gift treatments by inserting the following passage in the baseline

script:

             As a token of our appreciation, we will give you this bookmark (copy of
             Freakonomics) as a gift should you make a donation today.

This treatment eliminates the agent’s most opportune action—taking the gift and giving nothing.

As such, this manipulation should change the perceived generosity of the gift compared to the

unconditional case  CG   UG .

          Our final two treatments further restrict the action set by adding a price point to the

unconditional gift:

             As a token of our appreciation, we will give you this bookmark (copy of
             Freakonomics) as a gift should you make a donation of $1 ($25) today.



                                                                                                 12
Our price points were chosen to approximate the current retail price of the two goods. While

these two treatments serve to follow our theory, the chosen price in the small gift treatment

serves to present a particularly demanding test of theory. First, most donors likely will view any

“restrictions” on actions as illusory since every contribution in our previous fund-raising drive

for the Hazard Center (Landry et al., 2006) was $1 or more. Second, the psychology literature

teaches us that even solicitees who would like to contribute are largely unaware of the level of an

acceptable donation, and therefore might refrain from giving merely because they want to avoid

the social embarrassment of giving too little.10

        An extension of this second line of reasoning provides an important reason why these

treatments also present a particularly demanding test of our theory for the large gift treatment.

Literature in psychology provides some empirical evidence that mention of a target donation

amount serves to increase the response rate (see, e.g., Fraser et al., 1988; Briers et al., 2007). In

this spirit, simply providing a goal of $25 might serve to increase the number of donors.11

        Table 1 summarizes the design of experiment I. The experimental treatments were

conducted between April 21st and June 24th, 2006 with six sessions conducted between 9am and

5pm on Saturday and another five sessions conducted on Wednesday and Thursday evenings

between 5pm and 8pm.             Our design resulted in a sample size of 4283 total households

approached – 878 in the VCM, 768 in the unconditional small gift (USG), 610 in the

unconditional large gift (ULG), 634 in the no price point conditional small gift (CSG-NPP), 380

in the price point conditional small gift (CSG-PP), 481 in the no price point conditional large gift



10
   While outside of our theory, this intuition has some empirical support. For instance, Cialdini and Schroeder
(1976) found that in a door-to-door charity drive including the quip “even a penny will help” considerably increased
the number of donations without adversely affecting the average contribution.
11
   For further information about the actual exchange of information, we direct the reader to the Appendix, which
contains a copy of the informational brochure and script.

                                                                                                                 13
(CLG-NPP), and 532 in the price point conditional large gift (CLG-PP) treatment. Of the

households approached, 1381 answered the door and spoke to a solicitor.

B. Recruiting and Training of Solicitors

         As Table 1 reveals, we employed a within-solicitor design using a total of thirty-six

unique solicitors. Of the thirty-six total solicitors, nineteen participated in the VCM treatment,

nineteen participated in the unconditional small gift treatment, twenty-two participated in the

conditional small gift treatment, thirteen participated in the unconditional large gift treatment,

and seventeen participated in conditional large gift treatment.12                   To control for possible order

effects, solicitors were randomly assigned to treatments, and we were careful to run multiple

treatments on every day of the experiment.

         Each solicitor’s experience typically followed four steps: (1) consideration of an

invitation to work as a paid employee of the Center, (2) an in-person interview, (3) a training

session, and (4) participation as a solicitor in the campaign.13 Undergraduate solicitors were

recruited from the student body at ECU via flyers posted around campus, announcements on a

university electronic bulletin board, advertisements in the local campus newspaper, and direct

appeal to students during undergraduate economics courses. All potential solicitors were told

that they would be paid $10 per hour during training and employment and would be expected to

work multiple days. Interested solicitors were instructed to contact the Economics Department

to schedule an interview.

         Before proceeding to the results section, we should highlight a few important design

issues. First, every applicant was offered employment as a solicitor after completing an in-


12
   Six of the solicitors only participated in a single treatment. Of the remaining thirty solicitors, sixteen participated
in two different treatments and fourteen participated in three or more different treatments. No single solicitor
participated in all seven treatments.
13
   See Landry et al. (2006) for further details on recruitment; we followed their study in this regard.

                                                                                                                      14
person interview. Second, the training sessions were conducted by the same researcher and

provided the solicitor with background information on the Hazard Center and a review of the

solicitation script and data collection procedures. Third, each solicitor wore an identification

badge that included his or her picture, name, and city solicitation permit number. Fourth, we

randomly allocated solicitors across neighborhoods and treatment type, and solicitors remained

in the same treatment throughout each given day.           Finally, after every interaction with a

household, each solicitor filled out data collection forms that included the amount donated along

with demographic data such as the estimated age, gender, and race of the potential contributor.

C. Experimental Findings

       Table 2 summarizes donor behavior, as well as solicitor and household characteristics

across treatment. For example, our solicitors approached 878 households in the VCM treatment

and elicited contributions from 21.3 percent (61 out of 286) of those who answered the door.

The average donation amount was $1.90 per solicitation; therefore, we raised $541.35 in the

VCM treatment. In total we raised approximately $3333 (~$2.40 per solicitation) for the Hazard

Center. Further scrutiny of the data leads to our first set of results on unconditional gifts:

       Result 1a: Unconditional large gifts enhance both the extensive and intensive
       margins.

       Result 1b: The size of the unconditional gift importantly influences donor behavior.

These first two results are consonant with our theoretical model and share similarity with the

findings reported in Falk (2007), who explored the importance of gift exchange in a mail

solicitation fund-raiser. Moreover, these results call into question “pure” altruism as a driver of

donor behavior. Under the “pure altruism” model, ulterior motives – i.e., reciprocity – should

have no impact on donor behavior as the receipt of unconditional gifts is delinked from the

contribution decision.

                                                                                                  15
         Casual evidence for these two results is contained in Table 2. First, we find that in the

raw data, neither the propensity to contribute (22% vs. 21.3%) nor the average contributions

($1.73 vs. $1.90) are significantly different across the unconditional small gift treatment and the

baseline VCM treatment.             Yet, we find that both figures are considerably larger in the

unconditional large gift treatment: nearly twice as many solicitees contribute (36.8% vs. 21.3%),

and give more than twice as much on average ($4.48 vs. $1.90). Both of these results are

statistically significant at conventional levels (p < .05) using both a parametric matched pairs t-

test and a non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test. 14

         To complement these unconditional insights, we estimate a series of linear regression

models that explicitly control for observable and unobservable differences across solicitors. This

analysis is important because such factors might systematically differ across treatment, leading

to erroneous inference from a simple analysis of the raw data. Specifically, we estimate a linear

regression model of the amount contributed for each household that answered the door

(including zero contributions) on dummy variables for our experimental treatments and other

covariates:

                                      Lij  Z ij   X ij    ij ,                                              (4)

where Lij is the contribution level of the jth household to the ith solicitor, Z is a vector of treatment

group status indicators, and X is a vector of other covariates – including observable

characteristics of potential donors. To account for unobservable heterogeneities at the solicitor

level, we include solicitor fixed effects.15


14
   The unit of observation in each of these tests is solicitor specific averages for a particular treatment. The test
statistic is thus based on the distribution of the difference in these solicitor specific averages between the
unconditional large (small) gift treatment and the baseline VCM. Using such matched pairs tests controls for
potential solicitor specific dependencies across treatments.
15
   Qualitative insights are similar if we use a Tobit specification or if we estimate equations (4) and (5) with a
standard two-stage selection equation with the yes-no contribution decision modeled in the first stage and the dollars

                                                                                                                  16
        Empirical estimates presented in Model A of Table 3 provide insights consistent with the

unconditional results: households contributed approximately $2.66 more in the unconditional

large gift treatment than in the baseline VCM treatment, with this difference statistically

significant at the p < 0.05 level. Further insights garnered from Table 3 suggest that donors

respond to the perceived value of a gift as predicted by our theoretical model. On average,

households contributed approximately $2.60 more when receiving a copy of Freakonomics

rather than a bookmark, with this difference significant at the p < 0.05 level. Empirical results

are qualitatively consistent across richer models that account for more of the variation in the data

(see Models B and C in Table 3).

        To gain insights into the factors that influence the decision of households to contribute to

the Hazard Center, we estimate a linear probability model of the contribution decision of

households that answered the door:

                                   C ij  Z ij   X ij   eij ,                                         (5)

where Cij equals unity if solicitor i received a contribution for household j, and equals zero

otherwise. We again include solicitor fixed effects and three model types, which all paint a

similar picture.

        Empirical estimates are presented in Model A of Table 4, and again indicate that gifts, as

well as their size, matters. For example, we find that households were more likely to contribute

when approached by a solicitor in one of our gift treatments: households are approximately 23

percent (10 percent) more likely to contribute in the unconditional large (small) gift treatment.

Interestingly, both of these estimates are significantly different from zero, suggesting that the

small gift has some import on the extensive margin. Yet, the approximate 13 percent difference


contributed in the second. Also, all reported empirical results are robust to models that augment X to include
additional household controls such as donor age and previous contributions to the Hazards Center.

                                                                                                           17
in contribution rates across the unconditional large and small gift treatments is significant at the

p < 0.05 level.

       Turning to the effects of our conditional gift treatments, we report a second set of results:


       Result 2a: Providing donors with a conditional, rather than an unconditional, gift
       decreases participation rates and average donations per contact.

       Result 2b: Both rates of giving and average donations per contact are lower when we
       increase control and require a $25 donation to obtain the large gift.

       Result 2c: Conditionality induces an increased propensity for donors to pool at the
       minimum donation level required to receive the gift.

Evidence for Results 2a and 2b can be found in Tables 2-4. For example, summary results in

Table 2 show that both average contributions per contact and participation rates are reduced

when we move from the unconditional large gift treatment to a conditional large gift treatment.

Participation rates (average contributions) in our no price point treatment are approximately 4.6

percent ($2.20) lower than those observed when donors are provided the large gift

unconditionally. Interestingly, we observe no such crowding out in our small gift treatments,

perhaps suggesting that the bookmark is unable to generate feelings of reciprocity.

       To complement these insights, we return to the empirical estimates in Tables 3 and 4

which control for unobserved heterogeneity across solicitors in a fixed effects regression model.

Model A of Table 3 shows that average donations per contact are approximately $1.64 ($2.06)

lower in the conditional no price point (conditional price point) large gift treatment than in the

analogous unconditional large gift treatment, with both of these differences significant at the p <

0.05 level. This former difference is consonant with Proposition 2 which predicts a net reduction

in average contributions when moving from an unconditional gift treatment to a conditional gift

treatment requiring a minimum donation of b > bmin = 0 to receive the gift. Further, that we find

                                                                                                   18
an inverse relationship between bmin and average donations suggests that crowding dominates

consumption effects in our setting.

        Considering average participation rates, we observe that households are less likely to

contribute to the Hazard Center when offered a large gift conditionally. As noted in Model A of

Table 4, a household is approximately 2 percent (18 percent) less likely to contribute when

receiving the large gift, conditioned upon making a donation of any amount ($25) to the Hazard

Center. While this former difference is not significant at any meaningful level, the difference in

participation rates between the CLG price point treatment and both the ULG and CLG no price

point treatments is statistically significant at the p < 0.05 level. Empirical results for the small

gift treatment highlight that the extensive margin is considerably enhanced by providing social

cover for low donations. This result accords with Cialdini and Schroeder (1976) and the broad

literature, mostly in psychology and marketing, that has followed (for a review see, e.g.,

Brockner et. al., 1984; Fraser et al., 1998).

        Evidence for Result 2c can be found in Figures 1 and 2, which show histograms of

donations in our VCM and three small (large) gift treatments. As illustrated in Figure 1, there is

an increased propensity for agents to pool at the $1.00 contribution level in our price point

treatment. While approximately 2.04 percent of all households approached contribute $1.00 in

our unconditional small gift treatment, the percentage of households approached that contribute

this amount in the corresponding price point treatment increases to approximately 13 percent.

Using a two-sample test of proportions, the more than six-fold increase is statistically significant

at the p < 0.01 level.

        We observe similar data patterns in our large gift treatments. As illustrated in Figure 2,

the percentage of households approached that contribute $1.00 ($25.00) in our no price point



                                                                                                 19
(price point) treatments is greater than the corresponding percentage of households contributing

these amounts in the analogous unconditional gift treatment. While approximately 1.9 percent

(2.4 percent) of all households contribute $1.00 ($25.00) in our unconditional large gift

treatment, the respective percentage in the equivalent no price point (price point) treatment is 4.9

percent (6.8 percent).    Using a two-sample test of proportions, we find that the former 3

percentage point difference is statistically significant at the p < 0.10 and that the latter 4.4

percentage point difference is significant at the p < 0.05 level.

          Our analysis has thus far concentrated on gross proceeds. From the perspective of a

charitable organization, it is clearly of interest to further examine net public good provision—

average contributions less the costs of purchasing the gifts. In this regard, we present a final

result:

          Result 3: In the short-run, the VCM and the gift treatments that eliminate the agent’s
          most opportunistic actions maximize public good provision.

Evidence for Result 3 is provided in the final panel of Table 2 – net public good provision per

household in our large gift treatments is monotonically increasing in the level of conditionality.

As noted in the table, gross proceeds in both our unconditional and no price point large gift

treatments were insufficient to cover the costs of purchasing the copies of Freakonomics. As

such, net revenues per contact in these treatments are significantly lower than the $1.90 ($1.75)

figure observed in our baseline VCM (price point large gift) treatment at the p < 0.05 level.

Furthermore, the approximate $1.41 difference in net revenues per contact across our ULG and

no price point treatments is statistically significant at the p < 0.10 level. Interestingly, we

observe no discernable difference in net revenues across our small gift treatments and the VCM,

again highlighting that the bookmark may not induce feelings of reciprocity.



                                                                                                 20
       Exploring this result a level deeper, approximately 37.2 percent of all non-donors in our

unconditional large gift treatment keep the copy of Freakonomics – generating losses in the

range of $1.13 per household contacted. Amongst the set of donors, approximately 69.2 percent

(45 out of 65) of those who kept the copy of Freakonomics provided gifts less than the $12.98

cost of obtaining the book. For no price point large gift treatment, approximately 81.1 percent

(30 out of 37) of all donors kept the book but provided donations less than this amount. Taken

jointly, these data suggest that there are a non-trivial number of types in the population for whom

entering into a gift-exchange relationship is a losing proposition. Hence, altering bmin to “screen”

such types proves a profit enhancing strategy for the Hazard Center.

IV. Experiment II – Design and Results

       Results from experiment I highlight that in the short-run, the charity is better off

providing gifts conditionally in order to screen insufficiently-reciprocal types for whom gift

exchange is a net loser. However, as conditional gifts serve to crowd out donors, it is not clear

whether conditionality is an optimal strategy in the long-run. As noted in Landry et al. (2010),

previous givers to the Hazard Center are approximately 19 percent more likely to contribute in

future campaigns and provide average gifts that are roughly twice as large as counterparts who

have never given.     Given that households in our unconditional large gift treatment were

approximately 74.4 percent more likely to give than counterparts approached in the

corresponding price point treatment, it is thus plausible to intuit conditions under which

unconditional gifts prove a superior fund-raising mechanism in the long-run.

       However, fundamental to any such story is the assumption that, once triggered, feelings

of reciprocity influence behavior in subsequent fund-raising efforts. Yet, whether and the extent

to which feelings of reciprocity are sustained across campaigns is ex ante unknown. As such,


                                                                                                 21
data from experiment I provides little insight regarding long-run dynamics and the relative

superiority of conditional versus unconditional gifts. To better ascertain long-run impacts, we

return to the field and implement a second door-to-door fund-raising experiment during.

A. Experimental Design

       In designing the second field experiment, we made use of detailed information on

whether and how households were previously approached.              Households in predetermined

neighborhood blocks in Pitt County, North Carolina were approached by a paid solicitor and

asked if they would like to make a contribution to support the Hazard Center using a simple ask

strategy (or voluntary contribution mechanism). The neighborhood blocks were selected to

provide a representative sample of two distinct household types: (i) households that have never

contributed to the Hazard Center (cold-list households), and (ii) households that were

approached and contributed to the Hazard Center (warm-list households) in experiment I. As

small gifts (the bookmarks) had no discernable impact on outcomes in experiment I, we restrict

the sample of warm-list households to those who were previous approached in either the VCM or

one of the three large-gift treatments.

       As in experiment I, households that answered the door were provided an informational

brochure detailing the activities of the Hazard Center and read a fixed script that outlined the

reason for the solicitor’s visit. The script included a brief introduction that informed the resident

of the purpose of their visit and noted that all proceeds raised in the fundraising campaign would

be used to fund research that benefits Pitt County and the surrounding area.

       Table 5 summarizes the design for experiment II. Fund-raising efforts were initiated on

September 12th, 2009 and continued through the 16th of that month. We employed a total of

fifty-five solicitors who worked three hour shifts starting between 9 to 10am on Saturday



                                                                                                  22
morning, 1 to 2pm on both Saturday and Sunday afternoon, and at 5pm on both Tuesday and

Wednesday evenings.16           Our design resulted in a sample size of 2772 total households

approached. Of the households approached, 1074 answered the door and spoke with a solicitor –

833 who did not speak to a solicitor in experiment I, 62 drawn from the VCM treatment in

experiment I, 65 drawn from the Unconditional Large Gift treatment in experiment I, and 114

drawn from a Conditional Large Gift treatment in experiment I.17 The solicitation approach

mirrors the design of experiment I.

B. Experimental Findings

        Table 6 presents summary statistics including information on the success of solicitors

across different household types. For example, as noted in the table, solicitors spoke with 62

households who were approached in the VCM treatment in experiment I.                                   Of these,

approximately 22.6 percent (or 14 of 62) contributed to the Hazard Center.                          In total, our

solicitors raised $1914.72 (or approximately $1.78 per solicitation) for the Hazard Center:

$1532.72 (or $1.84 per solicitation) from households not solicited in experiment I, $103 (or

$1.66 per solicitation) from households previously solicited using a VCM, $69 (or $1.06 per

solicitation) from households previously solicited in the unconditional large gift treatments, and

$210 (or $1.84 per solicitation) from households previously solicited in a conditional large gift

treatment.18

The Dynamics of Unconditional Gifts




16
   The recruiting and training of solicitors followed the same procedures as those used in experiment I.
17
   In analyzing the data from experiment II, we pool HH’s initially approached in the no price point and price point
large gift treatments as participation rates and average contribution levels are indistinguishable across these two
groups.
18
   The set of previously approached households includes both prior contributors to the Hazard Center and those who
elected not to give in the prior fund-raising effort.

                                                                                                                 23
        Table 6 summarizes donor behavior, as well as household characteristics across different

household types. As noted in the table, our solicitors elicited contributions from 14.3 percent (4

of 28) of warm-list households initially attracted via an unconditional large gift. In contrast,

solicitors approaching a warm-list household initially attracted via a conditional large gift were

approximately 151 percent more likely to elicit a contribution. Importantly, this difference is

significant at the p < 0.05 level using a two sample test of proportions. We observe similar,

albeit less pronounced, differences when comparing participation rates against those initially

attracted via a simply ask for money (VCM).

        Exploring average contributions, we observe similar differences across the same

household types. The $1.29 average contribution from households initially attracted via an

unconditional gift is approximately 63 percent (29.5 percent) lower than that elicited from

counterparts initially attracted by a conditional large gift (VCM). While the latter difference is

not significant at meaningful levels, the former is significant at the p < 0.05 level using either a

parametric t-test or non-parametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Taken jointly, these data suggest a

fourth result:

        Result 4: Donors initially attracted via unconditional gifts are less loyal to the cause
        than counterparts attracted by conditional gifts or a VCM.


Importantly, Result 4 suggests that feelings of reciprocity – triggered by the receipt of an

unconditional gift – are short-lived and have little impact on subsequent behavior. Hence, while

data from experiment I suggest the importance of gift exchange, results from experiment II

highlight that the effects of gift exchange are contemporaneous and reciprocity is limited to the

immediate source of kindness.




                                                                                                   24
        To complement these unconditional insights, we estimate a series of linear regression

models that explicitly control for observable differences across households and unobservable

differences across solicitors. In this spirit, we estimate linear regression models of the amount

contributed for each household that answered the door (including zero contributions) on dummy

variables for our experimental treatments and other covariates:

                                      Lij  Z ij   X ij    ij ,                                                (6)

where Lij is the contribution level of the jth household to the ith solicitor, Z is a vector of treatment

group status indicators, and X is a vector of other covariates – including observable

characteristics of potential donors. To account for unobservable heterogeneities at the solicitor

level, we include solicitor fixed effects.

        Empirical estimates presented in Model A of Table 7 provide insights consistent with the

raw data summary: donors initially attracted by an unconditional gift contribute approximately

$2.28 less than counterparts initially attracted by a conditional gift – a difference that is

statistically significant at the p < 0.05 level. Further insights garnered from Table 7 highlight

that there is no discernable difference in the contributions of households initially attracted via an

unconditional gift and those who originally gave in a VCM.19 Empirical results are qualitatively

consistent models B and C which include additional household level controls.

        To gain insights into the factors that influence the decision of households to contribute to

the Hazard Center, we estimate a linear probability model of the contribution decision of

households that answered the door:

                                     C ij  Z ij   X ij   eij ,                                                 (7)




19
  Interestingly, our data suggest that the manner in which cold-list households – i.e., those who were approached
but did not give in experiment I – were initially approached has no impact on future contribution levels.

                                                                                                                    25
where Cij equals unity if solicitor i received a contribution for household j, and equals zero

otherwise. We again include solicitor fixed effects and three model types, which all paint a

similar picture.

         For example, empirical estimates in Model A of Table 8 suggest that households initially

attracted via an unconditional gift are approximately 79.5 percent less likely to contribute than

counterparts initially attracted via a conditional large gift – a difference that is significant at the p

< 0.05 level. Similarly, such households are approximately 55.5 percent less likely to contribute

than counterparts initially attracted via a VCM – a difference that is significant at the p < 0.10

level. Estimates for Models B and C provide similar insights and highlight that observable

characteristics such as the race, gender and the age of potential donors influence participation

rates.

         Viewed in conjunction with results from experiment I, our data therefore suggest that

unconditional gifts are a bad investment for the Hazard Center. In the short-run, the use of such

gifts enhances participation rates and gross proceeds per contact.            However, the increased

participation rates and average gifts come at a cost – approximately 23.4 percent of all

households approached keep the gift but do not contribute to the Hazard Center. In the long-run,

donors attracted to the Hazard Center using unconditional gifts are less likely to contribute and

provide lower average donations than counterparts attracted by other means. Hence, the Hazard

Center is unable to recover the short-run losses associated with the use of unconditional gifts and

would have been better off relying upon other fund-raising strategies – i.e., simple asks for

money or the provision of conditional gifts.

The Dynamics of Conditional Gifts and Net Charitable Revenue




                                                                                                      26
        Having explored the dynamics of unconditional gifts, we now examine the relative long-

run impact of conditional gifts vis-à-vis a simple ask strategy. Results from experiment I

highlight that in the short-run, there is no discernable difference across these treatments. Hence,

the charity is indifferent between the use of simple asks for money and providing donors a

conditional gift. Yet, as donors in the conditional gift treatment provide average contributions

that are approximately 30 percent greater than counterparts initially approached in a VCM, it

would be intuitive to posit that conditional gifts will have a greater impact on subsequent fund-

raising efforts.

        Data from experiment II allow us to explore this conjecture and suggest a fifth result:

        Result 5: Donors initially attracted via a conditional gift are more loyal to the cause
        than counterparts attracted via a VCM.


To provide evidence for this result, consider the raw data summary in Table 6. Warm-list

households attracted through a conditional gift treatment are approximately 25.5 percent more

likely to give (35.9 versus 28.6 percent) than counterparts initially approached in a VCM and

provide average gifts that are approximately 90.7 percent greater ($3.49 versus $1.83) than such

types – differences that are significant at the p < 0.10 and p < 0.05 levels respectively.

        Additional support for Result 5 is contained in Tables 7 and 8 which condition

participation rates and contribution levels on observable household characteristics and

unobservable solicitor specific effects. For example, as noted in Model A of Table 7, households

initially attracted via a conditional gift provide average gifts that are approximately $2.28 (or

186.9 percent) greater than counterparts initially attracted via a VCM – a difference that is

significant at the p < 0.05 level. Model A in Table 8, highlights similar differences in regards to

participation rates: donors initially attracted via a conditional gift are approximately 116.7



                                                                                                  27
percent more likely to contribute than a counterpart who originally gave in a VCM. Estimates

from Models B and C of these tables provide qualitatively similar insights and highlight the

robustness of this result to the inclusion of additional household level controls.

       Combined with results from experiment I, our data therefore suggest that conditional gift

exchange provides a superior fund-raising mechanism. For academics, this result calls into

question results from the laboratory suggesting that the use of explicit incentives – such as

conditional rewards and punishment – entail considerable “hidden” costs (see, e.g., Fehr and

Rockenbach, 2003; Fehr and List, 2004; Falk and Kosfeld, 2006). Although we cannot rule out

that some individuals respond adversely to conditional gifts, ‘control’ as defined in the literature

provides a means for the Hazard Center to enhance the profitability of its fund-raising efforts. In

this regard, our data highlight a “hidden benefit” of control in that such mechanisms provide a

way to screen donors – an effect that would escape our attention if reasoning had we followed

the standard approach in the literature of using a static model and experimental design that

measures short-run substitution effects. For practitioners, this result highlights the benefits of

using mechanisms such as conditional gifts that serve to screen insufficiently-reciprocal types

and those with “low” intrinsic value for the charity.

V. Conclusions

       A cornerstone of the recent ascension of behavioral economics is the study of the

interaction of psychological and economic incentives. This study takes this line of work to the

field by making use of a series of field treatments that parallel some of the important economic

features of the environments explored in the literature. Our approach uses an actual capital

campaign that raised thousands of dollars for the Center for Natural Hazards Research at East




                                                                                                 28
Carolina University.      Importantly, we use natural incentives to change exogenously the

solicitees’ action space to test for hidden benefits or costs of control.

       Our results can be broken down into three main categories. First, we report results that

highlight why people give to charity and why they remain committed the cause. In this manner,

we find that the pure altruism model can be rejected, and that fundraising practitioners can

effectively use gifts to enhance fundraising success. Second, there are hidden benefits of control:

fundraising success is enhanced when the most opportunistic donor choices are restricted. This

occurs not only because of short run benefits, but also because conditionality can be used as a

screen of donor type. Finally, we find considerable evidence of the efficacy of gift exchange in

the field but note that the effects of gift exchange are purely contemporaneous. This suggests

that the static experimental designs that are meant to measure the effects of gift exchange

provide a good approximation to the total effects.

one of the VCM treatment employed six solicitors that approached a total of 168 houses, of which 69 answered the door. All conditional gift treatments run
during the month of June required a minimum donation of $1 ($25) to obtain a bookmark (copy of Freakonomics).

Note: Cell entries provide parameter estimates for a fixed effects linear regression model of contribution levels
(including the zeroes) for our experiment. Cell entries can be read as follows – average contribution levels in the
ULG treatment (column 1, row 4) are approximately $2.66 greater than those for our baseline VCM treatment.

Note: Cell entries provide parameter estimates for an fixed effects model estimating the dichotomous decision of
whether or not a household made a contribution to the Hazard Center. Cell entries can be read as follows – agents in
the ULG treatment (column 1, row 4) are 23 percent more likely on average to contribute to the Hazard Center than
in the VCM.
