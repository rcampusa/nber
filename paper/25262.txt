                                          ABSTRACT

We exploit state variation in licensing laws to study the effect of licensing on occupational choice
using a boundary discontinuity design. We find that licensing reduces equilibrium labor supply
by an average of 17%-27%. The negative labor supply effects of licensing appear to be strongest
for white workers and comparatively weaker for black workers.

1         Introduction

An occupational license is a state issued credential that a worker must possess to legally work
for pay (Friedman, 1962). In the past six decades, the instance of occupational licensing in
the United States has increased from a coverage of around 5% of the U.S. labor force, to
a present-day coverage of close to 25% of the U.S. labor force. Similarly, in the European
Union, 22% of workers report having an occupational license (Koumenta and Pagliero, 2018).
        The primary focus of the literature on occupational licensing is estimating the licensing
premium (Kleiner and Krueger, 2013; Koumenta et al., 2014; Gittleman et al., 2015; Thornton
and Timmons, 2013).1 The literature on the employment effects of occupational licensing is
by comparison more nascent but no less important. Kleiner and Soltas (2018) show that the
employment effect of licensing is a sufficient statistic for the welfare consequences of licensing.
This finding makes studying the employment effects of licensing an important matter for
public policy. Law and Marks (2009) use data from the introduction of licensing in a select
group of industries during the period 1870-1960 to show that there are no negative labor
supply effects of licensing for women and minorities. By contrast, Hall et al. (2018) show that
female participation on the Uber platform increases after deregulation, which suggests that
licensing has a negative effect on female labor supply in the ride sharing industry. Likewise,
Kleiner and Park (2010) show that reducing the prescribing ability of nurses reduces hours
worked by 3%.
        We make several contributions to the literature on the employment effects of occupational
licensing. First, we update the evidence on the equilibrium labor supply effects of licensing,
building on the work of Law and Marks (2009). In this respect our paper is more similar
to Kleiner and Soltas (2018), who use 2016 data to estimate the labor supply effect of
licensing. Second, we use quasi-experimental variation to estimate the employment effects
    1
    Most estimates place the wage premium from a 6%-15%, with the lower end of the spectrum representing
the most contemporary estimates, for which the data quality and coverage is improved. In a prior work,
we also show that there is substantial heterogeneity in the licensing premium by race and gender, which
occupational licenses functioning as a labor market signal for women and minorities (Blair and Chung, 2018).



                                                     2
of licensing, following similar approaches used to estimate the wage impacts of occupational
licensing (Pizzola and Tabarrok, 2017; Hall et al., 2018). Third, we explore heterogeneity
in the response to licensing by gender and race. Fourth, we explore heterogeneity in the
equilibrium labor supply by the attributes of the license. Many licenses require workers to
pass an exam, undergo training, pursue continuing education. Some licensed occupations
also preclude ex-offenders from obtaining a license (Blair and Chung, 2018). Federman et
al. (2006) shows that additional licensing requirements, in the case of manicurist, reduces
labor supply, whereas Pagliero (2010) shows that requirements like exams are correlated with
increased wages for workers.
   In our paper we use a new data set that we created in prior work on the licensing
regulations affecting ex-offenders and merge this with data from the 2015-2017 Current
Population Survey (CPS) and the 2008 Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP)
to estimate a model of occupational choice (Train et al., 1987). In our model, occupational
selection is driven by wages, whether the occupation is licensed, a measure of the occupation’s
desirability (that is constant across all workers), and idiosyncratic workers’ tastes for the
occupation. We embed a boundary discontinuity design in our empirical model to compare
employment in occupations across state boundary pairs where the occupation is licensed on
one side of the boundary but unlicensed on the other side of the boundary. This design
is motivated by the work of Black (1999) who developed this research design to estimate
households’ willingness to pay for quality schooling. We follow Bayer et al. (2007) by
embedding this boundary discontinuity design in a discrete choice framework.
   Our results suggest that the presence of occupational licensing reduces labor supply by an
average of 17%-27%. From our boundary discontinuity estimates, we find that the magnitude
of the labor supply effect of licensing increases by 2/3 relative to OLS estimates. Moreover,
we find that the negative labor supply effects of occupational licensing are particularly large
for white workers and comparatively smaller for black workers. Our estimates are similar to
the employment effects reported in Kleiner (2006), where it is shown that partially licensed


                                              3
occupations grow at a rate of 20% less than unlicensed occupations. Our estimates are
also in line with the estimates in Johnson and Kleiner (2015), who find that state-specific
licensing laws reduce inter-state mobility of workers by 36%, whereas national licensing has
no negative effect on inter-state mobility of workers.
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. First, we describe the discrete choice model
and embedded boundary discontinuity design which we used to estimate the effect of licensing
on labor supply. Second, we describe the data used to estimate the model. Following this we
present and discuss our results. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of how these results
on the employment effects of licensing tie in with what we know about the wage effects of
licensing from prior work.



2     Empirical Specification

2.1    Base Model

Our empirical model follows the random utility model which is a standard empirical method
in discrete choice settings (McFadden, 1973; Train et al., 1987; Berry et al., 1995; Bayer et
al., 2007). In the base case we model the indirect utility of person i in state s working in
occupation o to be a function of wages ωos , an indicator for whether the state has a licensing
requirement in that occupation Los , and an occupational fixed effect ξo which captures the
desirability of the occupation, and a state-fixed effect λs . Workers choose an occupation to
maximize their expected utility, which is given by:


                             Uiso = θlog(ωos ) + βLos + ξo + λs + ios .                   (1)


We further assume that each worker has unobserved tastes, ios , that are independently and
identically distributed and follow a type 1 extreme value distribution. On the strength of
this assumption on the distribution of unobserved tastes, we obtain a closed-form solution


                                                 4
for the market shares for each occupation (mos ) as a function of the observed characteristics
of the occupation and the parameters of the model. In the market share equation below, qos
is the number of workers in state s who choose occupation o and qs is the total number of
workers the state:
                                            qos  exp(θlog(ωos ) + βLos + ξo )
                                 mos =          =P                                .                    (2)
                                            qs     o0 exp(θωo0 s + βLo0 s + ξo0 )

The key parameter of interest is β, which is a measure of the effect of a licensing requirement
on the equilibrium market share of an occupation. At this point we are not making any
distinctions based on race and gender in constructing the market shares. We will construct
race-by-gender market shares later to explore whether there are differential effects of licensing
on equilibrium labor supply. To estimate β, we compute the market share mo∗ s for a reference
occupation o∗ and take the ratio of the market share of occupation o to the market share of
the reference occupation o∗ . This strategy has the flavor of a first difference procedure, since
taking the ratio gets rid of the common denominator in the expression for the market shares
of both occupations o and o∗ . We then take the log of this ratio to arrive at our estimating
equation:
                                                               
                                mos                      ωos
                      log                   = θlog                    + β(Los − Lo∗ s ) + ξo − ξo∗ .   (3)
                                mo∗ s                    ωo ∗ s

       Moreover, by taking the log of the ratio of market shares we arrive at an interpretation
of the parameter of interest in terms of its effect on the observed equilibrium labor supply –
notably – imposing a licensing requirement on an occupation reduces its relative equilibrium
market share by 100 x β percent.2 Importantly, β is also the marginal utility to workers of
an occupation being licensed. It is a deep parameter of the utility model in equation (1). In
the results section of the paper we show that our estimated value of β is not sensitive to the
choice of the reference occupation, which is consistent with it being a deep parameter of the
model.
   2
    In practice, we could estimate equation (2) using a maximum likelihood approach, given the non-linear
relationship between the parameter of interest and the observable market shares.




                                                                  5
2.2        Accounting for Features of Licenses

Many occupational licenses have human capital requirements and/or impose restrictions
on the ability of ex-offenders to possess the license. These human capital and ex-offender
requirements create additional barriers to entry that may further influence workers’ selection
into a licensed occupation. To account for this, we enrich our utility model to allow these
features of the license to alter the estimated marginal utility of licensing. In our enriched
occupational choice model, we define new variables: Lfos = 1 if the occupation has a felony
restriction and 0 otherwise; and Lhos = 1 if there is (are) additional human capital requirements
and 0 otherwise:

                                          
           mos                      ωos
 log                   = θlog                    + β0 (Los − Lo∗ s ) + β1 (Lfos − Lfo∗ s ) + β2 (Lhos − Lho∗ s ) + ξo − ξo∗ (4)
           mo∗ s                    ωo ∗ s

With this specification, we are particularly interested in whether β1 and β2 are different from
zero. If so, this would provide evidence that the additional features of the license affect the
occupational selection of workers.
    There are four potential human capital requirements which we observe in the data: an
examination requirement, a continuing education requirement, a training requirement, and
whether it took more than 1 month to obtain the license. We code the human capital
requirements of occupational licenses by drawing on the following four questions in the SIPP
that were asked of respondents who reported having a license or certificate on a prior question:
(1) “Did the respondent have to demonstrate skills while on the job or pass a test or exam
to earn the certification or license?”; (2) “Did the respondent take courses or training to
earn the certification or license?”; (3) “Did the respondent have to take periodic tests or
continuing education classes or earn CEUs to maintain the certification or license?”; and (4)
“How long did it take to earn this certificate?”




                                                                     6
2.3         Heterogeneous Responses by Race and Gender

So far, our market shares include workers of all race and gender groups. To test whether
licensing affects women and minorities differently from white men, we compute separate
market shares by race and gender and use them as our dependent variable. We denote the
market shares of each occupation by race-gender groups by:

                                                                             g
                                                                            qos
                                                                  mgos =                                                           (5)
                                                                            qsg

       g
where qos is the number of workers of group g in state s who choose occupation o; and
qsg is the number of workers of group g in state s. We focus our analysis on four groups –
white men and white women, and black men and black women. As before, we also compute
the market share of the reference occupation (mgo∗ s ) and compute all other market shares
relative to this market share of the reference occupation. This yields the following estimating
equation for each demographic group:

           mgos                         g
                                           
                                     ωos
 log                    = θlog                    + β0g (Los − Lo∗ s ) + β1g (Lfos − Lfo∗ s ) + β2g (Lhos − Lho∗ s ) + ξog − ξog∗ . (6)
           mgo∗ s                    ωog∗ s

One challenge in running this specification is that we get many occupations with market
shares equal to 0. For black men and black women, who represent a smaller share of the
U.S. population, this problem is particularly acute. When we run our regression, we omit
occupations with zero market shares. We prefer this strategy to the imputation of market
shares because the imputation process will introduce two types of biases. First, a market
share of 0 could reflect the fact that workers of that group have a high disutility of that
occupation. Alternatively, a market share of 0 could reflect the fact that workers of that
group are a small fraction of the population of workers in the given state.




                                                                        7
2.4    Boundary Discontinuity Design

The approaches outlined so far exploit the cross-state variation in licensing laws. To tighten
the identification assumption, we adopt a boundary discontinuity design as in Black (1999),
in which we restrict our sample to border counties in the US and include boundary fixed
effects. By restricting the sample to boundary counties and including boundary fixed effects,
we are controlling for local labor market conditions that could influence the occupational
choice decision independently of the licensing regime. The underlying assumption is that
counties located next to each other have similar observed as well as unobserved characteristics
except for the licensing requirements, which differ state-to-state. This identification strategy
using policy discontinuity at the state borders has been adopted in several influential studies:
Bayer et al. (2007), Huang (2008), and Dube et al. (2010).
                                                                                  ~ j(c)
   To implement this research design, we create a set of shared boundary dummies BD
– one for each shared boundary. Each of these J boundary dummies equals 1 for all of the
counties that share this unique boundary and zero for every other county. For example,
if Texas and Oklahoma share boundary BDj(c)=1 then the associated boundary dummy
BDj(c)=1 = 0 for all counties not in Texas and Oklahoma; moreover BDj(c)=1 = 0 for all
counties in Texas and Oklahoma except those counties in Texas and Oklahoma which share
the Texas Oklahoma boundary – for these counties BDj(c)=1 = 1. Texas also borders New
Mexico and Louisiana hence some counties in Texas will have multiple state boarders. For
counties with multiple state boarders, there may be multiple border dummies equal to one
and equally lots of variation in licensing laws in a highly localized geography.
   To implement this strategy empirically, we compute the market shares for each occupation
at the county-level:
                                                   qoc
                                          moc =        .                                    (7)
                                                   qc

where qoc is the number of workers in county c who work in occupation o and qc is the number
of workers in county c. Similarly, the heterogeneous market shares by race and gender group



                                               8
g are given by:

                                                                            qoc
                                                                   mgoc =                                                    (8)
                                                                            qcg

3      Data & Descriptive Statistics

3.1      Licensing Variables

We use a combination of data sets for the licensing variables: a new data set on felony
restrictions created by Blair and Chung (2018), the 2008 panel (Wave 13) of the SIPP, and
the 2015 CPS. To define an occupation in our data, we adopt the 2010 Standard Occupational
Classification (SOC). In this method, there are 23 2-digit major groups such as “Management
Occupations” and “Community and Social Service Occupations.” Each 2-digit major group
then has detailed 3-digit subgroups that contain 6-digit professions with similar characteristics.
For example, the 6-digit professions “Social Worker” and “Counselors” belong to the 3-digit



                                                                        9
subgroup “Counselors, Social Workers, and Other Community and Social Service Specialists”
which is a subgroup of the 2-digit “Community and Social Service Occupations.”3 Our
occupation is defined by the 6-digit professions. The basic licensing variable, L in Section 2,
is defined by a 50-50 rule: we report a 6-digit occupation as a licensed profession if 50% or
more of the workers in that state-occupation pair report having a license in the CPS.
       As noted in Section 2.2, we are interested in whether various features of licensing laws
create additional distortions to the labor market. Therefore, we make use of two external
sources of licensing. First, as noted in Gittleman et al. (2015), the licensing module in the
SIPP contains detailed information on the types of licenses, namely whether the worker
is required to take an examination, continuing education, training, and the duration of
acquisition. Again, we employ the 50-50 rule to decide if an occupation in a state has a
particular type of license requirement.4 Second, the ex-offender data created by Blair and
Chung (2018) includes license restrictions that felons face in licensed occupations at the
occupation-by-state level. This data was generated using a database hosted by the American
Bar Association (ABA) Criminal Justice Section that specifies the 16,343 legal restrictions
faced by ex-offenders seeking occupational licenses. Because we matched the occupations in
the ABA database to their corresponding 2010 SOC occupations, we can directly merge the
licensing requirements governing ex-offenders and the licensing requirements in CPS 2015
and the SIPP.


3.2       Data on Labor Supply and Wage

Our main source of data is the 2015 Basic Monthly Survey of the Current Population Survey
(CPS 2015). We choose the 2015 CPS because we have additional data from an external
source, CareerOneStop, with licensing coverage for that year. We use this external data
source to show that the measurement error introduced by our procedure of assigning licensing
   3
     For example, the occupation code for ‘Counselors’ is 21-1010 and ‘Social Workers’ is 21-1020. The first
three digits indicate the corresponding subgroup.
   4
     Certification is not counted as a license in our analysis.



                                                    10
based on a 50-50 rule does not bias our results. We will further show the robustness of our
results by analyzing different years of sample, namely 2016 and 2017. To select our sample,
we follow Gittleman et al. (2015): an individual has to be in the labor force, age between 18
and 64 with hourly wage between $5 and $100.


3.3    The State Border Sample

The border counties in the 2015 CPS are in 17 places: Arizona, Delaware, District of Columbia,
Indiana, Illinois, Idaho, Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, New York, New Jersey, Ohio, Michigan,
Pennsylvania, Texas, New Mexico, Virginia and Washington. The limited coverage of border
states suggests that there is a trade-off between the strength of the empirical design with the
border discontinuity approach and the external validity of the results to the entire US. To
give a better sense of how comparable the border counties are to the full sample, we report
summary statistics for both in Table 1. The licensing coverage in border counties mirrors
the coverage in the full sample and this matching is consistent for all the types of licenses
that we observe in our data. For example, 22% of the state-occupation observations in our
data reflect occupations that are licensed and 21% of the county-occupation pairs in our data
reflect licensed occupations. The border counties are also similar on some demographics to
the full sample – e.g. the fraction of women is 49% in the full sample and 50% in the border
sample; the fraction of government employees 17% and 16% and the mean age 41.1 years
and 40.8 years (respectively). The border sample, however, has on average more minorities
(blacks: 15% versus 11%, Hispanics 20% versus 14%) and more college educated workers (40%
versus 36%) than the full sample. This difference in the racial and educational composition
of the border sample from the full sample informs the external validity of our results. The
extent to which the boarder sample is or is not representative of the full sample determines
the extent to which we believe that these estimates apply to the population at large.




                                              11
3.4    The Reference Occupation

As noted in Section 3, an important component of our estimation is the choice of the reference
group o∗ . The most important criteria is that the occupation has wide coverage to avoid
dropping out observations because of zero appearing in the denominator of the ratio of
                 mos
market shares:   mo∗ s
                       .   As shown in Table 2, we use ‘Elementary and middle school teachers’
as it is the most common occupation in our sample (measured by the number of counties
that have at least one worker in that occupation). For this reason, we chose it to be our
reference occupation. One might worry about the sensitivity of our results to the choice of
the reference group because this profession is a universally licensed occupation, as reported
in Table 3. To check the robustness of our results, in Section 5 we will instead use ‘Manager,
all other’, as the reference occupation. The manager occupation ranks 3rd on the list of
most common occupations, which satisfies the condition of minimizing the number of missing
observations in our empirical design. Moreover, the manager occupation is a universally
unlicensed occupation, unlike teaching which is universally licensed. In Table 4 we report
an augmented set of summary statistics that also include the market share relative to the
market share of the reference occupation and the wages relative to the wages in the reference
occupation. The average wage relative to the reference occupation is at or above 90% in
both samples and the market share in the reference occupation is 2 to 8 times larger than
the average market share.



4     Results

In Table 5, we present the results of running equation (3) at the state level. In column 1, we
regress the relative market share on the relative wage and licensing variable, and column 2
we further add 6-digit occupation fixed effects. In the model without occupation fixed effects,
the constant term in the regression output represents the average difference between the
occupation fixed effects of all occupations and the occupation fixed effect of the reference


                                                12
occupation, i.e. E[ξo − ξo∗ ] = E[ξo ] − ξo∗ . In our model with occupation fixed effects, the
constant term in the regression output represents the negative of the occupation fixed effect of
the reference occupation, i.e. −ξo∗ , since the inclusion of the occupation fixed effects absorbs
the ξo terms. While the inclusion of occupation fixed effects does increase the effect of relative
wages (by almost double) and the explanatory power of the regression (from R2 = 0.005 to
R2 = 0.724), the estimated labor supply response to licensing remains approximately the
same as the model without occupation fixed effects.5 In both specifications, the presence of
occupational licensing decreases relative labor supply by 17%-19%.
       In Table 6, we further study whether the labor supply response to licensing differs based
on the licensing requirements. We consider the following licensing requirements: felony ban,
exam, training, continuing education, and an acquisition period greater than 1 month. In
column (1), we run our base model with no additional licensing requirements. In column
(2)-(6) we add in each licensing requirement one at a time. In column (7) we run a saturated
model in which we control for the presence of all 5 licensing requirements. From the naive
regression that includes a single licensing requirement, adding a licensing requirement reduces
the negative effect of licensing on labor supply by almost half. In our fully saturated model,
however, we only find a positive effect of the training requirement on labor supply – all the
other licensing requirements enter with a negative sign, i.e. they exacerbate the negative labor
supply effect of licensing. It is important to note that of these negative requirement effects,
only the acquisition duration is statistically different from zero. Increasing the licensing
duration, however, doubles the negative labor supply effect of occupational licensing.
       The results from the boundary discontinuity design are presented in Table 7. We find
that the negative labor supply effect of licensing increases in magnitude by 10 percentage
points from -17% to -27%. This suggest that the OLS estimates were understating the
   5
     Most of the explanatory power of our regression is coming from the inclusion of the occupation fixed
effects. This suggest that, to first order, market shares of various occupations differ primarily because the
occupations are different in ways that go beyond differences in observed wages and licensing regulation. This
is consistent with demand for an occupation being a key driver of the equilibrium number of workers in a
given occupation. In light of this fact, the reader should not be surprised when the estimated constant and
R2 do not change substantially as we add more regressors.


                                                     13
negative labor supply effect of occupational licensing. In contrast to the results in Table 6,
we also find that each of the licensing requirements, when entered separately, have a negative,
but insignificant, effect on labor supply, above and beyond the direct negative labor supply
effect of licensing. In our saturated model, none of these licensing attributes are statistically
different from zero. It is worth noting that the exam requirement has a large but statistically
insignificant effect on labor supply, which offsets the negative effect of the occupation being
licensed.
       We now turn to our results of whether occupational licensing and licensing requirements
have heterogeneous labor supply effects by race and gender. We start our analysis first
looking at the results that exploit state variation in licensing laws. First, in Table 8, we look
at the effect of licensing on labor supply, not accounting for the additional requirements of
the license. For men, we find that licensing has a negative statistically significant effect on
labor supply. Licensing reduces the relative labor supply of white men by 15.2% and black
men by 18.9%. By contrast the labor supply effects for women are statistically insignificant
and close to zero. This result is important because it suggests that licensing only distorts
the labor supply of men. We know from Blair and Chung (2018), that women earn a larger
licensing premium than men even when the license has no additional requirement, whereas
men only earn a statistically significant licensing wage premium when the license has some
additional attributes. This suggests that occupational licensing may have wage effect without
an appreciably negative employment effect for women.6
       We next estimate a model in which we allow for heterogeneous labor supply effects of
additional licensing requirements by race and gender. The results in Table 9 confirm what we
saw is that there is a negative labor supply effect of occupational licensing for men but not
women. Of the additional licensing requirements, the only significant effects are a negative
   6
    It is worth noting that the wage coefficients for black men and black women are biased towards zero.
Looking at the sample sizes by race, we suspect that our wage estimates are biased toward zero because
of the small sample size of occupations in which we observe non-zero market shares for black workers of
both genders. As suggestive evidence supporting this claim, we do not observe a similar bias in the wage
coefficients among white workers. In fact, the wage parameter estimates for white men and white women are
almost identical (0.144 and 0.135, respectively).


                                                  14
effect of acquisition duration on white women and a positive marginally significant effect of
training for white women. The positive training effect for white women explains a result in
our earlier work, where we found a positive wage effect of training requirements for white
women (Blair and Chung, 2018). The positive labor supply effect here and the positive wage
effect that we documented in our previous paper point to white women sorting into licensed
occupations with training requirements as a way of signalling ability. Note that the effect of
a felony ban, though statistically insignificant, is mostly negative for black men and almost
double the negative baseline effect of licensing on black male employment. This result accords
with the fact that black men are more likely to have a felony record than other groups in the
data. This negative labor supply effect of the felony ban for black men offsets the positive
wage effect that we documented in our prior work for black men in occupations with felony
bans. In stark contrast to these results for black men, the presence of a felony restriction
moves the estimate on licensing for white men from -0.151 to -0.034, which is in line with
the estimated effect of licensing on equilibrium labor supply for white women. These results
are consistent with a story in which felony restrictions on licenses result in a net employment
gain for white men and a net employment loss for black men, within occupation. This is not
to say that the resorting due to this restriction is in equilibrium detrimental to black men or
advantageous to white men.
   We now look at the results of the effects of occupational licensing on employment by
race and gender using the boundary discontinuity design. Before delving into the results,
it is important to note that cutting the data in this way we lose a large fraction of the
data. For white men and women in our occupation-by-state sample, we have 10-12 thousand
observations, whereas in the boundary discontinuity sample we have slightly more than 3
thousand observations. This represents a reduction in the sample of close to 70%. Similarly,
for black men and black women, our sample size is 2-3 thousand for the occupation-by-state
sample, as compared to 600-900 state-by-county pairs in the border discontinuity design.
This represents a reduction in sample size that is also close to 70%. In percentage terms the


                                              15
loss in sample size is the same for both black and white workers, even though in absolute
terms the loss of sample is substantially larger for black workers than white workers.
   A few important differences emerge between the results in which we exploit the state
variation as opposed to the results in which we exploit the border county variation. First,
we find that the labor supply effect for white men with ordinary licenses is twice as large
in the boundary discontinuity sample (Table 10). Likewise, the magnitude of the labor
supply effects for both white women and black women increase markedly from -3% and -6%
(respectively) to -27% and -22%. In contrast to the increases in the negative labor supply
responses that we document for white men, white women, and black women, we find that
under the boundary discontinuity design that there is no negative labor supply effect of
licensing on black men. The point estimate goes from a statistically significant -19% in the
state sample to a small and statistically insignificant +9.0%. In Table 11 we also find that the
felony restrictions depress the labor supply by a marginally significant 12.4% for white men
and a statistically insignificant 12.4% for black men. This suggest that felony restrictions
have a deferentially more negative effect on the employment of white men than that of black
men, which would be consistent with black men using the license as a signal of non-felony
status.
   Among the other license attributes, we find a statistically significant positive effect of
training duration longer than 1 month on the labor supply of black women and white men
but a negative effect of training duration on the labor supply of black men. Moreover, we
find a positive and statistically significant effect of continuous education on the labor supply
of black men and a negative and statistically significant effect of felony restrictions on the
labor supply of black women. What we can say unambiguously is that licensing reduces the
labor supply of white men and white women. We have weaker evidence that licensing reduces
the labor supply of black men and black women because both the state level estimates and
the estimates from the border discontinuity design generate statistically insignificant effects
of occupational licensing on employment or black workers.

5         Robustness Checks

The robustness tests for our results center on checking whether our parameter estimates are
sensitive to the choice of the reference occupation, the way in which we define our licensing
variable, and the year in which our regression is estimated.
        First, in the main analysis, we choose ‘Elementary and middle school teachers’ as the
reference group. To ensure that our estimates do not depend on the choice of this reference
group, we estimate our model using ‘Manager, all other’ as the leading alternative, since this is
a universally unlicensed occupation with good coverage across all counties. Moreover, we also
include results with three other occupations as the reference occupation: 1) Financial Analyst
2) Auto Mechanic 3) Home and Health Aid.7 For each choice of the reference occupation,
we estimate equation (10), which exploits boundary discontinuities, and present the results
in Table 12. Indeed, we find similar magnitudes as in the main analysis. Comparing the
estimated licensing parameters in the border samples for different choices of the reference
occupations, we find that licensing reduces equilibrium relative employment by 28% – 30%.
This is to be expected because the parameter β is a deep parameter of the utility model. The
choice of the reference occupation only serves a technical purpose of allowing us to estimate
the model using a straightforward log-linear regression rather than a maximum likelihood
estimator.
        Second, to check the sensitivity of our results to measurement error in the licensing
variable, as we have defined it, we use an alternative measure of whether an occupation is
licensed. The Employment and Training Administration of the U.S. Department of Labor
financially supports a website www.careeronestop.org, which collects data from each state’s
Labor Market Information unit for the purpose of providing information to job seekers in
an easy-to-access format. We scrape the CareerOneStop website to record the name of each
occupation in each state that reports having a licensing agency. We report an occupation
as having a license if it has a licensing agency that appears in the CareerOneStop database.
    7
        We thank Morris Kleiner for suggesting these alternative choices for the reference occupation.


                                                        17
Gittleman and Kleiner (2016) also use similar strategy to define whether a 6-digit occupation
is partially licensed.8 As both CareerOneStop and the CPS define occupation using the
Standard Occupation Classification (SOC) system, we can match the license requirement of
an occupation at 6-digit level in March CPS directly. Focusing on the boundary discontinuity
design, again we find magnitudes between −29% to −31% in Table 13 using this alternative
measure of licensing. These estimates are similar to the results in the main analysis.
        Third, to test whether the magnitude of employment effects that we estimate are stable
over time, we re-estimate equation (10) using Basic Monthly Survey of CPS in 2016 and
2017, with the licensing variable defined by whether the state-occupation pair appears in
the CareerOneStop database. In Table 14 and Table 15 we see that the estimates of the
employment effects of licensing are in the range between −29% and −33%, which is broadly
similar to the magnitudes that we found using the 2015 CPS.



6         Conclusion

As expected by economic theory, we find evidence for a negative effect of occupational
licensing on labor supply. Surprisingly, we find that these negative labor supply effects
occur primarily for white workers. We find much weaker evidence of licensing having a
negative labor supply effect for black women and black men. Moreover, although many
licenses have additional requirements, we do not find strong evidence that these requirements
further distort the labor supply decision of workers above and beyond the direct effect of the
occupation being licensed.

The table presents the 10 most common occupations in the sample, as measured by the number of
counties in which there is a non-zero number of workers in that occupation (6-digit SOC code). We
use this measure of county coverage to choose the reference occupation to be the occupation with
the most widespread county coverage – namely elementary and middle school teachers.

 In this table we provide summary statistics of the key variables in our occu-
 pational choice model at both the state and the county level. The variable
‘share/‘share∗ ’ refers to the relative labor market share. The ‘share’ represents
 the labor market share of occupations o in state s and ‘share∗ ’ represents the
 share of the reference group ‘Elementary and middle school teachers’. Simi-
 larly, ‘wage/‘wage∗ ’, refers to the wage relative to the wage in the reference
 occupation.
