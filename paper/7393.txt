                                            ABSTRACT



       The optimal currency area (OCA) concept is central to the economic analysis of monetary
unions, as it clearly identifies the relevant optimizing tradeoff: extension of the area over which a
single currency is used enhances allocative efficiency but reduces the possibility of tailoring monetary
policy to the needs of different areas. Empirical work has verified the importance of various features
of economies that make them strong or weak candidates for a common currency arrangement, but
existing studies do not permit actual quantification of costs and benefits. Thus the OCA concept
remains less than fully operational. A second relevant body of theory is that pertaining to currency
crises. Formal models clarify various points concerning speculative attacks on fixed exchange rates,
and show how abrupt reserve losses and depreciations can occur rationally at times when no major
shocks are hitting the system. These models support the notion that a fixed (but adjustable)
exchange-rate regime is not a viable option for most nations, given high mobility of financial capital.
Also discussed is the recently-developed fiscal theory of price level determination, which if valid
would have major implications for monetary-fiscal arrangements in currency unions. This theory does
not contend that fiscal behavior drives an accommodative monetary authority, but rather that the price
level roughly mimics the pattern of the government bond stock rather than base money when their
paths differ drastically. An example is exposited in which there are two rational expectations
solutions for an economy with a constant money supply: a traditional solution in which the price level
is also constant and a fiscalist solution in which the price level and bond stock both explode as time
passes. These solutions represent competing hypotheses about the behavior of actual economies; the
paper suggests that the former is more likely to prevail in actuality.

1. Introduction

       The purpose of this paper is to review the economic theory relevant to the subject

of monetary unions, in principle to provide a background for the remainder of the

conference. This is a difficult assignment, for there is only a small bit of theory that is

directly and strongly relevant to the topic, whereas the amount of theory that is of

possibly significant relevance is huge—too large to cover in a single paper of moderate

length. Accordingly, I have had to make some difficult and debatable choices regarding

content.

       The one theoretical topic that is of clear and direct relevance is the theory of

optimal currency areas, since the basic purpose of that analysis is to specify conditions

under which it is (or is not) economically advantageous for a group of economies to

adopt a single currency. But direct relevance does not imply that an extensive discussion

of this topic is appropriate because, on the one hand, its central propositions are well

known and, on the other hand, the essential concepts involved are perhaps so difficult to

measure as to render the theory virtually non-operational. Accordingly, just one section

of the paper, Section 2, will be devoted to the subject of optimal currency areas.

       A second topic that seems worthy of some review is the recently-prominent

theory of exchange-rate (and other financial) crises. This topic is relevant because one of

its main practical messages is, as I understand it, that with unregulated international

financial flows the relevant choice for a group of economies is between currency union

and floating exchange rates. In other words, the apparent intermediate option of a fixed

but possibly adjustable exchange rate is actually close to infeasible. Accordingly, a short

review of this literature is in order and will be attempted in Section 3.




                                              1
       Third, the topic of monetary union envisions a single currency for economies that

have distinct governments and thus, to some extent, potentially distinct fiscal authorities.

Consequently, the subject of the relationship between fiscal and monetary policies arises.

As a whole, this subject is too extensive to be reviewed here. A particular issue that has

quite recently been the subject of considerable theoretical attention, however, is the so-

called “fiscal theory of price level determination.” This is a topic of fundamental

importance that has been developed in a number of writings that are theoretically

sophisticated and rather difficult to comprehend without extensive study. It is also a

topic in which I have taken some prior interest. An exposition of the issues is therefore

provided in Section 4 of the paper. It should be clearly stated at the outset that, due to my

previous involvement, this presentation does not pretend to be a balanced, unbiased

overview but is instead a partisan attempt to justify a particular position regarding this

theory—the position that I consider to be most appropriate.

       Finally, a short summary of the paper is included as Section 5.

2. Optimal Currency Areas

       The optimal currency area concept was introduced, as is well known, by Mundell

(1961). Despite appearances, the foregoing should be regarded as a striking statement

because it is surprising that such a basic idea would not have been developed previously.

Nevertheless, the statement is, as well as I have been able to determine, correct. I will

return to this point below, and will offer an explanation for the reason that the concept

had not been developed previously, but for the moment let us continue the substantive

theoretical discussion. The crucial tradeoff identified by Mundell is, according to my




                                              2
own textbook,1 that “an extension of the area over which a single currency prevails

enhances [microeconomic] efficiency but reduces the possibility of monetary policy

responses to shocks [or conditions] that affect various subareas differently” (1996, p.

258). The wider the area, that is, the greater are the efficiency benefits of possessing a

single medium of exchange and medium of account,2 but the smaller the area, the greater

are the possibilities of tailoring monetary policy to (temporary) local needs. Somewhere

between one currency for the entire world and one for each country (or for each city, or

neighborhood, …) lies the optimum. The plot of net benefits versus number of currencies

might be quite flat, of course, over a wide range that includes the optimum.

       In a sense, the foregoing is all there is to be said in terms of pure theory, but most

authors would discuss the topic at somewhat greater length. The recent and highly-

regarded graduate level textbook by Obstfeld and Rogoff (1996, pp. 632-4) sustains the

discussion for approximately two full pages by listing four main benefits and four main

costs to a pair of countries from having a common currency. These are, in the words of

Obstfeld and Rogoff, as follows, with benefits listed first.

       B1. Reduced transaction costs from currency conversion ….

       B2. Reduced accounting costs and greater predictability of relative prices

       for firms doing business in both countries.

       B3. Insulation from monetary disturbances and speculative bubbles

       that might otherwise lead to temporary unnecessary fluctuations in

       real exchange rates ….



1
 See McCallum (1996, pp. 258-9 and 209-214).
2
  For simplicity, I here assume that the two are the same. This is of course not logically
necessary, but will usually be the case except in environments of very high inflation.


                                              3
       B4. Less political pressure for trade protection because of sharp shifts

       in real exchange rates.



       C1. Individual regions in a currency union forgo the ability to use

       monetary policy to respond to region-specific macroeconomic disturbances ….

       C2. Regions in a currency union give up the option to use inflation

       to reduce the real burden of public debt ….

       C3. … [Political and strategic problems arise in determining how

       member countries split seignorage revenues ….

       C4. Avoiding speculative attacks in the transition from individual

       currencies to a common currency can be a major problem ….

Here it would appear that B1, B2, B3, C1, and C2 accord nicely with the simple

statement expressed above whereas C4 represents only a transitional difficulty3 and B4

and C3 are basically political rather than economic in nature. If I were making a list of

the Obstfeld-Rogoff type, however, I would add another distinct benefit as follows: the

existence of a common currency tends to bring a greater degree of integration to financial

and non-financial markets in the two countries.

       Merely stating that this optimization problem exists does nothing, obviously, to

solve it for any two actual countries such as the U.K. and Germany. The relevant issue

for the present paper is what theoretical writings have to say about the way in which the

optimization problem should be handled in practice. In his original paper, Mundell




3
  If transitional costs are to be considered, one should certainly count the resource and
educational costs of conversion by one or more regions to the new common currency.


                                             4
(1961) emphasized factor mobility, especially labor mobility, as a crucial consideration.

Subsequent contributions by McKinnon (1963), Kenen (1969), and others have proposed

other criteria for consideration. In particular, McKinnon emphasized openness, measured

by the share of tradable goods in a country’s output, whereas Kenen focussed on the

extent of product diversification in production. For an extensive review of this literature,

including references to many additional authors, see Ishiyama (1975) or Tower and

Willett (1976).

       After reflecting on some of these writings, my own impression was that there is

significant merit to several of the proposed criteria, in other words, that no one of them is

itself sufficient. Furthermore, each of the criteria is extremely difficult to implement

quantitatively. So when I began this paper, I found it difficult to avoid the conclusion

that the optimal currency area (OCA) concept is, in practice, non-operational.

Consequently, my first draft expressed the opinion that, although the concept reflects an

important and interesting tradeoff, in actual practice one can not go far beyond the rather

limp conclusion that currency unions “will be relatively more attractive for small, open

economies that engage in a large volume of international trade (relative to their size)”

whereas “floating rates … are more suitable for large and relatively self-contained

economies” (McCallum, 1996, p. 225).

       Since writing the first draft, I have seen a pair of papers by Bayoumi and

Eichengreen (1996, 1997) whose purpose is to operationalize the OCA concept. Their

approach in the 1997 paper is to develop quantitative measures or proxies pertaining to

size, trade linkages, and dissimilarity of aggregate shocks for different European




                                              5
countries each considered relative to Germany. 4 An index of unsuitability for

membership in the contemplated currency area is constructed (for each country except

Germany) by using coefficients obtained in a cross-section regression whose dependent

variable is the variability of bilateral exchange rates with Germany. This index indicates

that Austria, Belgium, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Switzerland would be relatively

suitable for inclusion in the union, whereas Denmark, Finland, Norway, Portugal, Spain,

Sweden, and the United Kingdom would be relatively unsuitable. These groupings seem

sensible enough that I would have to agree that Bayoumi and Eichengreen have made

notable progress toward operationalization of the OCA theory. 5

       Nevertheless, it must be recognized that their approach yields only rankings of

suitability, not actual cost-benefit measures that would indicate where the line separating

included vs. excluded currencies should be drawn. Accordingly, one could still argue

that true operationality of the OCA concept has not been achieved. To emphasize this

point, it might be argued that if there was ever a situation that cried out for application of

the OCA calculus, it was the January 1999 creation of the European Monetary Union.

But Bayoumi and Eichengreen’s (1996) review of numerous studies indicates that they do

not actually provide estimates indicating which countries should, and which should not,

be members of the Euro area. The European Union publication One Market, One Money

presented some worthwhile analysis—especially in its attempt to estimate the resource

   Some earlier work of this general type is reviewed and evaluated by Edison and Melvin
(1990).

  In my textbook, one end-of-chapter problem asks the student to consider “would it be
more advantageous for Portugal or France to have fixed exchange rates with Spain?”
(1996, p. 226). The Bayoumi and Eichengreen (1997, p. 768) results for selected
bilateral comparisons indicate that “Portugal” is the correct answer, which is certainly
what the textbook intended.

savings of a single currency rather than truly fixed exchange rates among national

currencies—but all in all it too seems not to pass the test.6

       Let us now return to questions relating to the history of the optimum currency

area’s crucial tradeoff concept. Was Mundell (1961) actually the first to express it

clearly? Yeager (1976) mentions another publication of the same year, namely Balassa

(1961, pp. 263-8). But examination indicates that the latter gives consideration to the

type of costs and benefits implied by the tradeoff, without ever posing the issue in terms

of an “optimal area” concept. Indeed, the same can be said for an earlier publication by

Yeager himself (1959a). In addition, some other earlier writings of relevance are cited by

Ishiyama (1975) and by Tower and Willett (1976). But even if one were to conclude that

the concept had been clearly formulated by someone prior to Mundell, which is

debatable, it would nevertheless be striking that its formulation did not occur until some

date not long before 1961. So let us move on to the more interesting question, why did

this recognition not come sooner?

       To the latter question there is, I believe, a rather clear-cut (although conjectural)

answer. It is that prior to the 1950s, the predominant position among international and

monetary economists was that some metallic monetary standard should be adopted by all

countries. The most common position was that the same monetary standard, typically the

gold standard, should prevail everywhere.7 Then, in the absence of restrictions on gold

  Certainly, actual decisions whether to participate were not based on optimal-currency-
area analyses, but that is another matter. The issue here is whether there are any
convincing economic studies.
7
  Mill (1848) puts the matter very nicely, as he does so often, as follows: “Let us suppose
that all countries had the same currency, as in the progress of political improvement they
one day will have…” (Book III, Ch. XX, § 2).


                                              7
flows, there would be a unified monetary system; the fact that different units of account

would be used in different countries would not negate the existence of a unified medium

of exchange and medium of account.8 Furthermore, even if different metals were used by

some countries, there would be no scope for floating exchange rates or for the associated

possibility of tailoring monetary policy to different conditions in different regions.

       The great break with this orthodoxy came, of course, with the publication of

Friedman’s “The Case for Flexible Exchange Rates” (1953). This, together with other

pro-floating rate writings, including Lutz (1954), Sohmen (1957), and Yeager (1959b),

altered the intellectual climate enough to permit the relevant issues to arise. In

Friedman’s essay there is no attempt to balance off the benefits and costs of floating

rates, but that is so because the paper’s task was to persuade analysts of the existence of

benefits. But in this task the paper was successful enough that within a few years

Mundell could take a more balanced perspective and look for an optimizing tradeoff.

       Another development was necessary, furthermore, before Friedman’s. Since the

main benefit of a floating exchange rate is that it permits monetary policy to be different

in different regions, and therefore to be usable for offsetting demand shocks that would

have undesirable (albeit temporary) effects on output and employment, there needed to be

professional recognition that monetary policy could be useful in this way. In other

words, there needed to be recognition of the possibility of monetary stabilization policy

of the type that we now call Keynesian. It is my own belief that Keynes’s General

Theory (1936) was largely unsuccessful as an undertaking in economic theory, but it

  If gold is the standard metal in various countries that have different coinage systems,
one might regard gold as the common medium of account even though units of account
would differ with different coinage systems.


                                              8
succeeded spectacularly in calling the profession’s attention to the importance of

considering short-run issues. The point, from the perspective of the present discussion, is

that the recognition of some role for monetary stabilization policy provides one potential

benefit for floating exchange rates, i.e., for the possible optimality of more than a single

worldwide currency. This particular role is not strictly necessary, for different countries

could have different preferences regarding long-run average inflation rates—perhaps for

public finance reasons—but the stabilization role is more prominent and would remain

relevant even if average inflation preferences were the same everywhere.9

       The discussion to this point has proceeded as if floating rates and currency unions

were the only possibilities. In other words, we have not mentioned the possibility of

countries with fixed but potentially adjustable exchange rates. Experiences during recent

years—most prominently in Europe in 1992 and 1993, Mexico in 1994-95, and Asia in

1997-98—have strengthened the belief that the fixed-but-adjustable arrangement is

illusory for the reason that was spelled out so effectively by Friedman (1953). This

reason, of course, is that fixed (but adjustable) rates tend to invite speculative attacks. In

Friedman’s words:

       Because the exchange rate is changed infrequently and only to meet

       substantial difficulties, a change tends to come well after the onset of

       difficulty, to be postponed as long as possible, and to be made only after

       substantial pressure on the exchange rate has accumulated. In consequence,



9
  For quite a few years, especially during the 1960s and 1970s, it was widely believed
that different countries might desire different average inflation rates because of different
preferences regarding output and employment relative to inflation, but in more recent
time professional opinion has moved strongly toward the Friedman (1966)-Phelps (1967)
position that there exists no long-run tradeoff.


                                              9
         there is seldom any doubt about the direction in which an exchange rate

          will be changed, if it is changed. In the interim between the suspicion of

         a possible change in the rate and its actual change, there is every incentive

         to sell the country’s currency if a devaluation is expected… or to buy it if

         an appreciation is expected. (1953, p. 164)

         Friedman’s argument is rather compelling and may seem more convincing now

than ever before. Nevertheless, a more formal literature concerning speculative attacks

on exchange rates has built up over the past 20 years, and deserves some attention in any

review of theory relevant to the topic of monetary unification. To provide a brief review

is the purpose of the next section of the paper. Comments on the currency-board

possibility will be included toward the end of this next section.

3. The Theory of Currency Crises

         The currency crisis or speculative attack literature came to prominence with

writings by Krugman (1979) and Flood and Garber (1984a). Extensive recent reviews of

the theory by Flood and Marion (1998), Marion (1999), and Garber and Svensson (1995)

indicate clearly, however, that the crucial ideas were present somewhat earlier in a

comparatively neglected paper by Salant and Henderson (1978).10

         The simplest and cleanest model is one developed by Flood and Garber (1984a).

As a preliminary step, let us consider how a floating exchange rate would behave in a

small open economy in which prices are highly flexible, so that employment and output

are always close to their “natural rate” levels. The analytical framework typically utilized

in the literature is normally described as also requiring uncovered interest parity,



10
     On this, see especially Flood and Marion (1998, fn. 1).


                                              10
purchasing power parity, and constant values for output and the real interest rate in the

home economy. The following presentation indicates how the latter three requirements

can be dispensed with.

        Let Mt be the stock of base money, Pt the price level, St the price of foreign

exchange, Qt the real exchange rate, Yt the rate of output, and Rt the nominal interest rate.

For all of these except the last, let lower case letters denote logarithms, e.g., st = log St;

for the last we have rt = Rt - Et ∆ pt+1, the real interest rate. Also, let “*” denote a foreign

or rest-of-world variable. Then we write the model as follows.

(1a)    yt = b0 + Etyt+1 + b1rt + b2(xt – Etxt+1) + ηt                    b1 < 0, b2 > 0

(1b)    mt – pt = c0 + c1yt + c2Rt + εt                          c1 > 0, c2 < 0

(1c)    xt = a0 + a1qt + a2yt + a3y*t + ξt                            a1, a3 > 0, a2 < 0

(1d)    qt = st – pt + p*t

(1e)    Rt = R*t + Et∆st+1 + ζt

(1f)    yt = y t .

Here (1a) and (1b) reflect dynamic optimizing versions of relations of the IS and LM type

that have been justified by McCallum and Nelson (1999), among others, with the former

augmented by trade flows, xt representing the log of exports minus the log of imports.

The value of xt is modelled in (1c) as depending on the real exchange rate and income

levels at home and abroad. Equation (1d) is an identity; (1e) represents uncovered

interest parity with a random, time-variable risk premium, and (1f) assumes that, with

price flexibility, output equals its (exogenous) market-clearing natural rate value.

        Of course, we also have the identities

(2)     rt = Rt - Et∆pt+1



                                               11
(3)    r*t = R*t - Et∆p*t+1,

so these plus (1d) permit us to rewrite (1e) as

(4)    rt = r*t + Etqt+1 – qt + ζt.

Then it can be seen that relations (1a), (1c), (1f), and (4) comprise a subsystem that

determines the dynamic behavior of yt, qt, xt, and rt given exogenous processes for ηt, ξt,

ζt, y t, and all foreign variables. Consequently, we can substitute (1d) and (1e) into (1b)

to obtain

(5)    mt – (st + p*t – qt) = c0 + y t + c2(R*t + Et∆st+1 + ζt) + εt,

and the latter can be expressed as

(6 )   mt – st = γ + α(Etst+1 – st) + vt                                α < 0,

where vt is a highly composite stochastic term, with Evt = 0, that reflects the behavior of

numerous variables, all of which are exogenous to st and mt.

       Thus we end up with equation (6) to describe the behavior of the exchange rate in

a flexible-price economy. Because it is of the same form as the Cagan (1956) formula for

money demand, except with st appearing where pt usually appears, the behavior of the

exchange rate in this setting is quite familiar. In particular we know that, on average

over an extended period of time, the exchange rate will depreciate at the rate of growth of

the money stock: if the money stock grows at the rate µ, then the exchange rate will

depreciate at the rate µ. Crucially, we also know that the desired level of      mt – st at any

time will be negatively related to µ, since smaller real money holdings are desired when

their expected depreciation rate is high. This simple and familiar model provides a

convenient vehicle for the analysis in the currency crisis literature. To keep matters as

simple as possible, while still making the basic points, the stochastic disturbance term vt


                                               12
is often neglected, i.e., the case of perfect foresight is utilized. In what follows, we shall

follow that common practice. Then we find, via simple rational expectations (RE)

analysis, that with mt = mt-1 + µ the exchange rate behaves as

(7)      st = - γ - αµ + mt.

       After these preliminaries, let us now consider an economy with a fixed exchange

rate. We have specified that st is the log of the exchange rate and now we suppose that its

value is fixed at the value s ; i.e., we have the fixed rate st = s . To maintain this value,

the log of Mt must be kept constant at (say) m . But suppose that the government of the

economy in question engages in another activity besides exchange-rate fixing that

requires positive growth at the rate µ of the domestic credit portion of the monetary base.

(Let M = DC + FR, where M is the base, FR is the stock of foreign exchange reserves,

and DC is the domestic credit portion of M.) To keep Mt constant while expanding DCt,

FRt must fall as time passes. If the growth rate of DCt is maintained permanently at µ,

and log Mt is kept at m , then eventually FRt will fall to zero, at which point it would

become impossible to maintain the fixed exchange rate.11

       But with rational expectations—i.e., perfect foresight in the absence of shocks—

the fixed exchange rate regime will collapse before FRt falls to zero. For by the time that

FRt reaches zero, the exchange rate that would prevail in the absence of official

intervention—i.e., with a floating rate—would be higher than the previously fixed value.

Thus there would occur a discrete, abrupt depreciation at this time, a fall in value of the

home country currency. But with rational expectations, market participants would know


11
  Actually the situation is more complex in that the authorities could have a positive or
negative level of reserves that they will maintain after collapse of the fixed rate. For
expositional simplicity, that level is (as usual) taken to be zero.


                                              13
that this is going to happen, and when it will happen, so before then they would become

unwilling to hold the domestic currency, since to do so would be to incur a capital loss

that is anticipated. So, instead, they sell off the domestic currency in exchange for

foreign exchange reserves earlier.

       In the basic Flood-Garber (1984a) model, it is assumed that when the fixed-rate

regime breaks down, a floating-rate regime takes its place and is maintained indefinitely

thereafter.12 Let ~st be the “shadow exchange rate” that would prevail at time t if a

floating-rate regime were to go into effect at t with FRt = 0;

         t                t


where dt = log DCt. Then according to the basic model, a currency crisis occurs when ~st

rises to the level s . There is then no discontinuity in st and thus no anticipated capital

gain or loss; instead there is an abrupt fall in FR as market participants use their holdings

of domestic currency to purchase foreign exchange from the central bank. In addition,

there is an upward jump (from zero to µ) in the expected inflation rate, and therefore an

upward jump in the nominal rate of interest—a jump that makes asset holders satisfied

with the reduced stock of money. What about the possibility of an earlier attack? Such

would not occur because prior to the point in time at which ~st = s , the former would be

the smaller so there would be capital losses to participants in a speculative attack against




12
  Note that some assumption must be adopted regarding policy behavior after the
breakdown, or the model will be incomplete. Various alternative assumptions are
considered in the literature; one of these will be analysed below.


                                             14
the currency if it were “successful.” Thus there is no incentive for an earlier attact to

occur.13

       In sum, the basic model explains why there are abrupt losses of foreign exchange

holdings by central banks, abrupt changes in interest rates, and a regime change to a

floating rate at the time of a currency crisis, even though no major external triggering

event happens at that time. It also explains (in principle) the time at which this collapse

will occur, since the growth of mt and therefore ~st is a deterministic function of time. 14

In an important sense, however, the model does not actually explain the occurrence of a

collapse, because the model begins with the assumption that the country’s government is

attempting to maintain a fixed exchange rate while conducting another policy activity that

is incompatible with such maintenance of that fixed rate. In such a situation it is obvious

that one of the two incompatible policy goals must eventually be given up, and the basic

model just presumes that the other policy activity has precedence over keeping the

exchange rate pegged at s .

       The literature contains several extensions of the basic model, however, that are

more ambitious in this regard. Several notable examples have been developed and

discussed by Obstfeld (1986, 1994, 1996), but we can outline the essential ingredients

with a simple extension of the Flood-Garber model described above. 15 Accordingly, let

us modify the basic model by assuming that ( i) in the absence of a speculative attack, the


13
   From the individual asset holder’s viewpoint, there would be costs of holding more
foreign exchange in their portfolio, costs that would outweigh the negligible effect to be
had on the precipitation of a general speculative attack.
14
   With the assumption that the post-collapse level of FR is zero, then ~st = - γ - αµ + d0 +
µt, where d0 is the log of “initial” DC. Thus t at collapse time is ( s + γ + αµ - d0)/µ. We
see that a lower µ or higher s will extend the life of the fixed-rate regime.
15
   This extension was first proposed by Flood and Garber (1984b).


                                              15
rate of growth of domestic credit is zero, i.e., µ0 = 0, but ( ii) if an attack occurs then DCt

grows thereafter at the positive rate µ1. In addition, it is assumed that this value satisfies

µ1 > log (M0/DC0)/(-α).

        In this situation, there are two RE (perfect foresight) equilibria. If there is no

speculative attack, then with zero growth in domestic credit there is no literal

inconsistency with the fixed exchange rate st = s , so it can survive indefinitely.

Alternatively, if there is an attack, then there will be an abrupt fall in reserves, a

depreciation of the exchange rate to the value ~st = - γ - αµ1 + dt, and ~st will henceforth

grow indefinitely at the rate µ1. Thus the fact that policy is not unconditionally dedicated

to maintaining the fixed rate, but would in the face of a major attack surrender to

speculators and thereafter pursue an alternative goal, implies that the fixed-rate policy is

subject to attack.16 There are several other models, described by Obstfeld (1996), that

lead to similar conclusions.

        What should one make of the foregoing, with regard to the feasibility of a fixed

but potentially adjustable exchange rate? Garber and Svensson (1995) begin the relevant

section of their prominent survey paper with the following statement: “A salient feature

of fixed exchange rate regimes is their inevitable collapse into some other policy regime”

(1995, p. 1891). Obstfeld and Rogoff (1995), by contrast, state that “…there are no

insurmountable technical obstacles to fixing exchange rates. Most central banks have

access to enough foreign exchange resources to beat down a speculative attack of any

magnitude…” (1995, pp. 77-78). Despite these apparently conflicting statements,



16
  Note that in this variant of the model there is an abrupt depreciation at the time of
attack, but in a manner that does not imply anticipated capital gains or losses.


                                               16
however, there is actually no substantive disagreement between these two pairs of

authors. In particular, Garber and Svensson (1995, p. 1892) recognize that “a central

bank can always preserve a fixed exchange rate through a sustained high interest rate or,

equivalently, through a sufficiently drastic contraction in [the] monetary base;” their

inevitability of collapse stems from “…the presumption that the adherence to a fixed

exchange rate is a secondary policy—it is to be maintained only as long as it is

compatible with policies that have priority.” And for their part, Obstfeld and Rogoff

(1995, p. 78) finish the incomplete sentence quoted above with the proviso, ‘…provided

they are willing to subordinate all the other goals of monetary policy.” In fact, Obstfeld

and Rogoff continue as follows: “If central banks virtually always have the resources to

crush speculators, why do they suffer periodic humiliation by foreign exchange markets?

The problem, of course, is that very few central banks will cling to an exchange-rate

target without regard to what is happening in the rest of the economy. Domestic political

realities simply will not allow it, even when agreements with foreign governments are at

stake” (1995, p. 79). In sum, Obstfeld and Rogoff agree with the Garber-Svensson

conclusion that, in practice, fixed (but adjustable) exchange rate regimes are not a viable

option for most economies, basically for the reasons identified by Friedman and

developed in the currency-crisis literature.

       What about the notion that creation of a currency board provides one way, short

of monetary union, for an economy to maintain a fixed exchange rate? From the

foregoing discussion, the answer seems reasonably clear. The creation of a currency

board gives rise to an institution that is more difficult and costly to dismantle, when it

interferes with some other policy objective, than a more conventional fixed-rate




                                               17
arrangement. But unless maintenance of the currency board arrangement has priority

over all other macroeconomic objectives, eventually the currency board, too, will break

down. The same might even be said for membership in a currency union, but the costs of

departing from a union are presumably even greater than those from the termination of a

currency board. The other members of the union might conceivably even go to war to

prevent its breakup.

4. The Fiscal Theory of Price Level Determination

       During the past few years, a striking body of literature has appeared in which it is

argued that general price level determination is essentially a fiscal, rather than monetary,

phenomenon. The most prominent papers to date are those of Woodford (1994, 1995,

1998), Sims (1994, 1996), and Cochrane (1998), but there are several others of

significance.17 If the theory expounded in these papers were valid empirically, there

would be major implications for the manner in which fiscal and monetary policies are

related in a monetary union, as Woodford (1996), Sims (1997), and Bergin (1996)

emphasize. The purpose of the present section is to describe this theory and explain why

I believe that it is not empirically valid, but instead is basically misleading.18 For

simplicity, the argument will be conducted in terms of a single closed economy, but if the

theory is misleading in that case it will also be misleading regarding the relationship

between monetary and fiscal policies in the more complex setting of a monetary union.




17
   Some of these are Leeper (1991), Bergin (1996), Dupor (1997), and Schmitt-Grohe
and Uribe (1997).
18
   My argument has been presented previously in McCallum (1998, 1999a); a somewhat
similar and complementary position is taken by Buiter (1998), in a study that discusses
several other issues as well.


                                              18
        At the outset it should be emphasized just how drastically unorthodox or counter-

traditional the fiscal theory of price level determination is. 19 Specifically, it does not

merely suggest that fiscal as well as monetary policy stances are significant for price

level behavior; instead it virtually claims that only fiscal policy is relevant. In the

prototype model to be sketched below, the price level moves over time in a manner that is

very closely related to the path of government bonds outstanding and entirely unlike the

path of the stock of high-powered money. Therefore it is not the case that the argument

involves fiscal behavior that drives an accommodative monetary authority, as when rapid

base money growth serves to finance a fiscal deficit.20 Furthermore, the type of model

typically utilized in the literature’s analysis is not of the overlapping generations type, in

which the Ricardian equivalence proposition is known to fail. Instead, the model is

basically of the Sidrauski-Brock type, in which Ricardian equivalence results are

normally obtained, i.e., results implying that bond-financial tax changes have no effect on

the price level or other macroeconomic variables of primary interest.21 In such a setting,

fiscalist positions are truly startling.

        As a background for illustrating these drastic results, let us begin with an

orthodox analysis of price level determination in an extremely simple and transparent

setting. Suppose that the (per capita) money demand function for a closed economy is of

the textbook form

(11)    mt – pt = c0 + c1yt + c2Rt + vt                          c1 > 0, c2 < 0,




19
    In what follows, I shall for brevity often refer to the latter as the “fiscal” or “fiscalist”
theory.
20
    Thus the theory is quite different from that of Sargent and Wallace (1981).
21
     For an analysis of this model, see McCallum (1984).


                                               19
where mt, pt, and yt are logs of the (base) money stock, price level, and output (income)

for period t, while Rt denotes a one-period nominal interest rate. The disturbance vt is

taken for simplicity to be white noise. It is well known that there are rigorous dynamic

general equilibrium models with optimizing agents that will justify (11) as an

approximation to a combination of implied Euler equations (first-order conditions).22

The present exposition is intended to convey the essential features of a full optimizing

analysis while ignoring some of the details.

          Furthermore, let us assume that the economy is one in which output and the real

rate of interest are constant over time. Then (11) collapses to

(12)      mt – pt = γ + α (Etpt+1 – pt) + vt                    α = c2,

which is the familiar Cagan specification for money demand. And let us consider cases

in which the growth rate of the (base) money stock is kept constant by the central bank,

so that

(13)      mt = mt-1 + µ,

where µ is the growth rate of the money stock. These relations plus rational expectations

determine the behavior of pt and mt for time periods t = 1,2,…. It is possible that the

structure was different prior to period 1.

          In this setting, the orthodox bubble-free or “fundamentals” rational expectations

(RE) solution for pt can be found by conjecturing that it is of the form

(14)      pt = φ0 + φ1mt-1 + φ2vt,

since mt-1 and vt are evidently the system’s only state variables. In that case we have

Etpt+1 = φ0 + φ1(mt-1 + µ) so substitution of the latter, (13), and (14) into (12) yields


22
       See, for example, Woodford (1995) or McCallum and Nelson (1999).


                                               20
(15)    mt-1 + µ = γ + α [φ0 + φ1(mt-1 + µ)] + (1-α) [φ0 + φ1mt-1 + φ2vt] + vt.

The latter implies that for (14) to be a solution, i.e., to hold for all realizations of vt and

mt-1, we must have satisfaction of the undetermined-coefficient (UC) conditions

(16)    1 = αφ1 + (1-α) φ1

        0 = (1-α) φ2 + 1.

        µ = γ + αφ1µ + (1-α) φ0 + αφ0

Thus we have that φ1 = 1, φ2 = - 1/(1-α) and φ0 = µ - γ - αµ, i.e., the solution is

(17)    pt = µ (1-α) - γ + mt-1 – 1/(1-α)vt

          = mt – (γ + αµ) – vt/(1-α).

        Here we see that pt grows one-for-one with mt, i.e., the price level Pt moves on

average in proportion to the money stock Mt, but fluctuates around this average position

in response to realizations of vt, with pt being temporarily reduced by positive money

demand shocks (vt > 0) or boosted by negative shocks (vt < 0). This is clearly an entirely

traditional—one might even say “monetarist”—analysis of price level behavior in the

economy in question.

        Now for an even simpler special case, let us suppose that the money growth rate is

zero, i.e., that µ = 0 so that mt = m. Then the solution for pt is

(18)    pt = m - γ - vt/(1-α).

And, finally, if money demand shocks were absent we would have pt = m - γ.

        It must be noted, however, that while (17) and its special case (18) give the well-

behaved, orthodox, bubble-free RE solutions for this model, there are other expressions

as well that satisfy the model (12)(13) with RE. For simplicity, let us consider the special

case with constant mt = m, but now conjecture a solution of the form


                                               21
(19)   pt = ψ0 + ψ1 pt-1 + ψ2vt + ψ3vt-1,

instead of pt = φ0 + φ2vt. Then working through the same type of analysis as before, one

finds that the UC conditions analogous to (16) are

(20)   0 = α ψ12 + (1-α) ψ1

       0 = α ψ1 ψ2 + α ψ3 + (1-α) ψ2 + 1

       0 = α ψ1 ψ3 + (1-α) ψ3

       m = γ + α ψ0 + α ψ1 ψ0 + (1-α) ψ0.

We see, now, that the first of these has two roots ψ1(1) = 0 and ψ1(2) = (α-1)/α. If the

former is the relevant root, then we find that ψ3 = 0, ψ2 = -1/(1-α), and ψ0 = m - γ so that

the same expression as in (18) is obtained. But if ψ1(2) is relevant, then ψ3 = -1/α and ψ0

= (m -γ)/α while any value of ψ2 is possible. So an infinity of solution paths is consistent

with the model. Note, however, that ψ1(2) = (α-1)/α > 1.0, so most of these solution paths

are explosive.

       Of course there are other variables and conditions besides those discussed thus far

in a fully articulated model of the economy under discussion. As for conditions, it is

typically true that a fully-specified optimizing analysis would require that



(21)   lim       Et βj Mt+j/Pt+j = 0,
       j→∞

i.e., that a transversality condition pertaining to real money balances must be satisfied.

Here β is a typical agent’s discount factor, β = 1/(1+ρ), with ρ > 0 and therefore

0 < β < 1. Similarly, if one of the economy’s assets is government bonds, then another

condition necessary for individual optimality would be



                                             22
(22)     lim      Et βj Bt+j/Pt+j = 0,
         j→∞

Bt+1 being the number of bonds purchased by an agent at t for the price 1/(1+Rt) and

redeemed for one unit of money in t + 1.

         We are now at last prepared to turn to the fiscalist theory. With government

bonds recognized, we could write the consolidated23 government budget constraint in per

capita terms as

(23)     Pt (gt – txt) = Mt+1 – Mt + (1 + Rt)-1 Bt+1 –Bt,

where gt and txt are real government purchases and (lump sum) tax collections,

respectively, in per-capita terms. In real terms, this constraint could then be written as

(24)     gt – txt = (Mt+1 – Mt)/Pt + (1 +Rt)-1 (Pt+1/Pt) bt+1 - bt,

where bt = Bt/Pt. Please note the mixed notation being utilized: bt = Bt/Pt whereas mt =

log Mt and pt = log Pt. Condition (24) obtains for t = 1,2,….

         Now consider the special case of the economy discussed above in which mt and

Mt are constant. Also let the random shock vt be absent so that Pt+1 is correctly

anticipated in t. Then with the real rate of interest rt defined by 1 + rt = (1 + Rt)/(1 + πt)

where πt = (Pt+1 – Pt)/Pt, and with rt = ρ as would be implied by optimizing behavior in

the absence of shocks,24 the government budget constraint becomes

(25)     bt+1 = (1 + ρ) bt + (1 + ρ) (gt – txt)                       t = 1,2,….

But since 1 + ρ > 1.0, if gt – txt is stationary (e.g., constant), the latter reveals a strong

tendency for bt to explode as time passes. As t grows without limit, bt grows at the rate ρ,




23
     The government consists of a fiscal authority and a central bank.
24
      See, e.g., McCallum (1998).


                                                  23
i.e., behaves like (1+ρ)t. Thus the transversality condition (22) tends not to be satisfied

since growth of bt just precisely offsets the shrinkage of βt = 1/(1 + ρ)t, yielding a limit

that is a positive constant.

        In fact, in this case there are just two paths for bt that, with gt – txt constant, will

satisfy (25) and also (22) for t = 1,2,…. One of these obtains if the value b1 equals

–(1 + ρ) (g – tx)/ρ, for then (25) implies that

(26)    b2 = (1 + ρ) [-(1 + ρ) (g-tx)/ρ] + (1 + ρ) (g – tx)

           = (1 + ρ) (g – tx) [-(1+ρ)/ρ + 1] = (1 + ρ) (tx – g) /ρ

and that same value prevails in all succeeding periods. But b1 = B1/P1, and B1 is the

number of nominal government bonds outstanding at the beginning of the initial period, t

= 1. Thus if the price level in this first period, P1, adjusts to equal the value P1 =

B1ρ/(1 + ρ) (tx – g), then condition (22) as well as (25) will be satisfied. Indeed, this is

precisely what the fiscalist theory predicts: P1 adjusts relative to B1 and g – tx so as to

satisfy the individual agents’ optimality condition (22).

        But what about the necessary condition for money holdings, equation (12)? Well,

the fiscalist answer is that although the path just described will not conform to the pt =

m - γ fundamentals solution implied by (18), it can and will satisfy the alternative

solution pt = [(α - 1)/α] pt-1 + (m - γ)/α for all t = 2,3,….25 The price level P1, and thus p1,

is determined by B1 and the b1 necessary to satisfy (22), and subsequent Pt, pt values are

given by (19) with ψ1 = (α - 1)/α. The price level is exploding as time passes, despite the

constant value of Mt, but all of the model’s equilibrium conditions including RE are


25
   It might be asked why this relation does not determine p1 in relation to p0. I am
unclear concerning the answer given by the proponents of the fiscal theory.


                                               24
satisfied nevertheless. Since Pt and Bt are growing at the same (explosive) rate, while Mt

is constant, the outcome is rightfully regarded as highly “fiscalist.”26

        Now let us consider the one other path of bt that will, with gt – txt constant, satisfy

(12) and also (22). It is that bt+1 = 0 for all t = 1,2,…. Clearly, this is satisfied with Bt+1 =

0 and in that case places no constraint on Pt values. Thus these are free to obey pt = m -

γ, as in (18). Therefore this solution is the orthodox or monetarist solution.27

        So we end up with two RE solutions that represent two competing hypotheses

regarding price level behavior in the hypothetical economy under study. It is an economy

in which the money stock is constant over time, all behavioral relations are constant, and

there are no stochastic disturbances impinging upon its agents or productive processes.

According to the monetarist hypothesis, the price level is constant through time at a value

that is proportional to the magnitude of the money stock, and no government bonds are

purchased by private agents.28 By contrast, the fiscalist hypothesis implies that, despite

the constant money stock, the bond stock and the price level both explode as time

passes—but without violating any optimality condition for private agents because the

initial price level adjusts relative to the initial bond stock so as to make the real bond


26
   There is a serious problem, however, with this solution: if tx – g < 0, then a negative
price level would be required for satisfaction of (25) by the assumed value of b1. This
problem is stressed by Buiter (1998, p. 20) and McCallum (1998, p. 8).
27
   It is not obvious how (25) is satisfied with Bt+1 = 0 when tx – g > 0. But in this case
the equilibrium condition BDt+1 ≤ BSt+1 is satisfied where bond supply bSt+1 satisfies (22)
and bond demand is bDt+1 = 0. Buiter (1998, p. 17) argues that the fiscalist assumptions
“violate the normal rules for constructing a well-posed general equilibrium model.” Also
see McCallum (1998, pp. 8-9).
28
    This does not necessarily imply that none are offered for sale by the government.




                                               25
stock equal the single non-zero value that will permit the stock of real bonds to remain

constant and the transversality condition (22) to be satisfied. Under this latter hypothesis,

the initial price level is proportional to the initial bond stock and the price level grows in

tandem with the bond stock.

        In the introduction to this section, it was stated that the section would include not

only a description of the fiscal theory of the price level but also an explanation of why I

believe it to be empirically invalid. The description that has been given pertains to only

one special case, and therefore fails to do justice to the richness of the fiscal proponents’

analysis. But the nature of this special case is such that I think no additional words are

needed to explain why I find it basically the less plausible of the two hypotheses under

consideration. 29

5. Conclusions

        Let us conclude with a brief overview of the paper’s arguments. The optimal

currency area concept is central to economic analysis of monetary unions, as it clearly

identifies the relevant optimizing tradeoff: extension of the area over which a single

currency is used enhances allocative efficiency but reduces the possibility of tailoring

monetary policy to the needs of different areas. Empirical work has verified the

importance of various features of economies that make them strong or weak candidates

for a common currency arrangement, but existing studies do not permit actual

quantification of costs and benefits of adopting a common currency. In that sense, the

OCA concept remains less than fully operational.




29
  A brief but somewhat more general discussion of the interaction of monetary and fiscal
policy strategies is included in McCallum (1999a).


                                              26
        Another relevant body of theory is that pertaining to currency crises. Formal

models clarify various points concerning speculative attacks on fixed exchange rates, and

show how abrupt reserve losses and depreciations can occur rationally at times when no

major shocks are present. These formal models also support the notion that a fixed (but

potentially adjustable) exchange regime is not a viable option for most nations, given

today’s mobility of financial capital. The reason, according to the theory, is that

speculative attacks can succeed even if there is no current policy inconsistency if

governments have other policy objectives that may at some date take priority over the

support of a fixed exchange rate.

        The third area discussed is the recently-developed fiscal theory of price level

determination. It is emphasized that this theory is drastically different than monetarist

orthodoxy; it does not contend that fiscal behavior drives an accommodative monetary

authority, but rather that the price level basically mimics the pattern of the government

bond stock outstanding rather than base money when their paths differ drastically. An

example is exposited in which there are two rational expectations solutions in an

economy with a constant money supply. The monetarist solution is that the price level is

also constant whereas the fiscalist theory implies that the bond stock and price level both

explode as time passes (without violation of any private optimality conditions). These

solutions may be viewed as competing hypotheses about the behavior of actual

economies, and the paper suggests that the monetarist hypothesis is the more likely to

prevail in actuality.
