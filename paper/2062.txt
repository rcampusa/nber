         The Effects of Fiscal Policies When Incomes are Uncertain:
                   A Contradiction to Ricardian Equivalence


                                    ABSTRACT


     This paper shows that when earnings are uncertain the substitution of

deficit finance for tax finance or the introduction of an unfunded social

security program will raise consumption even if all bequests reflect

intergenerational altruism. Thus, contrary to the theory developed by Barro

and a number of subsequent writers, an operative bequest motive need not imply

Ricardian equivalence.

     Since there is no uncertainty in the present analysis about the date of

each individual's death, this conclusion does not depend on imperfections in

annuity markets. Nor does it depend on the existence of non-lump-sum taxes

and other distortions. Rather it follows from the result derived in the paper

that, when an individuaPs future earnings are uncertain, his future bequest

is also uncertain and his consumption therefore rises more in response to an

increase in his current disposable income than to an equal present value

increase in the disposable income of his potential heirs.

          The Effects of Fiscal Policies When Incomes are Uncertain:
                   A Contradiction to Ricardian Equivalence


                              Martin Feldstein*


     This paper shows that when earnings are uncertain the substitution of

deficit finance for tax finance or the introduction of an unfunded social

security program will raise consumption even if all bequests reflect

intergenerational altruism. Thus, contrary to the theory developed by Barro

(1974) and a number of subsequent writers, an operative bequest motive need

not imply Ricardian equivalence. Since there is no uncertainty in the present

analysis about the date of each individual's death, this conclusion does not

depend on imperfections in annuity markets. Nor does it depend on the

existence of non-lump-sum taxes or other distortions. Rather it follows from

the result derived below that, when future earnings are uncertain, bequests

are also uncertain and that consumption therefore rises more in response to an

increase in current disposable income than to an equal present value increase

in the disposable income of the next generation.

     It is useful to begin with a summary of the reasoning to be developed in

this paper. The starting point of the analysis is the observation that the

level of earnings during the "second half" of an individual's working life

cannot be accurately predicted during the earlier years. This is particularly

important among individuals in managerial, entrepreneurial and professional

occupations who account for a relatively large share of all savings and

bequests. Because of this uncertainty, it is optimal for a younger individual

to save more than he would if his expected future income were known with
                                     —2—


certainty. The uncertainty about future income also implies that an

individual during the early stage of his life does not know whether he will

later want to make a bequest to his children if he can use an annuity to avoid

accidental bequests. But even if all bequests are intended and are motivated

only by intergenerational altruism, the uncertainty of the individual's future

income means that bequests are uncertain.

     This uncertainty of future bequests means that an individual is not

indifferent between receiving an additional dollar of income when he is young

and having his children later receive an amount with a present value of one

dollar. Similarly, a one dollar increase in his current disposable income

will increase his current consumption by more than a rise in his children's

income with a present value of one dollar. This in turn implies that a tax

cut financed by an increase in national debt that will be serviced by future

generations will raise current consumption. Similarly, an unfunded social

security program that promises a net transfer to the current generation from

future generations will also raise current consumption.

     Before presenting a formal proof of these propositions, I will review the

current state of the debate about Ricardian equivalence in the context of an

economy in which there is no uncertainty about individual incomes. This is

done in Section 1. The second section then presents a formal model of

consumption and bequest decisions of individuals whose earnings during the

second half of their working lives are uncertain. Section 3 uses this

analysis to examine the effects of fiscal policies that transfer income to the

current generation from the next generation. A numerical illustration is

presented in Section 4. There is then a brief concluding section.

1.   The Ricardian Equivalence Theorem


     Although several economists over the years noted the possibility that the

aggregate national debt might not be regarded as a net asset because of the

implied future debt obligation and therefore that a tax cut might not induce

an increase in consumption,1 it was Robert Barro (1974) who first presented an

explicit model in which finite-lived individuals who make bequests to the next

generation will completely offset any intergenerational lump-sum transfer

imposed by the government. In Barro's analysis, an individual chooses a path

of consumption and a bequest to the next generation by maximizing a utility

function that has as its arguments the individual's own annual consumption

amounts and the utility of the next generation. A current tax cut that is

matched by a rise in national debt that is serviced by taxes on future

generations does not change the opportunity set of the representative

individual. He can maintain his own consumption path and the utility level of

the next generation by saving the entire tax cut and bequeathing it (with

accumulated interest) to the next generation. This inheritance allows the

next generation to maintain its original consumption path and to provide a

bequest to its heirs that maintains that generation's utility level.     In

effect, the process of bequests makes the series of finite-lived individuals

act like an infinitely lived individual. With no change in the

infinite-horizon budget constraint, there is no reason to change consumption

at any date, thus establishing the equivalence of tax finance and debt

finance.

     One line of objection to this analysis (see, e.g., James Tobin, 1980, and
                                     —4—


Martin Feldstein, 1982) is that an operative bequest motive is relatively rare

because individuals believe that the marginal utility of their own retirement

consumption exceeds the marginal utility of bequests to their children.

Defenders of Ricardian equivalence reply that bequests are In fact relatively

common among the upper income groups that account for such a large share of

total wealth accumulation and point to the evidence of Laurence Kotlikoff and

Lawrence Summers (1981) that most existing wealth can be traced to bequests

rather than to life cycle accumulation.

     Andrew Abel (1985) and Zvi Eckstein, Martin Eichenbaum and Dan Peled

(1985) showed that the observation of substantial bequests does not imply an

operative bequest motive if the age at which death occurs is uncertain and an

annuity market does not exist. Moreover, in such an economy Ricardian

equivalence will be violated and fiscal policies will affect consumption.

However, annuity markets exist and, even with the less than actuarially fair

return estimated by Benjamin Friedman and Mark Warshawsky (1985), older

egoistic individuals will prefer annuities to accidental bequests.

     Although the observation of bequests in an economy with an annuity market

may therefore suggest that there is an operative altruistic bequest motive of

the type assumed by Barro, other types of bequest motives have been proposed

that do not imply Ricardian equivalence. Douglas Bernstein, Andre Schlaefer,

and Lawrence Summers (1986) note that bequests may be made for the "strategic"

purpose of maintaining the attention if not the actual affection of children

and grandchildren. Laurence Kotlikoff and Avia Spivak (1981) suggest that

bequests may be the result of an explicit or implicit contract between aged

parents and their children in which the parents agree to leave a bequest if
                                     —5—


they die before a certain age while the children agree to provide support if

the parents live beyond that age and therefore exhaust their assets.

Alternatively, individuals may make bequests because they regard themselves as

"stewards" of the funds that they inherited with a moral responsibility to

bequeath at least a similar amount to their own children. Each of these

models implies that a fiscal transfer from children to parents (i.e., a tax

cut or an increase in social security retirement benefits) will not be offset

by an equivalent increase in bequests.

     Economists will of course differ in the extent to which they accept the

strategic bequest, family annuity or stewardship theories as an explanation of

observed bequests. Although I believe that there is probably some truth in

each of these explanations, I doubt that they can explain the observed

bequests without reference also to intergenerational altruism. The

stewardship theory cannot explain the bequests of those who did not receive

inheritances. The family annuity theory may be relevant to some moderate

income individuals who are likely to exhaust their assets during retirement

but cannot be applied to the wealthy aged whose assets continue to increase as

they get older because their spending is less than their income. The

strategic bequest theory is more difficult to reject as the primary

explanation of observed bequests but is contrary to the persuasive "evidence"

of personal introspection as well as to the less reliable assertions of other

prospective donors. Moreover, as has been noted by Barro and others, these

other bequest motives have ambiguous implications about the direction of the

effect of fiscally imposed intergenerational transfers on current

consumption.

        Robert Barsky, Gregory Mankiw and Stephen Zeldes (1986) have shown how

the existence of non-lump-sum taxes on subsequent risky income can invalidate

Ricardian equivalence and cause a positive marginal propensity to consume out

of a deficit-financed increase in disposable income. Income taxes on risky

income reduce the variance of future net income, providing an otherwise

unavailable insurance to individuals that reduces precautionary savings and

increases current consumption. Barsky et. al. also show that an analagous

result holds when individuals live only one period but are uncertain about the

income that their heirs will earn. In that case, the non-lump-sum tax on

their heirs' income reduces its variance and therefore, by reducing the

expected marginal utility of such income to the initial generation, reduces

the desired bequest and increases current consumption. Their analysis is thus

fundamentally different from that of the current paper because they do not

consider the effect of an individual's own income uncertainty on his desired

level of bequests. Moreover, the non-lump-sum nature of the taxes that they

consider inevitably introduce a non-neutrality.

        Abel (1986) shows how a different type of non-lump-sum tax, a progressive

tax on bequests or capital, changes the relative cost of current consumption

and bequests and thus introduces an incentive to consume more at the present

time.

        The present paper shows that none of these departures from the original

Barro formulation is necessary to demonstrate that Ricardian equivalence is

false and that a fiscally mandated intergenerational transfer from the future

to the present implies an increase in current consumpton. To establish this,

I analyze a simple model in which all bequests are caused by intergenerational
                                     -.7—




altruism (i.e. there are no accidental bequests due to an uncertain time of

death and the strategic11, family altruism and stewardship motives for

bequests are ignored). All taxes and transfers are lump sum. The only

difference from the traditional model is that individuals in the first half of

their working lives are uncertain about their earnings in the second half.



2.   A Life Cycle Model with Uncertain Earnings


     This section extends the traditional life cycle model with bequests by

recognizing the inherent uncertainty of income in later years.2 Since the

purpose of this paper is to demonstrate a contradiction to Ricardian

equivalence in a model in which all bequests are motivated by explicit

intergenerational altruism, the model analyzed here is a very simple one that

serves this purpose rather than a more realistic model designed to explore the

response of aggregate consumption, capital accumulation, and bequests to

variations in the stochastic properties and predictability of lifetime

income.3

     Consider therefore a model in which the individual lives two periods. In

the first period he works a fixed amount and receives a certain income

which includes any bequest that he receives. In the second period he also

works a fixed amount but earns an amount y2 that cannot be predicted during

the first period of life. The second period of life also contains a fixed

interval of retirement before death at a known time. Since the amount of work

1n the first and second periods and the duration of retirement are all fixed,

these quantities need not be specified explicitly. Moreover, the assumption
                                       —8-


of a known date of death is equivalent to assuming the existence of

actuarially fair annuities. Finally, there is no need to distinguish between

consumption during the working years of the second period and the

retirement years because the analysis here focuses on the way that fiscal

transfers affect consumption during the first period when subsequent Income is

unknown.

     The individual's utility depends on his consumption during the first and

second periods of his life and on the utility of his children. The essential

features of the intergenerational bequest model that establishes Ricardian

equivalence when income is not stochastic can be captured by assuming that the

next generation is the final one: the children of the current generation

make no bequests and bear the full burden of any fiscal transfer to the

current generation. The utility of the children can therefore be written as a

function of their own consumption. In the current context, replacing this

specification with an infinite horizon model with each generation linked to

the next through the parents' utility function would only complicate the

analysis without changing anything essential.

     The simplest specification of the stochastic nature of second period

income is that the individual receives a fixed amount      with probability p
and receives zero with probability 1 -   p.   It will also eliminate unnecessary

notation without changing anything fundamental to assume that the interest

rate is zero.

     In the first period of life, the individual chooses first period

consumption (c1) to maximize expected utility. In the second period, the

individual observes either y2 =   or   y2 = 0 and, conditional on that
                                        —9-


observation, chooses second period consumption (c2) and a non-negative bequest

(B ) 0) to maximize utility subject to the budget constraint

yl -   Cl   +   = c2 + B.
       Since this generation's utility is a function of the expected utility of

the next generation, some comments about the next generation are in order. In

its first period, the next generation receives income z1 plus the bequest B

from this generation. In its second period, the next generation receives

income Z with robabilitv D and zero with Drobabilitv 1 -           o.   Since the next

generation makes no bequest, its utility is a function of its own path of

consumption and its maximum expected utility can be written as a function of

the parameters of its stochastic budget constraint: •(z1÷B,Z2,p).

       It will be convenient to restate this with the uncertain second period

income replaced by its certainty equivalent (x2) defined by the condition that

the maximum expected utility that is possible with the parameters z1 + B,
                                                                          Z2
and p is equal to the maximum utility that the individual would obtain subject

to the nonstochastic budget constraint that lifetime consumption is not

greater than z1 + B +   x2.   Thus q(z1+B,Z2,p) =
                                                    J,(z1+B+x2).   Since bequests are

added to the nonstochastic first period income (z1) in both specifications,

the substitution of the certainty equivalent does not alter the conclusions of

the analysis.

       With these assumptions, the first period problem of an individual in the

current generation is to choose c1 to maximize E[u(c1,c2,4,(z1+B+x2))] knowing

that in the second period he will choose c2 and B to maximize

u(c,c2,js(z1+B+x2)) where c? is the value of c1 chosen in period 1. Note that

a positive bequest will be chosen at time 2 only if u3' > u2 at B = 0, i.e.,

if the marginal utility of the first dollar of bequest exceeds the marginal
                                                   -10-


utility of an additional dollar of consumption when the bequest level is zero.

The interesting case explored below is the one in which this condition holds

when y2 =      but   does not hold when y2 =                0, i.e., when the bequest is made
only when the second period income exceeds its expected value.

      To derive explicit parametric and numerical results, I assume that the

utility function is log-linear:


(1)         E(u) =   in     c1 +   E(in   c2 +   aln(z1+B+x2)]

where a reflects the weight that the current generation assigns to the

logarithm of the certainty equivalent income of their prospective heirs. To

find the value of C1 that maximizes expected utility, the individual must

follow the stochastic dynamic programming principle of solving the second

period problem first and then using the optimal conditional values of c2 and B

to find the optimal value of c1. From the vantage point of the second period,

c1 is fixed at c and c2, B must be chosen to maximize in c2 +
                                                                                    aln(z1+B+x2)
subject to the budget constraint y1 +
                                                       V2
                                                            -
                                                                c c
                                                                 =    + B if y2 =
                                                                                    V   or the

constraint y1 -
                    c   =
                            c2
                                 + B if y2 =      0.

      A positive bequest will be optimal if and only if

                1                    a
(2)                0<
            y1+y2-c1 zl+x2
i.e., if the marginal utility of c2 evaluated at B = 0 is less than the marginal

utility of increased second generation income, also evaluated at B =                      0.     The

only interesting case in the current analysis is the one in which a bequest is

optimal when y2 = V2 but not optimal when y2 = 0:
                                                            —11-

This case will be assumed in the analysis that follows.4

       Thus y2 = 0 implies B* = 0 and c =                              C? while y2 = V2 implies that 8*
                                                                 y1-
maximizes in c2 + aln(z1+B+x2) subject to the constraint that

C2 + B =         +        —              The first order condition is
           y1                  c?.

and implies


(5)         B* + z1 +                =
                                          1       (yi+Y2+zi+x2—c?)


and


(6)         c =       1


Thus when second period income is high enough to make a positive bequest

optimal, the available resources of the two generations are divided in the

ratio a to 1 implied by the parameters of the utility function.

       These conditional values of B and c2 can now be substituted into equation

(1) with probability weights p and 1 -                       p   to derive the optimal value of c1.

Thus


(7)        E(u) =         in   c1 + p(1n(1+a1(Y1+Y2+z1+x2—c1)
                      + aln(a/1+a)(y1+Y2+z1+x2-c1)]

                      + (1—p)(ln(y1—c1) + aln(z1+x2)].
                                               —12—


The first order condition for the optimal value of c1 is thus:

 8
            1        -          p(1+a)                1 - p

            c y1+Y2+z1+x2-c y1-c
or, equivalently, the quadratic equation:


(9)         (2i-pa)c!2 —       ((2—p)(yl+Y2+zl+x2) + (1+p+pa)y ]c*

                             + y1(y1+Y2+z1+x2) =   0.


       Before analyzing the implications of (9) for the effects of fiscal

policy, it is useful to derive the optimal consumption and bequests in the

same model but without the uncertainty of second period income. If the

individual knows with certainty at the beginning of his life that his second

period income will be pY2 (i.e., the mean of the uncertain distribution), he

will choose c1, c2 and B to maximize ln c1 + in C2 + ain(z1+x2+B) subject to

the budget constraint c1 + c2 + B =
                                              y1 + pY2 and the non—negativity constraint
on bequests (B            0). This implies the optimal values

                         y1 + pY2 + z1 + x
            c* =
(10)            1               2+a
                         y1 + pV2 + z1 + x
            c** =
(11)
                2              2+a

                                    a(y1+pY2+z1+x2)
(12)
            B**+z1+x2=                   2+a
as long as the implied value of B             0. If the desired bequest is negative,

the constraint is binding and the optimum consumption is simply

Cr =   cr   =
                    (y1 + pY2)/2.

3.       The Effects of Fiscal Policies


     -
         We   are now ready to analyze how recognizing the uncertainty of second

period income alters the effects of fiscal policy. Consider therefore a tax

cut that raises the first period disposable income of the initial generation

(y1) and increases the national debt that must be repaid by reducing the first

period disposable income of their children (z1). Since the interest rate is

assumed equal to zero, the debt repayment is equal to the initial tax cut:

dy1 = dz1.

         Equation (10) shows that in the case of certainty this fiscal policy has

no effect on the first period consumption of the initial generation: dc1 = 0

because c1 depends only on the combined endowment of both generations

(y1 + pY2 + z1 +       x2) and that is unaffected by increasing y1 and decreasing
z1 by equal amounts. This is the fundamental Ricardian equivalence result of

Barro.

         In contrast, equation (9) shows that when the uncertainty of second

period income is recognized a fiscal change that raises y1 and reduces z1 by

an equal amount will not leave c1 unchanged. More specifically, a tax cut

that raises y1 but leaves y1 +                          unchanged will raise first period
                                                   z1
consumption. To see this, note that the solution to equation (9) can be

written as5


                     Q -                -
                           /Qa2              4(2+pa)(y1+Y2+z1+x2)y1
(13)           c =                            2(2+pa)

where Q =
                (2-p)(y1+Y2+z1+x2)
                                               +
                                                   (1+p+pa)y1

that, with y1 +            +        +
                      V2       z1           x2 constant,

the    right hand side of (15) since for any p < 1, 2 + a > 1 + p + pa and

pY2 < 2• Moreover, the existence of second period income uncertainty

increases precautionary saving in the first period and therefore implies that

c < Cr. Since c < Cr and cr < (y1+V2+z1+x2)/(1+p+pa), inequality (15) is

satisfied and therefore dc1/dy > 0; a tax cut balanced by a tax increase on

the next generation raises current spending.

        Before pursuing the formal analysis any further, it is desirable to ask

why income uncertainty causes Ricardian equivalence to fail. When

second period income is uncertain, the individual does not know at the time

that he chooses c1 whether he will ultimately want to make a bequest. If he

knew with certainty that he was not going to make a bequest, the extra tax

borne by the next generation would be irrelevant to him and he could divide

his tax cut between his own consumption in the first and second periods. More

generally, the individual raises his first period consumption (although by

less than the increase in disposable income), knowing that with probability

1 - p he will not want to make a bequest and will raise his second period

consumption by the remainder. With probability p the individual will have
                                             —15-


high income in the second period, will therefore choose to make a bequest, and

will use some of his additional first period saving to make a larger bequest

than he would otherwise have made. Nevertheless, the tax cut raises total

consumption of the initial generation and reduces total consumption of the

next generation even when a bequest is made.

       To see this explicitly, note that equation (5) implies that, when a

bequest is to be made, an increase in y1 and an equal decrease in z1 implies

that the next generation's consumption is reduced by a fraction of the induced

consumption:


            d(B*+z +x2)                     a dc*
(16)                               =   -
                dy1                        1+ady
                          B* > 0


Since there is no offsetting change in bequest when y2 = 0 and B* =           0,   the average

chan9e in second generation income In response to a current tax cut financed

by a tax increase on the second generation is

            d(B*+z1+x2) =       a      dc1 + (1—p)].
(17)                      —(p 1 +
                dy1


       The analysis of social security retirement benefits is essentially

identical in the current context to the analysis of the tax cut. Consider a

program that pays a sure benefit           to the current generation In its

second period and finances this by a tax of          on the income    of the next

generation. When there is no income uncertainty, the social security program

raises second period income to p?2 +          and reduces the next generation's initial

earnings to 21 -   , leaving   c!* in equation (10) unchanged. In the case of

uncertain second period income, the payment of a sure second period benefit is

analytically identical to a tax cut. To see this, note that y2 = 0 now implies
                                               —16-


     =
         y1- c +    so that the payment of the second period benefit is the same

as an increase in first period income if it induces the same c?. Similarly,

when y2 = Y2, the individual maximizes in c2 +                          subject to the
                                                        a1n(z1-+B+x2)
constraint that C2 + B =          +        +   — c?; this is also identical to the
                             y1       V2

effect of a tax cut that increases y1 and decreases z1 as long as it yields

the same c. To see that the optimal first period consumption is indeed the

same, note that the expression to be maximized in equation (7) is modified in

exactly the same way by the social security program as it would be by a

tax-induced rise in y1 and reduction in z1. Thus a social security program

has the same effect of increasing first generation consumption and reducing

the second generation's subsequent consumption as an equal—sized

intergenerational transfer achieved by a tax cut.6



4.       A Numerical Illustration


         A numerical example will illustrate the potential effect of income

uncertainty on consumption, on bequests, and on the impact of fiscal policy.

The specific example is obviously arbitrary but indicates the potential

importance of income uncertainty. In the example, the marginal propensity to

consume out of the tax-induced increase in disposable income is almost as

large as the average propensity to consume.

         Since the results are essentially independent of the Units of

measurement, I set first period income equal to unity: y1 = 1.            With p =   0.5
and V2 =     2, the expected value of second period income is also one. The
economic specification is completed by setting the next generation's first
                                                       —17—


period income and second period certainty equivalence income both equal to one

as well: z1 = x2            =    1.   The analysis will be done for two alternative values

of the intergenerational altruism parameters: a =                      1    and a =   3.

           Consider first the case in which there is no uncertainty. Second period

income is pY2 = 1 and is known with certainty. From equation (12), the

optimal bequest is B** =               max(4a/(2+a)-2,0].       Thus with a = 1 the individual

gives too little weight to the next generation to make any bequest and

       =    0.    In this case the individual consumes all of his income in each

period: Cr =            q* = 1.0.          With a =   3, there is enough weight on the next
generation's welfare to induce a bequest: B** =                     0.4 and cr =           c* = 0.8.
        When second period income is uncertain, the optimal value of c1 is given

by equation (13). With a = 1,                 c = 0.6311      while a = 3 implies ct =         0.5937.
In both cases, first period consumption is substantially less than it would be

if the same expected second period income could be anticipated with certainty.

This reflects both the precautionary demand for saving (against the risk that

   =    0) and the saving for subsequent bequests (if y2 = 2).
           If y2 =    0, the individual will choose to make no bequest with a =                   1 or

with a =         3.   In contrast, if y2 = 2 the individual will choose a bequest of

8* = 0.1844 with a = 1 and 8* = 1.3047 with a =                   3.       Thus with a = 1 the income

uncertainty increases the average bequest from B = 0 to pB* = 0.0922 and

with a = 3 the income uncertainty increases the average bequest from

       = 0.40 to p8* =           0.6524.
        Consider now the effect of a fiscal policy that increases the initial

generation's first period disposable income from y1 =                        1.0   to y1 =   1.1 and
reduces the corresponding disposable income of the next generation from

   =    1.0      to z1 =   .9.    This raises the first period consumption from
                                           -18-



c = 0.6311    with a = 1 and y1 =   1.0   to c! =        0.6896 with a =   1   and y1 =   1.1;
the increase of 0.0585 implies a marginal propensity to consume out of the

fiscal transfer of 0.585, almost as high as the initial average propensity to

consume of 0.631. Similarly, with a = 3, first period consumption rises from

c = 0.5937 to c = 0.6434,       implying a marginal propensity to consume out of

the fiscal transfer 0.497, approximately 85 percent of the average propensity

to consume.

     The fiscal transfer induces an increased bequest, although not a large

enough increase to maintain the consumption of the next generation. This is

true even if attention is limited to the case in which y2 = 2 so that a

bequest is made. For example, with a =          1   the bequest when y2 = 2 rises from

B* = 0.1844 to B* = 0.2552 but the increased bequest of 0.0708 is less than

the increased tax of 0.10 paid by the next generation. Moreover, the fiscal

transfer only raises the average bequest from 0.5(0.1844)                  0.0922 to

0.5(0.2552) =   0.1276, an increase of 0.0354 in comparison to the universal tax
rise of 0.1000. Similarly, with a =        3,   the bequest when y2 = 2 rises from

B* = 1.3047 with y1 =   1.0   to B* =   1.3674 when y1 = 1.1.         The increased bequest

(0.0627) is slightly smaller then with a =           1    and offsets less than two—thirds

of the tax increase even among those who receive a bequest. More generally,

the average bequest rises from 0.5(1.3047) = 0.6524 to 0.5(1.3674) =                  0.6837,
a rise of 0.0313 or less than one-third of the average tax increase.

5.   Concluding Comment


     This paper has shown that the inability of individuals to predict

accurately their subsequent earnings implies that fiscal transfers from future

generations to the current generation will raise current consumption. Thus

earnings uncertainty is incompatible with Ricardian equivalence. The

individual's uncertainty of his future income also reduces consumption and

increases the probability and expected size of bequests.

     Unlike the uncertainty that arises because the time of death is unknown,

the unpredictability of individual future income cannot be avoided even in

principle by an annuity market or other insurance market. The uncertainty of

personal earnings Is unavoidable because of the moral hazard problem involved

in trying to insure individual earnings.

     The very simple model developed in this paper can demonstrate the

potential importance of earnings uncertainty and the general inapplicability

of Ricardian equivalence. It would be desirable to extend this analysis to a

more realistic specification of uncertainty and to analyze the implications

for capital accumulation, income distribution and fiscal policy in an infinite

horizon model.

Miller and C. Upton (1974).    It is not clear whether David Ricardo actually

believed this to be true; see Ricardo (1951) and Gerald O'Driscoll (1977).

2.   Although there have been several analyses of life cycle models with

uncertain income and asset returns (see, e.g., Agnar Sandmo (1970), Jacques

Dreze and Franco Modigliani (1972) and Robert Barsky, Gregory Mankiw and

Stephen Zeldes (1986)), these have not dealt with the relation between income

uncertainty and bequests.

3.   For such an analysis, see Feldstein (1987).

4.   The case where a bequest is always optimal corresponds to the original

Barro analysis despite the income uncertainty while the case where a bequest

is never optimal is contrary to the observation that individuals do make

bequests.

5.   This is the only feasible solution of the quadratic equation; adding

instead of subtracting the square root expression implies a value of c1

greater than initial income.

6.   This assumes that the size of the second period benefit is not so large

that the individual wants to consume more than his entire first period income.

In this case, it is still true that the benefit increases first period

consumption but by less than the rise that would result from an equally large

tax reduction.
