                                            ABSTRACT

This paper re-examines aggregate and disaggregate import and export demand functions for the
United States. This re-examination is warranted because (1) income elasticities are too high to be
warranted by standard theories, and (2) remain high even when it is assumed that supply factors are
important. These findings suggest that the standard models omit important factors. An empirical
investigation indicates that the rising importance of vertical specialization combined with decreasing
tariffs rates explains some of results. Accounting for these factors yields more plausible estimates
of income elasticities, as well as smaller prediction errors.

1. Introduction

       This analysis is inspired by both current events – the widening of the trade deficit

as a proportion of GDP, illustrated in Figure 1 – and recent findings of the persistence of

the Houthakker-Magee results, namely that the income elasticity of U.S. imports exceeds

that of exports. Over the past 30 years, the gap is at least 0.3 for total goods and services,

regardless of the method of estimation. In Chinn (2005), the gap is as high as 0.65. Table

1 presents estimates obtained from OLS, dynamic OLS, single equation error correction

estimates and the Johansen maximum likelihood procedures. Furthermore, there is little

evidence that the asymmetry is disappearing. Breaking the last 30 years into three equal

sub-periods, one obtains the income elasticities in Figure 2. In other words, the

asymmetry is proving to be quite durable.

       In addition, the absolute values of the income elasticities are quite high. In Table

1, the income elasticities are as high as 2.3 for imports, and 2.0 for exports. These large

elasticities are difficult to reconcile with the standard differentiated goods model (see

Goldstein and Khan, 1985). From a forecasting standpoint, high income elasticities1 are

not troubling; but – as discussed below – from an economic perspective, they are

perplexing.2 Finally, the behavior of trade flows during 1999-2000 is difficult to explain

using standard models. As illustrated in Figure 3, both series surge in this period.

       In this paper, I re-investigate the behavior of export and import flows, motivating

the analysis by referring to new theories of trade behavior. These include differentiated

goods models such as those forwarded by Krugman (1991). Such approaches yield some

insights. In this paper, I adopt a different approach. Disaggregating the data, one finds

that some of the odd behavior of goods exports and imports can be isolated to the peculiar

behavior of capital goods; since such goods are often used to manufacture other capital

goods or consumer goods, it seems that growth in such categories is blowing up the

volume of such trade flows. Various papers have pointed out that the growth of such

trade may be nonlinearly related to the decline in trade flows and the heightened

importance of capital expenditures during certain phases of the business cycle. More

recently, Mann (2005) has argued that disaggregation along category line and trading

partner helps in obtaining reasonable parameter estimates.

       Once one includes the variables that one thinks should matter for such vertical

specialization, the parameter estimates become more plausible. That being said, the

parameter estimates for the auxiliary variables are not always in the expected direction or

statistically significant, and the results cannot be construed as definitive. In addition, the

estimates based upon disaggregated data yield less biased estimates of the long run

equilibrium levels of imports.



2. The Standard Model and the Supply Side

2.1 The model specification

The empirical specification is motivated by the traditional, partial equilibrium view of

trade flows. Goldstein and Khan (1985) provide a clear exposition of this “imperfect

substitutes” model. To set ideas consider the algebraic framework similar to that used by

Rose (1991). Demand for imports in the US and the Rest-of-the-World (RoW) is given

by:




                                               3
         US
        Dim = f 1US (Y US , PimUS )                                   (1)

        DimRoW = f 1RoW (Y RoW , PimRoW )                             (2)

where Pim is the price of imports relative to the economy-wide price level. The supply of

exports is given by:

        S exUS = f 2US ( PexUS , Z US )                               (3)

        S exRoW = f 2RoW ( PexRoW , Z RoW )                           (4)

Where Pex is the price of exports relative to the economy-wide price level. Note that the

price of imports into the US is equal to the price of foreign exports adjusted by the real

exchange rate.

        PimUS × P US = E × PexRoW × P RoW     PimUS = QPexRoW         (5)

where E is the nominal exchange rate in US$ per unit of foreign currency, the real

exchange rate is

           EP RoW
        Q=
            P US

where P represents the aggregate level of prices of domestically produced goods and

services. Z is a supply shift variable, representing the productive capacity of the

exportables sector.

       An analogous equation applies for imports into the rest-of-the-world. Imposing

the equilibrium conditions that supply equals demand, one can write out import and




                                                4
export equations (assuming log-linear functional forms, where lowercase letters denote

log values of upper case):3

        imt = β0 + β1q t + β2 y tUS + β3 z RoW + ε 2 t                        (6)

        ex t = δ 0 + δ1q t + δ 2 y tRoW + δ 3 z US + ε1t                      (7)

Where    1   < 0,   2   > 0,   3   > 0 and   1   > 0,   2   > 0,   3   > 0.

        Notice that exports are the residual of production over domestic consumption of

exportables; similarly imports are the residual of foreign production over foreign

consumption of tradables. The difference between this specification and the standard is

the inclusion of the exportables supply shift variable, z. In standard import and export

regressions, this term is omitted, implicitly holding the export supply curve fixed; in

other words, it constrains the relationship between domestic consumption of exportables

and production of exportables to be constant (see Helkie and Hooper, 1988 for an

exception to this rule). A bout of consumption at home that reduces the supply available

for exports would induce an apparent structural break in the equation (6) if the z term is

omitted. Similarly, omission of the rest-of-world export suppy term from the import

equation makes the estimated relationships susceptible to structural breaks.

        Note that the supply term here is explicitly partial equilibrium in nature. Unlike

the Krugman (1991) model, where balanced trade implies supply creates its own demand,

no specific presumptions are made regarding the source of this supply effect.




 3
   As Marquez (1994) has pointed out, there are a number of problems with this
specification, in terms of assumptions regarding expenditure shares. A number of other
potentially important factors are also omitted, including other trend factors (e.g,
immigration as in Marquez (2002) or the rise of services exports as in Mann (1999)).



                                                             5
       The problem, of course, is obtaining good proxies for these supply terms. Obvious

candidates, such as US industrial production for US exports, exhibits too much

collinearity with rest-of-world GDP) to identify the supply effect precisely.4 That is why

this supply factor has typically been identified in panel cross section analyses (Bayoumi,

2003; Gagnon, 2004).

2.2 Data and Estimation

       Data on real imports and exports of goods and services (2000 chain weighted

dollars) were obtained for the 1967q1-2005q2 period (July 2005 release). Domestic

economic activity was measured by U.S. GDP in 2000 chain weighted dollars. Foreign

economic activity was measured by real Rest-of-World GDP, weighted by U.S. exports

to major trading partners. The Federal Reserve Board’s broad trade weighted value of the

dollar is used. This index uses the CPI as the deflator. Additional details on all these

variables are contained in Appendix 1.

       Estimation is implemented on data spanning a period of 1975q1-2005q1 (I drop

the preliminary estimate for GDP in 2005q2). This period spans three episodes of dollar

appreciation and three episodes of dollar depreciation; the broad measure of dollar is

used, as opposed to the major currencies measure, which as has been pointed out in

recent reports, is unrepresentative of relative prices faced by the U.S. import competing

sector in recent years (see Figure 4).




 4
   In addition, industrial production is in some sense too “endogenous” a variable to
include in the regression. An alternative is to obtain capital stock measures as a measure
of the supply capacity of exportables, as in Helkie and Hooper (1988). The question is
whether these variables are measured with too much error, especially to the extent that
we want to capture the impact of the newly industrializing countries and China.



                                              6
         The cointegrating relationship is identified using dynamic OLS (Stock and

Watson, 1993). Two leads and four lags of the right hand side variables are included. In a

simple two variable cointegrating relationship, the estimated regression equation is:
                               −4
         yt = γ 0 + γ 1 xt +   i = +2
                                        Γi ∆x t + i + ut

Although this approach presupposes that there is only one long run relationship, this

requirement is not problematic, as in these extended samples at least one cointegrating

vector is usually detected.



2.3 Empirical Results

First we consider equations (6) and (7) suppressing the z terms. The long run elasticities

are reported in Table 2. The income elasticity for total exports of goods and services is

1.90 (Column [1]). This finding is not an artifact of the inclusion of services. In fact, the

goods only elasticity is 1.96 (Column [3]). A similar result obtains for imports. As

reported in Table 3, Column [1], total imports of goods and services exhibit a long run

elasticity of 2.20.

         There is good reason to consider an import aggregate excluding petroleum. The

trade equations in (6) and (7) are derived from an imperfect substitutes model, well suited

to manufactured goods. However, oil is a natural resource commodity that does not

quickly respond to market signals, and exhibits trends due to resource depletion.

         Moreover, since Chinn (2005) findings of cointegration over the 1975q1-2001q2

period are sensitive to the inclusion of computers, I also consider an aggregate excluding

these two commodity classes.5 In this case (Column [3]), the income elasticity is barely

 5
     This procedure follows the lead of Lawrence (1990) and Meade (1991).


                                                           7
altered: 2.22. Finally, a goods imports ex petroleum series (Column [5]) exhibits an even

higher elasticity: 2.65.

        These results inform the debate over the durability of the Houthakker-Magee

(1969) findings. Exports respond between 1.9 to 2.0 percent for each one percentage

point increase in rest-of-world income. In contrast, imports rise about 2.2 to 2.7

percentage points for each percentage point increase in US GDP. This set of findings

suggests that the Houthakker-Magee income asymmetry persists. Hence, even if U.S. and

foreign growth rates were to converge, net exports would continue to deteriorate even

starting from balanced trade. Obviously, starting from an initial trade deficit, the

deterioration would be even more rapid.

        All of the preceding specifications exclude a role for the supply side, suggested by

Equations (6) and (7). As noted earlier, it is hard to find good measures of the supply

side. Helkie and Hooper (1988) used a measure of relative capital stocks; but it is hard to

think of how one would accurately estimate the relevant rest of the world capital stock,

especially with the entry of China.

        For exports, accounting for supply is fairly successful. In Table 2, when U.S.

industrial production is included, the export income elasticity falls from 2.0 to 1.1, with

the supply coefficient equal to close to unity (Column [7]). Unfortunately, this point

estimate is sensitive to the inclusion of a time trend (Column [8]). If one proxies the

supply of exports with U.S. GDP (and constrains the coefficients on supply and demand

to be equal), then one once again obtains a significant effect, close to unity, regardless of

whether a time trend is included or not (Columns [9] and [10]).




                                              8
         On the import side, the inclusion of supply side effects is less successful. In Table

3, Column [9], the import income elasticity rises to 2.92 from 2.60, with the coefficient

on industrial country industrial production equal to negative 0.40. This perverse finding

suggests that industrial country industrial production is not the correct proxy measure. A

better measure would probably incorporate LDC industrial production. Constraining the

coefficients on U.S. GDP and rest-of-world GDP to be equal yields more sensible

coefficients (Columns [11] and [12]). Unfortunately, in all these instances, the demand

and supply variables are so collinear that one can’t be certain of stability of the results.6

This is why cross-section and panel regressions such as Gagnon (2003) and Bayoumi

(2003) obtain more supportive evidence of supply side effects.



3. Vertical Specialization and Tariffs

One hint of why the income elasticities are so large is provided by the surge in both

exports and imports during 1999-2000. In informal discussions, this jump is associated

with the investment boom; the category experiencing the largest jump is capital goods.

         The fact that the surge and collapse occurred in both categories could be

coincidence – evidence of a worldwide investment boom. Or it could be a reflection that

the two are interlinked.

         Recent research has focused on the rise of intermediate goods in international

trade. However, intermediate goods are not in and of themselves sufficient to explain the

rise in trade. It is intermediate goods trade used to produce other traded goods – in other

words vertical specialization (Hummels, et al., 2001; Yi, 2003; Chen et al., 2005). This

6
    The slope coefficient of a regression of U.S. GDP on rest-of-world GDP is 0.93, with



                                               9
process of importing in order to export has also been termed “fragmentation” of

production (Arndt, 1997). At this juncture, it is useful to recognize that services exhibit

less of this fragmentation. This explains in part the differential import income elasticities:

2.65 for goods ex oil versus 1.70 for services.7

       Table 4 estimates the basic regressions specification (trade flow on income and

real exchange rate) for the trade flow ex capital goods and capital goods trade flows. For

the specifications excluding a time trend, goods exports ex capital goods (Column [1])

exhibit an income elasticity of 1.35 while capital goods exports (Column [3]) exhibit an

elasticity of 2.96. For imports, this pattern is repeated, but more sharply. The income

elasticity for total goods imports ex oil and capital goods is 1.87, while that for capital

goods is nearly 4.82, for specifications excluding time trends (Columns [5] and [7]). In

both cases, the trend-augmented specifications exhibit a similar, although less

pronounced, pattern.

       These findings suggest two not necessarily inconsistent conclusions. First, that it

is important to disaggregate goods exports and imports in order to model aggregate trade

flows. Second, if one is to model aggregate goods flows, one needs to include the

measures that have a specific impact on the capital goods portions.

       Figures 5 and 6 show how goods and goods excluding capital goods for exports

and imports respectively behave. Note that the series excluding capital goods exhibits

much less of a pronounced hump. Figure 7 illustrates how capital goods exports and

imports covary with investment in equipment and software, particularly in the 1999-2001



adjusted R2 over 0.99.
7
  Marquez (2005) obtains similar estimates, but points out that further disaggregation of
services leads to different insights on income and price elasticities.

                                              10
period. The importance of vertical specialization was suggested, particularly for hi-tech

goods, in analyses around the time of the capital goods surges (e.g., Council of Economic

Advisers, 2001, Chapter 4).

       The regression results in Column [1] of Table 5 indicate the impact of U.S.

investment in equipment and software on total goods exports: income now has unit

elastic impact, while investment has an elasticity of 0.57. Yi (2003) argues that

reductions in the tariff rate have induced large, non-proportionate, changes in the extent

of vertical specialization. To incorporate this factor, we augment the regression with the

(square of the) average tariff rate of the US, Europe and Japan. This variable does not

enter with the correct sign or statistical significance for total goods exports, while leaving

the other coefficients relatively unchanged (Column [2]).

       Interestingly, for goods exports ex capital goods (Column [3]), the tariff rate has

an incorrect and statistically significant coefficient estimate, while investment has a much

lower coefficient (although still statistically significant). When examining capital goods

exports (Column [4]), the income elasticity is about unity and the price elasticity is very

high, at 1.6. Investment also enters in with unit elasticity, while squared tariff rate enters

with a statistically significant and negative coefficient. Hence, for capital goods, the

vertical specialization hypothesis is not contradicted.

       Examining non-oil goods imports in a specification augmented in by investment

(Column [5]) yields a relatively high income elasticity of 2.34 (although lower than 2.65).

Investment is statistically significant, as expected. Augmenting the specification with the

tariff rate squared (Column [6]) yields a statistically significant coefficient on this

variable, in the expected direction, while raising the investment coefficient. This is




                                              11
suggestive that the decline in tariff rates and the rise in investment are correlated. In

addition the income coefficient declines to 1.5; most likely income was picking up the

trend in the tariff variable in the standard specifications. Non-oil, non-capital goods

imports (Column [7]) show a minor effect from investment and statistically insignificant

effect from tariffs.

        In contrast, imports of capital goods (Columns [8]) exhibit an implausibly strong

responsiveness to income and tariff rates (although exchange rates exhibit wrong

signedness and equipment and software expenditures are not statistically significant).

        The fact that capital imports drop precipitously after 2000, while GDP only

plateaus, suggests dropping the income variable (Column [9]). This idea is also motivated

by Mann and Plück’s (forthcoming) finding that matched expenditure classes sometime

work better than aggregate income as an activity variable. This still yields an incorrect

sign on the exchange rate. Only when augmenting the specification with a time trend and

an interaction of time with the exchange rate does one obtain a positive coefficient on the

exchange rate (early in the sample). Toward the end of the sample, the exchange rate

coefficient becomes negative.



4. Long Run Equilibria and Actual Values

        One potential benefit of obtaining a better fit for the trade flows, aside from a

greater understanding of the economic mechanisms at work, is that better predictions

might be possible. What has proven particularly challenging is adequately modeling

imports; hence in this section I investigate whether one can improve upon the predictions

obtained using only aggregate data. In Figure 9, the long run equilibrium values from the




                                              12
a simple DOLS incorporating only income and exchange rates (conforming to Column

[5] of Table 3) is depicted, alongside the actual log level of real non-petroleum imports

(the actual dynamic OLS fit, incorporating the short run dynamics, matches almost

exactly the actual). In Figure 10, the actual and long run equilibria for log non-oil non-

capital goods imports and capital goods imports are depicted (conforming to Columns [8]

and [9] respectively of Table 5). Once again, short run dynamics are omitted from the

predictions.

       In principle it would be useful to compare the prediction errors obtained from the

equation estimated using the aggregate non-oil imports, and compare it against the

summed prediction errors for the components, non-oil non-capital goods imports and

capital goods imports. However, because the trade flows are “chained” quantities that do

not obey adding up constraints, this procedure is not appropriate.

       Instead, I convert the predicted long run flows into nominal flows using the ex

post price indices. These actual and nominal trade flows can then be added and

subtracted. Then, to make the errors somehow comparable over time, I normalize by

GDP. The prediction error for the aggregate specification is compared against the sum of

the prediction errors for the components in Figure 11. On average, using the

disaggregated data yields smaller mean error: 0.1085 percentage points (ppts) of GDP

versus 0.3754 ppts. In addition, the standard deviation of the errors is slightly smaller:

0.3196 ppts. versus 0.3602 ppts. In addition, the disaggregate procedure does better in the

boom of the 1990’s, including the investment boom of 2000-01.

       Of course, not all problems are solved. Both approaches underpredict the recent

level of non-oil imports, by about 0.37 ppts. of GDP in 2004.




                                             13
5. Summary

In this paper the data for U.S. trade flows up to the beginning of 2005 are investigated.

The results indicate:

   •   The Houthakker-Magee finding persists for the standard aggregates.

   •   The income elasticities for imports and exports are quite high in regressions

       involving only GDP and exchange rates.

   •   The inclusion of supply-side variables reduces the magnitude of the income

       elasticities for exports. However, the results are not robust.

   •   Capital goods and non-capital goods imports appear to behave differently. Capital

       goods exports respond strongly to investment in equipment and software, and

       tariff rates.

   •   Capital goods imports are difficult to model.

   •   Prediction using disaggregated imports yields smaller errors than prediction using

       aggregate imports.
