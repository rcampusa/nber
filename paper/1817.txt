                 Fixed Price Versus Spot Price Contracts:
                        A Study in Risk Allocation



                                ABSTRACT


     This   paper is concerned with the risk-allocation effects of
alternative types of contracts used to set the price of a good to
be delivered in the future. Under a fixed price contract, the
price is specified in advance. Under a spot price contract, the
price is the price prevailing in the spot market at the time of

delivery.     These contract forms are examined in the context of a
market in which sellers have uncertain production costs and buyers
have uncertain valuations. The paper derives and interprets a
general condition determining which contract form would be pre-

ferred when the seller and/or the buyer is risk averse. In
addition, an example is provided in which a spot price contract
with a floor price is superior both to a "pure" spot price con-
tract and a fixed price contract.

1.   Introduction

     When a seller and a buyer enter into a contract for the

future delivery of some good, they can set the price to be paid

in several ways. For example, they can specify the price in
advance, which will be called a fixed price contract. Or they
can agree to the price prevailing in the spot market for the
good on the date of delivery, which will be referred to as a

spot price contract.1 This paper is concerned with the effects
of these two contract forms on the allocation of risk between
the parties when at least one of them is risk averse.-"      (A

hybrid form -— a spot price contract with a floor price --   also
will be discussed.)

     Variations of these contract forms are widely used in
practice. For example, in a survey of members of the National
Association of Purchasing Management, it was found that 90%
used fixed price contracts, 65% used "price at delivery" con-

tracts (what I am calling spot price contracts), 50% used

renegotiated price contracts (price adjustments only in unusual
circumstances), 39% used "escalator clause" contracts (price

affected by increases or decreases in the costs of specific
inputs), and 20% used "cost plus" contracts.1' Contracting
practices in specific industries also illustrate the variety of
contract forms used. For example, contracts for the sale of
nuclear reactors have, at different times, been of the "turn—

key" (fixed price) form and of the cost—plus form.-/ Similarly,

contracts for the sale of natural gas, petroleum coke, and coal
have included fixed price contracts and several different kinds
of contracts with variable prices, including some with   price

floors and ceilings./
    To begin to see how fixed price and spot price contracts

allocate risk, consider a simple example (the details of which

are discussed in section 4 below) .   Suppose there are a large
number of sellers with identical, but uncertain, production

costs in an industry with a flat supply curve. Because of the

firms' cost uncertainty, the supply curve also is uncertain,

And because the supply curve is flat, the equilibrium price
in the spot market equals the realized value of the firms'
Costs (regardless of the demand curve). Suppose further that
there are many buyers (also firms) whose valuations are not

uncertain.
     In this example, a spot price contract would insure a

seller against risk for the following reason. If that seller's
costs are high, so are all other sellers' costs, and so also
is the supply curve and the spot price. The increase in revenue
from the higher spot price exactly offsets the increase in pro-
duction costs. Thus, in this example, a spot price contract
provides perfect insurance for the seller against production
cost uncertainty. A fixed price contract would leave all of
the risk of production cost uncertainty on the seller.

     However, a fixed price contract would insure a buyer

against risk in this example. This is because, assuming the
value of the good to the buyer is fixed, a fixed price contract
would guarantee the buyer a certain level of profits. A spot
price contract would cause the buyer's profits to be uncertain.
                               —3—


      Thus, in this example. a spot price contract insures the
seller and a fixed price contract insures the buyer. A spot
price contract will be chosen over a fixed price contract if and
only if the seller is more risk averse than the buyer.
      The main contribution of this paper is to derive and

interpret the condition determining whether a spot price con-
tract or a fixed price contract is superior in a model in which

the following complications are added: First, it is assumed
that the industry supply curve may be rising (rather than flat),
and that the seller's uncertain production cost is positively,
but imperfectly, correlated with shifts in the industry supply
curve. Second, it is assumed that the buyer's valuation and the
industry demand curve are uncertain and that the buyer's valuation
is positively, but imperfectly, correlated with shifts in the
industry demand curve. Note that, if the supply curve is rising,
the equilibrium spot price will depend on fluctuations of both
the industry supply curve and the industry demand curve.
      In this more general framework, a spot price contract will
still tend to insure the seller against production cost uncer-
tainty. The reason is similar to that discussed in the previous

example, although the upward slope of the industry supply curve
and the less than perfect correlation between the seller's costs
and shifts in the industry supply curve reduces the value of a
spot price contract as insurance against production cost uncer—
        6/
tainty . —

      However, as noted, the spot price also will fluctuate
because of shifts in the industry demand curve. A
                                —4—

fixed price contract would insure the seller against these

demand—side uncertainties. Thus, in general, neither contract
can protect the seller against both supply-side and demand-side

risk.
        The results regarding the buyer are the mirror image of

those regarding the seller. A spot price contract will tend

to insure the buyer against valuation uncertainty, while a
fixed price contract will insure the buyer against supply—side

uncertainties.
        The preceding discussion shows that neither contract form

is best in terms of risk allocation in all circumstances.

Whether a spot price or a fixed price contract is preferred
depends on: the parties' relative aversion to risk;

the magnitudes of the supply-side and demand-side uncertainties;
the degree of correlation between the seller's costs and shifts

in the industry supply curve; the degree of correlation between
the buyer's valuation and shifts in the industry demand curve;

and the slopes of the supply and demand curves.
        In the next section the basic framework is described,

including the general condition determining which contract form
is preferred. In section 3. this condition is interpreted

by examining some special cases. In section 4, an example is
presented in which a spot price contract with a floor price
dominates both a "pure" spot price contract and a fixed price
contract. And in section 5, some concluding remarks are made./

2.      Basic Framework

        This section presents the basic framework. First, the
spot market equilibrium is described. Then the seller's and

buyer's utility under spot price and fixed price contracts
is stated. Finally, the general condition determining whether
a spot price contract is preferred to a fixed price contract
is derived.

        The industry supply curve in the spot market is assumed to

be of the form

(2.1)         p =            +         +   F,
                        k1       k20
where P is the price of the good, Q is industry output,

k1 >    0   and k2           0 are positive constants, and F is a random
variable with mean zero and variance a2 (F) ./                   Similarly,   the

industry demand curve is assumed to be of the form:


(2.2)          P =           -         +
                        k3       k4Q

where k3 >      0    and k4 > 0 are constants and S2 is a random

variable with mean zero and variance a2 ()                   The random variables

     and F are assumed to be independent.2-"

        Setting supply equal to demand and solving for the equi-
                                           10/
librium spot price gives:—


(2.3)               =        + Ar      +


where

The corresponding expression for the equilibrium output is
omitted because it will not be used below. Industry equilibrium

is shown graphically in Figure 1.
        Now consider a particular seller (hereafter "the Seller")

and a particular buyer ("the Buyer") who are contemplating
entering into a contract for the future exchange of one unit

of the good, but who do not yet know their respective costs
and vaiuationsj!/ The Seller's cost of producing the good is

(2.5)           C = c +    y,

where c >        0   is a constant and 'y            is   a random variable with mean

zero and variance a2 (y)                 The random variable representing the
Seller's cost uncertainty is assumed to be positively corre-

lated with the random variable representing supply curve uncer-

tainty:

 '2 • 6'/        p(.F.
                           —
                           =    Cov(F,    y)    >    0,
                                a(r)a(y)
where p(.) is the correlation coefficient, Cov(.) is the
covariance, and o(.) is the standard deviation of the respec-

tive arguments.
            Similarly, the Buyer's value from having the good is


 (2.7)          V=v+w
where v >        0   is a constant and w is a random variable with mean

zero and variance o (w) .                The random variable representing the
Buyer's valuation uncertainty is assumed to be positively corre—

lated with the random variable representing demand curve uncer-

tainty:

(2,8)            p(Q, w)   >    0.

The Seller's cost and the Buyer's valuation are assumed to
                         12/
be independent.—
        The parties are assumed to have the following mean—variance

utility functions:


(2.9)           Seller: U = E(ir)                   —   sVar(iT),
(2.10)          Buyer:           V = E(lr) - bVar(IT),


where i    is        the relevant party's profit and s                0 and b   0 are

constants measuring the Seller's and Buyer's risk aversion.--"

        The Seller's profit under a spot price contract is


(2.11)                = P* —      [c +        y].

Using (2.3) ,          (2.11) can be rewritten as:

(2.12)          ii    = (P   —   c) + (X1F +                      —




Thus, under a spot price contract, the Seller's expected pro-
fit is P    —        c and the variance of his profit is (X1F +

Similarly,           the Seller's profit under a fixed price contract

with contract price P is:


(2.13)          rr =    P —      [c   +   y].
This results in an expected profit of P - c and a variance of

profit of a2 (y)

        The Buyer's profit under a spot price contract is


(2.14)          It    =v     +        —   P,
or, using (2.3),

(2.15)           if   = (V —              +         —         —

                                            —9--



The resulting expected profit is v -                       and the resulting
variance of profits is a2(ai —                     - X22).       Similarly, the Buyer's
profit under a fixed price contract with contract price P is:

(2.16)    ii   = v +      w —   p,

leading to an expected profit of v -                   P   and variance of profit
of a2(w). The results of the preceding cases are summarized
in Table 1.

     It is shown in the Appendix that, with mean-variance

utility functions, the optimal contract form minimizes the
weighted sum of the parties' variances of profits, where the
weights are the parties' risk aversion coefficients.-/ Thus,
a spot price contract is preferred to a fixed price contract
if and only if:

(2.17)

The left-hand side of (2.17) can be interpreted as the parties'

disutility due to the bearing of risk under a spot price con-
tract, while the right—hand side is their comparable disutility
under a fixed price contract.

3.      Interpretation
        In order to understand better the condition determining

which contract form is preferred, this section will consider
several sp9cial cases. First, it will be assumed that only
one of the parties is risk averse,             then that both re
risk averse.

        3.1 Seller Risk Averse, Buyer Risk Neutral
        In this case, condition (2.17) reduces to:

                           —   y)   < a2
(3.1)       a2 (A1F + x2c2


It will be useful to examine this condition when either supply—
side uncertainty or demand—side uncertainty is absent.
        Suppose first that the only source of uncertainty is with

respect to the demand curve; therefore, a2(F) = 0 and a2(i) = 0.
Then (3.1) becomes


(3.2)        a2(A2c2) <0,

implying that a fixed price contract is preferred to a spot
price contract. This makes sense intuitively. If the Seller's
production costs are fixed, then the Seller bears no risk if

his revenue is fixed, as it would be under a fixed price contract.
A spot price contract would make his revenue uncertain because
the spot price would vary with fluctuations in the demand curve.

Thus, a fixed price      contract    insures the Seller against

side uncertainty.
        Now suppose that the only sources of uncertainty are on

the supply side, both with respect to the Seller's production
                                  —12—


costs and with respect to the supply curve; therefore,
a2(c) = 0.    Now (3.1) becomes:


(3.3)        a2(XF -    ')   < a2(y)

After some manipulation, this can be rewritten as:


(3.4)        p(F,y) >
                              + k)

Clearly, this condition may or may not be satisfied. Therefore,

with respect to supply-side uncertainty, either a spot price
contract or a fixed price contract may be preferred.
        To understand the circumstances in which each contract

form would be preferred, consider the terms in (3.4). Every-

thing else equal, the higher is p(F,y)——the (positive) corre-
lation between the Seller's production cost and the industry

supply curve-—the more likely a spot price contract is pre-

ferred to a fixed price contract, The reason, suggested in
the introduction, is easy to see. Suppose, for example, that
the Seller's costs turn out to be high. Since i(F,i) > 0,
 the industry supply curve, and hence the spot price, is likely

 to be high as well. Therefore, a spot price contract can be
viewed as a form of insurance for the Seller against production
 cost uncertainty. High costs will tend to be associated with

 high revenue, and vice versa)-/
        This conclusion needs to be qualified for the following

reason. As can be seen from (3.4), ii a(F)/c(y)——the ratio
of the standard deviation of the industry supply curve to the
standard deviation of the Seller's costs--is sufficiently high,

 then a fixed price contract would be preferred to a spot price
                            --13—


contract regardless of the magnitude of p(F,y). Under these

circumstances, the implicit insurance provided by the spot
price contract is "too much of a good thing." For example,

if the Seller's costs rise, the spot price is likely to rise
by so much more that the Seller's profits become more variable
rather than less variable under a spot price contract. Thus,
in order for a spot price contract not to "overinsure" the

Seller in this sense, the variance of the industry supply curve
must not be too large relative to the variance of the Seller's

costs . —
        16/

     One final factor needs to be taken into account. Every-

thing else equal, the extent to which shifts in the industry

supply curve lead to changes in the spot price depends on the
slopes of the industry supply and demand curves. This is
accounted for in (3.4) by the term k4/2(k2 +   k4).   For example,

the flatter the demand curve (i.e., the lower is k4), the smaller
the impact on the spot price of a shift in the supply curve.
Consequently, a spot price contract would be more likely to

be superior because the problem of "overinsuring" would be less

likely.
     To summarize: A fixed price contract insures the Seller

against demand—side uncertainty, while a spot price contract
tends to insure the Seller against production—cost uncertainty
 (although it might overinsure him). Therefore, when the Seller
is risk averse and the Buyer is risk neutral, which contract

form is preferred will depend on the relative importance of the

two sources of uncertainty (unless the spot price contract
overinsures the Seller against production cost uncertainty,
in which case a fixed price contract would be preferable)

        3.2 Buyer Risk Averse, Seller Risk Neutral

        In this case, condition (2.17) reduces to:

            2(w —            -               < a2(w),
(35)                  X1F         X2)
or, equivalently,


(3.6)       a2(X1F +              —          <   a2(w)


Note that (3.6) is identical to (3.1) with w--the Buyer's

valuation uncertainty——substituted for y—-the Seller's pro-
duction-cost uncertainty. Thus, the results of section 3.1

apply here in reverse.
        If the only source of uncertainty is with respect to the

supply curve, (3.6) becomes


(3.7)                   <    0,
             2(X1F)

implying that a fixed price contract is preferred to a spot
price contract. For reasons analogous to those discussed
earlier, a fixed price contract insures the Buyer against

supply-side uncertainty.
        If the only sources of uncertainty are on the demand side,

(3.6) can be written as:
                                  k
                                      2
(3.8)        p( ,w) >                            ThT
                            2(k2 + k4)

The interpretation of this condition is analogous to that of
(3.4) : A spot price contract can be viewed as a form of

ance for the Buyer against valuation uncertainty. However, if
it overinsures the Buyer, a fixed price contract may be pre-

ferred.

        3.3 Both Parties Risk Averse
        In this section limiting values of the slope of the indus-

try supply curve will be considered when both parties are risk

averse.
        Suppose first that the industry suoplv curve i flat;
i.e., k2 = 0.      Then A1     1 and A2 =            0    (see (2.4)), and the
condition determining whether a spot price contract is preferred
to a fixed price contract, (2.17), becomes:


(3.9)        SG2(F — y) + ba2(w —          F).   <       sc2(y)   + ba2(w)


After some manipulation, (3.9) can be rewritten as


(3.10)       b <
                   s{2PFii    ----    — i}.

Since the expression in braces may be positive or negative,
either a spot price or a fixed price contract may be preferred.
        Condition (3.10) can be interpreted in terms of the results

in sections 3.1 and 3.2. First note that when the supply curve

is flat, only supply—side uncertainty matters since shifts in

the industry demand curve will not affect the spot price.
From the Seller's perspective,21 recall that a spot price

contract is preferred with respect to supply—side uncertainty
unless it "overjngures" the Seller; the condition for a spot

price contract to be preferred was given by (3.4), which,
when k2 = 0, can be rewritten as:


(3.11)       2p(F,y)         - 1 >    0.
                       cf)
Note that the left-hand side of (3.11) is identical to the
                                      —16—


expression in braces in (3.10). From the Buyer's perspective,
recall that a fixed price contract is preferred with respect

to supply—side uncertainty because it fully insures the Buyer
against this source of risk. Therefore, (3.10) can be given
the following interpretation. If the Seller prefers a fixed

price contract too——that is, if the expression in braces is
negative—-then (3.10) clearly implies that a fixed price con-
tract will be superior to a spot price contract. However, if
the Seller prefers a spot price contract—-that is, if the
expression in braces is positive-—then whether a spot price or

a fixed price contract is superior depends on the risk aversion
of the Seller relative to that of the Buyer and on the extent

to which a spot price contract insures the Seller against
production cost uncertainty (as measured by the magnitude of
the expression in braces in (3.10>).
       Now suppose that the slope of the industry supply curve

approaches infinity. Then l approaches zero, A2 approaches
unity, and (2.17) becomes:


 (3.12)       sa2(Q — y) + bc2(w — A2c2)            <   sa2(y) ÷ b2(w).

This condition can be rewritten as:


              s   <
 (3.13).              b{2P(cw) ¶____ — 4.

 The interpretation of (3.13) is analogous to the                 interpretation

 of (3.10). In the limit, as the slope of the industry supply

 curve approaches infinity, only demand—side uncertainty
                                                                            matters.'
 With respect to this source of uncertainty, the Seller prefers
                             —17—


a fixed price contract, whereas the Buyer prefers a spot price
contract unless it overinsures him. Therefore, if the Buyer
prefers a spot price contract, then which contract form is

superior depends on the strength of this preference and the
relative aversion to risk of the parties, whereas if the Buyer
prefers a fixed price contract, then that contract form will
be superior.

     Other special cases easily can be worked out. Note, for
example, that the results when the slope of the industry demand

curve approaches (minus) infinity are identical to those when
the slope of the supply curve is zero (since X1 approaches

unity and A2 approaches zero). Similarly, when the slope of
the demand curve approaches zero, the results are identical
to those when the slope of the supply curve approaches infinity.

4.   Spot Price Contracts with Floor Prices: An Example
     There are many other types of contracts that could be
considered by the parties in order to better allocate supply—

side and demand—side risks. One additional contract form
will be examined in this section——a spot price contract with
a floor price. Under this contract, the Buyer pays the Seller
the spot price or a prespecified floor price, whichever is
greater. Since the floor price can be made arbitrarily low,
this contract form can approximate a "pure" spot price contract.

Moreover, if the floor price is set sufficiently high and
the Buyer is made to pay the spot price or the floor price,
whichever is higher, less a positive constant, a spot price

contract with a floor price can also approximate a fixed price

contract. Clearly, therefore, a spot price contract with a
floor price cannot do worse than the other two contract forms.
This section presents an example in which it does better.
      The example is a special case of the model described in

 section 2.   It is characterized by the following assumptions.

First, the industry supply curve is flat: k2     0. Second,
 the random variable representing the Seller's production
 cost uncertainty is identical to the random variable repre-

 senting supply curve uncertainty: y = F.   (This common random

 variable will be referred to as y) Together, these two assump-
 tions have a natural economic interpretation; they describe

 a competitive industry in long-run equilibrium in which all of
 the firms' costs are identical, but uncertain. Third, the

 supply-side uncertainty is binary:
                                           —19—


                          -ra,        with probability (1-r),
(4.1)        y =
                          —ra + a,    with probability r,
where 0. <       r    <    1 and a > 0 are constants. Note that E(Y) = 0

and


(4.2)        a2(y)           r(l—r)a2.


Given these three assumptions, the equilibrium spot price is

                                       —   ra,       with probability (1-r),
(4.3)
                                     P -   ra + a,   with probability r,

where      is a constant. Fourth, there is no demand—side uncer-

tainty.
        Since the analysis of different contract forms in this

example parallels the analysis in the preceding two sections,
only a few details concerning the spot price contract with a
floor price will be discussed here. From (4.3), the low value
of the spot price is P — ra and the high value is P -                         ra       ÷ a.

Therefore, let the floor price be P -                 ra   +   f,   where 0        f      a.

If f = 0, the spot price contract with a floor price is equiva-

lent to a pure spot price contract and if f = a, it can be made

equivalent to a fixed price contract by having the Buyer pay
the floor price less a positive constant.                      (Since a reduction

of the contract price by a constant would not affect the vari-

ance of either party's profit, the possibility of such an
adjustment will be ignored in the remainder of this section.)
        The Seller's profit under a spot price contract with floor

price f >    0       is, using (4.1) and (4.3):
                                             —20—


               =        — [C +      y)
(4.4)
                    P —c +         f,        with probability (l—r),

                    P   - c,                 with probability r.

The variance of the Seller's profit is r(1-r)f2                       Similarly,

the Buyer's profit is:

                    v — P ÷ ra —             f,     with probability (l-r),
(4.5)                      —
                    V-P        +   ra    -   a,     with probability r.


The variance of the Buyer's profit is r(l-r) (a-f)2.
        As noted in section 2, the optimal contract minimizes
the weighted sum of the variances of profits, where the weights
are the parties' risk aversion coefficients. Thus, the optimal

floor price, P      - ra       +   f*,   can be determined by minimizing


(4.6)        sr(l—r)f2 + br(1—r) (a—f

                     19/
over f. This leads to:—

(4 7)        f* =   r ab
                    [s+b
Inserting (4.7) into (4.6) gives the minimum of the weighted

sum of the variances of profits under a spot price contract

with a floor price:


 (4.8)              r(l—r)a2.


         Under a pure spot price contract the weighted sum of the

variances of profits is

                               2
 (4.9)        [b}r(l—r)a
                              —21—



while under a fixed price contract it is


(4.10)      [s]r(1-r)a2.


Note that, as between a pure spot price contract and a fixed

price contract, the former is superior if and only if the Seller
is more risk averse than the Buyer.

       A comparison of (4.8) through (4.10) shows that when both
parties are risk averse the spot price contract with the optimal
floor price is preferable both to a pure spot price contract
and to a fixed price contract since


(4.11)
            []=     []b= []
is   less than both b and s when s > 0 and b > 0.   This result
can be exp1ained intuitively. In the example, a pure spot
price contract fully insures the Seller against production
cost uncertainty, leaving all of the risk on the Buyer. A
fixed price contract does just the opposite. When both parties
are risk averse, it is better to share the risk, which can be

accomplished by a spot price contract with a floor price.
      There is a simple way in this example to measure the

advantage of a spot price contract with a floor price over the

other two contracts. Expressions (4.8) through (4.10) repre-
sent the disutility to the parties from the bearing of risk.
In each case, the term in brackets multiplies the variance of

the Seller's production cost (see (4.2)). Therefore, the
ratio of the risk—bearing costs under a spot price contract

with an optimal floor price to the risk-bearing costs under the
                            —22—


other two contracts equals the ratio of sb/(s+b) to s or to b.
For example, suppose the Buyer and the Seller are equally risk
averse. Then the risk—bearing costs under a spot price con-
tract with an optimal floor price are exactly half of the risk-
bearing costs under either a pure spot price contract or a

fixed price contract. Or, for example, suppose the Buyer is
twice as risk averse as the Seller (i.e., b = 2s). Then a

fixed price contract is superior to a pure spot price contract,

but a spot price contract with an optimal floor price reduces
risk-bearing costs by a third from what they would be under a

fixed price contract.

5.   Concluding Remarks

     Although many simplifying assumptions have been made in
this paper, the principal observations seem quite general: A
spot price contract tends to insure a seller against production

cost uncertainty and a buyer against valuation uncertainty
(although it may "overinsure" them). A fixed price contract
insures a seller against demand—side uncertainties and a buyer

against supply—side uncertainties. Thus, which contract form
will be preferred by the parties depends on their relative
aversion to risk and the magnitudes of the supply-side and

demand—side uncertainties.

     The analysis in this paper can be used to help explain
contracting practices in different industries. Consider, for
example, the uranium industry, in which the sellers usually
are private firms and the buyers frequently are public utilities

(using the uranium to produce electricity). It would seem
reasonable to assume that the sellers are more risk averse
than the buyers with respect to fluctuations in the price of
uranium (since the price of uranium constitutes a small fraction

of the utilities' cost of producing electricity and they usually

can pass input price changes through to consumers)
     The contracting practices in the uranium industry changed
during the early 1970's. Before then, fixed price contracts
were the norm. Afterwards, spot price contracts were used
                            —24--



more frequently (often with a floor price). Assuming for

simplicity that the buyers (public utilities) are risk neutral,
this change would have to be explained by the risks borne by

the sellers. As noted earlier, sellers would prefer spot price

contracts with respect to production cost uncertainty (unless
such contracts overinsure them, which does not seem likely in

this context) and fixed price contracts with respect to demand
uncertainty. About the time that contracting practices began

to change in the uranium industry, there was a significant
increase in production cost uncertainty due to the effects of

environmental and mine safety regulations passed in the late

1960's and early 1970's. Thus, the change in contracting form

might be explained by these regulatory changes.

Appendix

         The following result will be demonstrated in this appendix:
Suppose the parties' utility functions are of the mean—variance
form, the sum of their expected profits is constant, and lump-

sum transfers can be made between them. Then one situation is
Pareto superior to another if and only if the weighted sum

of the partiest variances of profits, where the weights are the

respective coefficients in the parties' utility functions, is
lower under that situation.
         The notation used will be adapted from the text. Let

      represent the expected profit of party i (i = S,B) in
  J
situation j (j =                      1,2)          Then the assumption that the sum of the

parties' expected profits is constant becomes:

(A.l)                         +                =        +
                   IrS

Let          represent the variance of profit of party i in situation
         J                    >
j, and       let       k. =       0    represent a lump—sum transfer from S (the
Seller) to B (the Buyer) in situation j.

         First it will be shown that if the weighted sum of the

variances of profits is lower under one situation, then that
situation can be made Pareto superior to the other situation

by appropriate lump-s urn transfers. Without loss of generality,
suppose the weighted sum of the variances is lower under situ—
ation 1:

The Buyer's utility in situation 1 is:

Solving for k1from (A.3) and substituting the resulting expres-

sion into (A.4) gives:

                                                                                         2                 2           2

From (A.1) ,            the expression in the first set of parentheses
equals m                  Therefore,                            (A.5) can be written as:
            2
                                                   2                2                    2
                                                           +                 —                        +

                        B 2 -boB2 +k2,
where the inequality follows from (A.2). Hence, the Buyer's

utility is higher in situation 1.
         Now it will be shown that if one situation is Pareto

superior to another, the weighted sum of the variances of
profits is lower under that situation. Without loss of gener-
ality, suppose situation 1 is Pareto superior to situation 2
and that the Seller's utility is strictly higher in situation 1:

Footnotes
     */ Stanford University and National Bureau of Economic
Research. This paper grew out of work I did in 1980 for the

defendants in Westinghouse Electric Corporation V.   Rio Algom
Limited, et al. (an antitrust suit by Westinghouse against
domestic and foreign uranium producers). The actual writing
of the paper, as well as the derivation of most of the results
in the present version, occurred after the case was settled in
1981. Work on the paper during the summer of 1982 was supported

by the Stanford Legal Resarch Fund, made possible by a bequest
from the Estate of Ira S. Lillick and by gifts from Roderick E.
and Carla A. Hills and other friends of the Stanford Law

School. Helpful comments were provided by Lucian Bebchuk,

 Jeffrey Perloff, Ivan P'ng, Michael Riordan, William Rogerson,
 Steven Shavell, Edward Sherry, and participants in seminars

 at Berkeley and Stanford.
     1/ If the spot market is competitive, which is consistent
with what will be assumed in section 2 below, then a spot price

contract is equivalent to transacting in the spot market.
Although there are reasons why the parties might prefer to enter
into a contract rather than to transact in the spot market

 (such as reduced transaction costs from dealing with the same

person over time) ,   these reasons are not incorporated into the
model to be analyzed.

      2/    Both the seller and the buyer will be presumed to be

firms (although the assumption that the buyer is a firm is not

essential to the analysis) .    The assumption of risk aversion
in the case of firms has both theoretical and empirical support.
                             —29—


See, for example, Amihud and Lev (1981) and Marcus (1982).

     3/ See Long and Varbie (1978). Although many of the
respondents obviously utilized more than one type of contract,
the use of multiple contract forms will not be considered in
this paper.

     4/ See, for example, Burness, Montgomery, and Quirk
(1980)
      5/ See, for example, Pierce (1982), Goldberg an
Erickson (1982), and Joskow (1985)

      6/ There is also the possibility, discussed in section
3 below, that a spot price contract will "overinsure" the
seller, in which case a fixed price contract could be prefer-
able with respect to production cost uncertainty.
     7/ Although, to my knowledge, the problem addressed in
this paper has not been studied previously, there is much work
on risk allocation that is related in one way or another. Of
general relevance are articles that consider risk allocation
issues in specific contractual settings--such as employment

contracts, defense procurement, and products liability.
Apparently, the first article of this sort was the study by
Cheung (1969) of employment contracts in agriculture.
     There is also a large literature on the behavior of the

firm under uncertainty that is complementary to the problem
addressed here. Especially relevant are those papers which
consider what fraction of a firm's output it should sell
forward at a fixed price rather than in the spot market. An
early classic in this literature is McKinnon(1967) and more
recent examples include Feder, Just, and Schmitz (1980) and
                                   —30—

Hoithausen (1979). Perloff (1981) applies this framework
to the excuse doctrine in contract law. This literature does

not, however, consider the risk aversion of buyers.

        Probably of most relevance to the present analysis is the

book by Newbery and Stiglitz (1981) on commodity price stabil-
ization schemes and the paper by Shavell (1976) on deferred
compensation schemes. However, in the Newbery—StiglitZ frame-
work, if a firm's output were fixed, then a fixed price contract
 (perfect commodity price stabilization) would eliminate all

risk.        This is not the case in my analysis. The general results

in the Shavell paper are consisten t with those presented here,

al thoug h he does not consider the specific contract forms and

market structure that I do. Also in the spirit of the present

study i s the paper by Sebenius and Stan (1982) analyzing profit

sharing        royalties, and fixed fees    although they assume that

one of the parties is risk netural.

        8/
               Obviously, F must be such that P >   0   (Analogous

comment s apply to the other random variables defined below.)

        9 /    This assumption may be reasonable in some contexts

 but   not others.     It   would be appropriate, fo r example, if

 demand uncertainty is due to fluctuations in the real income
 of consumers while production cost uncertainty is due to regu-

 latory changes or the vagaries of the weather.
       10/ Since the focus in this paper is on the contract
 choice of a single seller and a single buyer who treat the

 spot price as exogenous, it is not necessary in deriving (2.3)
 to explicitly take account of the behavior of all

 buyers and sellers in the market (although it is necessary to
 assume that enough choose to trade in the spot market)
                            —31—
    11/ It will be assumed that the realized values of the
uncertain costs and benefits are such that the parties will

want to complete the contract in the way originally contem-
plated by them--that is, by having the Seller produce the good
(as opposed to securing one unit in the spot market) and by

having the Buyer keep the good (as opposed to reselling it in

the spot market).

    12/ The comment in note 9 above is applicable here too.
However, in a paper analyzing the effects of demand—side and
supply-side uncertainties on the output exchanged in a bilateral

trading situation, Weitzman (1981) has suggested why the
relevant random variables might be negatively correlated.
    13/ Although mean-variance utility functions are widely
used because of their simplicity, their justification requires

some well—known assumptions. See, for example,Newbery and

Stiglitz (1981, Ch. 6)
    14/ The conditions assumed in the Appendix include that
the sum of the parties' expected profits is constant and that
lump—sum transfers can be made between them. That the sum of
the parties' expected profits is constant across contract forms

is clear from Table 1. That lump—sum transfers can be made
between the parties follows from their ability to adjust the
contract price by a constant amount. Since such an adjustment
would not affect the variance of either party's profit, it is
not explicitly taken into account in the analysis.
    15/ Note that this implicit insurance need not be perfect
in order for a spot price contract to be preferred.
    16/ A possible response to this problem would be to make

the contract price only partly dependent on the spot price.
                             —32—

I am indebted to Michael Riordan for suggesting this point.

     17/   I will use phrases like "from the Seller's perspective"
or "what the Seller would prefer" to refer to what the parties
would jointly choose if the Seller were risk averse and the

Buyer were risk neutral. Similar phrases will be used with

respect to the Buyer.
     18/ Note that if shifts in the industry supply curve were
horizontal rather than vertical, then supply—side uncertainty
would matter even when the supply curve is perfectly inelastic.

     j/    The second—order condition for a minimum is satisfied.
