                                             ABSTRACT

Importation of drugs into the U.S. would result in a decline in U.S. drug prices. The purpose of this
paper is to assess the consequences of importation for new drug development. A simple theoretical
model of drug development suggests that the elasticity of innovation with respect to the expected price
of drugs should be at least as great as the elasticity of innovation with respect to expected market size
(disease incidence). I examine the cross-sectional relationship between pharmaceutical innovation
and market size among a set of diseases (different types of cancer) exhibiting substantial exogenous
variation in expected market size. I analyze two different measures of pharmaceutical innovation:
the number of distinct chemotherapy regimens for treating a cancer site, and the number of articles
published in scientific journals pertaining to drug therapy for that cancer site. Both analyses indicate
that the amount of pharmaceutical innovation increases with disease incidence. The elasticity of the
number of chemotherapy regimens with respect to the number of cases is 0.53. The elasticity of MEDLINE
drug cites with respect to cancer incidence throughout the world is 0.60. In the long run, a 10% decline
in drug prices would therefore be likely to cause at least a 5-6% decline in pharmaceutical innovation.

         Importation of drugs into the U.S. may soon become legal. Since prices of drugs
are lower in most other countries than they are in the U.S., importation would result in a
decline in U.S. drug prices. The price decline would benefit U.S. consumers in the short
run. However, importation may have two other effects that could reduce the welfare of
U.S. consumers. First, importation could reduce the quality, or safety, of drugs
purchased by Americans, and increase the number of adverse drug events. Second,
importation could reduce the number of new drugs developed in the future by reducing
the expected profitability of new drug development. In previous papers (Lichtenberg
(2005a, 2005b, 2005c)), I have shown that the introduction of new drugs has increased
longevity and ability to work, and reduced utilization of hospitals and nursing homes.
         Therefore, while importation may yield an increase in static efficiency (lower
drug prices), it may also result in reduced dynamic efficiency (fewer new drugs
developed). Schumpeter (1947, p. 190, italics in original) suggested that, in general,
consumer welfare depends more on dynamic efficiency than it does on static efficiency:
“we shall call that system relatively more efficient which we see reason to expect would
in the long run produce the larger stream of consumers’ goods per equal unit of time.”
         The purpose of this paper is to assess the consequences of importation for new
drug development. One way to do this is to estimate the elasticity of drug development
with respect to the expected price of drugs.1, 2 This approach requires substantial
exogenous variation in expected drug prices, which may be hard to find. I will pursue an
alternative approach: I will attempt to estimate the elasticity of drug development with
respect to expected market size. In Section I, I will present a simple theoretical model of
drug development which suggests that the elasticity of investment with respect to the
expected price of drugs should be at least as great as the elasticity of investment with
respect to expected market size. In section II, I will examine the cross-sectional
relationship between pharmaceutical innovation and market size among a set of diseases

timing of launch of existing drugs in different countries. Danzon et al (2005) present evidence that
countries with lower prices or smaller market size experience longer delays in access to new drugs. Kyle
(2005) found that companies delay launch into price-controlled markets, and are less likely to introduce
their products in additional markets after entering a country with low prices.

(different types of cancer) exhibiting substantial exogenous variation in expected market
size. In section III, I will consider the implications of the estimates, and compare them to
estimates from previous studies.


I.        A simple theoretical model of drug development


          Suppose that the cost function of the pharmaceutical firm is linear, i.e. that there
is a fixed cost and that marginal cost is constant:

          C = CF + m Q
            = CF + CV                                       (1)

where

          C = total cost
          CF = fixed cost
          m = marginal cost
          Q = quantity
          CV = variable cost = m Q

The fixed cost (CF) is likely to be very large relative to marginal cost. In 2003, the Tufts
Center for the Study of Drug Development reported that the fully capitalized cost to
develop a new drug, including studies conducted after receiving regulatory approval,
averages $897 million.3 In 2002, the average U.S. price of a generic prescription—which
may be close to marginal cost—was $30.
          Given this cost function, the firm’s profit function is:

          Π=R-C
           = P Q – (CF + CV)
           = P Q – m Q - CF
           = R - CV – CF
           = ΠV - CF                                        (2)

where

          Π = profit
          R = revenue = P Q

                                                                                                5

         P = price
         ΠV = variable profit = revenue – variable cost = (P – m) Q

The firm will be willing to invest (incur the fixed cost CF) if it expects “variable profit”
(revenue minus variable cost) to exceed fixed cost. This theory of investment in
innovation is quite consistent with Scherer’s (2001, p. 220) “virtuous rent-seeking
model” of pharmaceutical industry R&D, in which, “as profit opportunities expand, firms
compete to exploit them by increasing R&D investments, and perhaps also promotional
costs, until the increases in costs dissipate most, if not all, supranormal profit returns.”
         Suppose we regard both fixed and marginal cost as given. Exogenous changes in
price or quantity change variable profit, and therefore may affect whether of not the firm
is willing to invest.
         If the firm were an unregulated monopolist facing a linear inverse demand curve
P = a – b Q, the profit-maximizing price would be P* = (a + m) / 2, and the profit-
maximizing quantity would be Q* = (a – m) / 2 b. However, suppose that the firm is
prevented, by reimportation or regulation, from charging the profit-maximizing price.
The actual price it can charge, P, may be lower than P*. I want to assess the sensitivity of
variable profit (hence willingness to invest) to exogenous changes in P, and compare it to
the sensitivity of variable profit to exogenous “demand shocks” (e.g., changes in market
size).
         A change in P has an indirect as well as a direct effect on variable profit, via the
demand function. Suppose that the demand function is log-linear rather than linear:

         Q = N P-β

or

         ln Q = ln N - β ln P

where N is the number of consumers and β is the elasticity of demand. I assume that the
elasticity of Q with respect to N is one, e.g. a 10% increase in disease incidence would
cause quantity demanded to increase 10%, holding price constant.
         Then we may write

         ln ΠV = ln(P – m) + ln Q
                                                                                                6



              = ln(P – m) + ln N - β ln P

The elasticity of variable profit with respect to the number of consumers is one. The
elasticity of variable profit with respect to price is

        δ ln ΠV = P - β
         δ ln P  P–m


                =        1      -β
                    1 – (m / P)

Suppose, for a moment, that the demand for pharmaceuticals were completely inelastic: β
= 0. In this case

        δ ln ΠV =      1      > 1 = δ ln ΠV
         δ ln P   1 – (m / P)       δ ln N

The elasticity of variable profit with respect to price is greater than one, and is therefore
greater than the elasticity of variable profit with respect to the number of consumers. If
demand were completely inelastic, variable profit would be more sensitive to price than it
is to market size. A reduction in the number of consumers reduces cost as well as
revenue, whereas a reduction in price reduces only revenue.
        To calculate the elasticity of variable profit with respect to price when demand is
completely inelastic, we require only an estimate of (m / P), the reciprocal of the price-
cost margin. Hughes et al (2002, p. 6), citing Grabowski and Vernon (1992, 1996), note
that “once multiple generic manufacturers enter [the market following patent expiration],
they typically price their drugs at discounts of 70 to 90 percent below the incumbent’s
price prior to entry. This observation implies that the ratio of price to marginal cost for
branded drugs with patent protection is about 6:1.” If (m / P) = 1/6, the elasticity of
variable profit with respect to price when demand is completely inelastic is 1 / (1–(1/6)) =
1.20.
        However, other evidence suggests that the mean ratio of generic price to branded
price is much higher. Data from the 2002 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey indicate
that the mean price of generic prescriptions was $30 (N = 124,555), and that the mean
                                                                                                        7

price of branded prescriptions was $75 (N = 189,312), so the ratio of mean prices was
0.40. However, this ratio compares prices of different products, e.g. antibiotics and
cardiovascular drugs. We can calculate the mean percentage differential of the prices of
generic and branded versions of the same product by estimating the following model:
            ln Pij = δ GENERICij + αj + εij
where


          Pij = the price of the ith prescription for product j
    GENERICij = 1 if the ith prescription for product j is a generic prescription
              = 0 if the ith prescription for product j is a branded prescription
          αj = a fixed effect for product j, where a product is defined by active
              ingredient(s), dosage form, strength, and route of administration4

         The estimate of the within-product price differential δ, based on data on 258,276
prescriptions for 2235 products, is -.317 (t-statistic = 65.3). This implies that the mean
ratio of the price of a generic prescription to the price of a branded prescription for the
same product is 0.73 (= exp(-.317)). If (m / P) = 0.40, the elasticity of variable profit
with respect to price when demand is completely inelastic is 1.68; if (m / P) = 0.73, it is
3.68.
         Some evidence indicates that the demand for pharmaceuticals is completely
inelastic: a study by Caves, Whinston, and Hurwitz (1991) found that the total amount
sold of a drug in both generic and brand-name forms did not increase after generic entry.5
Moreover, as Folland et al (2001) argue, insurance reduces the price elasticity, and
prescription drug insurance coverage has been rising. According to an April 2000
Department of Health & Human Services Report to the President6, in 1998 only 27 cents
out of every dollar of pharmaceutical expenditure was paid for out of pocket by
households; 53 cents was paid by private insurance and the remainder was paid by
Medicaid and other sources (Figure 2-16).

        However, evidence from several studies suggests that the elasticity of demand for
pharmaceuticals is positive, but not large. One of these was the Health Insurance
Experiment (HIE), which randomized people to various insurance plans that differed in
their copayments and deductibles. The HIE yielded an elasticity of prescription drug
expenditures of 0.27, implying that a 10% reduction in the price of drugs would increase
spending by 2.7%. Lillard et al (1999) observed a similar response (0.25) among the
elderly.7 Goldman et al (2002) stated that “overall, the literature suggests elasticities that
range between 0.20 and 0.35.”
        If (m / P) = 1/6, and the demand elasticity is 0.20, the elasticity of variable profit
with respect to price happens to be equal to unity, the same as the elasticity of variable
profit with respect to the number of consumers:

        δ ln ΠV =      1      -β=     1     − 0.20 = 1
         δ ln P   1 – (m / P)     1 – (1/6)

If the demand elasticity is 0.35, the elasticity of variable profit with respect to price
equals 0.85, which is lower than the elasticity of variable profit with respect to the
number of consumers, but not by much. This suggests that the elasticity of variable profit
with respect to price is likely to be similar to the elasticity of variable profit with respect
to the number of consumers. Hence, an estimate of the effect of the number of
consumers on investment may also be considered an approximate estimate, or forecast, of
the effect of price on investment.

II.     Evidence about the effect of market size on pharmaceutical innovation


        To estimate the effect of market size on pharmaceutical innovation, there must be
observable, exogenous variation in market size (e.g. disease incidence) that can be linked
to innovation measures. Estimates of the incidence (i.e. the annual number of new



7
  The estimated elasticity is based on Goldman et al’s (2002) calculations, using the demand response
shown in Table 4 of Lillard et al (1999) for elderly with Medicare only. Using information from the
Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS), they assumed the average coinsurance rate for these elderly
is 100% without insurance and 45% with insurance. The 45% average coinsurance rate is based on our
calculation of observed coinsurance rates (out-of-pocket expenditures divided by total expenditures) for
people with private supplemental drug coverage in the 1995 MCBS.

cases)8 of 365 conditions have been compiled and posted on the wrongdiagnosis.com
website. In most cases, the incidence rates refer to the U.S. or other industrialized
nations.9 Data for the top 25 conditions are shown in Table 1.
        Although these data are potentially useful, they may be subject to several
limitations. First, they were derived from a variety of sources, covering different regions
and time periods, and may not be directly comparable.10 A second and perhaps greater
concern is that reported incidence may not be exogenous with respect to the availability
of treatments. An increase in available treatments for a disease may lead to greater public
and professional awareness of it (e.g. due to more promotion and advertising by drug
companies), and therefore to higher reported incidence.
        There is one important set of diseases—different forms of cancer—for which
reliable, systematic incidence data are available, and where the potential for “reverse
causality” (from treatment availability to incidence) is likely to be quite limited. Reliable
data on the incidence of cancer, by cancer site (e.g. breast and prostate) are available
from GLOBOCAN. The GLOBOCAN 2002 database provides estimates of the
incidence and prevalence of, and mortality from, 27 cancers for all countries in the world
in 2002. The database has been built up using the huge amount of data available in
the Descriptive Epidemiology Group of the International Agency for Research on Cancer
(IARC), part of the World Health Organization. Incidence data are available from
cancer registries.
        If drugs were the only or primary treatment for cancer, or if drugs were often used
to diagnose cancer, as well as to treat it, the possibility of reverse causality would be
greater. But drugs are not the only cancer treatment: as noted by the British Columbia
Cancer Agency, surgery and radiation therapy, as well as cancer drugs, “are all proven to
cure cancer, extend life, or improve quality of life.”11 Also, data contained in the
National Library of Medicine’s Unified Medical Language System Metathesaurus

indicate that only 0.4% of cancer drugs are used to diagnose cancer. The vast majority
(98.7%) are used to treat cancer; 0.9% are used to prevent cancer.
           I will examine the relationship, across cancer sites, between cancer incidence and
two different measures of pharmaceutical innovation.12 The first is the number of distinct
chemotherapy regimens for treating the cancer site. The second is the number of articles
published in scientific journals pertaining to drug therapy for that cancer site.
           Cancer Care Ontario (CCO) publishes lists of chemotherapy regimens grouped by
disease site. The regimens are categorized according to the recommendations of the
respective CCO Disease Site Group. I will use the number of core chemotherapy
regimens for a disease site. A core therapy is defined as a “standard therapy; a regimen
widely used by most Regional Cancer Centres in this disease site.”13 Data on the number
of new cases in Canada in 2002, by cancer site, were obtained from GLOBOCAN 2002.
Data on the estimated number of new cases in the U.S. in 2000, by cancer site, were
obtained from the SEER Cancer Statistics Review, 1975-2002.14
           Data on eighteen cancer sites, listed in descending order of incidence in Canada,
are shown in Table 2. In both Canada and the U.S., the top four cancer sites—lung,
breast, prostate, and colorectal—account for about two-thirds of all cases. They account
for 46% of core chemotherapy regimens. Figure 1 plots the log of the number of core
chemotherapy regimens for a site against the log of the number of cases in Canada in
2002. Statistics from the regression of the log of the number of core chemotherapy
regimens on the log of the number of cases in Canada in 2002 are:

The elasticity of the number of chemotherapy regimens with respect to the number of
cases is 0.53, and the estimate is significantly different from zero (p-value = .018). A
10% increase in the number of cases in associated with a 5.3% increase in the number of
chemotherapy regimens.15
         Now I will examine the relationship, across cancer sites, between cancer
incidence and the number of articles published in scientific journals pertaining to drug
therapy for that cancer site. Data on the latter were obtained by searching MEDLINE
(Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online), the U.S. National Library of
Medicine's (NLM) premier bibliographic database of biomedical citations and abstracts.
The subject scope of MEDLINE is biomedicine and health, broadly defined to encompass
those areas of the life sciences, behavioral sciences, chemical sciences, and
bioengineering needed by health professionals and others engaged in basic research and
clinical care, public health, health policy development, or related educational activities.
It contains approximately 13 million references to journal articles that appeared in over
4,800 journals published in the United States and more than 70 other countries primarily
from 1966 to the present.16


15
   The elasticity is virtually identical when we use the log no. of cases in the U.S. in 2000 instead of the log
no. of cases in Canada in 2002. U.S. and Canadian incidence across cancer sites is extremely highly
correlated.
16
   The great majority of journals are selected for MEDLINE based on the recommendation of the Literature
Selection Technical Review Committee, an NIH-chartered advisory committee of external experts

        References to articles are indexed with terms from NLM's controlled vocabulary,
MeSH (Medical Subject Headings). MeSH is the National Library of Medicine's
controlled vocabulary thesaurus. It consists of 22,568 descriptors in a hierarchical
structure that permit searching at various levels of specificity. The Medical Subject
Headings Section staff continually revises and updates the MeSH vocabulary. Staff
subject specialists are responsible for areas of the health sciences in which they have
knowledge and expertise. In addition to receiving suggestions from indexers and others,
the staff collect new terms as they appear in the scientific literature or in emerging areas
of research; define these terms within the context of existing vocabulary; and recommend
their addition to MeSH.
        At the highest (most general) level of the MeSH hierarchical structure are the
following 15 headings:
         1.   Anatomy [A]
         2.   Organisms [B]
         3.   Diseases [C]

We can search MEDLINE for all articles pertaining to particular diseases, and for articles
specifically pertaining to drug treatment of those diseases. For example, the search string
“exp leukemia” identifies all articles in MEDLINE that pertain to any form of leukemia,
and the search string “exp leukemia/dt” identifies all articles in the database that pertain
to drug therapy for any form of leukemia.




useful to particular segments of NLM's broad user community are also included. Citations for MEDLINE
are created by the NLM, international partners, and collaborating organizations.

         The MEDLINE data we have described refer to publication; my objective is to
measure innovation. I think that publication is closely related to, and a good indicator of,
innovation. The majority of the publications covered in MEDLINE are scholarly
journals, and novelty is generally a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for
publication in such journals.17 However, the novelty criteria used by scholarly journals
undoubtedly differ from those used by other authorities (e.g. the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office or Cancer Care Ontario’s Disease Site Groups).
         Table 3 shows data on incidence in 2002, by region (less vs. more developed),
and number of MEDLINE article citations, for 25 cancer sites as defined in
GLOBOCAN. I calculated both total and drug-therapy article cites for each cancer site,
from which non-drug cites may also be computed:
  TOTAL_CITEi = the total number of MEDLINE articles pertaining to cancer site i
   DRUG_CITEi = the number of MEDLINE articles pertaining to drug therapy for
              cancer site i
NONDRUG_CITEi = other MEDLINE articles pertaining to cancer site i
              = TOTAL_CITEi - DRUG_CITEi

Using the data in Table 3, I estimated the following four models:

Model 1: ln DRUG_CITESi = α1 + βDW ln INC_WORLDi + ei

Model 2: ln NONDRUG_CITESi = α2 + βNW ln INC_WORLDi + ei

Model 3: ln DRUG_CITESi = α3 + βDM ln INC_MOREi + βDL ln INC_LESSi + ei

Model 4: ln NONDRUG_CITESi = α4 + βNM ln INC_MOREi + βNL ln INC_LESSi + ei

where:

     INC_WORLDi = the incidence of cancer at site i throughout the world
       INC_MOREi = the incidence of cancer at site i in the more developed region
        INC_LESSi = the incidence of cancer at site i in the less developed region

         Estimates of these equations are shown in Table 4. Estimates of model 1 indicate
that the elasticity of MEDLINE drug cites with respect to cancer incidence throughout


17
  Novelty is also a necessary condition for patenting. A searchable U.S. patents database exists, and some
investigators have used patent counts and citations as innovation indicators. However the U.S. patent
classification system is much cruder than the MeSH classification system with respect to medical
innovation, and is inadequate for our purposes.
                                                                                                           14

the world is 0.60, and is significantly different from zero. Estimates of model 2 indicate
that the elasticity of MEDLINE non-drug cites with respect to cancer incidence
throughout the world is virtually identical, and is also significantly different from zero.
There is more publication (presumably indicating more research and innovation) related
to cancers with higher incidence. A 10% increase in cancer incidence is associated with a
6% increase in both the number of drug-therapy publications and non-drug-therapy
publications.
        Models 3 and 4 distinguish between incidence in the more developed and less
developed regions. Model 3 indicates that the number of drug-therapy publications is
related to incidence in the more-developed region but not to incidence in the less-
developed region. Model 4 indicates that the number of non-drug-therapy publications is
also related to incidence in the more-developed region but not to incidence in the less-
developed region, although the more- vs. less-developed difference between the
sensitivity of the number of drug-therapy publications (βDM - βDL = 0.73) is almost three
times as large as the more- vs. less-developed difference between the sensitivity of the
number of non-drug-therapy publications (βNM - βNL = 0.27).
        I think that the most plausible explanation for the lack of a relationship between
the incidence in developing countries and the amount of pharmaceutical innovation has
been weak or nonexistent incentives for firms to develop medicines for diseases primarily
afflicting people in developing countries. Although the size of the developing-region
market is large, the prices manufacturers expect to receive in this market are probably
very low.18

III.    Discussion


        I performed two analyses of the relationship, across cancer sites, between cancer
incidence and pharmaceutical innovation, using two different measures of the latter: the
number of distinct chemotherapy regimens for treating the cancer site, and the number of


18
  Prices of other (non-drug) medical treatments (e.g., hospital care) are also undoubtedly lower in the
developing region than they are in the developed region. But the ratio of the expected drug price to the
price of other medical treatments may be lower in the developing region (due to the low marginal cost of
drugs). This could explain why (βDM - βDL) is almost three times as large as (βNM - βNL).
                                                                                              15

articles published in scientific journals pertaining to drug therapy for that cancer site.
Both analyses indicated that the amount of pharmaceutical innovation increases with
disease incidence. The elasticity of the number of chemotherapy regimens with respect
to the number of cases is 0.53. The elasticity of MEDLINE drug cites with respect to
cancer incidence throughout the world is 0.60. These estimates are quite close, despite
the fact that the innovation measures used are quite different.
        If the ratio of price to marginal cost for branded drugs with patent protection is
about 6:1, as some evidence suggests, then the elasticity of variable profit with respect to
price is likely to be similar to the elasticity of variable profit with respect to the number
of consumers. This suggests that the elasticity of innovation with respect of price is
similar to the elasticity of innovation with respect to market size, which I estimate to be
in the .53 to .60 range. This estimate is very consistent with Giaccotto, Santerre and
Vernon’s (2005) estimate (0.583) of the elasticity of pharmaceutical industry R&D with
respect to the real price of pharmaceuticals. That study employed time series
econometric techniques to explain R&D growth rates using industry-level data from 1952
to 2001.
        A recent paper by Abbott and Vernon (2005) suggests that the elasticity of
innovation with respect to price may be somewhat higher. Using Monte Carlo
techniques, they model how future price controls in the U.S. will impact early-stage
product development decisions within the context of a net present value framework that
appropriately reflects the uncertainty associated with R&D project technical success,
development costs, and future revenues. Using partial-information estimators calibrated
with the most contemporary clinical and economic data available, they estimate that
cutting prices by 40 to 50 percent in the U.S. will lead to between 30 to 60 percent fewer
R&D projects being undertaken (in early-stage development). The elasticity of
innovation with respect to price is therefore in the 0.67-1.33 range. Since evidence from
the 2002 MEPS suggests that the ratio of price to marginal cost is lower than 6:1, the
elasticity of variable profit with respect to price is likely to be greater than the elasticity
of variable profit with respect to the number of consumers, so my estimates seem
compatible with Abbott and Vernon’s.
                                                                                                          16

            My estimates, and those obtained by other authors using very different
approaches, imply that importation would be likely to significantly reduce the amount of
pharmaceutical innovation. It would also be likely to reduce employment in the U.S.
pharmaceutical industry. We can get a rough assessment of the employment impact of
reduced pharmaceutical innovation by examining the relationship, across pharmaceutical
companies, between the number of innovations and the number of employees. I defined
the number of innovations by a company as the number of FDA-approved active
ingredients contained in products sold by the company that are not contained in any other
company’s products.19 Data on the number of innovations by, and number of employees
of, 14 selected major pharmaceutical companies are shown in Table 5. Figure 2 plots the
log of the number of company employees against the log of the number of innovations.
The relationship depicted is highly statistically significant: the elasticity of employment
with respect to the number of innovations is 0.71 (p-value < .001).
