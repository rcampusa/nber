                                              ABSTRACT

Regulation and the negligence rule are both designed to obtain compliance with desired standards
of behavior, but they differ in a primary respect: compliance with regulation is ordinarily assessed
independently of the occurrence of harm, whereas compliance with the negligence rule is evaluated
only if harm occurs. It is shown in a stylized model that because the use of the negligence rule is triggered
by harm, the rule enjoys an intrinsic enforcement cost advantage over regulation. Moreover, this advantage
suggests that the examination of behavior under the negligence rule should tend to be more detailed
than under regulation (as it is).

        Regulation and the negligence rule are both designed to obtain compliance with
desired standards of behavior, but they differ in a primary respect: compliance with
regulation is ordinarily assessed independently of the occurrence of harm, whereas
compliance with the negligence rule is evaluated only if harm occurs. It is shown in a
stylized model that because the use of the negligence rule is triggered by harm, the rule
enjoys an intrinsic enforcement cost advantage over regulation. Moreover, this
advantage suggests that the examination of behavior under the negligence rule should
tend to be more detailed than under regulation (as it is).

1. Introduction
         Regulation and the negligence rule are both intended to achieve compliance of
behavior with desired standards, but they differ in a basic regard. Under regulation,
compliance with standards tends to be assessed before, or independently of, the
occurrence of harm—conformance with speed limits, fire safety codes, financial
regulations, and the like is usually evaluated whether or not harm has eventuated. 1 Under
the negligence rule, in contrast, conformity with legal standards is ordinarily examined
only on the condition that harm transpires—only if car accidents, fires, or financial losses
actually come about. 2
         The main point to be developed here is that because the negligence rule is
triggered by harm, the rule enjoys a fundamental enforcement advantage over regulation.
The advantage flowing from this characteristic of the negligence rule often renders the

         1
           This characterization of regulation describes how regulation is generally enforced. See, for
example, Posner (2010, ch. 13). But there are some settings in which the occurrence of harm could lead to
an investigation of compliance with regulation (even though compliance could also be examined
independently of the occurrence of harm). This possibility is discussed in Section 4.
         2
           See, for example, Keeton, et al (1984), p. 165, stating that a necessary element of a cause of
action for negligence is “[a]ctual loss or damage resulting to the interests of another”; and Dobbs (2000), p.
258, observing that “no claim for negligence will be recognized unless the plaintiff suffers actual harm.”



                                                                                                             1

rule a cheaper, more efficient method of enforcing socially desired behavior than
regulation.
         Moreover, just because of the enforcement cost advantage of the negligence rule,
it will frequently be economic for the assessment of behavior under the rule to be more
detailed than under regulation. This corollary conclusion may help to explain why in fact
the negligence determination is case-specific and usually more thorough than the
regulatory—why, for example, a court’s inquiry whether a fire at a restaurant was caused
by negligence will typically encompass a greater number of considerations than those
addressed by fire safety codes.
         In Sections 2 and 3 of this article, I analyze the enforcement cost advantage of the
negligence rule over regulation employing a stylized model of law enforcement. 3 In
particular, I suppose that there is a single type of behavior that society wishes to control,
and I make several assumptions that place regulation and the negligence rule on a level
playing field in all but one regard. Notably, I presume that the ability of both regulators
and of courts to assess compliance with standards is perfect and that the cost of assessing
compliance per instance is the same for each. These assumptions assure that the only
difference between regulation and the negligence rule in the model is that the use of the
negligence rule is occasioned by harm. 4
         I first compare regulation and the negligence rule supposing for simplicity that
compliance with regulation is assessed with certainty. Hence, the cost of verifying
compliance with regulation is incurred for sure. Under the negligence rule, however, the
cost of evaluating compliance is experienced only with the probability that harm occurs.
Consequently, the negligence rule clearly involves lower enforcement costs than
regulation. 5


         3
             Section 2 is informal, but contains numerical examples; Section 3 is formal.
         4
           These assumptions are not made because I believe that they are realistic; the ability of regulators
and of courts to assess behavior may not be the same in fact, and so may other factors of relevance to the
comparison of regulation and the negligence rule vary, as I will occasionally observe. But one must
abstract from all such differences in the analysis proper if one is to isolate the importance of the
characteristic of the negligence rule that it, but not regulation, is triggered by harm.
         5
           In the analysis, I consider, as I must, the effectiveness of regulation and of the negligence rule in
achieving compliance. In particular, I show that even though compliance is examined only with a
probability under the negligence rule, it will result in compliance under broad assumptions.


                                                                                                               2

                      Electronic copy available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2144553
        I then compare regulation and the negligence rule allowing for regulation to be
enforced probabilistically. Under this assumption, enforcement expenses under
regulation can be saved. Even so, I demonstrate that the negligence rule possesses an
enforcement cost advantage over regulation. 6 To illustrate, consider the case in which
compliance with a standard eliminates all possibility of accidents—suppose that
installation of a sprinkler system at a restaurant would eliminate any chance of harm to
individuals from a fire. Then the negligence rule would involve no costs, as no fire-
caused injuries would occur. But regulation would necessarily involve costs, for there
would have to be a positive probability of verification of compliance with regulatory
standards to induce the installation of sprinkler systems. More generally (when
compliance with a standard does not eliminate all possibility of accidents), the superiority
of the negligence rule will be seen to rest on the observation that under the rule,
compliance with a standard reduces the number of instances in which behavior is
examined, whereas under regulation, compliance with a standard does not reduce the
number of instances in which behavior is examined (installation of a sprinkler system
does not lower the frequency of monitoring).
            In Section 4, I discuss and interpret the conclusion from the model that the
negligence rule possesses a principal enforcement cost advantage over regulation. Here I
consider the following points, among others. First, an implication of the enforcement
advantage of the negligence rule is, as I noted at the outset, that it will desirable for
society to control more dimensions of behavior under the negligence rule than under
regulation. Second, despite the enforcement cost advantage of the negligence rule in the
model, regulation may be preferred to the rule for reasons going outside the model,
especially because of the judgment proof problem and difficulties in establishing
causation of harm (both of which dilute the threat of liability for negligence).
Consequently, in theory as in reality, it will generally be desirable for society to employ
regulation along with the negligence rule. Relatedly, given that regulation and the

        6
           The argument takes into account that regulation and the negligence rule must be enforced
sufficiently frequently that compliance under them is achieved. Because the minimum probability of
enforcement that achieves compliance is influenced by the maximum possible sanction for noncompliance,
I assume that the maximum possible sanction is the same under regulation and under the negligence rule—
otherwise one legal regime would possess an arbitrary enforcement advantage over the other.



                                                                                                      3
negligence rule ought to and do co-exist, the question arises whether satisfaction of
regulation should insulate a party from liability for negligence. The answer given is no,
essentially because of the first point, that it will not be economic for regulators to
evaluate as many dimensions of behavior as the courts.
         Before proceeding, let me note that there exists prior economically-oriented
writing on regulation versus liability. 7 This literature emphasizes factors other than
enforcement costs, 8 although the point that liability may have an enforcement cost
advantage over regulation is adumbrated there. 9 I should also state that my purpose here
is not to canvass and weigh the various advantages and disadvantages of regulation
versus liability, but rather to focus on the specific factor of enforcement costs.
2. A Model of Enforcement of Regulation and the Negligence Rule
         Assume that there is a precaution that a potential injurer 10 can take that would
lower the risk of harm but that involves a cost. For concreteness, imagine as above that
the precaution is installation of sprinklers in restaurants, and assume that a sprinkler
system would reduce the long-term risk of a fire at a restaurant from 4% to 1%, that a fire
would cause harm of $100,000, and that a sprinkler system would cost $2,000.
         Suppose that the social goal is to induce a precaution whenever the benefit it
would yield—a reduction in expected harm—would outweigh its costs—comprised of the
cost of the precaution itself and of the costs of law enforcement. 11 In the example of the
sprinklers, the benefit of the precaution would be $3,000, for a sprinkler system would

           See Shavell (1984a, b) and Wittman (1977); and see also Kolstad, Ulen, and Johnson (1990) and
the collection of articles in Kessler (2011a), particularly Posner (2011) and Shleifer (2011).
         8
           As Kessler (2011b) notes in his summary of the literature, the factors that are examined include
rules versus standards, the judgment proof problem, imperfect judicial decisionmaking and incentives, and
matters of political economy.
         9
           See my remarks in Shavell (1984a, p. 364), mentioning that liability may enjoy an advantage
because it applies only with a probability.
         10
            I will often refer to a potential injurer simply as an injurer even though the “injurer” may not in
fact cause harm.
         11
           Equivalently, the social goal is to induce a precaution whenever it would lower total social
costs, equal to the sum of expected harm, the cost of the precaution, and the costs of law enforcement.



                                                                                                                  4
lower expected harm from 4% x $100,000 or $4,000, to 1% x $100,000 or $1,000. 12
Because the cost of a system is $2,000, it would be desirable for the law to require
sprinklers as long as the enforcement cost would not exceed $1,000 per restaurant.
         Society is presumed to have two alternative legal instruments for achieving use of
precautions, namely, regulation and the negligence rule, and they are employed at
different times.
         Regulation applies at time 1, a time at which an injurer has either taken a required
precaution or has not, but before an accident has had a chance to occur. Under
regulation, the regulator checks to verify whether the required precaution has been taken.
If it has been, that is the end of the matter; but if the precaution has not been taken, a
monetary sanction for noncompliance is imposed.
         The negligence rule applies only at time 2, a time by which an accident resulting
in harm has had a chance to occur. Under the negligence rule, a suit may be brought
provided that harm has occurred. If a suit is brought, a court will verify whether a
required precaution was taken. If the precaution was taken, the injurer will be found non-
negligent; but if the precaution was not taken, the injurer will be found liable for
negligence and will pay damages equal to the harm caused. Thus, if a sprinkler system is
a required precaution but a restaurant did not install sprinklers and a fire occurred as a
result, the restaurant could be sued and made to pay damages of $100,000.
         Regulation and the negligence rule are assumed to be essentially identical law
enforcement instruments, except for the fact that regulation at applies at time 1, whereas
the negligence rule applies at time 2 only if harm occurs. In particular, I assume that
each legal instrument operates free of error—the regulator and the court make perfect
determinations of whether precautions were taken. I also assume that each instrument
involves the same enforcement cost per instance of verification that a precaution was
taken 13 and that this enforcement cost is borne by the state. 14

         12
            As illustrated, the expected harm means probability-discounted harm. For analytical
convenience, I assume that society and injurers are risk neutral: they evaluate risky prospects in terms of
their expected values rather than in a more complicated manner reflecting risk aversion. On the concepts of
risk neutrality and risk aversion, see, for example, Pindyck and Rubinfeld (2009, pp. 165–170) and Shavell
(1987, chap. 8).
         13
            This simplifying assumption about costs may not hold in fact. For example, it could be difficult
to ascertain whether a precaution was taken after harm occurred because an accident might destroy relevant


                                                                                                          5
         Let me now compare regulation and liability, first considering the case in which
enforcement is certain and then the case in which enforcement is probabilistic.
2.1 Certain Enforcement
         I here suppose that regulation is enforced with certainty in the sense that
compliance with a required precaution is checked for sure. Thus, whether a restaurant
has installed a sprinkler system is definitely verified at time 1. 15 The motivation for
examining this case is both expositional convenience and that the case is sometimes
descriptive of reality.
         Because regulatory compliance is investigated with probability one, compliance
can be induced as long as the sanction for noncompliance exceeds the cost of the required
precaution. In the example of the sprinkler system, a restaurant will be led to meet the
installation mandate as long as the sanction for failure to do so exceeds the $2,000 cost of
the system. I assume that sanctions are at least equal to the cost of compliance and that
injurers’ assets are sufficient to pay such sanctions; hence, injurers will comply with a
regulatory requirement to take a precaution.
         Further, because compliance will be checked with certainty, the enforcement cost
of verifying the taking of precautions will be borne with certainty. Thus, if the cost of
verifying that a sprinkler system is installed is $500, this amount will be the cost of
enforcement of regulation per restaurant. Note that if $500 is the enforcement cost,
regulation of the use of sprinkler systems will be worthwhile, for the benefit of a
sprinkler system is $3,000, whereas total costs will be less, $2,500— the sum of the
$2,000 cost of a system and the $500 enforcement cost. More generally, if the cost of
determining the presence of a sprinkler system is less than $1,000, it will be worthwhile




evidence. The enforcement cost advantage of the negligence rule that I demonstrate here would obviously
be reduced to the extent that the cost of determining a precaution is higher after an accident than before.
         14
           Were I to allow for the bearing of costs by private parties in connection with law enforcement, I
would have to analyze the private versus the social incentive to bring suit, among other issues. This would
make the playing field for the comparison of negligence and regulation unlevel and introduce
complications into the analysis that are distracting for my purposes.
         15
             In reality, regulators would want to verify not only that a sprinkler system had been installed but
also that it is functional. Hence, the interpretation of “checked for sure” might be checked for sure every
time period, such as every year.


                                                                                                              6
regulating sprinkler systems; but if the verification cost exceeds $1,000, regulation will
not be worthwhile, for the cost of a system plus the enforcement cost will exceed $3,000.
        Under the negligence rule, suppose here that there will be a suit and compliance
will be assessed by the court whenever harm occurs. This implies that restaurants will be
induced to install sprinkler systems. In particular, if a restaurant does not install a
system, there will be a 4% chance of harm, in which case the restaurant will be found
liable and have to pay damages of $100,000; thus its expected liability expense will be
$4,000. If a restaurant does install a system, its expense will be only $2,000. Hence, the
restaurant will install the system. More generally, an injurer will always be led to take a
required precaution under the negligence rule, provided that, as in the sprinkler example,
the benefit of the precaution exceeds its cost, 16 and provided also that the injurer has
sufficient assets to pay for the harm, something that I assume is true. 17
        The enforcement cost of obtaining compliance under the negligence rule is
incurred only when harm occurs. In the sprinkler system example, the enforcement cost
is incurred with only a 1% probability, and the expected enforcement cost per restaurant
is thus only 1% x $500 or $5. Note that the relevant probability of the bearing of the
enforcement cost is the probability of a fire given that the sprinkler system is installed—
the probability is 1%, not 4%. In other words, the very success of the negligence rule in
inducing compliance lowers the expected cost of checking compliance. Observe too that
the cost of checking compliance can be quite high and still the negligence rule will be
worth employing. As long as the expected cost of checking compliance is less than
$1,000, which is to say, as long as the actual cost of checking compliance is less than
$100,000, the negligence rule will be worthwhile employing (for 1% x $100,000 =
$1,000).



        16
             Let p1 designate the probability of harm h if the precaution is taken and p2 the (higher)
probability of harm if the precaution is not taken. The benefit of the precaution is thus the reduction in
expected harm due to the precaution, p2h – p1h. Assume that this benefit exceeds the cost of the precaution
c. To show that an injurer would be induced to take the precaution if required under the negligence rule,
observe that if the injurer takes the precaution, his expense is c, whereas if he does not, his expected
liability is p2h. But p2h ≥ p2h – p1h > c, so that it is better for him to spend c than not. This standard
argument was originally made by Brown (1973).
        17
             But see my remarks in Section 4 on the judgment proof problem.



                                                                                                          7
         We can summarize the comparison of enforcement costs under regulation and
under the negligence rule with two general statements. 18
         First, if it is desirable to require a precaution under both regulation and the
negligence rule, then the enforcement cost per injurer will be lower under the negligence
rule. Specifically, under regulation, the enforcement cost will equal the cost of
verification, whereas under the negligence rule the enforcement cost will equal only an
expected value: the cost of verification discounted by the probability of an accident given
that the precaution is taken. 19
         Second, and following from the first point, if it is desirable to require a precaution
under regulation, it must also be desirable to require the precaution under the negligence
rule, but it may be undesirable to require the precaution under regulation yet to require it
under the negligence rule. We saw this in the sprinkler example, where regulation is
desirable to employ if the cost of verification is less than $1,000, and where the
negligence rule is desirable to employ if the cost of verification is less than $100,000.
Hence, if the cost of verification is between $1,000 and $100,000, it is desirable to
employ the negligence rule to induce the use of sprinkler systems but not desirable to
employ regulation.
2.2 Probabilistic Enforcement
         I now assume that regulation is enforced probabilistically, such as that restaurants
are inspected on a random basis for compliance with a requirement that they have
installed sprinkler systems. The reason for studying this case is not only that regulation is
in fact often enforced probabilistically. It is also that one might suspect that the
enforcement cost advantage of negligence over regulation just discussed in Section 2.1
does not exist if regulation is enforced only with a probability, for that allows savings of




         18
           These statements also essentially describe the comparison of enforcement costs in the next
section with probabilistic enforcement of regulation.
         19
            Note this point implies that the expected enforcement cost under the negligence rule could well
be lower than the enforcement cost under regulation even if the verification cost per instance of use of the
negligence rule exceeds that per instance of use of regulation. In the sprinkler system example, if the cost
of verification under the negligence rule were $5,000 rather than $500, then the expected enforcement cost
under the negligence rule would be 1% x $5,000 or $50, which is less than the $500 cost under regulation.



                                                                                                           8
enforcement costs. However, as I stated in the introduction, the negligence rule still
holds an advantage over regulation in the present case.
         Let us first consider the achievement of compliance under probabilistic
enforcement of regulation. An injurer will comply and take the required precaution as
long as the expected sanction for noncompliance—the probability of being checked
multiplied by the sanction for noncompliance—is high enough to outweigh the cost of the
precaution. Thus, a restaurant will install a sprinkler system provided that the expected
sanction for not doing so exceeds the $2,000 cost of the system. Suppose, for instance,
that the probability of monitoring compliance is 50% and that the sanction for
noncompliance is $100,000. Then the expected sanction for noncompliance would be
$50,000, which greatly exceeds the $2,000 cost of the sprinkler system, so the restaurant
would comply with the regulation. Indeed, as long as the probability of monitoring is at
least 2%, the expected sanction would be at least $2,000 and compliance would be
induced. In saying this, I am presuming that the sanction for noncompliance is $100,000;
the motivation for this assumption is that the sanction available to the state under
regulation should be the same as it is under the negligence rule for the two instruments to
be on a level playing field. 20
         The cost of obtaining compliance under probabilistic enforcement of regulation is
now an expected cost, the probability of monitoring compliance multiplied by its cost.
Hence, it is optimal for a regulator to employ the minimum probability of monitoring that
will induce compliance; that will minimize the expected costs of enforcement. In the
example, the minimum probability is 2%, as stated in the last paragraph, for then the
expected sanction for noncompliance will just equal the $2,000 cost of the sprinkler
system and just induce compliance. At a 2% probability of monitoring, the expected cost
of enforcement per restaurant will be 2% x $500 or $10. Moreover, regulation will
clearly be worthwhile enforcing at this expected cost, since the benefit of the sprinkler
system is $3,000, its cost is $2,000, and the expected enforcement cost is only $10. As

         20
            Nevertheless, the argument that I am about to make demonstrating the superiority of the
negligence rule does not depend on the assumption that the sanction under regulation is $100,000 rather
than some other, higher figure. As long as the maximum sanction available for use under regulation equals
the sanction available under the negligence rule, and is at least equal to the harm, the conclusion about the
superiority of the negligence rule holds. See Remark (b) following Proposition 4 on this point.



                                                                                                            9
long as the enforcement cost per instance of checking compliance is less than $50,000,
regulation will be worthwhile undertaking, for at $50,000, the expected cost would be 2%
x $50,000 or $1,000, so that the cost of the precaution of $2,000 plus $1,000 would just
equal the benefit of $3,000 of the precaution.
        Next let us again consider the negligence rule. As I explained in Section 2.1, we
obtain compliance under the rule if, whenever there is an accident, there is a suit and a
court inspects the behavior of the injurer to see if he was negligent. In the case of the
sprinkler system, this meant that there would be checking of compliance with a 1%
probability, and thus that the expected enforcement cost would be only 1% x $500 or $5.
Thus, the enforcement cost under the negligence rule is lower than the $10 cost under
regulation, despite the use of the minimum probability of checking under regulation. The
advantage of the negligence rule is less than before, due to the use of probabilistic
enforcement of regulation, but it still exists. This diminished advantage of the negligence
rule is also reflected in the point that now the region of costs of checking compliance
under which it would be desirable to employ the negligence rule but not regulation is
from $50,000 to $100,000, rather than, as before, from $1,000 to $100,000.
        But why does the negligence rule retain its enforcement cost advantage when
regulation is probabilistically enforced? We can see that that is true in the example of the
sprinkler system, but is this result an artifact of the particular numbers that I chose for the
example? We need to understand the intuition behind the conclusion in the example
before we can accept it.
        The source of the advantage of the negligence rule can be appreciated by
reviewing the calculus of a restaurant under regulation and under the negligence rule.
Under regulation with a probability of inspection of 2%, the expected sanction that a
restaurant will bear if it does not install a sprinkler system will be 2% x $100,000 or
$2,000, so it will just be induced to install it. Further, if the probability of inspection is
any lower than 2%, such as 1%, a restaurant will not be led to install the sprinkler system
(at 1%, the expected sanction for failing to install the system would be only $1,000, half
of the $2,000 cost of the system).
        How is it that even though, under regulation, a 1% chance of inspection will not
lead to compliance with the sprinkler requirement, under the negligence rule, a 1%



                                                                                                 10
chance of inspection will lead to compliance with the sprinkler requirement? The answer
is that under the negligence rule, if the sprinkler system is not installed, the probability of
inspection will be higher than 1%—it will be 4%, because the accident probability will
rise, meaning that the expected sanction will be $4,000, which exceeds the $2,000 cost of
the system. In other words, the way that the incentive to take a required precaution works
under the negligence rule is that the probability of the sanction increases if the injurer
fails to take the precaution. That threat leads the injurer to take the precaution, and
because of the success of the threat, the actual frequency of checking is lower (and as I
remarked above, could be zero—if it were the case that the precaution eliminated the
chance of an accident). In contrast, under regulation the fact that inspection with a 2%
probability induces injurers to take the precaution of installing the sprinkler system does
not itself lower the likelihood of inspection; that likelihood is fixed. In summary, the
reason that the negligence rule enjoys an enforcement cost advantage can be stated in two
closely-related ways: the taking of a required precaution lowers the probability of costly
monitoring of compliance with the rule; and because the failure to take a required
precaution raises the probability of monitoring, the negligence rule achieves compliance
through a threat of what the probability of monitoring would be, rather than through the
actual probability of monitoring.
       At this point, I hope that I have conveyed the essence of the logic of the
advantage of the negligence rule over regulation even when enforcement of regulation is
probabilistic, but there is a remaining issue to be considered. In the example, the
probability of assessing behavior under the negligence rule was 1%, which was less than
the 2% minimum probability needed to obtain compliance under regulation. Yet what if
the probability of assessing behavior under the negligence rule had been higher than 2%
instead of being lower? This could be so in a modified example and thus it would seem
that under the negligence rule the probability of evaluation of behavior could be greater
than under regulation. Suppose, for instance, that we alter the example such that the
probability of a fire in the absence of a sprinkler system is 8% and that the probability of
a fire is 5% in the presence of a system. In this changed example, as in the original
version, the effect of the sprinkler system will be to reduce the probability of a fire by
3%, so that its expected value will remain equal to $3,000. But now the probability of



                                                                                             11
checking the behavior of a restaurant under the negligence rule will be 5%, exceeding the
probability of 2% under regulation. Does this mean that the negligence rule no longer
possesses an enforcement cost advantage over regulation?
         The answer is no, once we permit the negligence rule to be applied
probabilistically, just as we have allowed regulation to be applied probabilistically.
(Otherwise the comparison between regulation and the negligence rule would be biased,
as it would arbitrarily constrain the negligence rule.) The interpretation of a
probabilistically applied negligence rule is that if harm occurs, there is a probability
rather than a certainty of suit. Suit might not be brought even though an injurer has
caused harm occurs for many reasons, such as a victim’s difficulty in obtaining the
evidence needed to establish liability and to prove damages. Moreover, the probability of
suit can in principle be controlled by the state, as fees for bringing suit, evidentiary rules,
and the like are chosen by it. 21
         I will now demonstrate why, if the negligence rule is probabilistically enforced, it
is less expensive to induce a required precaution under that rule than under
probabilistically enforced regulation. Let me do this using the modified example.
Suppose that the probability of suit conditional on the occurrence of harm is 25%. This
probability was chosen so that, if a restaurant is negligent, the unconditional probability
of suit will equal 2%, namely, the probability of being checked for compliance under
regulation (note that 25% x 8% does equal 2%). Therefore, if a restaurant does not
install the sprinkler system, it will face an expected sanction of 2% x $100,000 or $2,000,
so it will just be induced to install the system. And since the restaurant will install the
system, the actual probability of a fire will be only 5%. Consequently, the true
probability of suit will be only 25% x 5% or 1.25%. Since 1.25% is less than 2%, the
negligence rule will be less expensive to enforce than regulation, as I claimed.
         The reasoning just employed applies generally and shows that no matter what the
numbers may be, the probabilistically applied negligence rule holds an enforcement cost




         21
           The argument that I am about to describe presumes that the state is freely able to choose the
probability of suit.



                                                                                                           12
advantage over probabilistically employed regulation. 22 In many circumstances, however,
as in the original version of the example, the likelihood of an accident will be sufficiently
low that the negligence rule without probabilistic application will be cheaper than
probabilistically employed regulation.
3. Formal Analysis of the Model
         Consider here the standard model of accidents, 23 in which risk neutral, identical
injurers can exercise care to lower the risk of harmful events. Let
         x = level and cost of care, x ≥ 0;
         p(x) = probability of harm; 0 < p(x) < 1; p′(x) < 0, p″(x) > 0;
         h = harm if an accident occurs, h > 0.
The social objective is to minimize social costs, which, in the absence of enforcement
costs (to be described), are
(1)    x + p(x)h.
Let the x that minimizes (1) be denoted x*(h). Assume that h is large enough that x*(h) is
positive, 24 so that it is determined by
(2)    p′(x)h = –1.
More generally, let x*(z) denote the x that minimizes x + p(x)z for any z. Observe that
x*(z) is increasing in z where x*(z) is positive. 25
         In the absence of any legal control over care, injurers will choose x = 0, for
exercising care is costly to them.




         22
            The general proof is given in Section 3.2, but a demonstration in the simple context of this
section in which there is a single type of precaution may be helpful. Let me use the notation from note 16.
The minimum probability needed to induce compliance with regulation is qR = c/h, for at this qR, the
expected sanction for noncompliance is (c/h)h = c. Now under the negligence rule, let qN denote the
probability of suit conditional on the occurrence of harm, and choose qN so that it satisfies qNp2 = c/h. It
follows that compliance will just be induced under the negligence rule: if the injurer does not take the
precaution, his expected sanction will be qNp2h = (c/h)h = c, so he will be just led to spend c. Therefore,
the actual probability of checking compliance under the negligence rule will be qNp1 < qNp2 = c/h = qR.
         23
              See Brown (1973) and, for example, Landes and Posner (1987) and Shavell (1987).
         24
              Since (1) is convex in x, x*(h) > 0 if and only if 1 + p′(0)h < 0, that is, if and only if h > –1/p′(0).
         25
           Implicit differentiation of the first-order condition determining x*(z), namely, 1 + p′(x)z = 0,
gives p″(x)x′(z)z + p′(x) = 0, or x′(z) = –p′(x)/(p″(x)z) > 0.



                                                                                                                  13
         The state can seek to control care under regulation, by which is meant a rule
prescribing a positive level of care as a standard and imposing a sanction if the standard
is not met. Let
         xs = standard of care; xs ≥ 0;
         s = sanction if x < xs; s ≥ 0;
         a = assets of injurers.
If xs > 0, I will say that there is regulation, whereas if xs = 0, I will say that there is no
regulation. I will assume that a > h. I will also assume that sanctions are feasible if a ≥
s. 26
         The state can also seek to control care under the negligence rule, by which is
meant a rule prescribing a positive level of care as a standard (possibly different from the
regulatory standard) and imposing a sanction equal to the harm h if harm occurs and the
standard was not met. If xs = 0, I will say that the negligence rule is not applied.
         When the state observes x under either regulation or the negligence rule, it bears
an enforcement cost; let
         k = cost to the state of observing and verifying x; k > 0.
For simplicity, I assume that individuals bear no costs associated with enforcement (other
than possible sanctions) under regulation and liability.
         The social objective is to minimize total social costs, that is, costs of care, x, plus
expected harm, p(x)h, plus expected enforcement costs. The socially optimal xs will
generally be denoted xs*. Let me now describe the use of regulation and the negligence
rule and why the negligence rule is superior to regulation.
3.1 Certain Enforcement
         Regulation is enforced with certainty. Assume here that if the regulator chooses
xs > 0, he will observe x with certainty and thus will incur k with certainty. Hence, social
costs will be
(3)     xs + p(xs)h + k

         26
             This assumption is appropriate when care x is interpreted as nonmonetary effort, for then taking
care of x still leaves an injurer with assets of a, so that he can pay a sanction of a. If care is interpreted as a
monetary expense, then the assets that an injurer would have available to pay as a sanction would be only a
– x. This latter case is more complicated, for the most part only notationally, so that I will not formally
consider it, even though the main conclusions applying to it would be the same as I will draw.



                                                                                                                14
presuming that xs is induced. If the regulator chooses xs = 0—that is, there is no
regulation—social costs will be
(4)    p(0)h,
for x will not need to be observed to induce x = 0.
        I will restrict attention to xs that can be induced. 27 An xs can be induced if there is
a feasible s such that s ≥ xs; and since s can be as high as a, xs can be induced as long as a
≥ xs. It is clear from (3) that if the optimal xs, that is, xs*, is positive, it minimizes xs +
p(xs)h, so it equals x*(h), which can be induced. 28 Hence, xs* = x*(h) if and only if
(5)    x*(h) + p(x*(h))h + k < p(0)h,
or, equivalently, if and only if
(6)    k < p(0)h – [x*(h) + p(x*(h))h];
otherwise xs* = 0. Note that the right-hand side of (6) is positive, since x*(h) minimizes x
+ p(x)h and is assumed to be positive. 29 To summarize, we have
        Proposition 1. Suppose that regulation is enforced with certainty. If it is optimal
to regulate, then the optimal standard of care xs* = x*(h) and social costs are x*(h) +
p(x*(h))h + k. It is optimal to regulate if and only if the cost k of observing care is
sufficiently low, that is, if and only if (6) holds.
        Negligence is assessed whenever accidents occur. Assume here that the
negligence rule is applied whenever accidents occur. Then, by well-known logic, 30 if xs
is set equal to x*(h), injurers will be led to choose x*(h). Namely, if an injurer chooses x
< x*(h), he will be liable for harm (which he can pay, since h < a), so that he will choose
among such x to minimize x + p(x)h. But x + p(x)h > x*(h) + p(x*(h))h for all x < x*(h)
since x*(h) is optimal. Further, x*(h) + p(x*(h))h > x*(h). Hence, x + p(x)h > x*(h) for
all x < x*(h); the injurer is worse off with x < x*(h) than with x*(h). Obviously he will
not choose x > x*(h). He will therefore choose x*(h).


        27
             This assumption is without loss of generality—see Section 3.3.
        28
             Since x*(h) < x*(h) + p(x*)h < 0 + p(0)h < h < a, we know x*(h) can be induced.
        29
             Specifically, since x = 0 is a possible x but is unequal to x*(h), we have 0 + p(0)h > x*(h) +
p(x*(h))h.
        30
             See originally Brown (1973).



                                                                                                              15
         If xs = x*(h), social costs will thus be
(7)    x*(h) + p(x*(h))(h + k),
for the cost k of assessing x will be borne only when accidents occur.
         It follows from (7) that x*(h) can be achieved under the negligence rule at lower
cost than under regulation, since p(x*(h))k < k. Hence, if regulation is optimal to
employ, so will be the negligence rule and it will be superior to regulation.
         It also follows from (7) that when xs = x*(h), it will be optimal to employ the
negligence rule if and only if
(8)    x*(h) + p(x*(h))(h + k) < p(0)h,
that is, if and only if
(9)    k < [1/p(x*(h))]{p(0)h – [x*(h) + p(x*(h))h]}.
Because the right-hand side of (9) exceeds the right-hand side of (6), it will be desirable
to employ the negligence rule more often than regulation.
         In summary, we have
         Proposition 2. Suppose that the negligence rule applies whenever accidents
occur. Then the negligence rule is superior to regulation: If regulation is desirable to
employ, the optimal regulatory standard of care x*(h) can be induced under the
negligence rule but at lower social costs, x*(h) + p(x*(h))(h + k); and if regulation is not
desirable to employ, the negligence rule may still be desirable to employ, and when so,
will result in lower social costs.
         Remarks. (a) It was shown that the negligence rule is superior to regulation when
the standard of care under the negligence rule is x*(h), but the optimal standard of care
xs* under the negligence rule is different from (and higher than) x*(h). 31 Therefore, the
advantage of the negligence rule is actually greater than was demonstrated above.
         (b) It was assumed that assets a exceed h, so that injurers can be induced to
choose x*(h) under regulation and under the negligence rule. If, however, a is
sufficiently below h, regulation may be superior to the negligence rule. The reason is that
         31
            Social costs under positive xs are xs + p(xs)(h + k), so that xs* = x*(h + k) > x*(h). It may not be
possible to induce x*(h + k) given assets a, but it is readily shown that even given assets of h, it is possible
to induce x > x*(h) that is superior to x*(h). Specifically, the derivative of xs + p(xs)(h + k) with respect to
xs is negative at xs = x*(h), so that it is desirable to raise xs above x*(h). Now we know that if xs = x*(h) and
the sanction is h, the injurer is strictly better off choosing x*(h) than not, for x*(h) < x*(h) + p(x*(h))h. It
follows by continuity that if xs is raised slightly above x*(h) and h is still the sanction, the injurer will
remain strictly better off choosing xs than being negligent.


                                                                                                              16
if a is low enough, the maximum level of care that can be induced under the negligence
rule will be less than is socially desirable and less than the level of care that can be
induced under regulation. Specifically, under liability, the highest xs that can be induced
is x*(a) + p(x*(a))a, for this is the highest possible expected expense for
noncompliance. 32 But x*(a) + p(x*(a))a < a, so that a higher level of care can be induced
under regulation than under the negligence rule. Further, if x*(a) + p(x*(a))a < x*(h),
then it is not possible to induce optimal care under the negligence rule, whereas it is
possible to induce socially superior care under regulation. Hence, certainly if k is
sufficiently low, regulation will be superior to liability.
3.2 Probabilistic Enforcement
         Regulation is enforced probabilistically. Suppose now that the regulator chooses
a probability with which to observe x; let
         qR = probability that the regulator observes x.
Hence, expected social costs given xs > 0 are
(10) xs + p(xs)h + qRk,
presuming that xs is induced. I will continue to restrict attention to xs that can be induced.
For an injurer to be led to choose xs, we must have qRs ≥ xs, that is, the expected sanction
for noncompliance must be at least the cost of compliance. Thus, the minimum qR that
produces compliance is xs/s. Because it is clear from (10) that the regulator would want
to employ the minimum qR that induces xs, the regulator will set qR equal to xs/s and also
will want to use the maximum available sanction.
         I will assume that the maximum available sanction is h, the sanction for
negligence. This assumption is made in order that regulation and the negligence rule are
implemented with the same enforcement tools 33—we do not want the comparison




         32
           If xs > x*(a) + p(x*(a))a, an injurer could be negligent, choose x*(a), and bear expected
expenses of x*(a) + p(x*(a))a; thus xs could not be induced.
         33
            That the level of the sanction is h is not crucial. In particular, as I show in Remark (b) after
Proposition 4, the comparison between regulation and the negligence rule would be essentially the same if
the sanction for noncompliance is higher than h, as long as it is the same for regulation as for the
negligence rule.



                                                                                                          17
between them to be affected by a difference in the maximum available sanction. 34 Since
h is the maximum available sanction, the regulator will choose
(11) qR = xs/h.
Observe that increasing xs raises enforcement costs because it increases the probability
with which observation by the regulator must occur to induce compliance. Social costs
are thus
(12) xs + p(xs)h + (xs/h)k.
Note that if xs = 0, (12) becomes p(0)h, which makes sense because when xs = 0, the
probability needed to induce compliance is 0. Let the xs that minimizes (12) be denoted
xR*. Because (12) is convex in xs, xR* = 0 if and only if
(13) 1 + p′(0)h + k/h ≥ 0 or k ≥ –h(1 + p′(0)h) = k* > 0.
That –h(1 + p′(0)h) > 0 follows from the assumption that x*(h) > 0. Now if k < k*, then
xR* > 0 and is determined by the first-order condition
(14) 1 + p′(xs)h + k/h = 0,
which implies that
(15) xR* < x*(h).
The explanation for (15) is that reducing xs slightly below x*(h) has no first-order effect
on xs + p(xs)h but does have a first-order effect in lowering the probability xs/h that is
needed to induce xs. We therefore have
         Proposition 3. Suppose that regulation is enforced probabilistically. If it is
optimal to regulate, then the optimal standard of care xs* = xR* < x*(h), where xR* is
determined by (14), the probability of observation of care by the regulator is xR*/h, the
sanction for noncompliance is maximal, h, injurers are just induced to comply with xR*,
and social costs are xR* + p(xR*)h + (xR*/h)k. It is optimal to regulate if and only if the
cost k of observing care is sufficiently low, that is, if and only if k < k*, where k* is
determined by (13).
         Negligence is probabilistically assessed when accidents occur. Assume here that
negligence is assessed with a probability if an accident occurs. Let

         34
              If the assumption of equal sanctions were not made, it is obvious that regulation could be better
or worse than the negligence rule because of the difference in the sanctions available under the two rules.
If, for instance, a very high sanction, much greater than h, were available to enforce regulation, then
regulation could be enforced with an extremely low probability, so could be superior to the negligence rule.



                                                                                                            18
        qN = probability that courts examine x given that an accident occurs.
Because the goal is to show the superiority of the negligence rule over regulation,
suppose that regulation is optimal, that is xR* > 0, and that the negligence standard is the
optimal regulatory standard xR*. Then social costs given qN and xR* will be
(16) xR* + p(xR*)(h + qNk),
provided that xR* is induced, and I will restrict attention to qN such that xR* is induced.
Denote by qN* the minimum probability that induces xR*.
        I now show that qN* is unique, positive, and determined by
(17) x*(qNh) + p(x*(qNh))qNh = xR*.
That there is a unique positive qN* satisfying (17) is clear, for the left-hand side of (17) is
0 at qN = 0, is strictly increasing in qN , and equals x*(h) + p(x*(h))h > xR* at qN = 1.
Observe also that (17) implies that
(18) x*(qN*h) < xR*.
It follows that at qN*, the injurer is just induced to choose xR*: if he decides to be
negligent, he will choose x*(qN*h) < xR*, and by (17) he will bear expected costs equal to
xR*. It is also clear that if qN < qN*, the injurer will decide to be negligent. In particular,
we know that x*(qNh) is non-decreasing in qN and that the left-hand side of (17) is strictly
increasing in qN. Hence, if qN < qN*, we have x*(qNh) ≤ x*(qN*h) < xR* and
(19) x*(qNh) + p(x*(qNh))qNh < x*(qN*h) + p(x*(qN*h))qN*h = xR*.
Consequently, the injurer will be better off if he is negligent and chooses x*(qNh) than if
he elects xR*.
        It follows that the negligence rule more cheaply induces xR* than regulation.
Specifically, (17) implies that
(20) p(x*(qN*h))qN*h < xR*.
We also know that
(21) p(xR*) < p(x*(qN*h))
since x*(qN*h) < xR*. Further, (20) and (21) imply that
(22) p(xR*)qN*h < xR*.
Dividing by h, we obtain
(23) p(xR*)qN* < xR*/h,




                                                                                              19
that is, the probability of assessing negligence is less than the probability of assessing
compliance under regulation. (Note that the intuition behind this result is what was
explained informally in Section 2: compliance under the negligence rule is obtained by
the threat of assessment of compliance with a probability p(x*(qN*h))qN* that is based on
a level of care less than the negligence standard, but the actual probability of assessment
of compliance p(xR*)qN* is lower because it is based on the level of care equal to the
negligence standard.) It follows from (23) that
(24) xR* + p(xR*)h + p(xR*)qN*k < xR* + p(xR*)h + (xR*/h)k,
namely, social costs (16) under the negligence rule are less than social costs (11) under
regulation. It is also clear from (24) and the above discussion that the set of k for which
it will be desirable to employ the negligence rule is larger than that under regulation.
        In summary, we have
        Proposition 4. Suppose that the negligence rule and regulation are enforced
probabilistically. Then the negligence rule is superior to regulation: If regulation is
desirable to employ, the optimal regulatory standard xR* can be induced under the
negligence rule but at lower social costs, xR* + p(xR*)(h + qN*k) since p(xR*)qN* < xR*/h;
and if regulation is not desirable to employ, the negligence rule may still be desirable to
employ, and when so, will result in lower social costs.
        Remarks. (a) It may be possible to induce xR* under the negligence rule at lower
cost than under regulation even if negligence is assessed with certainty when harm
occurs, for p(xR*) < xR*/h may hold.
        (b) Proposition 4 is also valid for any sanction s > h that is employed for
noncompliance under both regulation and the negligence rule. To establish this, note that
for such an s, (11) becomes qR = xs/s; (14), defining xR*, becomes 1 + p′(xs)h + k/s = 0,
implying that xR* < x*(h); and (17), defining qN*, becomes
(17′)   x*(qNs) + p(x*(qNs))qNs = xR*.
This equation has a unique solution as in the proof of Proposition 4, for the left-hand side
of (17′) is 0 at qN = 0, is strictly increasing in qN, and equals x*(s) + p(x*(s))s > xR* at qN
= 1. The latter is true because x*(s) + p(x*(s))s > x*(h) + p(x*(h))h > x*(h) > xR*. The
rest of the argument proceeds as in the proof of Proposition 4 and leads to the conclusion




                                                                                             20
that p(xR*))qN* < xR*/s, implying that the cost of inducing xR* under the negligence rule
is less than than under regulation.
        (c) Proposition 4 does not hold for s sufficiently below h. The explanation is
essentially that given in Remark (b) following Proposition 2.
3.3 Comment on the Assumption that Compliance is Induced
        I restricted attention in the analysis to standards xs that are induced. This was a
natural assumption to make, but it is worth pointing out that if the assumption were not
made, the outcome would not be superior—achievable social costs would not be lower.
The essential reason is as follows. Suppose that the optimal standard is xs* and that it is
not induced, so that injurers instead choose some lower x′. Then if xs = x′, xs will be
complied with and social costs will be less than or equal to those under xs*. Hence, no
advantage could have been secured by using xs* as the standard, implying that we can
restrict attention to standards that are induced.
        To be specific, consider the case where regulation is enforced with certainty and
suppose that compliance is not induced at xs*. Then injurers will clearly choose x = 0.
Also, since xs* must be positive for there to be noncompliance, social costs must be p(0)h
+ k under xs*. But social costs are lower if xs = 0, namely, p(0)h, and there is trivially
compliance with this standard. Hence, xs* could not have been optimal, so we can
restrict attention to xs that are induced.
        Next consider the case where negligence is assessed whenever accidents occur
and suppose that compliance is not induced at xs*. Since injurers choose x < xs*, they
choose x to minimize x + p(x)h, which is to say, they choose x*(h), so that social costs are
x*(h) + p(x*(h))(h + k). But this outcome can be achieved when xs = x*(h), which is an
xs that is induced. Therefore, xs* could not have resulted in lower costs than an xs that is
induced.
        Analogous arguments apply in the cases where enforcement is probabilistic.
4. Discussion
        I here discuss a number of issues relating to the interpretation of the analysis of
the model.
        The consistency of theory and actuality—the negligence determination is in fact
generally more detailed than the regulatory. The theoretical conclusions reached in the



                                                                                              21
model suggest that the negligence rule should be employed to control risks more
comprehensively than regulation. Indeed, because it was shown that the expected
enforcement cost of controlling a precaution under the negligence rule is lower than the
expected enforcement cost under regulation, in strict logic it is always better to utilize the
negligence rule to induce a precaution in the world of the model. 35 The essence of the
argument was, of course, that the frequency with which the taking of a precaution is, or
must be, assessed in order to induce it is lower under the negligence rule than under
regulation.
         Reality seems broadly consistent with theory in the sense that negligence
determinations are usually concerned with a wider spectrum of behavior than
determinations of regulatory compliance. A negligence determination can in principle
address any type of precaution, for the failure to take any action that would have lowered
expected harm by more than its cost constitutes negligence—the precise description of a
risk-reducing action does not matter. 36 In contrast, regulation does not generally mandate
the taking of any precaution that would have lowered expected harm by more than its
cost, but rather usually requires the taking of only a specific list of precautions (even if a
long list). 37 Thus, whether a restaurant placed paper decorations at a special event too

         35
           Why this implication does not hold if certain assumptions made in the analysis are relaxed is
discussed shortly below.
         36
            This point is reflected in the definition given by Learned Hand of the duty of care that must be
taken to avoid a finding of negligence: “[T]he . . . duty, as in other similar situations, to provide against
resulting injuries is a function of three variables: (1) The probability that [the harmful act will occur]; (2)
the gravity of the resulting injury, if [it] does; (3) the burden of adequate precautions. . . . [I]f the
probability be called P; the injury, L; and the burden, B; liability depends upon whether B is less than L
multiplied by P: i.e., whether B less than PL.” United States v. Carroll Towing Co., 159 F.2d 169, 174 (2d
Cir. 1947). See also RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF TORTS § 3 (2010), stating that “[a] person acts negligently if
the person does not exercise reasonable care under all the circumstances. Primary factors to consider in
ascertaining whether the person's conduct lacks reasonable care are the foreseeable likelihood that the
person’s conduct will result in harm, the foreseeable severity of any harm that may ensue, and the burden
of precautions to eliminate or reduce the risk of harm.”
         37
             For example, a Florida statute addressing barriers that must surround residential swimming
pools lists lists eight specific requirements. See Florida Statutes Annotated, Chapter 515.29. Another
example is the New York City Fire Code that sets out a list of hundreds of mandated precautions. See
www.nyc.gov/html/fdny/pdf/firecode/2009/fire_code_ll26_2008_amended_ll37_41_64_2009_final_compl
ete.pdf. Although the fire code is lengthy, it does not cover all forms of negligence in relation to fire, for §
101.3 reads “Intent. The purpose of this code is to establish reasonable minimum requirements and
standards for life safety and property protection....” However, a qualification to the statement that
regulations contain only lists of specific precautions is that some regulations include open-ended standards.
Driving regulations, for instance, often forbid reckless driving, which in theory might include a broad


                                                                                                             22
close to high-temperature halogen lamps would presumably be considered in a
negligence determination if the decorations caught fire and caused harm, but the
particular matter of the proximity of halogen lamps to paper decorations might not be
covered by fire safety regulations. 38 To express the point under discussion somewhat
differently, regulation ordinarily sets only minimum standards of required behavior, so
that satisfaction of regulation does not insulate a person from liability for negligence. 39
         Regulatory enforcement triggered by the occurrence of harm. Although I have
characterized regulation as enforced independently of the occurrence of harm, this is only
a central tendency, for adverse events may attract the attention of regulators and result in
investigation of compliance. A fire, a crash, or an oil spill, for example, may lead
regulators to inquire whether safety rules were violated. That regulation may be enforced
in this manner is consistent with the theory developed here, for the costliness of
regulatory enforcement explains why regulators do not examine compliance with
certainty, meaning that if an accident occurs, regulators often will not have determined
whether the injurer was in compliance. Furthermore, regulators will then have an
affirmative reason to investigate compliance, because the occurrence of an accident is a
signal that the injurer was not in compliance. Additionally, to the degree that regulated
parties anticipate that their compliance will be checked if there is an accident, their
incentives to satisfy regulation will resemble those that I associated with the negligence
rule.
         Is the analysis intrinsically addressed to regulation versus negligence or instead
to ex ante versus ex post control of behavior? The observations of the preceding
paragraph, that regulation is in fact not purely ex ante nature in nature, reflect the point


spectrum of negligent driving behavior. The New York traffic laws state that “Reckless driving shall mean
driving ... in a manner which unreasonably interferes with the free and proper use of the public highway, or
unreasonably endangers users of the public highway. Reckless driving is prohibited.” See MCKINNEY’S
CONSOLIDATED LAWS OF NEW YORK ANNOTATED, VEHICLE AND TRAFFIC LAWS, §1212 Reckless Driving.
To the extent that such standards are enforced, regulation becomes more expansive.
         38
            The New York City Fire Code does not appear to apply to the proximity of halogen lamps to
paper decorations. It addresses in § 308.3.3 only the risks of the proximity of open flames to decorations –
it says “Separation from combustibles. Open flames shall be kept at a safe distance from decorations. . . .”
         39
             See RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF TORTS § 16 (2010), stating that “[a]n actor's compliance with a
pertinent statute, while evidence of nonnegligence, does not preclude a finding that the actor is negligent
under § 3 for failing to adopt precautions in addition to those mandated by the statute.”


                                                                                                          23
that the main analytical conclusion of this article is at root not one about regulation
versus the negligence rule but rather about ex ante versus ex post (triggered-by-harm)
modes of inducing desired behavior. The ex post mode need not be the negligence rule
of tort law; it could also be regulatory enforcement that occurs after a harmful event,
resulting in a fine or a criminal sanction rather than a payment of damages to the injured
party.
         Qualifications to the theory—and why regulation may possess advantages over
the negligence rule. A factor that was not included in the model and that works against
the negligence rule is difficulty in proving causation, for this dilutes the threat of liability
but does not affect regulation. If it would be a problem to establish that an injurer caused
harm (for instance, a pollution-related harm), the likelihood of liability for negligence
would be reduced, but this point would be irrelevant for regulatory enforcement.
         Another omitted factor weighing against the negligence rule is the judgment proof
problem because it too dilutes the threat of liability. However, the judgment proof
problem could also interfere with regulatory enforcement, as it can diminish the threat of
a sanction for noncompliance with regulation. Nevertheless, the judgment proof problem
impinges more on the effectiveness of the negligence rule and may make regulation the
superior instrument of control. 40
         A third excluded factor that might be thought to favor regulation is the expertise
of regulators. It is natural to believe that regulators have more knowledge about their
areas of risk than do generalist courts, for example, that the Environmental Protection
Agency possesses more knowledge of environmental risks than courts. If so, regulators
would be better able to identify worthwhile precautions than courts. This line of
argument does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that regulation is superior to the
negligence rule, however. If regulators have superior information allowing them to


         40
            To illustrate, in the example of the sprinkler systems, suppose that the assets of a restaurant are
$10,000. Then it is clearly possible to induce the use of a sprinkler system, for its cost is $3,000: Any
sanction between $3,000 and $10,000 is feasible and will lead to use of a system if regulation is enforced
with certainty; and the highest feasible sanction of $10,000 will lead to use of a system as long as the
probability of regulatory enforcement is at least 30% for 30% x $10,000 is $3,000. However, use of the
sprinkler system will not be induced under the negligence rule. For if a restaurant owner does not install a
system, his expected liability will be 4% x $10,000 or $400, which is much less than its $3,000 cost. This
point is discussed in the Remark (b) following Proposition 2 and also in Shavell (1984a).



                                                                                                             24
formulate standards that are better than those the courts could determine on their own,
regulators could announce their standards but leave it to the courts to enforce the
standards employing the negligence rule. That is, the “regulators” would not regulate but
rather advise the courts. 41
         Desirability of the joint use of regulation and the negligence rule. The general
implication of the several preceding reasons why regulation may sometimes hold an
advantage over the negligence rule is that regulation should be employed along with the
negligence rule. In particular, if both instruments are utilized, then, on one hand, society
will be effectively guaranteed that regulated precautions will be taken, which will be of
value because in certain contexts the negligence rule will be ineffective in inducing
precautions. On the other hand, society will usually be able to enjoy the savings in
enforcement costs that the negligence rule yields in the control of other precautions, as
explained in the analysis of the model. Thus, if both regulation and the negligence rule
are used to control fire risks, society will know that regulated precautions such as
installation of sprinkler systems and exit signs will be taken, even though judgment proof
parties would not take these precautions if their only inducement to do so were the
prospect of liability. At the same time, society will be able to obtain substantial savings
in enforcement costs by controlling a large swath of unregulated fire risks through the
negligence rule, which will be relevant for the many parties whose assets are not meager.
         An aspect of the desirability of the joint use of regulation and the negligence
rule—of the fact that parties must satisfy regulation and are subject to liability for
negligence—is that satisfaction of regulation should not insulate an injurer from liability
for negligence. 42 One way of explaining why it can be socially advantageous to find a
party negligent even though the party satisfied regulation is to point out the fallacy in a
commonly made argument to the contrary. This opposing argument is that if regulation
did not call for a precaution, say did not call for oily rags to be removed from storage
closets where they could present a fire risk, then it must have been that regulators
considered that precaution but decided not to require it (and hence why should courts

         41
          This in fact occurs, in that violation of regulations tends to result in a finding of negligence. See
RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF TORTS § 14 (2010), on statutory violations as negligence per se. However, the
presumption of negligence per se may be rebutted, as discussed in § 15.
         42
              This observation is also consisent with reality, as mentioned in note 39.


                                                                                                            25
require it?). The error in the argument is the presumption that when regulation was
formulated, regulators must have contemplated the whole menu of possible precautions
and required all those worth taking. Rather, a better view, which is in a sense the central
conclusion of the analysis of this article, is that it would be inefficient for regulators to
address most of the multitude of precautions that might in the ideal be worthwhile
controlling because inducing precautions can ordinarily be more cheaply accomplished
through use of the negligence rule. Therefore, that regulation does not ask for a
precaution to be taken does not mean that regulators decided that it did not need to be
taken. Instead, that regulation does not require a precaution to be taken often implies that
the precaution was not within their efficient ambit, because the precaution was in the vast
category of precautions best left to the liability system to control.
        An analogue to the enforcement cost advantage of the negligence rule over
regulation: an advantage of strict liability over corrective taxation. Let me conclude by
observing that there exists an enforcement cost advantage of strict liability over
corrective taxation that is analogous to the enforcement cost advantage of the negligence
rule over regulation studied in this article. Strict liability is, of course, the form of
liability under which injurers pay for harm done, and corrective taxation is the ex ante
form of control of activities under which injurers pay for the expected harm that they
generate, so that it may be regarded as the ex ante cousin of strict liability.
        Strict liability can be seen to require a lower probability of application than the
corrective tax and thus to hold an enforcement cost advantage for reasons closely-related
to those discussed in Sections 2 and 3. To illustrate, consider again the example of
restaurants and sprinkler systems. Under strict liability, a restaurant must pay for harms
due to fires that occur, and thus, as is readily verified, it would be induced to install a
sprinkler system. Consequently, the probability of fires and of incurring enforcement
costs would be only 1%. Under the corrective tax that is applied with certainty, the
restaurant would pay a tax of 4% x $100,000 or $4,000 if it did not install sprinklers and
a tax of 1% x $100,000 or $1,000 if it did install sprinklers. Hence, a restaurant would be
led to install the sprinklers under the tax, and enforcement costs would be borne with
certainty. Thus, the tax would lead to the same outcome, installation of sprinklers, as
strict liability, but it would be applied more often and thus be more expensive than strict



                                                                                                26
liability. If the tax were applied probabilistically, then enforcement costs could be saved,
but the tax would still have to be used with greater probability than strict liability and
thus still involve greater enforcement costs. 43
         A final comment is that under the corrective tax, unlike under strict liability, the
state would have to determine the precautions taken by an injurer – such as whether a
sprinkler system was installed – in order to compute the expected harm. Under strict
liability the authority need only determine the harm that eventuates. This suggests that
the per instance cost of application of the tax might exceed that of strict liability. 44
Nevertheless, if the amount of the tax is lower than the harm, there is less reason for the
taxed party to resist than under strict liability, suggesting that enforcement cost of the
corrective tax could be less than that of strict liability.




         43
             If the tax t is applied with probability qT, then qTt must equal the expected harm. Let me
assume, as I did in the analysis of Sections 2 and 3, that the maximum amount that can be collected from an
injurer is the same under ex ante enforcement as under liability, and let this amount be h for concreteness,
which is $100,000 in the example. Therefore, if no sprinkler system is installed, the maximum tax is
$100,000. Since this must equal the expected harm of $4,000, the minimum probability q of imposing the
tax is 4%. But this exceeds the probability 1% of suit under strict liability. More generally, using the
notation from note 16, we must have that qTt = p1h when care is taken and qTt = p2h when care is not taken,
for the tax must equal the expected harm. Since the maximum t is h, and since p1 < p2, the minimum qT
satisfies qTh = p2h, so the minimum qT that leads to a tax equal to expected harm is p2. But under strict
liability, the probability of harm and suit is p1 since parties are induced to take care.
         44
          My articles Shavell (2011, 2012) emphasizes the problem that the state would often have in
computing the corrective tax.
