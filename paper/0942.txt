                World Shocks, Macroeconomic Response,
                      and the Productivity Puzzle



                                ABSTRACT



     On the basis of a comparative growth analysis of ten major industrial

countries, it is shown that   the   productivity slowdown of the l970s can be
attributed to a combination of the energy and raw material price shocks and
the contractionary macroeconomic policies that were followed in response
to these shocks. For a raw material intensive sector the rise in the relative
price of material inputs has lowered gross output per unit of the other
complementary factors, labour and capital. For the aggregated manufacturing
sector of the ten economies this explains on average about 60% of the
productivity slowdown. A more disaggregated analysis for U.K. manufacturing
industries is also given.
     On the demand side, terms of trade deterioration has    reduced   real
income and consumption and the profit squeeze has lowered investment demand.
Fear of inflation and current account deficits has imparted a further
deflationary bias to aggregate demand management in most industrial countries.
Depressed demand and greater output variability have hampered factor
reallocation in response to the exogenous shocks.
     The overriding role of demand contraction, particularly in the non—
manufacturing industries, is shown in a comparative analysis of the aggregate
business sector and a partial view of labour productivity growth in the
service industries of these economies.
     The industrial countries can be contrasted with the middle income
developing countries where output and productivity continued to grow more
evenly after 1973, at the cost of large current account deficits and higher
persistent inflation. This provides further evidence that productivity
growth is closely linked to macroeconomic response.

INTRODUCTION


The output and productivity slowdown of the l970s seems a unique phenomenon

when viewed against the background of the whole of the post-Second World

War period. It has been widespread and has affected virtually all

industrial countries. It also seems to have been fairly widespread

sectorally, although this aspect has not yet been adequately investigated.

      Conventional growth accounting procedures (e.g., Denison, 1979,

Kendrick, 1981) decompose the slowdown in terms of quantity, quality, and

utilization of labour and capital inputs, research and development effort,

environmental regulations, etc. While these yield some partial explanations

and may narrow down the extent of the puzzle, they leave one unsatisfied

because there is a dominant characteristic of the slowdown that eludes

such explanation. With a few exceptions the beginning of the phenomenon

can be dated at about 1973, when a major break occurs in the slope of the

various time series. For a growth-accounting approach this is a rather

disturbing feature. Changes in the research and development effort,

conventional input qualities, and environmental regulations are gradual

processes. They can hardly explain sharp turning points, let alone the

close synchronization of developments across countries. On the other hand,

the very existence of such a watershed.may provide a helpful lead for

economic research. Rather than trying to chisel away the phenomenon into

little boxes, one can start the analysis at the other end, so to say. One

may concentrate on the turning point itself, try to characterize the

response to the worldwide shocks of the 1970s, and then ask to what extent

the events themselves could help to explain the apparent productivity

slowdown. Such an approach may still leave some open questions but it has

the advantage of a search for common causes as well as enabling one to

gain insight from the differences in response among countries or sectors.

     The first and obvious candidate for analysis is the sharp increase

in the price of energy. This in itself may not explain much, but when

viewed in the context of the general increase in the price of industrial

raw materials that occurred in the l970s, does provide a lead. For a raw-

material intensive activity the conventional two-factor view of the production

process is only valid when the relative price of the raw material (in

output units) or its unit input stays constant. When its relative price

rises and it is a complementary factor of production, productivity per

unit of the other factors, labour and capital, must fall. Profits must

also fall, the extent of the fall depending on the extent of real wage

rigidity. The profit squeeze will cause an investment slowdown which in

turn affects the accumulation of capital thereby causing a further slowdown

in labour productivity. As we shall see, the supply shifts of 1973-74 and

 1979-80 go quite a long way towards explaining the slowdown in the

manufacturing sector of some major industrial countries and also account

for international differences. The direct link between the raw-material

price shock and the productivity slowdown in manufacturing (first analysed

 in Bruno, 1981) is further explored for a cross section of ten OECD

countries, in Section I, which also contains a more disaggregated study

of U.K. manufacturing industries.

     Raw materials alone do not give a complete answer for manufacturing,

let alone for nonmanufacturing industries. As is well known, the oil and

raw-material price shocks have not only shifted aggregate supply for most

industrial countries, they have also set in motion contractionary forces

on the demand side. Terms-of-trade deterioration has reduced real income

and consumption; the profit squeeze has reduced investment demand; the

fear of inflation and of ensuing current-account deficits has also imparted

a deflationary bias to aggregate demand management in virtually all

industrial countries. Finally, there is the reinforcing interaction of

contracting export markets. A large part of the 1970s slowdown in output

and productivity growth can be ascribed to the combined effect of these

demand-side factors. This is discussed in part in the context of the

manufacturing sector (Section I) and more extensively in Section II, where

an international comparison of the aggregate business sector is studied.

A brief view of service industries is also given. It will be argued that

it is most probably the interaction of depressed demand (and greater output

variability) with the supply shocks that provides the main explanation for

the aggregate productivity slowdown.

     A major reason for the demand squeeze comes from the anti-inflation

bias of macro-economic policy in the major industrial countries.   This is

briefly   constrasted in Section III with the more expansionary policies

pursued by the middle-income developing countries, whose output and

productivity both continued to grow after 1973, but at the cost of higher

persistent inflation and large current-account deficits. While this option

can probably not be pursued by all countries simultaneously, it supports

the argument that productivity growth and macro-economic response are

closely linked.



I. INPUT SUBSTITUTION, DEMAND, AND THE PRODUCTIVITY SLOWDOWN: AN

    INTERNATIONAL COMPARISON OF THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR


A convenient starting point for empirical study is protided by comparative

developments in the manufacturing sector of the industrial countries. This

sector differs less from one country to another than the total business

economy and it is heavily dependent on purchased material inputs. Moreover,

there is sufficient cross-country variation in both the extent of the

slowdown in factor productivity and the magnitude of the input price shock

to allow a test of the possible relationship between the two.

     The approach here is to extend the conventional two-factor production

framework by adding a third input, purchased materials or intermediate

goods, and proceed under the simplifying assumption that gross output in

manufacturing can be described in terms of a linearly homogeneous two-level

function Q = Q[V(K, L, T), N], where V is a real value added index,

K and L are capital and labour, N represents the composite material

input, and T represents pure technical progress. An earlier paper (Bruno,

1981) expounded the empirical conditions permitting such separability of

V and     N. While this assumption may not be legitimate when considering

the energy input by itself, it- most probably is in the case of non-energy
+                                         -5-                                        +


inputs    (see, e.g., Berndt and Wood, 1979).       Given the smallness of the

direct energy input in the composite N for manufacturing (of the order

of 10 percent), such an approximation may be empirically valid.

        Using lower-case letters for logarithms (q -            log Q, etc.) and
dotted symbols for time derivatives, and denoting the output elasticity

of intermediate goods by       and that of capital within V by                we can
write




            4 = (1 -     +    = (1.   -         +   + (1.   -
                                                                4)9]   +           (1)


where A is the rate of technical progress in V.

     Next we assume that the elasticity of substitution between V and N

is constant (denoted by ) from which it follows that




            nq-air,                                                                (2)




where Tr is the (log) relative price of the intermediate input.

Substituting into (1) we get



            4- [4&+ (l-4).] =A-a(1-8)1.                                            (3)




The left-hand side of equation (3) represents the change in factor

productivity as measured in terms of gross ouput relative to the weighted

capital and labour input. The share of 4 will be constant if V(K, L)

is a Cobb-Douglas production function. On the right-hand side of (3) we

have a conventional time-shift factor (A) which is augmented or reduced

byamaterial-input price term according as relative raw-material prices
+                                   -6-                                         +



fall   or rise over time. The coefficient of          in (3) is the product

of the relative share of N and V in Q [/(l -            )]   and their

elasticity of substitution (a). If we had constant proportiOnS (a = 0)

or no change in input prices    (fr = 0)   this substitution term would be

immaterial and the measurement of factor productivity would be invariant

to the role of raw materials or to the choice of output measure (gross

output or some GDP artifact).

       In my earlier paper a similar framework was applied to four large

industrial countries (the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and

Japan) and direct estimates of the parameters (, , a, A) were obtained

from a two-equation system consisting of (3) and the associated factor-

price frontier. The model also allowed for some cyclical variation in

factor utilization. This and related studies (Bruno and Sachs, 1982,

Lipton, 1981) suggested an estimate of a of the order of 0.3-0.4 for

the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany, and 0.7-0.8 for Japan.

While the hypothesis gives a good explanation of the relative ranking of

the productivity slowdown for the four countries as well as a quantitative

fit for the lowest (Germany) and highest (Japan), there is a sizable

unexplained residual for the United Kingdom and a more moderate one for

the United States. It could also be argued that the implied estimate of

a for Japan is somewhat high. At any rate, there seems little doubt that

a fall in productivity is associated with a rise in raw-material prices.

The data also confirm such an effect for each of the two shocks (1973-74

and 1979-80) separately.

       Table 1 gives the relevant average growth data for a wider sample of

ten OECD countries for the periods 1955-73 and 1974-80. Column (4) shows

(obtained   from a cross-section regression). Inspection of the figures

for the drop in labour and capital inputs [columns (2) and (3)] reveals

that this measure is not very sensitive to the choice of 'f   [a change of

      in q    changes the entries in column (4) by 0.06 on average]. There

is considerable variation in the estimated slowdown around the mean of

2.2 percent (from a base of 3.9 percent for 1955-73), the figures ranging

from less than 1 percent for Germany to more than 3 percent for Japan and

Sweden.

     Neither oil nor raw material prices were constant during the high

growth period preceding 1972 (see Bosworth and Lawrence, 1982, for a

detailed study). Once the effects of the Korean boom had worked themselves

out, they declined steadily at a real annual rate of 0.5-1.0 percent from

1955 until 1971-72. The trend was reversed at the beginning of the 1970s,

culminating in the price explosion of 1973-74. Raw-material prices then

caine down again until a new shock hit both types of goods in 1979-80.

     The magnitude of the total real input price shock (t*n)    is here

measured by the differences in average growth from 1955-72 to 1973-79

[column (5); Table 1]. Much of the cross-country variation in

though by no means all of it, stems from differential movements of the

real effective exchange rate that mitigated or accentuated the effect of

the exogenous shock on domestic relative prices. It is important to

stress again that even the external part of the real price increases is

only in part directly due to energy prices, although extraction costs, etc.,

may have been indirectly affected by the energy crisis. (For more details

on the large increase in primary non-fuel export prices see Kravis and

Lipsey, 1981.)

 prices and factor productivity growth is obtained by taking observations

 on average growth in each of the two sub-periods, 1955-73 and 1974-80, for

 the ten countries listed in Table 1, a total of 20 observations (not

 detailed here), and pretending that they come from a common underlying

 production model. Obviously, such an approach ignores the possible

 intercountry differences in basic productivity growth, quite apart from

possible differences in other parameters.

      It is interesting to note that even this simple regression (Table 2,

line 1) yields a significant and quite plausible estimate for the input-

price term (-0.25). As long as basic country differences in production

parameters are not correlated with the differences in raw-material
                                                                        price
changes this might give an unbiased estimate of the       term in

equation (3). However, while it can be argued that the shares       j
                                                                        and
,    and possibly the elasticity of substitution (cl), are similar in

different countries, factor productivity (X) almost certainly varies.

Moreover, the higher the basic factor productivity growth, the more

likely it is that real exchange-rate appreciation would be higher (or

depreciation lower) and ceteris paribus,       would thus be lower. This

would introduce an upward bias in the estimated effect of        Some

evidence of this can be obtained when one introduces the growth of public

consumption expenditure () into the regression. Since it is correlated

with real appreciation, its coefficient is overstated in the regression

and that of   r    is substantially reduced.
               n
     One way of overcoming this statisticaiproblem, at the cost of a

severe cut in degrees of freedom, is by going to the first differences of

average growth rates.   If it is assumed that countries may differ in basic

productivity attributes but that in themselves these attributes are time

invariant,   the problem is side-stepped. The resulting regression

(Table 2, line 3) shows two things. With a value of      of about 0.35

the coefficient of -0.17 suggests an average elasticity of substitution

of 0.32. At the same time the significant negative intercept (-1.18)

suggests a common element of the slowdown which is not captured by the

raw-material factor. It is interesting to note that the exclusion of

Japan, an outlier, from this regression only raises the frft coefficient

to 0.18, but the standard error falls (from 0.094 to 0.076), and R2

rises considerably (from 0.19 to 0.37).

     Regressions 5 and 6 add the deceleration in public expenditure and

total domestic absorption, respectively [see columns (6) and (7) of

Table 1]. These variables seem to improve the explanatory power

considerably, make the intercept nonsignificant, and hardly change the

estimate of thu. For a regression on 10 observations this is a

satisfactory result. It is important to stress that the deceleration in

total absorption (M) is virtually uncorrelated with the acceleration

in raw-material prices (the correlation coefficient between 1A and

is -0.06) so that Eâ may be considered a truly independent factor. For

a subsector such as manufacturing it can probably also be considered

exogenous.

     On the assumption that these two variables exhaust the productivity

slowdown we obtain the next regression (Table 2, line 7), which is forced

through the origin. This raises the estimate of a to 0.39 and is the

preferred regression. Table 3 shows the estimated components of the

slowdown and the errors of the regression by country. It is interesting

that with this simple model the four large countries previously mentioned

all come out virtually on the regression line (errors ranging between 0

and 0.1). On average raw materials explain about 60 percent of the

slowdown, with the demand squeeze explaining the remaining 40 percent.

Two outliers for which the regression under-explains are Sweden and

Canada and one extreme over-explained case is Italy.

     A glance at column (7) of Table 1 shows that Japan had by far the

largest demand squeeze. With such a small sample there is a danger of

accidentally attributing significance to a variable which only comes in

as a result of one extreme observation. Indeed, when regression 7 is run

without Japan the coefficient of     is rendered nonsignificant, though

it retains the same estimated value. However, the alternative regression

8, using public consumption (ti) as a proxy for demand management, is

highly significant and the estimated effect of raw-material prices is even

higher in this case (possibly reflecting an indirect income effect--the

share of this component in the slowdown rises to 75 percent). The earlier

reservation concerning correlation between     and      does not apply in

this case as the correlation coefficient for the increments 4 and t*

is virtually nil (0.055). For this regression Canada is no longer an

outlier but the error for Sweden remains high. Another demand factor,

exports, was also tried, but although it helps, the marginal improvement

in the estimate does not justify its separate mention here. Also, its

exogeneity with respect to productivity growth is probably more suspect.

The relationship between demand and productivity is discussed in greater

detail in the next section.

     At this stage we come to another important concomitant of the shock

of the l970s. Not only has the average growth level changed but so has

its variability. Looking at the variance of output growth in manufacturing

during sub-periods from 1955 to 1980 it can be shown that except in two
+                                  -14-                                  +



countries,   Denmark and Japan, the variance (or standard deviation)

increased after 1973 even though output growth dropped substantially.

The coefficient of variation, which is the ratio of the standard deviation

to the mean [shown in columns (1) and (2) of Table 4] has on average grown

by a factor of five. While this ratio is, of course, largely affected by

what has happened to its denominator (mean growth rate), it is nonetheless

indicative of the unprecedented change that has taken place in the economic

environment. At a time of severe fluctuations in output the average

optimal use of inputs per unit of output is necessarily greater than in a

situation of greater certainty. Average factor productivity must thus

fall. Geometrically this can be illustrated by comparing the mean cost

of two points on opposite branches of a U-shaped cost curve with the point

of minimum-cost production (assuming this is the equivalent output level

under certainty). Under uncertainty producers may opt for flatter cost

curves but at the price of a higher minimum cost. Some such argument may

account for an outlier like Sweden where the increase in relative

variability of output growth was particularly large (mean output actually

dropped in the late 197 Os). It is also known that in this country

reallocation of factors was hampered by government subsidies to ailing

industries.



A more dieaggregated view


Our view of manufacturing output as the outcome of an aggregate production

process is clearly an abstraction. The estimated effect of material

inputs still leaves open the question as to whether it is the outcome of

analogous substitution processes within subsectors or the result of a

change in the composition of demand in response to relative price changes.

The more disaggregated a view we take, the more likely it is that the

latter will dominate. A partial look inside the 'black box' is provided

by considering an intermediate division of the sector into major 2-digit

industries. The results of such an experiment for U.K. manufacturing are

reported in Table 5 and are based on an ongoing study by Louis Dicks-

Mireaux. Input prices were measured for each of the major industries

(from an input-output breakdown). Factor productivity growth, as defined

in equation (3), using separate shares () for each industry [see

column (1), Table 5], was regressed on share-weighted lagged input price

change as well as on the growth of total GDP (a proxy for aggregate demand

pressure).

     Column (2) of the table gives the measured share of materials and

intermediate inputs by industry. It here includes not only purchased

inputs from outside manufacturing (as was the case in the earlier aggregate

regressions) but also inputs that are internal to the broader manufacturing

sector (30 percent on average). The figures in italics indicate the

imported part of the material input. Columns (3), (4) and (5) give the

estimated coefficients (and standard errors) of the total productivity

shift, A, the elasticity of substitution, ,         and the elasticity of

GDP growth, ';    of   the two regressions in each industry, (a) excludes and

(b) includes 1r

     The regressions by and large confirm the results for the aggregate

sector. For 10 out of 14 industries the substitution term [column (4)]

is negative and in most cases highly significant. In only one industry

(order 8, instrument engineering) is the coefficient significantly positive

and in the remaining three (orders 7, 12, 14-15) it is zero or positive

but not significant. It should be noted that in these four industries the
+                                 -17-                                   +



share of the import component is very low (10 percent or less). Except

for food (order 3) the estimated elasticity of substitution ranges from

0.25 to 0.56--the average for the ten industries is 0.39 in the (a)

regressions and 0.27 in the (b) regressions. Inclusion of total GDP

growth takes away some of the indirect effect of raw-material prices, as

we saw in the aggregate regression. At this level of disaggregation the

substitution effect, or whatever phenomenon this variable measures, is

obviously significant in explaining productivity slowdown by industry.

     Similar results have also been obtained in an ongoing study based on

Israeli data by M. Bar-Nathan of the Bank of Israel. He obtains

significant negative coefficients for      in 10 out of 17 major industries

with all other industries showing nonsignificant coefficients. The

estimated average a of 0.6 is somewhat higher than in the United Kingdom,

but his regressions did not include aggregate GDP, only average hours

worked (as a proxy for demand).

     We conclude this section with a comment on the input substitution

hypothesis and the relevance of alternative theories. In this study we

have treated gross capital stock as a homogeneous input over time. It

may be argued that one result of a rise in energy prices may be that

pre-1973 capital becomes obsolete. In this case our measure of average

factor productivity would be biased. A useful alternative approach

(recently started by Baily, 1981) would be to measure the change in capital

stock and productivity in a way that takes this factor explicitly into

account.

     Which of these alternative views of the role of energy and materials

in production turns out to be empirically more fruitful must await further

study. Both, however, share the position that the productivity slowdown

in   manufacturing must somehow be related to the input price shocks of

the 1970s.



II. PRODUCTIVITY COMPARISONS FOR THE AGGREGATE BUSINESS SECTOR

We now turn to a more aggregative view of the total business sector.

While manufacturing and its subsectors are heavy users of raw materials,

the same cannot be said of most of the nonmanufacturing sectors and yet

the productivity slowdown in the economy as a whole seems, if anything,

to have been more marked than in manufacturing. To what extent can any

of the arguments advanced above also be applied to the broader economy?

       If we consider the economy as an aggregate productive framework, this

time employing labour and capital in conjunction with total imports, there

would be some analogy with our previous discussion. An increase in

relative import prices would cause substitution against imports, and

aggregate gross output (measured in some suitable form, per unit of the

two other factors) would grow more slowly. There are some important

differences here, however. First of all, unlike in the case of

manufacturing, there is no need to resort to a gross output measure (the

analogue would presumably be total real use of resources). Both the

quantity and the price of total imports are directly measurable so that

one could, at least in principle, attempt to construct a real GDP index

which is free of import price bias, and relate it to the inputs of labour

and capital. Any remaining effect of an increase in real import prices

on an unbiased factor-productivity measure could then only be the result

of misallocation of factors caused by the real shock or its interaction

with depressed aggregate demand or the increase in output variability,

arguments that would apply equally well outside the manufacturing sector.
+                                -21-                                    +


However, this would not, strictly speaking, be the same as the input-

substitution argument (part of the fall in demand is itself a reflection

of a terms-of-trade effect on real income- -see below).

     In trying to search for a test of these ideas our point of departure

is a recent study by Kendrick (1981). In this study the productivity

slowdown from 1960-73 to 1974-79 in nine OECD countries (the ten used here

excluding the Netherlands) is analysed in terms of the aggregate GDP of

the business sector and its average factor (labour and capital) use. With

minor modifications, columns (1) to (3) of Table 6 replicate Kendrickts

data. Column (4) shows an average factor-productivity slowdown which, on

the face of it, looks more marked than in manufacturing [cf. column (4)

of Table 1], and is particularly high for Italy and Japan (the figures are

otherwise quite similar). Kendrick applied a Denison-type growth-accounting

approach to the component analysis of this change. Other than the

conventional changes in labour quality and technical knowledge, the main

factors that accowit for the slowdown (Kendrick, 1981, p. 141, Table 7)

are reallocation of labour, economies of scale, capacity utilization, and

government regulations. Together these items account, in his analysis,

for 1.5 points out of an average 2.4 percent slowdown in factor

productivity.

     While the problem of oil and raw-material prices is mentioned in

Kendrick's discussion, no attempt is made to measure its contribution.

Government regulations is the only item that could be associated with an

increase in the cost of materials but it only amounts to 0.4 points of

the 1.5 mentioned. The other three factors could be associated with the

demand squeeze argument (or the interaction between the demand squeeze

and the real shock).

     In   trying to apply our framework to the data the first point to be

made relates to the problem of GDP measurement. The OECD data on which

Kendrick's analysis is based measure GDP at constant 1975 prices, using

a conventional double deflation procedure.    I have shown elsewhere (Bruno,

1981) that double deflation may cause a systematic bias when import prices

change monotonically in either direction. Specifically, in this case, one

would expect to get an upward bias in the GDP growth measure relative to

a Divisia index for the earlier years in which there was a consistent fall

in relative import/GDP prices. For the period 1974-79, using an intra-

period (1975) base could work either way.

     GDP was re-estimated using a moving weight Divisia index. There was

an average upward bias of 0.31 percent for 1960-73 and an average downward

bias in GDP growth of 0.16 percent for 1973-79. The total bias over the

two periods thus amounts to 0.47 percent, which is quite sizable, relative

to the average deceleration in factor productivity.    For some countries

(e.g., the United Kingdom) the relative importance of the bias is even

greater [see column (5), Table 6]. Part of the deceleration then, is

nothing but a statistical artifact directly associated with a shift from

a period of falling relative import prices to a period of rising ones I

[This problem was mentioned in an OECD document (1980) but not really

followed through to its logical conclusion. Note that moving from a 1970

to a 1975 base does not resolve it.]

     Once we correct for the measurement bias we can proceed to look at

the relationship between the modified factor-productivity figures and the

relevant supply and demand variables. The first regression in Table 7

relates 18 average growth-rate observations (nine countries for two

periods) to the share-weighted rate of change of import prices relative

is given in column (6) of Table 6; column (7) shows the average relative

M/V share for the second period.] Adding a demand variable (           or
as is done in regressions 2 and 3, does not remove the effect of import

prices even though the underlying GDP quantity measure should, in principle,

be free of the direct effect of relative import prices. Moreover, whatever

effect import prices had on real income should have been neutralized by the

inclusion of the domestic absorption variable (a   two-stage   procedure was

employed in regressions 3 and 4). The alternative view that it is only the

the interaction of import prices and demand that matters is represented

by regression 4, for which the fit is slightly better (including m -

separately   in this regression adds nothing).

      Recalling the argument about the possible endogeneity and reverse

causality of the relative-price term these regressions were also run using

the relative import/U.S. export price (      - f), which   is free of real

exchange-rate effects, and obtained similar, though less significant

results (there is less intercountry variation in this index). It might

also be objected that the sample is too small. Unfortunately, no capital-

stock data are available for other OECD countries. However, little is

lost by regressing labour productivity rather than factor productivity on

these variables. When we extend the sample to include 19 OECD countries,

the 38-observation regression of r    -9   gives (with y denoting weights):

             -          -
                                            :fl                ( = 0.20)

      Using a    instead of     in this regression gives an elasticity of

1.00 (±0.14) with f2   = 0.63, but the coefficient of (        - *)y   becomes

positive and nonsignificant. Since a       is   highly negatively correlated

(-0.645) with the price factor (which           is not) this may be a reflection

of the fact that all of the terms-of-trade effect is already captured by

the absorption variable, while       represents a more independent demand

pull variable.

     Regressions 5 to 9 present results, using the same      price   variable,

in terms of incremental growth, for which internal correlation between the

explanatory variables is much smaller. The last three regressions again

force a zero constant (in regression 2 it is not significant once a          is
introduced). An analogous regression with ( -                gives very similar

results, again less significant.

     Table 8 presents the breakdown by components and the residuals for

regression 7. The net role of import prices is here much smaller than for

the manufacturing sector by itself, with the demand factor taking a much

larger share. Similar results are obtained for the alternative regression

8. Sweden is an outlier and so are Belgium and Italy. The large increase

in output variability shown in columns (3) and (4) of Table 4 may be part

of the explanation for Belgium and Sweden (in both countries real wages

were also quite rigid).

     This discussion shows that the basic argument about the role of the

supply shock and the demand response also applies with some modification

to the aggregate private sector. By implication one would expect to find

that in non-manufacturing, less material-intensive, sectors (such as

services) it is mainly the demand squeeze that accounts for the slowdown.

Some evidence is provided by looking at such partial data as there are for

the service sector in these economies. The growth of GDP per employed

      The disappearance of the import price variable from this regression

(it does appear highly significant in a regression in which                  replaces

     suggests very clearly that here it is only demand that matters

directly. The latter is in turn affected by government fiscal policy as

well as by the terms of trade (the elasticity with respect to each is

about 1).

     We now have further evidence to support the claim that the intensity

of material-input use in a sector must have had something to do with the

effect of the rise in material-input prices on productivity. Manufacturing

industries were heavily affected, services apparently not. We can now go

back to the earlier part of the discussion and ask--when one aggregates

across sectors, some of which were directlyhit by input prices and some

of which were not, how would one expect the aggregate economy to behave?

On the face of it, we have corrected for the import price bias, and any

internal relative price changes should wash out in aggregate GDP as well

as in the factor input and productivity measures, provided there is full

factor mobility between sectors. If, however, these assumptions do not

hold, e.g., if factors do not reallocate freely, then a shock to any one

sector may also show in the aggregate. This argument can be made more

precise.

inputs, and T are exogenous shift terms (technology, material input

prices, etc.). Denoting relative output prices (in terms of V0 as

nuineraire) by P, we have

       The left-hand side of equation (6) represents aggregate factor

productivity as conventionally measured. The right-hand side consists

of three terms. The first is the sum of the sectoral shift factors; the

other two are terms involving divergences of marginal factor productivities

from real factor returns multiplied by the rates of change of factors by

sector.

which is not matched by a positive disturbance in another. There are two

ways in which this will not fully translate to the left-hand side of (6).

Either V and aggregate V may be measured with T properly netted

out; or factors always reallocate in the 'right' direction, i.e.,               0

whenever PV./3K.       R (and similarly for 2). The whole rationale of

aggregate productivity measurement rests on the assumption that in the long

run and on average marginal products of factors equalize across sectors,

so that the last two terms in equation (6) disappear while V, K, and L

are measured so that the only T. disturbances that can appear are of a

pure technology kind. In the situation that prevailed in the 1970s, with

real shocks, depressed demand, and increased uncertainty, probably none of

these conditions held. Because of capital immobility and sluggish labour

adjustment there are built-in asymmetries between expanding and contracting

sectors which may impart a negative bias to the two divergence terms in

(6) (that is,             < R    may more often go together with     ? 0,

and similarly for labour).      It is also very likely that the overall

correction introduced to take account of rising import prices does not

properly capture the effect of individual sector input price shifts.

(Regression of the measurement bias on m            gives nonsignificant

results.) It is perhaps no accident that when we multiply the estimated

input price effect in manufacturing [column (2), Table 3] by the average

share of the sector in the business economy (1/3, say) we get figures that

are for several of the countries quite close to the estimated role of

import prices in the aggregate business sector [column (2), Table 8]. It

is as if a ceteria paribuB assumption applied in equation (5) or (6) and

1W =        =                where i would stand for the manufacturing

sector. But this may, of course, be stretching the argument too far.

       Finally we may note that while the intercountry variance of labour-

productivity   growth stayed as high in the second as in the first period

in manufacturing (1.79 compared with 1.77) in the service sector it fell

(from 1.36 to 1.11). For the business sector the intercountry variance

fell even more (from 1.97 to 1.34). This too may be evidence that

manufacturing was hit more directly by the real supply shocks which

worked differentially in the industrial countries. The absolute demand

squeeze, with one or two exceptions, was more uniform across countries.



III.   CONCLUDING REMARKS


Can one try to attach a consistent story to these international

comparisons of productivity slowdown? While for some countries there may

already have been signs of deceleration in productivity growth by the end

of the l960s (a point made for the United States by Denison, 1979,

Nordhaus, 1982, and others), it seems that the dominant role was played

by the commodity-price shock of the early 1970s. Until then raw-material

and energy prices were falling in real terms. There was a turning point

in 1971-72, the price rise culminating in the great shock of 1973-74. In

spite of subsequent fluctuations the earlier low levels were never

recovered even for raw materials (at least not by the end of 1981). This

price shock affected the material (and energy) input intensive sectors

directly. As we have seen, more than half of the slowdown in manufacturing

can be ascribed to this direct effect. Two secondary effects played a

role on the demand side. The terms-of-trade effect on the income of net

importers, the investment squeeze, and the induced contractionary fiscal

(and monetary) measures have generally kept economic activity growing

much more slowly since 1973. The major industrial countries, in particular

the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan, adopted contractionary

policies   for fear of excessive inflation and current-account deficits.

The depressed domestic demand (which, in turn, interacts with export

demand) has impeded the internal relative price and factor adjustment

process necessitated by these supply shocks. When seen in this light,

the observed productivity slowdown is thus directly linked to the choice

of short-term and medium-term macro-economic response strategy.

     In this context one may refer to another structural factor that is

sometimesproposed as a possible culprit--the import and export competition

from the newly industrialized countries (NICs). The rapid development of

the NICs is not a new phenomenon of the 1970s--it started in the 1960s

and even before that- -yet it was not a special issue during the rapid

growth phase. Why would it cause more problems in the 1970s? The answer,

which is related to our earlier discussion, seems to be that in a rapidly

growing economy it is much easier to adjust to external competitive shocks

because there is excess demand and factors will easily move into more

productive activities with less risk of unemployment. At a time of general

slack, on the other hand, the system tends to freeze into old modes of

operation and fear of unemployment causes retrenchment, excessive

subsidization of ailing industries, and the like. This links up with our

present topic only in the sense that it would probably be wrong to ascribe

a separate role to external competition as an explanatory factor in the

productivity story. Rather, it is the generally depressed internal

economic conditions that tend to impede adjustment to both types of

external shock and thus show up in the form of reduced productivity growth.

     The NICs and the much broader group of middle-income developing

countries (MICs) can be brought into the story to play another role. They

provide an exception to the characterization of OECD response which may
+                                 -33-                                    +


at   the same time strengthen the argument. Faced with the same exogenous

input price shocks these economies, and in particular their manufacturing

sectors, performed quite well in the 1970s in terms of output and general

economic activity, while most OECD countries did miserably in this respect.

Part of the answer, which is not directly relevant here, has to do with

the emergence of an international private capital market to which many of

the NICs had access and for a time could borrow heavily at zero or negative

real interest rates (I discuss this in another paper, 1982). The other

side, more relevant to our present discussion, is that these countries have

by and large been pursuing highly expansionary domestic policies. As the

recent World Development Report (1981; p. 140, Table 4) shows, domestic

absorption in the group of 60 middle-income countries grew at least as

fast in the 1970s as in the previous decade. The cost of choosing the

expansionary option was much higher inflation and larger current-account

deficits (which were themselves required to effect the resource transfer

from OPEC). But it showed up in continued rapid growth in both output and

labour   productivity. (There are unfortunately no data on total factor
productivity.)   The data show a more expansionary response of the MICs

after 1973, yet a close association between output and labour productivity

in all countries. There is little doubt that the more expansionary internal

policies (and smaller output variability) of the MICs have a lot do so

with the difference in economic performance. Paradoxically, it is likely

that the relative success of the MICs would not have been possible if the

OECD countries had also followed a more expansionary policy, since

competition for the OPEC surplus would have made this a much more costly

option to pursue (by 1980-81 real interest rates had indeed risen). But

for the present purpose this example illustrates that productivity and
+                                  34                                    +


macro-economic response are closely linked.

     Finally, if the view of the sources of the productivity slowdown in

the OECD countries advocated here is correct, it also follows that this

phenomenon is only as transitory or as permanent as the macro-economic

climate of the world economy. If input price shocks continue to hit the

world economy frequently, but at uncertain intervals, and if cost-induced

inflationary waves are going to be followed by contractionary demand

policies in the leading industrial countries, then there is no reason to

consider the slowdown as transitory. If, on the other hand, the system

were to find an efficient way of smoothing the fluctuations in real input

prices (e.g., bycoinmodity agreements, buffer stocks, or the break-up of

cartels) and of better co.-ordinating economic activity and monetary

policies across national frontiers, then one of the major sources of the

slowdown will be removed. The best bet probably lies with neither of the

two extremes. There may be some learning and adaptation to the new

environment which would allow pursuit of reasonable inflation rates without

the enormous cost in unemployment that has been paid in recent years. The

upshot of the present discussion is that in this case aggregate productivity

growth in the industrial countries might improve along with the hoped-for

improvement in overall macro-economic performance.
