Unemployment Disrupts Sleep
David G. Blanchflower and Alex Bryson
NBER Working Paper No. 27814

JEL No. I31,J64

                                           ABSTRACT

Although there is a substantial literature indicating that unemployment and joblessness have
profound adverse impacts on individuals' health and wellbeing, there is relatively little evidence
of their impact on sleep. Using data for over 3.5 million individuals in the United States over the
period 2006-2019 from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey
series we show sleep disruption patterns that vary by labor market status. We look at sleep
measured by hours in a day and days in a month and whether sleep is disturbed over a fortnight,
as indicated by problems falling or staying asleep or staying asleep too much. We find the short-
term unemployed suffer more short and long sleep than the employed and are more likely to
suffer from disturbed sleep. These problems are greater still for the long-term unemployed and
for the jobless who say they are unable to work.

1. Introduction
Unemployment hurts. We care about unemployment for several reasons: it increases susceptibility
to malnutrition, illness, mental stress, and loss of self-esteem, leading to depression (Blanchflower,
2019). Being unemployed can reduce the life expectancy of workers. Increases in the
unemployment rate tend to be associated with increases in the suicide rate. Unemployment
increases the probability of poor physical health outcomes such as heart attacks in later life. Many
of the unemployed delay life decisions such as marriage and having children. There is evidence
of increases in smoking after unemployment. There is a great deal of evidence to suggest that
unemployment is involuntary: unemployment makes workers unhappy.

Unemployment hurts and there is a deterioration of physical and mental well-being and skills for
individuals who experience spells of unemployment, especially long ones. It is well known that
unemployment can have harmful effects if durations are long and especially so if they happen
when young (Ellwood, 1984). Young people who are unable to make the transition from school
to work find it more difficult to strike out on their own and often end up living with their parents.
The long-term unemployed also tend to earn less once they find new jobs (Nichols et al, 2013).
Morale sinks as the duration of unemployment rises. Long spells of unemployment are especially
harmful as the losses from unemployment worsen as the duration spell lengthens (Machin and
Manning, 1999). The long-term unemployed are at a disadvantage in obtaining jobs. Long-term
unemployment (LTU) was a major issue in Europe in the 1980s and 1990s when it rose sharply in
European and most major OECD countries with the exception of Japan and the United States.

During the Great Recession long-term unemployment rose sharply around the world including in
the United States. Krueger, Cramer and Cho (2014) note that the long-term unemployed have a
20 to 40 per cent lower probability of being employed 1 to 2 years ahead. Abraham et al (2019)
confirmed that unemployment duration has a strong negative impact on the likelihood of
subsequent employment and of lower subsequent earnings. They rule out the possibility that these
long-term unemployed (LTU) individuals are "bad apples" and show they fare worse than the
short-term unemployed (STU) more likely due to the state dependence explanation of the negative
relationship between unemployment duration and subsequent success in the labor market. And
yet, using data from 1987 to 2000 years of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System
(BRFSS) Ruhm (2005) found that health often improves during an unemployment spell as
unemployed workers get more exercise, smoke and drink less and lose weight.

There isn't much in the literature on the relationship between sleep and unemployment. The
evidence that does exist is contradictory and focuses on the impact of macroeconomic labor market
conditions on sleep duration. Using the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) Data from 2003­
2012 Antillón et al. (2015) found that increases in the unemployment rate increased sleep duration:
a 1 percentage point increase in unemployment is correlated with an extra 2.38 minutes of sleep.
In contrast, Ásgeirsdóttir, and Ólafsson (2015) also using ATUS found no consistent relationship
between unemployment and sleep duration. However, an inverse relationship between sleep
duration and wages was found. The two papers used different dependent variables: the latter
focuses on the overall amount of rest on the diary day, defined from 4 AM to 4 AM, whereas the
former used the length of the longest continuous sleep episode. This might account for differences
in the results. Neither explicitly examined the sleep duration of the unemployed themselves.



                                                  1
Three other papers also used ATUS to look at sleep and work. Gibson and Schrader (2018) showed
that increasing short-run weekly average sleep by 1 hour increased worker earnings by roughly
1%. Niekamp (2018) found that economic expansions, where the unemployment rate falls,
decreased weekday sleep but increased weekend sleep. Basner et al. (2007) found that increased
working time reduced time spent sleeping.

Even though we know a lot about the consequences of unemployment, on future labor market
activity and health and well-being its impact on the sleep of the unemployed is under-researched.
Poor sleep may be the mechanism by which these disruptive effects of unemployment occur.
Maeda et al (2019) found that in Japan unemployed men and women both had a higher likelihood
of insomnia than the employed. Knabe et al (2010) using German data find that the unemployed
sleep almost one hour longer than the employed. Asplund (2005) examined sleep in 1948 Swedes
and found that poor sleep was associated with increased propensity for sick leave, while
unemployment itself was associated with increased occurrence of poor sleep. However, they found
from a logistic regression that unemployment was not independently associated with sleep
impairment after adjustment for age, health, marital status and place of residence.

Virtanen et al (2013) caution that there is a potential for reverse causality from poor health and
poor sleep to unemployment. They show that poor self-rated health and mood were good
predictors of occurrence of unemployment and prolonged unemployment respectively. They found
that the LTU were more likely to have musculoskeletal pain and poor sleep quality. But this is not
likely to be the dominant relationship over the business cycle.

The "lockdown" in the spring of 2020 has generated a shock to the labor market and unemployment
has risen sharply as activity slowed. In the United States the Department of Labor has shown that
over 59 million workers filed initial unemployment claims between the week ending March 20th
and the week ending 20th August 29th 2020.1 The US Census Bureau has been conducting weekly
Household Pulse Surveys tracking anxiety post Covid.2 In the period April 23 to May 5th 36% of
respondents said they had had anxiety "not at all" in the last 7 days. By July 6th to July 17th that
had fallen to 11%. The dominant relationship in 2020 is thus from unemployment to anxiety rather
than the reverse. 

We contribute to the literature by examining the association between labor market status and
various aspects of sleep duration and quality, distinguishing between overall sleep duration in a
24-hour period, short sleep, long sleep and disturbed sleep as indicated by problems falling or
staying asleep or staying asleep too much. We separate out the effects on both the STU and LTU
as well of those in an increasingly important group who say they are `unable to work'
(Blanchflower and Oswald, 2020). We also have data on how many days per month respondents
say they have insufficient sleep. We find the STU suffer more short and long sleep than the
employed and are more likely to suffer from disturbed sleep. These problems are greater for the
LTU and for the jobless who say they are unable to work.

2. Why should labor economists care about sleep?
Inadequate sleep is mostly measured within a twenty-four-hour period (Chattu et al (2018);
Altevogt et al (2006); Exelmans and Van den Buick (2016); Lockley et al (2004); Roehrs et al
(1983)). But as we show below it can also be based on days in a month. Inadequate, or short sleep
is associated with multiple poor life outcomes that impact daily functioning. It is known for
example, that short sleep duration (<7 hours per night) is associated with greater likelihoods of
obesity (Wheaton et al, 2011a), diabetes (Shan, Ma and Xie et al 2015), coronary heart disease
(Magee et al 2012, Wang et al, 2016, and Wu, Zhai and Zhang, 2014), depression, (Zhai, Zhang
and Zhang 2015), hypertension (Wang, Mei, Jiang et al 2015), and death (Gallicchio and Kalesan,
2009). Insufficient sleep is also bad for social welfare: it can result in lost GDP and lower
productivity (Hafner et al., 2017).

Perhaps less well-known is the evidence linking long sleep to poor health outcomes. Long sleep
may also mean it is hard for the unemployed to engage in the sort of regular routine required by
systematic job search, which is often a requirement of welfare receipt. Patel et al. (2006) found
that multiple sclerosis, anti-depressant use, benzodiapine use and lupus were factors most strongly
associated with long sleep. The traditional focus on short sleep is unsurprising since many more
people suffer short sleep than they do long sleep (Knutson and Turek, 2006). However, a growing
body of research establishes the health problems related to long sleep as well as short sleep. Bin
et al. (2103) note that short and long sleep are both risk factors for morbidity and mortality. They
find that short sleep predicts higher mortality, cardiovascular events, metabolic dysfunction,
obesity, and poor mental health, while habitual long sleep predicts premature mortality,
cardiovascular disease, and cognitive impairment. Buxton and Marcelli (2010) reported that both
short and long sleep are positively associated with obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and
cardiovascular disease among adults in the United States.

There are higher risks of mortality associated with both long and short sleep (Patel et al, 2004, Yin
et al, 2017; Kronholm et al, 2011). In some studies, the association is even stronger in long than
short sleep (Tamakoshi and Ohno, 2004, Kwok et al, 2018). Magee, Iverson and Caputi (2009) in
a study of Australian adults found that short sleep was associated with long working hours and
obesity while long sleep was associated with recent treatment for cancer, heart attack and angina.
Short and long sleep are also associated with a higher risk of type-2 diabetes (Ferrie et al, 2015).
Jike et al (2018) conducted a meta-analysis covering over 5 million respondents and found that
long sleep was significantly associated with higher rates of mortality, diabetes, cardiovascular
disease, stroke, coronary heart disease and obesity.

Changes in sleep duration are also found to affect health. Sleep deterioration had a negative effect
on pain-related health outcomes (Afolalu, Ramlee and Tanga, 2018). An increase in sleep results
in better outcomes such as sleep quality and a reduction in sleep medication (Tang et al, 2017).
Sleep duration also affects subjective wellbeing: Piper (2016) shows a link between sleep duration
and life satisfaction. Germans, he finds, sleep for seven hours a night, which is one hour less on
average, than he calculates, from the German Socio-Economic panel of 2008-2012, is the level
associated with maximal life satisfaction.

It is not surprising, therefore, that scientists have long studied sleep's correlates and antecedents.
Part of this literature focuses on the links between sleep patterns and labor market status. The

                                                  3
literature indicates that economic shocks affect sleep duration. Sleep duration is counter-cyclical
(Colman and Dave, 2013). Nearly one-third of foregone work hours during the Great Recession
were devoted to more sleep and TV watching (Aguiar et al., 2013).

An economic shock associated with job loss and subsequent unemployment is liable to impact an
individual's sleep adversely, both indirectly through increased anxiety, depression and other
health-related problems attendant on unemployment, but also directly having conditioned on
health-related problems if, for example, the experience of unemployment impacts an individual's
motivation and energy levels, or reduces the opportunity costs of sleep. To our knowledge, no
studies to date assess the links between joblessness and various aspects of poor sleep. We do so
distinguishing between short sleep and long sleep, as well as other measures of inadequate sleep
such as inability to get to sleep, the number of days in the last thirty that the respondent felt they
`did not get enough rest of sleep', unintentionally falling asleep during the day, and having trouble
falling asleep.

3. Previous literature on sleep using BRFSS
We analyse data from 2.5 million Americans from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System
(BRFSS) survey series from 2006-2019.3 The BRFSS is a telephone survey conducted by the
Center for Disease Control (CDC) regarding health-related risk behaviors, chronic health
conditions, and use of preventive services. Established in 1984 with 15 states, BRFSS now collects
data in all 50 states as well as the District of Columbia and three territories of the United States.
In recent years around 400,000 adult interviews are conducted each year in the BRFSS. Questions
vary over time. In some years only subsets of states field the relevant questions. The great
advantage of these data over others used in the literature is that the sample sizes are substantially
larger, making it easier for the analyst to establish robust relationships between sleep patterns and
other factors in people's lives.

A series of studies have studied sleep patterns using BRFSS surveys, with a number focusing on
the association with age. Liu, Wheaton et al (2013) used the 2010 BRFSS to examine short and
long sleep using the following question:

Q1. 'On average how many hours of sleep do you get in a 24-hour period?' (sleeptime).

They examined data on 54,269 adults ages 45 and above and found that 31% of respondents age
45 and older reported being short sleepers ( 6 hours), 65% were optimal sleepers (7-9 hours), and
4% were long sleepers ( 10 hours) in a 24-hour period.

Using BRFSS 2014's Q1 question, Liu et al. (2016) found that the percent of adults ages 18-60
with 7hrs usual sleep followed a U-shape in age, minimizing between age 35 and 44.
Analogously, the proportion with short sleep defined as <7 hours followed an inverted U-shape
with a maximum in the same age group of 35-44. Their results on the proportions with short sleep
are reported below.

Ages 18-24                      32.2%

Grandner et al. (2012) used the 2006 BRFSS survey and examined responses on 155,877
participants on sleep disturbance over a fortnight. They found that sleep disturbances were
especially high among the unemployed and those unable to work. The LTU had higher levels of
complaints than the STU. We confirm this finding on later sweeps of the BRFSS.

The literature does suggest a note of caution when examining self-reported sleep duration data as
exists in the BRFSS. It is well-known that self-reported sleep duration overestimates actual sleep
duration. Girschik et al (2012) suggested that sleep questions typically used in epidemiologic
studies do not closely correspond with objective measures of sleep as assessed using actigraphy.
Lauderdale et al (2008) examined self-reports of hours of sleep for accuracy against measured
sleep duration and found they were 'moderately correlated'. There could be various reasons for
this. For example, it may be that the days when the subject wore an actigraph were atypical. It is
unclear if there is any bias when respondents are asked about days in the month when they have
had poor sleep.

However, the focus in this paper is principally on short sleep (under seven hours a night) and long
sleep (ten hours or more). There is no evidence to our knowledge suggesting that misclassifications
have a large effect on whether someone is classified as a short sleeper or a long sleeper. That is to
say, the recall error would have to move an individual across these thresholds to have an impact
on these results. In the presumably relatively rare event of this occurring it is unlikely to have any
substantive impact on our results regarding links between labor market status and sleep. If
someone actually sleeps for eight hours and actigraphy measured sleep as eight hours and five
minutes that will impact sleep duration measures but will have no effect on our estimates of short
or long sleep. Actigraph measures have not to our knowledge determined what sign it likely takes,
let alone the size of the bias ­ it is unclear if people over or under-estimate sleep duration.

Furthermore, we do not simply rely on reported sleep durations to capture poor sleep or sleeping
problems. We examine the BRFSS on sleep duration in twenty-four hours and then move on to
the other measures of sleep or lack of it by the number of days in a month and a fortnight. It
remains unclear if there is a bias in such data.

Liu, Croft et al (2013) examined self-reported sleep and chronic disease in 375,563 adults from
the 2009 BRFSS based on days and focused on the number of days of insufficient sleep. They
found a significant association between insufficient sleep, measured as at least half the days in a
month with insufficient sleep - and six chronic diseases of diabetes, high blood pressure; coronary
heart disease; stroke; asthma and arthritis. Wheaton et al (2011a) examined the 2008 BRFSS on
384,541 adults on sleep days in a month and found that days of insufficient rest or sleep strongly
correlated with BMI. Perceived insufficient sleep was assessed by question Q2 in both studies.



                                                  5
Q2. "During the past 30 days, for about how many days have you felt you did not get enough rest
or sleep?" (qlrest2)

Defining insufficient sleep as at least 14 days the authors showed that this variable had an inverted
U-shape in age 18-24 = 29%; 25-34=36.0%; 35-44=33%; 45-64=26% and 65 and over=14%.
They demonstrated a highly significant relationship between insufficient sleep and frequent mental
distress (not good mental health days >=14), an indicator of psychological distress.

Despite all this work on sleep we know very little about the relationship between unemployment
and sleep and especially between long and short sleep and unemployment. It is often assumed
that, since the unemployed have more time available to them than the employed, and they are less
constrained in how they spend that time ­ other than with regards to costly leisure pursuits - the
opportunity costs of sleeping are lower and they will likely sleep more.

We contribute to this literature using observations on 3.5 million respondents in the 2006-2019
BRFSS to establish associations between labor market status and poor sleep including short sleep,
long sleep and disturbed sleep.

4.     Results

4.1. Sleep duration in hours in a day, 2009-2019
We begin with nationally representative data for the United States from eight sweeps of the BRFSS
survey from 2009-2014, 2016, and 2018 using the hours of sleep in a day Q1 question described
above. Several of the surveys also have a few observations from the prior year so there are some
observations in 2014 from the 2013 survey and in 2015 from the 2014 survey, and so on.

The data for 2019 comes from the 2018 survey and the small sample for 2015 of under five
thousand comes from the 2014 survey, and so on. The responses in the years prior to 2013 are
drawn from sub-sample of states as below which were the only states that asked the questions in
those years.

2009=Georgia; Hawaii; Illinois; Louisiana; Minnesota and Wyoming
2010= Arkansas; Connecticut; Delaware; DC; Hawaii; Illinois; Louisiana; Minnesota; Missouri;
Nevada and Oregon.
2011= Alaska; Hawaii; Minnesota and Tennessee
2012=Alaska; Kansas; Nevada; Oregon; and Puerto Rico

In our BRFSS sample of over two million respondents, as can be seen below, hours of sleep
average very close to seven hours per night in every year.

Total           6.98 (35.2) [3.5]            2,034,771

Sample weights are used in calculating these mean estimates (using the variable, _finwt). The
numbers in round parentheses are the proportion of respondents that report less than seven hours
of sleep per day. The proportion with short sleep ranges from 33.7% to 35.8%, and averages
35.2% and has changed little over the decade or so examined. The numbers in square parentheses
are the proportion of `long sleepers' sleeping >=9 hours. There is an average of around 3.5% long
sleepers per annum. Hence the number of short sleepers in the USA is ten times the number of
long        sleepers.       The         Census       Bureau         (https://www.census.gov/data-
tools/demo/idb/informationGateway.php) estimates that in 2018, the last full year of sleep duration
data that we have available, there were 262,140,772 adults age sixteen and over in the United
States, which suggests there are around 92 million short sleepers and 9.2 million long sleepers.4

If we consider the relationship between sleep duration, long sleep and age we find a U-shape in
duration and an inverse U-shape in short sleep. The weighted distribution of sleep hours by age
is shown below using a sample size of 2,034,771, which minimizes in the age range 45-54. The
percent with short sleep maximises in the range 45-54 too.

Hours of sleep minimize in the age group 45-54. The percent of short sleeps maximizes in prime
age (45-54). Long sleep minimizes in the age range 35-44. So, sleep duration and long sleep are
U-shaped in age and short sleep is hill shaped in age. We explain this further below.

  Gallup has collected data on average sleep per night which they estimate fell from 7.9 hours in 1942 to 6.7 in 1990
and 2001 and 6.8 in 2004 and 2013. In 2013 they estimate that 40% were short sleepers (6 hours or less hours or less
per night) versus 11% in 1942.4 In 1942 Gallup reported that 14% slept 9 hours or more versus 5% in 2013. that there
was no significant change in sleep duration over the last 50+ years. Bin, Marshal and Glozier (2012) found in self-
reported sleep duration data for adults across fifteen countries from the 1960s to the 2000s. Duration increased in 7
countries: Bulgaria, Poland, Canada, France, Britain, Korea and the Netherlands and had decreased in 6 countries:
Japan, Russia, Finland, Germany, Belgium and Austria with no change for the United States and Sweden.

                                                         7
Table 1 shows the overall distribution of (weighted) average hours of sleep by labor market status.
Four fifths of the sample report sleeping between six and eight hours; 35.2% are short sleepers.
On average 3.5% are long sleepers, defined as 10 hours per night or more. The unemployed sleep
more hours per day than workers do (6.95 hours per day for the LTU and 6.99 for the STU versus
6.87 for workers). However, both the STU and LTU are more likely than workers to experience
both short sleep and long sleep. 36.6% of workers experience short sleep, compared with 37.7%
of the STU and 42.3% of the LTU. Only 0.6% of workers experience long sleep compared with
5.0% of the STU and 6.1% of the LTU.

In the top half of Table 2 we examine the percentage of short and long sleepers by disaggregated
labor market status. Information is available both on short-term unemployment (STU) with a spell
duration of less than a year and LTU with a spell of unemployment of at least a year. The data
also contains details of another relevant category ­ unable to work ­ that accounts for 6.8% of the
sample which is more than the two unemployment groups added together (6.2%). We discuss this
group in a separate section below. The table presents weighted means of the proportions with short
and long sleep.5 Short and long sleep are both especially high for those who say they are unable
to work. The link to being unable to work is consistent with other studies on the adverse effects
of unemployment, such as Blanchflower and Oswald (2020) which showed those who were unable
to work were especially likely to report being in despair.

To examine the independent association between labor market status and sleeping patterns further
we turn to multivariate analyses. 6

Table 3 presents estimates of sleep duration in a 24-hour period. There is a U-shape in age with
year dummies alone (column 1) and with the addition of month and state dummies (column 2).
Column 3 shows differentials in mean sleep duration by labor market status controlling for
personal characteristics, year, month and state dummies. Both the STU and LTU have longer sleep
durations than workers, whereas those who are unable to work have shorter sleep durations than
employees. But that is not the whole story: we need to separate out normal sleep from disrupted
sleep including whether it is long or short, as well as whether people have trouble falling or staying
asleep.

Table 4 presents probit estimates of short and long sleep probabilities in a 24-hour period. In the
short sleep equations, we omit long sleepers and vice versa for long sleepers. Hence, we compare
short (<7 hours) and long sleepers (=10 hours) in turn to normal sleepers, defined as 7-9 hours a
night.

 The CDC on its website reports data on short sleep, defined as less than seven hours a night using the 2014 BRFSS,
and confirms that 35.2% of adults were short sleepers. Data on short sleep by state is available at
https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/publications/factsheets.html
6
  The BRFSS data files each year from 2011 were constructed by using information on landline and cell phones
identified with the variable QSTVER. Values less than 20 indicate that the interview was conducted by landline phone,
and 20 and higher indicate a cell phone interview. Most of the sample are cell phone users by 2018, as older persons
are adopting cell phones in higher numbers. Cell phone use accounted for 19% of the weighted sample in 2011
compared with 76% in 2018. In the regressions to follow we included a cell phone dummy which is set to zero in
2009 and 2010 and one in later years.


                                                         8
Columns 1 reports the probability of short sleep relative to `normal' sleep having dropped long
sleepers, and contains labor market status only, while column 2 adds personal controls. The hump
shape in age is apparent in both specifications.7 In both specifications the self-employed,
homemakers, students and the retired are all less likely than the employed to experience short
sleep, while the LTU and those who are unable to work are significantly more likely to suffer short
sleep. The positive correlation between STU and short sleep in column 1 falls to zero with the
introduction of controls.

Chart 1 shows the percentage of short sleepers by single year age bin among those who are either
short or normal sleepers. It is hump-shaped in age for both the LTU and STU and tends to be more
prevalent among the LTU across the lifecycle.8

Columns 3 and 4 of Table 4 report similar probit estimates, but this time for long sleep versus
normal sleep. Long sleep is U-shaped in age, minimizing around the age of 50-52 years.
Employees are less likely to be long sleepers than others, and this remains the case with personal
controls. Those unable to work have the highest probabilities of being long sleepers, followed by
the LTU, then the STU.

Chart 2 plots rates for long sleep excluding the short sleepers. The LTU have more long sleep
than the STU at all ages, but the U-shape in age is not apparent.

4.2: Insufficient sleep in days in a month, 2008-2012.
We now turn to an alternative measure of poor sleep, namely the perception of having suffered
from insufficient sleep. We examine data on this variable qlrest2 defined as Q2 above, using the
2008 file used by Wheaton, Perry et al (2011); the 2009 file used by Liu, Croft et al (2013) plus
the 2010-2012 files. Unweighted sample sizes are as follows 2008 (n=405,931); 2009
(n=425,022); 2010 (n=435,781), 2011 (n=25,891) and 2012 (n=24,880). The data from 2011 and
2012 are taken from a sub-set of states as they are the only ones that fielded the relevant question.9
Sample size overall for the years 2008-2013 is 1,317,505.
7
  Wheaton et al (2011b) from the CDC found similar evidence using the 2005-2008 National Health and Nutrition
Survey (NHANES): in their study 37% of U.S. adults reported regularly sleeping <7 hours per night. Short sleep
duration was more common among adults aged 20-39 years (37%) or 40-59 years (40%) than among adults aged
60 years (32%).
8
  In the charts we plot the short rates vs normal excluding the long sleepers and long rates excluding the short
sleepers. The overall rates are as follows.
                             Short vs normal Long vs normal
Employee                            37.9              2.8
Self-employed                       32.6              3.9
Out of work 1+ years                45.0            10.7
Out of work <1 year                 39.3              7.4
Homemaker                           30.9              5.9
Student                             32.4              5.2

 The 16 states with data on insufficient sleep for 2011 and 2012 were Alaska; California; Colorado; Hawaii; Illinois;
Kansas; Louisiana; Minnesota; Nevada; New Mexico; North Carolina; Oklahoma; Oregon; Tennessee; Utah;
Wisconsin plus Puerto Rico.

                                                         9
It remains unclear the extent to which respondents over or underestimate the number of days in a
month they had insufficient sleep. Actigraphy has tended to focus on inaccuracies in correctly
recalling hours of sleep in a day rather than days in a month. This variable will pick up short
sleepers, but long-sleepers may or may not report that they want even more sleep.

Overall, 31% of the sample said there were zero days in which they felt they did not get enough
rest or sleep in the last 30 days, while 11% say every day. The mean number of days was 8.47
and 25% said fourteen days or more. The weighted distribution by age is as below (n=1,310,155).
The columns in turn refer to mean days; per cent with 14-30 days where the respondent did not get
enough rest or sleep.

                    # days           >=14 days %
Ages 18-24           9.08              29.5
Ages 25-34          10.37              34.6
Ages 35-44           9.73              32.2
Ages 45-54           8.96              28.9
Ages 55-64           7.53              24.0
Ages 65-74           5.18              15.8
Ages 75              4.48              13.8
All                  8.47              27.5

In both cases there is a maximum in the age group 25-34 confirming the finding in Liu et al (2016)
for the 14-30 days variable.

The second part of Table 2 presents average number of days and the proportion saying on a half
or more days in the month they got insufficient sleep. The patterns are similar to those using hours
in the first part of the table. The unemployed have more days of inadequate sleep but the unable
to work category has the highest incidence.

Columns 1 and 2 of Table 5 estimate the number of days with insufficient sleep, with and without
personal controls respectively, with the controls including a cubic in age to pick up a non-linearity
at older ages (as depicted in Chart 3). Column 1 is an OLS regressions for the number of days of
insufficient sleep in the last month and column 2 is a probit estimate for the probability of having
insufficient sleep in at least 14 days in the last month. In column 1 the LTU experience
significantly more days of insufficient sleep than employees as do those who are unable to work,
whereas the STU experience significantly fewer. In column 2, when we look at whether half or
more of the days in a month are days of insufficient sleep, the negative coefficient for the STU
turns to insignificance.

4.3. Disturbed Sleep: Trouble falling asleep, staying asleep or sleeping too much over a
fortnight, 2006.
The previous section used a question on insufficient sleep that was unlikely to pick up long sleepers
unless they had long sleep and wanted more. It really focused on those who were unable to get




                                                 10
enough sleep. However, the BRFSS 2006 contains a question (Q3) relating to disturbed sleep,
whether it be because of too little sleep, difficulty falling asleep or too much sleep.

Q3. "Over the last 2 weeks, how many days have you had trouble falling asleep or staying asleep
or sleeping too much?"

Grandner et al (2012) used this question and found that 54.3% say zero days and 10.5% say all 14
with a mean of 2.87 days. Panel 3 of Table 2 reports restless sleep over the past fortnight by labor
market status: employees reported 2.4 days, about half the rate of the STU and LTU, whereas those
unable to work reported restless sleep for an average of almost 7 days.

Column 3 of Table 5 report the results of estimating an OLS equation with the dependent variable
the number of days in a fortnight (fourteen days) of disturbed sleep. Given the question includes
both long and short sleepers and even normal sleepers who might have restless sleep it is
unsurprising to find that this measure of sleep declines with age.

Compared to employees the LTU, the STU and those unable to work have large and significantly
positive coefficients, with the latter having the largest impact. That is also true in column 4 which
models the probability, using a probit, of someone saying all 14 days were disrupted. There are
again positive and significant effects for these three groups versus employees.

In the appendix we report OLS regression results using data from Eurobarometer Survey #56.1 for
2001 that asked about disrupted sleep (n=15,782). The question asked was as follows.

Q4. "Would you say that you have not at all (=1), no more than usual (=2), rather more than usual
(=3), much more than usual (=4)...lost much sleep over worry?" with our coding in parentheses.

The unemployed enter significantly positively compared with workers and non-workers.
Fishermen, business owners, Italians and the Greeks had especially high probabilities of losing
sleep over worry.

In the UK there is evidence from the National Health Service of the age distribution of admissions
to hospital for a primary diagnosis of sleep disorders by age in the London region.10 Over the
financial years 2013/14-2017/18 there were a total of 33,000 hospital admissions. The distribution
is as follows by age group as follows: 20-29=2910; 30-39=5230; 40-49=7415; 50-59=8260; 60-
69=5945; 70-79=2885; 80 and over=620. So, there is an obvious hump shape in age with the
largest number of admissions of over 8000 admissions being in the age range 50-59. We don't
know, however, whether the sleep problems were from too much or too little sleep. But, most bad
sleep is short sleep, hence the hump shapes in age.

As noted above, in the BRFSS one of the labor market categories is `unable to work". As
Blanchflower and Oswald (2020) have noted this has become an increasingly important category
over time, especially for prime age (ages 35-54) less educated, defined as those with a high school
diploma/GED or less. The data are as follows for those age under seventy. Overall, as a weighted
proportion of the population it has nearly tripled from 1993 to 2020 and did not fall as the
unemployment rate ticked down since 2009. In the 2019 survey unable to work accounted for one
in eight of the prime age less educated.11 In contrast for this group unemployment accounted for
5.1%.

Of note is that it remains unclear what these people are doing and whether they are actually sick,
ill or disabled or not. In the 2019 BRFSS the unable to work reported that on average out of the
last 30 days 11 were bad mental health days versus 7 for the unemployed.

Table 2 suggests that 9% of the unable to work reported being long sleepers and a half said they
were short sleepers and a half said that they had insufficient sleep in the majority of the last 28
days. They had lower sleep durations in column 3 of Table 3 versus employees but this is because
they were more likely to suffer short sleep than employees as well as suffering long sleep, with
short sleepers dominating, also confirmed in Table 4.

Chart 4 is like Charts 1 and 2 in that it presents the incidence of short sleep among those who are
short sleep or normal sleepers, and long sleep among those who are long or normal sleepers, but
this time for those who are unable to work. Whilst there is some indication of a hump-shape in
age for short sleep, long sleep appears constant across the life course.

Sleep disruption seems to be a major factor for those unable to work and even more so than the
LTU. As Blanchflower and Oswald (2020) note the unable to work, especially those with low
levels educated in prime age, are especially likely to report that all thirty of the past thirty days
were bad mental health days.

The question is to what extent lack of sleep may have moved these folks from unemployment to
out of the labor force (OLF). It is unclear what the `unable to work' are actually doing. The labor

11
  The 2019 BRFSS was not included by Blanchflower and Oswald (2020) in their study as the data file only became
available in September 2020. There are 18,650 observations in 2020, mostly in January.

                                                      12
force participation rate (LFPR) of prime age, especially men has not returned to pre-recession
levels.12 Of interest is the Council of Economic Advisors (2016) examined the long run decline in
prime age male LFPR and found that the largest difference in how prime age men in and out of
the labor force spend their time is in time spent on leisure activities--socializing, relaxing and
leisure. Nonparticipating men spent almost twice as much time on these activities than prime-age
men overall, and more than twice as much time watching television.

7. Discussion and Conclusion
This paper examines the relationship between labor market status and poor sleep. In contrast to
previous studies we distinguish between five measures of sleep, namely sleep duration in a 24-
hour period, short and long sleep in a 24-hour period, insufficient sleep over a one-month, and
disturbed sleep over a fortnight, as indicated by problems falling or staying asleep or staying asleep
too much. We find the short-term unemployed suffer more short and long sleep than the employed
and are more likely to suffer from disturbed sleep. These problems are greater for the long-term
unemployed and for the jobless who say they are unable to work.

The findings have potentially serious implications for the jobless since both short and long sleep
are linked to higher morbidity and mortality. In the 2019 BRFSS released in early September 2020
and covering the period from January 2019 through April 2020 we see the poor health of the
unemployed and especially the unable to work on a number of dimensions below (weighted
estimates).

Disparities in the mental and physical health of the jobless versus workers are huge. The period
of worklessness appears to matter, too, with health problems becoming more pronounced as
individuals leave STU for LTU and, in the extreme case, declare themselves "unable to work".

The recent pandemic is liable to take its toll on sleep especially if temporary layoffs turn into
permanent ones and there is a second round of COVID infections. It may well be important to use
what Blanchflower (2019) called `the economics of walking about' to determine what is going on.
There are already signs at the time of writing at the end of August 2020, that unemployment is
rising again. Searches in the USA in Google Trends for the word "unemployment" picked up
sharply in March 2020 before falling steadily. But from August 23rd it started rising again. Recent
research shows the lockdown response to COVID-19 in Italy increased sleep difficulties,
particularly among those reporting higher levels of depression and anxiety (Cellini et al., 2020)
and those reporting work-related troubles (Gualano et al., 2020). Similar increases in sleep

12
   According to the BLS the seasonally adjusted LFPR for men ages 35-44 was 92.1% in January 2008 at the start of
the Great Recession versus 90.9 in February 2020. In contrast the rates for women 35-44 had returned - from 76.1%
to 76.5% respectively.

difficulties linked to increased depression and anxiety have been linked to the COVID outbreak
elsewhere too (eg. Falkingham et al., 2020 for the UK and Huang and Zhao, 2020 for China).
Blume, Schmidt and Cajochen (2020) conducted a study of sleep after lockdown in March 2020
in Austria, Germany, Switzerland. They found that sleep durations rose, but sleep quality
decreased, and they suggested that led to a decrease in physical and mental wellbeing as a result.

Prescriptions for sleep medications jumped 15% between mid-February and mid-March according
to Express Scripts.13 According to a survey conducted in May 2020, 53% of Americans said they
spend less time asleep and 68% said they feel stress and find it hard to sleep even after the
lockdown.14

We suggest that the problem of disturbed sleep is an important issue for the short-term unemployed
and especially for the LTU and those unable to work. We conjecture that that this may be causally
linked to unemployment and joblessness. It is a problem because long sleep, like short sleep, is
highly detrimental to an individuals' health, wellbeing and life prospects. Those who say they are
unable to work experience even more sleep disruption than the LTU, which may play a role in
their inability to find, or even search, for a job.
