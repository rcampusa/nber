Cycles of Distrust: An Economic Model

                                             ABSTRACT

We propose a model of cycles of distrust and conflict. Overlapping generations of agents from two
groups sequentially play coordination games under incomplete information about whether the other
side consists of “extremists” who will never take the good/trusting action. Good actions may be mistakenly
perceived as bad/distrusting actions. We also assume that there is limited information about the history
of past actions, so that an agent is unable to ascertain exactly when and how a sequence of bad actions
originated. Assuming that both sides are not extremists, spirals of distrust and conflict get started as
a result of a misperception, and continue because the other side interprets the bad action as evidence
that it is facing extremists. However, such spirals contain the seeds of their own dissolution: after a
while, Bayesian agents correctly conclude that the probability of a spiral having started by mistake
is sufficiently high, and bad actions are no longer interpreted as evidence of extremism. At this point,
one party experiments with a good action, and the cycle restarts. We show how this mechanism can
be useful in interpreting cycles of ethnic conflict and international war, and how it also emerges in
models of political participation, dynamic inter-group trade, and communication - leading to cycles
of political polarization, breakdown of trade, and breakdown of communication.

1        Introduction
Mutual bene…ts from trust, cooperation, and communication not withstanding, inter-group con‡ict is
pervasive. In his study of the Peloponnesian War, Thucydides (2000) traces the origins of con‡ict as
much to fear and distrust as to other factors such as greed and honor. He argues that the Peloponnesian
War became inevitable precisely because each side saw war as inevitable and did not want to relinquish
the …rst mover advantage to the other (see also Kagan, 2004).1 This view of con‡ict, sometimes referred
as the Hobbesian view or spiral model, has a clear dynamic implication: if Group A’s actions look
aggressive, Group B infers that Group A is likely to be aggressive and acts aggressively itself (e.g.,
Jervis, 1976, Kydd, 1997). Moreover, unless Group A can fully understand that Group B is acting
aggressively in response to its own actions, it will take this response as evidence that Group B is
aggressive. As a result, con‡ict spirals.
        The ubiquity of “con‡ict spirals” throughout history provides prima facie support for this view.
A leading example is ethnic con‡ict: Donald L. Horowitz argues that “The fear of ethnic domination
and suppression is a motivating force for the acquisition of power as an end” (Horowitz, 2000, p.
187), and suggests that such fear of ethnic domination was the primary cause of the rise in ethnic
violence following the withdrawal of colonial powers.2 Horowitz also suggests (p. 189, italics in the
original): “The imminence of independence in Uganda aroused ‘fears of future ill-treatment’ along
ethnic lines. In Kenya, it was ‘Kikuyu domination’that was feared; in Zambia, ‘Bemba domination’;
and in Mauritius, ... [‘Hindu domination’]... Everywhere the word domination was heard. Everywhere
it was equated with political control.”
        More recent examples of such spirals are provided by con‡icts in Northern Ireland, the Balkans,
Lebanon, Iraq, Gaza and the West Bank, and Turkey. For instance, many accounts of the dynamics
of the Serbian-Croatian war emphasize Croatian fears from the aggressive posturing of Milosevic,
which were instrumental in triggering more aggressive Croatian actions, including the adoption as the
national symbol of the sahovnica, associated with the fascist pre-Yugoslavia Ustasha regime, and a
variety of discriminatory policies towards the Serbian minority (e.g., Posen, 1993). These actions then
spiraled into all-out war.3 Spiral e¤ects might account not only for violent con‡ict between nations and
    1
     The fear motive for con‡ict is also referred to as the “Hobbesian trap”or the “security dilemma”(following Schelling,
1960). It is modeled by, among others, Baliga and Sjostrom (2004) and Chassang and Padro i Miquel (2010).
   2
     Horowitz also writes: “In this atmosphere of uncertainty, the greatest group anxiety was to avoid creating an old
colonialism for a new one...” (p. 188), and quotes from James S. Coleman’s (1958) study of ethnic con‡ict in Nigeria
that “in a self-governing Nigeria the north would in e¤ect be a backward protectorate governed by Southerners... The
threat of sudden domination, fancied or real, was the major stimulant in the northern awakening.” Robert N. Kearney
(1967) describes the intensi…cation of ethnic con‡ict in Sri Lanka (Ceylon): “The gradual transfer of power from foreign
to Ceylonese hands quickly created concern for the relative political strength of the various communities. The basic
assumption upon which this concern rested was that the share of political power held by members of one community
would be used for the exclusive bene…t of that community or to the detriment of other communities.”
   3
     DellaVigna et al. (2011) provide further evidence highly suggestive of a con‡ict spiral in this context. They show
that Croatians who received nationalistic radio broadcasts from the Serbian side were more nationalistic and more
supportive of anti-Serbian actions. Kaplan et al. (2005) provide evidence consistent with a “cycle of violence” from the
Israeli-Palestinian con‡ict (but see also Jaeger and Paserman, 2008).

ethnic groups, but also for lack of trust and communication between groups and within organizations.
Guiso, Sapienza and Zingales (2009) document deep-rooted distrust among some nations, and show
that it is associated with lower international trade and foreign direct investment, and Bottazzi, Da
Rin, and Hellmann (2011) show a similar pattern of international business ventures. Kramer (1999)
surveys a large social psychology literature documenting the emergence and persistence of distrust
within organizations. In most cases, distrust is triggered by suspicion that others are untrustworthy
or are pursuing ulterior motives. Some see the root cause of the increasing polarization in US politics
also in this type of spiral e¤ects which may have made each side segregate into their own “echo-
chambers” where they only listen to like-minded communication (e.g., Sunstein, 2006).4
      This classical view of con‡ict and distrust is incomplete, however, because it only explains how
con‡ict starts and not how it stops— even though most con‡ict spirals come to an end sooner or
later. For example, sectarian con‡ict in Northern Ireland has ended starting with a cease-…re in 1994
ultimately leading to the Good Friday agreement in 1998; the widespread distrust and con‡ict between
blacks and whites in South Africa has largely subsided after the fall of the apartheid regime in 1994;
war and con‡ict between di¤erent ethnic and national groups in the Balkans have mostly ended; and
the historical Franco-German distrust and animosity has made way to vibrant trade and economic and
diplomatic cooperation. The bloody ethnic wars that seemed intractable after the end of World War
II have dramatically abated over the past two decades. Even if political polarization in the US seems
incorrigible today, a similar era of polarization in the …rst third of the 20th century was followed by
a long period of non-partisan politics (McCarty, Poole and Rosenthal, 2008). So rather than in…nite
con‡ict spirals— where con‡ict once initiated never subsides— history for the most part looks like a
series of con‡ict cycles, where even long periods of con‡ict eventually end, often quite suddenly and
unexpectedly.
      This paper proposes a simple model of con‡ict spirals, and then shows that such spirals contain
the seeds of their own dissolution— thus accounting not only for the onset but also the end of con‡ict.
The basic idea of our approach is simple: once Groups A and B get into a phase in which they are
both acting aggressively, the likelihood that a con‡ict spiral has been triggered by mistake at some
point increases over time. This implies that aggressive actions— which are typically informative about
how aggressive the other side is— eventually become uninformative. Once this happens, one group
will …nd it bene…cial to experiment with cooperation and, unless the other group is truly aggressive,
cooperation will resume— until the next con‡ict spiral begins.
      Formally, our model features a coordination game between overlapping generations of (represen-
tatives of) two groups. The “bad” action in the coordination game may correspond to …ghting or
initiating other types of con‡icts, and is a best response to bad actions from the other party, while
the “good” action is optimal when good actions are expected. Each side is uncertain about the type
of their opponents, who may be— with small probability— committed to the bad action. The two
distinguishing features of our approach are: (1) noisy Bayesian updating, so that individuals (groups)

understand that con‡ict may be initiated because of a misperception or unintended action; and (2)
“…nite memory,” so that there is limited information about the exact sequence of events in the past,
and when and for what reason con‡ict has started will be unknown. These features together generate
a distinctive pattern where, in the unique sequential equilibrium of this dynamic game, a spiral of
distrust and con‡ict is sometimes initiated and persists, but must also endogenously come to an end.
The …rst contribution of our model is to show that because of limited information about the past, when
the current generation sees con‡ict (but not how it came about), it often responds by choosing a bad
action, perpetuating the spiral.5 The main contribution of our model is to show that such spirals of
con‡ict will eventually terminate: when an individual or group reasons that there have been “enough”
chances for a con‡ict spiral to have gotten started (call this number T ), they will conclude that the
likelihood that it started by mistake— rather than being started intentionally by a truly aggressive
adversary— is su¢ ciently high, and they will experiment with the good action. In our baseline model,
these two forces lead to a unique equilibrium which features a mixture of deterministic and stochastic
cycles. In particular, a single misperceived action stochastically initiates a con‡ict spiral, which then
concludes deterministically at the next time t that is a multiple of T .6
       The rest of the paper examines the robustness of the forces we isolate in this simple dynamic game
and argues that they are relevant for thinking about cycles of distrust in a variety of situations. First,
in subsection 2.3 we argue that our baseline game is a natural model of ethnic or international war.
In addition to capturing the essence of the Hobbesian view of con‡ict, ours is a direct overlapping
generations analog of the models used by Baliga and Sjostrom (2004) and Chassang and Padro i Miquel
(2010) to study related issues in a static setting. Our model implies that the unique equilibrium in the
context of ethnic and international con‡ict may involve cycles of distrust fueling cycles of con‡ict— so
that neither war nor peace is an absorbing state.
       We then turn to extensions of the baseline model in Section 3, which show that our basic insights are
robust to relaxing a variety of assumptions. These include versions of the model without deterministic
dependence on calendar time and versions with more information about past actions.
       We believe that forces similar to those in our baseline model are important for understanding
other instances of the cycle of distrust. However, these applications typically necessitate somewhat
di¤erent and more detailed assumptions than in our baseline model. Section 4 develops one such
application. There, we study the dynamics of political partisanship and participation using a model
   5
     While informal accounts of con‡ict often invoke spirals (e.g., Posen 1993), they do not clarify the conditions under
which such spirals will emerge. For example, full observation of the history of signals and actions would preclude spirals
for the following reason: if Group A knows that Group B perceived her initial action as aggressive and responded
aggressively, then Group A should not respond aggressively in turn (as she knows that Group B would have behaved this
way even if he were not inherently aggressive). In our model, limited information about past signals, as well as about
when con‡ict started, prevents this type of perfect inference and makes spirals possible.
   6
     We certainly do not claim that every possible model of con‡ict spirals leads to cycles. For example, Rohner,
Thoenig and Zilibotti (2011) develop a dynamic “Hobbesian” model of con‡ict where information about a group’s type
accumulates over time, leading asymptotically to either permanent war or permanent peace. The key di¤erence is that,
because of …nite memory, information does not accumulate in our model— as decision makers have limited information
about the past— so there is no “asymptotic learning.”



                                                            3
where extremist politicians care primarily about a partisan political issue, while moderate politicians
care primarily about a common-interest issue. A cycle of partisanship emerges, where politicians
act on the partisan issue when they think the other party is extremist, and act on the major issue
when they think the other party is moderate. Augmenting this model with a model of voter turnout,
we predict a cycle of voter turnout that mirrors the cycle of partisanship: turnout and propaganda
are both high in the partisan phase of the cycle, while turnout is low and communication between
the parties is informative in the cooperative phase. This model may capture aspects of the cycle of
political partisanship documented by McCarty, Poole and Rosenthal (2008), Abramowitz (2011), and
others.7
    Two further applications are examined in Appendix A. The …rst considers cycles of trade break-
down: We posit that some groups are unable to produce high-quality goods, while others can produce
them at a cost. This yields a coordination game because this cost is only worth paying when the
other group will also produce high-quality goods for trade, and we show that equilibrium is essentially
unique and cyclical as in the baseline model. The second additional application is to cycles of “mis-
communication”between two groups with di¤erent political views. Each group may be extremist and
thus stubbornly repeat their own views, while normal groups are willing to moderate their commu-
nication in order to in‡uence the other party. This model yields a cycle where phases of informative
communication alternate with phases of uninformative, “ideological,” communication.8
    Our paper also relates to several strands of the literature on dynamic games, including anti-folk
theorems in overlapping generations games (e.g., Laguno¤ and Matsui, 1997) and reputation with
limited records (e.g., Liu and Skrzypacz, 2011). We discuss the relationship of our paper to these and
other literatures in Section 5. Section 6 concludes, while Appendix B contains proofs omitted from
the text.


2     Baseline Model: Trust Game
In this section, we present our baseline model, which formalizes in the simplest possible way how
con‡ict spirals can form but cannot last forever when individuals are Bayesian and have limited
information about the history of con‡ict. At the end of this section, we present our …rst application,
   7
     Notably, our model generates such cycles even though the electorate itself does not become more polarized, which is
consistent with the evidence presented in Fiorina (2011).
   Other related work includes Bernhardt, Krasa, and Polborn (2008), Chan and Suen (2008), and Gul and Pesendorfer
(2011), who present models linking polarization to competition among media outlets. One interpretation of “cooperation”
in our model is that the cooperative action is engaging in an informative political dialogue that gives the other party
the information it needs to set policy, while the uncooperative action is broadcasting propaganda to one’s base to try to
maximize turnout. On this interpretation, our model complements these papers by studying the incentives for political
parties themselves to provide useful information rather than propaganda.
   8
     This may be viewed as a dynamic model of social learning, where ideological extremism— or merely the fear that
the other side is extreme— can prevent information aggregation. In this respect, it generalizes Morris (2001) as well as
Prendergast (1993), Canes-Wrone, Herron, and Shotts (2001), Maskin and Tirole (2004), and Acemoglu, Egorov and
Sonin (2011). Relatedly, Banerjee and Somanathan (2001) and Sethi and Yildiz (2009) present models where social
learning is precluded because of heterogeneous and unknown biases among members of society.

ethnic con‡ict and international war. We relax several of the simplifying assumptions adopted here
in Section 3.

2.1      Model and Equilibrium Characterization
Two groups, Group A and Group B, interact over time t = 0; 1; 2; : : :. At every time t, there is one
active player (“player t”) who takes a pair of actions (xt ; yt ) 2 f0; 1g                  f0; 1g, where xt = 1 and yt = 1
are “good” (or “honest”) actions and xt = 0 and yt = 0 are “bad” (or “cheating”) actions; as will
become clear, xt is player t’s action toward player t                    1, and yt is player t’s action toward player t + 1.
In even periods the active player is a member of Group A, and in odd periods the active player is a
member of Group B. A di¤erent player is active every period. A key assumption is that players observe
very little about what happened in past periods: in particular, before player t takes her action, she
observes only a signal y~t      1   2 f0; 1g of player t           1’s action toward her. This assumption captures the
feature that agents may know that there is currently con‡ict or cheating without fully knowing when
and how this was initiated in the past. We assume that y~t                      1   is determined as:

                                           Pr (~
                                               yt   1   = 1jyt      1   = 1) = 1
                                           Pr (~
                                               yt   1   = 1jyt      1   = 0) = 0,

where       2 (0; 1).9 Thus, a good action sometimes leads to a bad signal, but a bad action never leads
to a good signal (both this in the assumption that nothing from the past history beyond last period’s
con‡ict is observed is relaxed Section 3).
       Each group consists either entirely of normal types or entirely of bad types. The probability that
a group is bad (i.e., consists of bad types) is               0    > 0. Playing (xt = 0; yt = 0) is a dominant strategy
for the bad type of player t. For t > 0, the normal type of player t has utility function

                                                u (xt ; y~t   1)   + u (~
                                                                        yt ; xt+1 ) ,

so her payo¤ is the sum of her payo¤ against player t                           1 and her payo¤ against player t + 1.10
By writing payo¤s as a function of the realized signal of player t                         1’s action, we are following the
literature on dynamic games of incomplete information in ensuring that no additional information
                                                                                      y0 ; x1 ).11 We
is obtained from realized payo¤s. The normal type of player 0 has utility function u (~
assume that each “subgame” between neighboring players is a coordination game, and that (1; 1) is
the Pareto-dominant equilibrium:
   9
      There are several ways of interpreting the misperception probability . One group may literally misperceive the
other’s action, or a group’s leaders may try to do one thing but mistakenly do another.
   An alternative assumption which is entirely identical is that a fraction of each group’s membership may be “bad
types” (even when the group’s type is normal) who always play 0, perhaps because they are “provacateurs” who bene…t
from sending the groups into con‡ict (cf. Rabushka and Shepsle, 1972, Glaeser, 2005, Baliga and Sjostrom, 2011).
   10
      Changing this utility function to (1                           yt ; xt+1 ) for 2 (0; 1) would have no e¤ect on the results
                                              ) u (xt ; y~t 1 ) + u (~
or in fact on the expressions that follow.
   11
      Note that this makes action x0 irrelevant, so we ignore it (equivalently, assume that player 0 only chooses y0 2 f0; 1g).



                                                                    5
Assumption 1              1. u (1; 1) > u (0; 1).
            2. u (0; 0) > u (1; 0).
            3. u (1; 1) > u (0; 0).

      We also assume that the probability that a group is bad is below a certain threshold                              2 (0; 1):

Assumption 2
                                                                           u (1; 1)          u (0; 0)
                                                          0   <                                       :
                                                                           u (1; 1)          u (1; 0)

      Assumption 2 is equivalent to assuming that normal player 0, with belief                             0,   plays y0 = 1 when
she believes that player 1 plays x1 = 1 if and only if he is normal and sees signal y~0 = 1.
      We can now explain the logic of the model. Assumption 1 ensures that in any sequential equilibrium
player t does indeed play xt = 1 if and only if he is normal and sees signal y~0 = 1. In view of this,
Assumption 2 implies that normal player 0’s prior about the other group is su¢ ciently favorable that
she starts out with y0 = 1.
      Next, consider the problem of normal player 1. If he sees signal y~0 = 1, then he knows the other
group is normal— since bad types take the bad action which never generates the good signal. In this
case, his belief about the other group is even better than player 0’s, so he plays y1 = 1 (in addition to
playing x1 = 1). But what if he sees signal y~0 = 0? He clearly plays x1 = 0, but moreover, by Bayes
rule, his posterior belief that the other group is bad rises to

                                                                           0
                                                      1   =                             >       0,
                                                                  0 + (1           0)

which follows in view of the fact that y~0 = 0 may have resulted from the other side being extremist,
probability       0,   or due to a bad signal following from the good action when the other side is normal,
probability (1           0)   . Now if    1   is su¢ ciently high— in particular, if it is above the cuto¤ belief
     — then player 1 plays y1 = 0 after she sees signal 0.12
      Now suppose that up until time t normal players play yt = 0 after seeing signal 0, and consider the
problem of normal player t. Again, if she sees signal 1, she knows the other group is normal and plays
(xt = 1; y1 = 1). But if she sees signal 0, she knows that this could be due to a bad signal arriving at
any time before t, because a single bad signal starts a spiral of bad actions. Thus, her posterior is

                                                                               0
                                              t   =                                                    ,
                                                          0 + (1           0) 1         (1        )t

which follows since the probability of no bad signal arriving at any time before t, conditional on the
other side being normal, is (1                )t , and thus the total probability of player t seeing y~t                 1   = 0 is
                                 t
 0   + (1       0)   1   (1     ) .
 12
    We do not assume that 1 > . But if 1 < , then the con‡ict “cycle” that emerges is the trivial cycle where
cooperation always restarts immediately after a misperception.



                                                                           6
      If    t   is above the cuto¤ belief          , then player t again plays yt = 0 after seeing signal 0. Crucially,
note that         t   is decreasing in t, and that furthermore         t   !   0   as t ! 1. Recall that    0   <   . Thus,
there is some …rst time T — given by (2) in Appendix B— at which                         T      . And at this time, player
T plays yT = 1 even if she sees signal 0. Thus, any spiral of bad actions that started before time T
ends at T .
      Finally, consider the problem of normal player T + 1. He knows that player T plays yT = 1 if and
only if she is normal. Thus, player T + 1 is in exactly the same situation as player 1, and play from
period T + 1 on is exactly like play from period 1 on. Hence, play is characterized by cycles of length
T , in which a single bad signal starts at some time t starts a spiral of bad actions that lasts until the
next multiple of T .
      A central feature of the above argument is that it holds regardless of beliefs about future play.
Consequently, equilibrium is unique up to one technicality: if                      T   exactly equals   , then cycles can
be of length either T or T + 1, and this can eventually lead to “restarts” of cooperation occurring at
a wide range of times. To avoid this possibility, we make the following genericity assumption on the
parameters:

Assumption 3               t   6=      for all t 2 N.

      We now state our main result for the baseline model, establishing that there is a unique equilibrium
which is cyclic. The same cyclic equilibrium structure will arise in all of the more detailed applications
studied later in the paper.

Proposition 1 Under Assumptions 1-3, the baseline model has a unique sequential equilibrium. It
has the following properties:

  1. At every time t 6= 0 mod T , normal player t plays good actions (xt = 1; yt = 1) if she gets the
           good signal y~t     1    = 1, and plays bad actions (xt = 0; yt = 0) if she gets the bad signal y~t      1   = 0.

  2. At every time t = 0 mod T , normal player t plays the good action xt = 1 toward player t                             1 if
           and only if she gets the good signal y~t       1   = 1, but plays the good action yt = 1 toward player t + 1
           regardless of her signal.

  3. Bad players always play bad actions (xt = 0; yt = 0).

      It is straightforward to turn the above discussion into a proof of Proposition 1, and we omit this
formal proof.13
      Figures 1 and 2 graph the probability of observing con‡ict (i.e., the bad signal) and a normal
player’s posterior assessment of the probability that the other group is bad after observing con‡ict
in the last period (as a function of time t) when both groups are normal (these are respectively

      The proof is similar to— but simpler than— the proof of Propostion 10, which is in Appendix B.

given by 1       (1    )t mod T and          t mod T ).   The parameter values used for constructing this …gure are:
 0   = 1=10,     = 1=25, and (u (1; 1)             u (0; 0)) = (u (1; 1)    u (1; 0)) = 1=4.14 These …gures illustrate the
distinguishing features of cycles in this model, which have both stochastic and deterministic elements.
With these parameters, the period of the con‡ict cycle T equals 10, and consequently the …gures show
that cooperation restarts every 10 periods. That is, the onset of con‡ict is stochastic and its end is
deterministic: the probability that a con‡ict spiral will have started by time t increases until t = 10.
At this point this probability is so high that con‡ict is no longer su¢ ciently informative about the
other group’s type (as indicated by the posterior belief in Figure 2 hitting the dotted line), and if
con‡ict had already started, it stops and cooperation restarts.

2.2       Additional Results
To help build intuition about the mechanics of the baseline model, we next present simple comparative
statics on the cycle length T and results on social welfare when the probability of a misperception
is small.
       Our comparative statics result is as follows: First, cycles are longer when u (0; 0) is higher, u (1; 0)
is lower, or u (1; 1) is lower, as all of these changes make experimenting with the good action less
appealing (i.e., they decrease               ). Second, cycles are longer when the prior probability of the bad
type is higher, as this makes players more pessimistic about the other group (i.e., increases                          t   for all

t). Finally, cycles are shorter when the misperception probability                 is higher, as this makes the bad
signal less informative of the opposing group’s type, which makes players more optimistic (decreases
 t ).   Summarizing, we have the following result:

Proposition 2 The length (period) of the cycle in the baseline model T is increasing in u (0; 0),
decreasing in u (1; 0), decreasing in u (1; 1), increasing in the prior probability of the bad type               0,   and
decreasing in the misperception probability .

    Another interesting property of the baseline model is that expected social welfare when both groups
are normal— averaged across all players— is bounded away from the e¢ cient level 2u (1; 1) , even as
the probability of a misperception             goes to 0.   Thus, not only do some players receive payo¤ less
than 2u (1; 1) for all      > 0 (which is immediate), but the fraction of players who get less than this
does not vanish as       ! 0. The intuition is that, while the probability of a con‡ict spiral starting each
period goes to 0 as       ! 0, the expected length of a con‡ict spiral conditional on its starting goes to
1 as      ! 0, because when            is small con‡ict is very informative and it therefore takes a long time for
cooperation to restart after a misperception. This result is in stark contrast to what would happen in
a static setting, where, as           ! 0, the players could coordinate on the good outcome with probability
approaching 1.15
    In contrast, expected social welfare when both groups are normal does converge to the e¢ cient
level 2u (1; 1) when both the probability of a misperception               and the prior probability that a group
  15
     More precisely, in the “static” (i.e., two-period version) of our model, when both groups are normal, the probability
that both players play 1 would converge to 1 and payo¤s would converge to full information payo¤s as ! 0.


                                                            9
is bad     0   go to 0 (regardless of the relative sizes of these probabilities). Thus, both the probability
of accidental con‡ict and the fear of the other group’s true intentions must be small for e¢ ciency to
prevail. The intuition here can be seen from examining the formula for                  t:   if   0   is vanishingly small,
                                                             t
then any positive probability of con‡ict 1          (1      ) is large enough that a player who observes con‡ict
will restart cooperation. Hence, the probability that con‡ict actually occurs at any point in a given
T -period cycle goes to 0 when both           and    0   go to 0.
       Formally, we have the following result, where social welfare is evaluated according to the limit-of-
means criterion (proof in Appendix B).16

Proposition 3 Suppose that both groups are normal. Then the following hold:

   1. The limit of expected social welfare as            ! 0 is less than the e¢ cient level 2u (1; 1).

   2. For any sequence         n;   0;n   converging to (0; 0) as n ! 1 (such that Assumptions 1-3 hold for
         all n), the limit of expected social welfare as n ! 1 equals the e¢ cient level 2u (1; 1).

2.3      Application to Ethnic Con‡ict and International War
An immediate application of our baseline model is to ethnic con‡ict and international war. Consider
two ethnic groups (or two countries) who repeatedly face the potential for con‡ict. For each potential
con‡ict, the groups choose between two actions sequentially, and one of these corresponds to aggression
or war. We assume that representatives of the two ethnic groups alternate in taking the …rst action
as in the baseline model. The “security dilemma,” or the “Hobbesian trap,” suggests a game form in
which a group or country dislikes taking the peaceful action when the other side is aggressive. In our
overlapping-generations setup, this exactly corresponds to parts 1-2 of Assumption 1, implying that
aggression is a best response to the belief that the other side has been aggressive so far or is expected
to be aggressive in the future. Part 3 of Assumption 1 then implies that both sides are better o¤
without such aggression.17
       It is plausible in the context of such con‡ict that non-aggressive acts are sometimes viewed as
aggressive by the other party, justifying our assumption concerning the relationship between actions
and signals (i.e., between y and y~).18 Finally, we believe that, though extreme, the assumption that
the past history of signals is not fully observed is also reasonable in this context. Even though we
all have access to history books, it is di¢ cult to ascertain and agree on how and exactly when a
  16                                                                                 PN
      That is, if player t’s payo¤ is ut , social welfare is de…ned to be limN !1 N1  t=0 ut .
   17
      One might argue that our baseline model would better capture the “…rst-mover advantage” aspect of ethnic con‡ict
if we allowed player t’s payo¤ from choosing war after getting the peaceful signal from player t 1 to di¤er from her
payo¤ from choosing war prior to player t+1’s playing peace; that is, if we allowed a player’s payo¤ to depend on whether
she moves …rst or second in a given con‡ict. Our results would not be a¤ected by this generalization so long as each
potential con‡ict remains a coordination game (i.e., a player wants to match her opponent’s action or signal, regardless
of whether she moves …rst or second).
   18
      An alternative that leads to identical results is to assume that even when a group mostly consists of normal, non-
aggressive types, a few of its members may be aggressive (e.g., military commanders bent on initiating con‡ict even
when most politicians prefer peace).


                                                            10
given con‡ict started (see also Section 3). Consequently, the structure of the baseline model together
with Assumptions 1-3 can be applied to the analysis of ethnic con‡ict or international war, and this
leads to the equivalent of Proposition 1, accounting for potential con‡ict spirals and their endogenous
cessation.


3         Extensions
This section presents four extensions of the baseline model, each relaxing a simplifying assumption
made in the main analysis. The goal is to show that our main explanation of cycles of distrust— and
thus our analysis of the applications— is not overly sensitive to these assumptions. Section 3.1 assumes
that players do not observe calendar time, ruling out the strict dependence on calendar time found in
the baseline model. Section 3.2 shows that behavior can be independent of calendar time even when
time is observed, if additional information about the previous player’s type is available. Section 3.3
allows the bad action to generate the good signal as well as the other way around. Section 3.4 allows
players to observe the signals of actions taken more than one period ago.

3.1         Unobserved Calendar Time
One highly stylized aspect of the baseline model is the strict dependence of behavior on calendar time.
The most direct way of eliminating this feature is to assume that players do not know calendar time:
each player observes a signal y~t           1   of her predecessor’s action and then chooses actions (xt ; yt ), without
knowing t. This approach is intuitively appealing, but it introduces the somewhat delicate issue of
what players believe about calendar time when they enter the game. Here, we simply assume that
players have an “improper uniform prior” about calendar time, in that they take the probability of
observing signal y~t            to equal the long-run fraction of periods in which the signal equals y~t                   19
                            1                                                                                         1.        Player
0, however, is assumed to know calendar time (e.g., she can infer this from the fact that she does not
observe a signal).
         In such a model, normal players play yt = 1 in response to y~t                         1   = 1, as they know the other
group is normal after observing y~t               1   = 1. There can be no equilibrium in which normal players play
yt = 0 in response to y~t           1   = 0 with probability 1: if there were, then y~t                1   = 0 would be observed
almost surely in the long run, so a normal player would believe that the opposing group is good with
probability        0   <    after observing y~t        1   = 0 and would therefore play yt = 1 (by Assumption 2). So
suppose that in response to y~t            1    = 0 normal players play yt = 0 with some probability p 2 [0; 1] and
play yt = 1 with probability 1              p. Then when both groups are good the long-run fraction of periods
in which y~t       1   = 0— denoted by q— is given by q =                + (1        ) qp, or

                                                           q=                    .
                                                                1   (1      )p

                                                                    11
This expression follows because if there is a misperception then y~t                                    1   = 0 with probability 1 while if
there is not a misperception then y~t              1   = 0 with probability qp.
           Now a normal player’s assessment of the probability that the other group is bad after observing
y~t    1    = 0 is given by
                                                                             0
                                                          =                                     .
                                                                  0 + (1                 0) q
For her to be indi¤erent between playing yt = 0 and yt = 1, it must be that                                         =     , or

                                                                         0           1
                                                       q=q                                          .
                                                                    1            0

This holds if and only if
                                                                         q
                                                        p=p                                     .
                                                                        q (1               )
Summarizing, we have the following result:20

Proposition 4 Under Assumptions 1 and 2, the model with an improper uniform prior over calendar
time has a unique symmetric sequential equilibrium. It has the following properties:

       1. Normal player 0 plays y0 = 1.

       2. At every time t > 0, normal player t plays good actions (xt = 1; yt = 1) if she gets the good signal
             y~t   1   = 1. If she gets the bad signal y~t    1   = 0, she plays the bad action xt = 0 toward player t                   1
             and plays the good action yt = 1 toward player t + 1 with probability 1                                p .

       3. Bad players always play bad actions (xt = 0; yt = 0).

           This result implies that even when calendar time is not observed, our model generates (irregular)
cycles: when both groups are good, a con‡ict spiral starts in each period with probability                                        and ends
in each period with probability 1 p . Therefore, this important aspect of our model does not depend
on players’observing calendar time.

3.2           Independence from Observable Calendar Time
In the baseline model, the T th player plays the good action (toward the next player) regardless of
her signal, while the T                 1st player plays the good action only if she gets the good signal. This
“discontinuous” behavior is driven by the endogenously changing informativeness of the bad signal
(or con‡ict) about the other group’s type. In particular, the T th player, correctly, thinks observing
con‡ict is su¢ ciently likely that it is uninformative, while it is slightly more informative for the T                                 1st
player; and this di¤erence is enough to cause them to behave di¤erently in equilibrium. Thus, the
di¤erent behavior of the T th and T                     1st players is not driven by calendar time per se— after all,
nobody directly cares about calendar time— but rather by the informativeness of con‡ict.
      20
           Here, a symmetric equilibrium is one in which all normal players (except for player 0) use the same strategy.


                                                                     12
       This subsection clari…es this idea by assuming that with probability                                           2 (0; 1), independently of
all other random variables, player t is “crazy.”Thus, each group consists of either 1                                            normal players
and      crazy players, or 1            bad players and              crazy players. Crazy players are more inclined to play
the bad actions xt = 0 and yt = 0 than normal players are; for simplicity, we just assume that they
always play (xt = 0; yt = 0) though this is not necessary. Crazy players also di¤er from both normal
and bad players in that their type is observable to the next player. That is, every player t observes
whether or not player t             1 was crazy, in addition to observing x
                                                                          ~t                             1.
       The point of adding crazy players to the baseline model is that now if player t sees that player t                                     1
was crazy, then she becomes like player T in the baseline model in that for her con‡ict is uninformative
of the other group’s type. Therefore, normal players always cooperate when the previous player was
crazy. In addition, if there are enough crazy players, there are no longer deterministic restarts of trust,
because getting the bad signal from a non-crazy player is always a strong signal that the other group
is bad. In this case, whether or not players observe calendar time in the model becomes irrelevant,
but cycles of distrust emerge again for reasons similar to those in the baseline model.21
       To see this formally, …rst note that the analog of Assumption 2, which guarantees that normal
player 0 plays y0 = 1, is now:

Assumption 20
                                                                              1           u (0; 0)        u (1; 0)
                                            0   <     CRAZY      1                                                     :
                                                                         1                u (1; 1)        u (1; 0)

       As in the baseline model, let              t   be the probability that normal player t assigns to the other group
being normal after getting a bad signal from a non-crazy player, under the hypothesis that normal
players play yt = 0 if and only if they get a bad signal from a non-crazy player. The following lemma
characterizes     t:


Lemma 1 We have
                                                                                  0
                                t   =                                                                                  :
                                                                 (1 )
                                            0 + (1        0)     +(1 )                1       (1        )t (1    )t

This is decreasing in t, and satis…es limt!1                     t        1       <       CRAZY         if and only if
                                                                     (    CRAZY                    0)
                                        <                                                                        ;                           (1)
                                                           CRAZY              0       +   0   1         CRAZY

which is a positive number under Assumption 20 .

       The genericity assumption is now modi…ed to:

Assumption 30          t   6=   CRAZY           for all t 2 N.
  21
    The presence of crazy players may also be realistic: for example, it may be that in any ethnic group there is a
probability that an aggressive military leader, who always (regardless of the preferences of the group) wants to wage
war, comes to power, and this is observed by the next generation.


                                                                         13
     We now describe the unique equilibrium. When both groups are normal, con‡ict phases always
begin with a misperception and end with the arrival of a crazy player. Whether there is also a
deterministic component of con‡ict cycles (as there is in the baseline model) depends on whether                                      is
greater or less than                . If   <      , then eventually being in a con‡ict phase is weak enough evidence
that the other group is bad that normal players will eventually switch to the good action— because
 1    <         CRAZY —       and so there are deterministic restarts. But if              >   , then being in a con‡ict cycle is
always strong enough evidence that the other group is bad that normal players do not restart (because
 1    >         CRAZY ),      so restarts are purely stochastic.

Proposition 5 Under Assumptions 1, 20 , and 30 , the model with crazy types has a unique sequential
equilibrium. Let                 be given by (1) and TCRAZY         min ft :       t   <    CRAZY g.   Then:
     If         <      , then the equilibrium has the following properties:

  1. At every time t 6= 0 mod TCRAZY , normal player t plays the good actions (xt = 1; yt = 1) if she
          gets the good signal y~t         1   = 1, and plays the bad actions (xt = 0; yt = 0) if she gets the bad signal
          y~t    1   = 0.

  2. At every time t = 0 mod TCRAZY , normal player t plays the good action xt = 1 toward player
          t      1 if and only if she gets the good signal y~t          1   = 1, but plays the good action yt = 1 toward
          player t + 1 regardless of her signal.

  3. Bad players and crazy players always play bad actions (xt = 0; yt = 0).

     If         >      , then the equilibrium has the following properties:

  1. At every time t > 0, normal player t plays good actions (xt = 1; yt = 1) if she gets the good signal
          y~t    1   = 1, and plays the bad actions (xt = 0; yt = 0) if she gets the bad signal y~t                   1   = 0.

  2. Normal player 0 plays the good action y0 = 1 toward player 1.

  3. Bad players and crazy players always play bad actions (xt = 0; yt = 0).

     The proof is straightforward given Proposition 1 and Lemma 1: If                                 <    then       1    <     CRAZY ,
and hence             t   <   CRAZY    for su¢ ciently large t, so TCRAZY is well-de…ned. The result in this case is
analogous to Proposition 1. In contrast, if                   >     then      1    >       CRAZY ,   and hence    t   >     CRAZY    for
all t. So normal player t plays yt = 1 if and only if y~t               1   = 1.

3.3        Two-Sided Errors
The analysis of the baseline model was simpli…ed by the assumption that only the good action can
generate the good signal. This section shows that our main conclusions still apply when either action
can generate either signal.


                                                                   14
       In particular, assume now that the signal y~t                                   1   is distributed as follows:

                                                       Pr (~
                                                           yt      1   = 1jyt              1   = 1) = 1
                                                                                                                             0
                                                       Pr (~
                                                           yt      1   = 1jyt              1   = 0) =                            ,

where ;          0   2 (0; 1) and     +   0   < 1. The assumption that                                                   +           0       < 1 means that the good action is
more likely to generate the good signal than is the bad action, and is thus essentially a normalization.
       As in the baseline model, Assumption 1 guarantees that normal player t plays xt = 1 if and only
if y~t   1   = 1, and Assumption 2 guarantees that she plays yt = 1 if and only if her assessment of the
probability that the other group is bad after observing y~t                                                     1       is less than                   . Denote her assessment of
this probability after observing y~t                   1   = 0 by          t   (as usual), and denote her assessment of this probability
after observing y~t              = 1 (which equals 0 in the baseline model, due to one-sided errors) by                                                                               0.   To

be the Markov transition matrix governing the evolution of y~t in the event that both groups are
normal, under the hypothesis that normal players play yt = 1 if and only if y~t                                                                                  1   = 1. That is, if both
groups are normal and y~t = 1, then y~t+1 = 1 with probability 1                                                                                 ; if, on the other hand, y~t = 0,
then y~t+1 = 1 with probability                   0.   Then, by Bayes rule,
                                                                                                           0)

                                                                     0 (1                          (1               0)       +           0


If     1     <       , then Assumption 2 guarantees the existence of a smallest time T2                                                                                 SIDED   such that
  T2     SIDED
                 <        , and there is a deterministic cycle with period T2                                                                SIDED ,   as in the baseline model. If
on the other hand             1       , then there is no deterministic cycle, and in particular a bad signal always
leads to a spiral of bad actions that lasts until the next accidental good signal.
       Summarizing, we have the following result (proof in Appendix B):



                                                                                       15
Proposition 6 Under Assumptions 1-3, the model with two-sided errors has a unique sequential equi-
librium. If              1    <      , then the equilibrium has the following properties:

      1. At every time t 6= 0 mod T2                   SIDED ,   normal player t plays the good actions (xt = 1; yt = 1) if she
             gets the good signal y~t           1   = 1, and plays the bad actions (xt = 0; yt = 0) if she gets the bad signal
             y~t   1   = 0.

      2. At every time t = 0 mod T2                    SIDED ,   normal player t plays the good action xt = 1 toward player
             t     1 if and only if she gets the good signal y~t              1   = 1, but plays the good action yt = 1 toward
             player t + 1 regardless of her signal.

      3. Bad players always play bad actions (xt = 0; yt = 0).

       If instead             1        , then the equilibrium has the following properties:

      1. At every time t > 0, normal player t plays the good actions (xt = 1; yt = 1) if she gets the good
             signal y~t       1   = 1, and plays the bad actions (xt = 0; yt = 0) if she gets the bad signal y~t      1   = 0.

      2. Normal player 0 plays the good action y0 = 1 toward player 1.

      3. Bad players always play the bad actions (xt = 0; yt = 0).

3.4           More Information About the Past
Another stylized aspect of the baseline model is the assumption that players observe a signal of
only the most recent action yt                        1,   and get no information about any earlier actions. Though this
simple information structure allowed us to explicitly characterize equilibrium and show that it features
“restarts”of trust every T periods, it is not necessary for our main intuition for cycling. This section
shows that when players observe the previous K signals, for any integer K, there are still deterministic
restarts of trust (though not necessarily at regular intervals); in particular, we show that there are
still in…nitely many times t at which a normal player plays the good action xt = 1 even if she observes
K bad signals, and that this occurs for essentially the same reason as in the baseline model.22
       Formally, let us modify the baseline model by supposing that players observe the previous
K signals, for some …xed integer K.                               That is, before choosing her action, player t observes
 y~t       K; y
              ~t (K 1) ; : : : ; y~t 1     , where this vector is truncated at 0 if t < K. Player t’s utility function
is still given by u (xt ; y~t             1)   + u (~
                                                    yt ; xt+1 ), exactly as in the baseline model.

Proposition 7 Under Assumptions 1 and 2, in any sequential equilibrium of the model where players
observe the last K signals, there are in…nitely many times t at which normal player t plays the good
action yt = 1 toward player t + 1 with positive probability when she observes all bad signals (i.e., when
y~t    k   = 0 for all k 2 f1; : : : ; Kg).
  22
     In addition, the event that player t observes K bad signals always occurs with positive probability, in particular with
probability at least K .


                                                                         16
    Proposition 7 and its proof, which is presented in Appendix B, show that our main intuition for
cycling goes through when players observe any number of past signals, not just one. However, when
K > 1 cycling is no longer regular (i.e., there is no longer a restart of trust every T periods), and
explicitly characterizing equilibrium seems very challenging.23
    A …nal remark on more information about the past: In the context of war or ethnic con‡ict, it
is sometimes argued that grievances from the distant past can be a salient source of con‡ict and
distrust (e.g., massacres or desecration of holy sites). Proposition 7 can be modi…ed to allow for this
possibility. Suppose that every instance of con‡ict (i.e., every time that y~t = 0 or xt = 0) leads to
a lasting grievance for the opposing group with some probability. If players always remember the
                                   ~ grievances for some (potentially arbitrarily large but …nite) K,
exact timing of their group’s last K                                                               ~ no
matter how long ago they originated (but forget earlier grievances), then the same argument leading
to Proposition 7 (see Apendix B) implies that there are again in…nitely many times at which normal
                                                                                     ~ grievances. In
players restart cooperation even if the last K signals are all bad and they remember K
consequence, con‡ict cycles emerge even when players can remember unboundedly distant grievances
with positive probability.


4     Application to Political Partisanship and Participation Cycles
This section develops a detailed application of our model to cycles of political partisanship and political
participation. A standard— though not uncontroversial— narrative is that polarization in American
politics was high in the …rst third of the 20th century, low in the middle third, and high in the last
third. For example, McCarty, Poole, and Rosenthal (2008) document this pattern of polarization
between Democrats and Republicans in congressional roll call votes. Other prominent views are that
underlying political preferences have not polarized to nearly the same extent as have the major parties’
political positions (Fiorina, 2011) and that political partisanship and participation are closely linked
(Abramowitz, 2011).
    The model we present in this section provides an approach for thinking about polarization between
political parties in the absence of polarization of the electorate. In particular, we consider political
competition between two parties that can each be either moderate or extremist. Every period, the
representative of the party in power can take action on either a major, common interest issue (e.g.,
the economy) or a partisan issue (e.g., school prayer). Taking action on the major issue requires some
form of cooperation from the previous political leader; we model this by assuming that the previous
leader may learn some information about the economy that must be passed on for the current leader
to set economic policy e¤ectively.24 Whether or not this cooperation is granted is observed by the
  23
     The reason for this is as follows: the good action yt = 1 is a best response to a single good signal (i.e., y~t k = 1 for
some k 2 f1; : : : ; Kg). In turn, when a player observes all bad signals, she has to update her beliefs about the last time
a player restarted trust, which can be an intractable updating problem.
  24
     One could alternatively assume, with identical results, that the previous leader may need to give the current leader
a vote of con…dence in order for her to be able to make major policy changes.



                                                             17
political supporters of the incumbent party— referred to as its “base”— and can in‡uence their decision
on whether or not to turn out to vote (in an extension of the model, we allow both parties’bases to
turn out). The di¤erence between moderate and extremist politicians is that moderates care more
about the major issue, while extremists care more about the partisan issue; thus, unlike in our earlier
models, we do not assume that extremists are committed to some course of action, and the behavior
of both moderates and extremists is determined by strategic considerations.
   We show that this model leads to a distinctive pattern of partisanship and turnout that resembles
the cycles of distrust in our baseline model. Extremists never cooperate or communicate with the other
party, because in equilibrium cooperating would signal to the base that the other party is moderate
and the base would therefore not bother turning out. Moderates cooperate as long as they believe
that the other party is su¢ ciently likely to be moderate. In equilibrium, a single accidental failure of
cooperation leads to a partisan phase in which no parties cooperate, the bases turn out, and politicians
act only on the partisan issue. However, eventually a politician realizes that a partisan phase was
quite likely to have started by accident, and hence cooperates with the other party, which leads to a
trusting phase where both parties cooperate, the bases do not turn out, and politicians act only on
the major issue. As in the baseline model, these phases alternate, and the dynamics are driven by
how much the parties trust each other.
   We split this section into three subsections. Subsection 4.1 presents the model, subsection 4.2
characterizes the unique equilibrium, and subsection 4.3 extends the model by allowing both parties’
bases to turn out.

4.1   Model
Group A is a left-wing party and Group B is a right-wing party. In every period t = 0; 1; 2; : : :, a
representative of the group in power is the leader (“player t”). A di¤erent representative is chosen
every period, and representatives do not know what happened in past periods (including which group
was in power— the dynamics of power holding are described below). Each group can either consist
entirely of moderates or entirely of extremists. The probability that a group consists entirely of
extremists is   0   > 0. Both moderates and extremists are policy-motivated but they di¤er in what
political issues they …nd more important.
   Every period, player t can take action on one of two issues: the “major issue” wt or the “partisan
issue” zt . Players’ ideal actions on the partisan issue are …xed over time and commonly known. In
                                                                                                         1
contrast, the period t state   t   2 f 1; 1g is drawn independently every period, with probability       2   on
either state. Player t observes the period t state     t   and has the option of attempting to communicate
this to player t + 1. If player t attempts communication (denoted st = 1), communication succeeds
(denoted s~t = 1) with probability 1        2 (0; 1), in which case player t + 1 observes   t   (and can infer
that communication was attempted), and communication fails (denoted s~t = 0) with probability , in
which case player t + 1 does not observe       t   (and also does not observe whether communication was
attempted).

                                                       18
         The timing is as follows: At the beginning of period t, the identity of the group in power and
its representative, player t, is determined. Player t then observes                          t,    and also observes         t 1   if player
t        1 successfully communicated it. We also assume that player 0 directly observes or has received
communication about the initial state                      1.    Player t then chooses which issue to “take action” on.
Taking action on the major issue means choosing a policy wt 2 [ 1; 1] for the major issue, while taking
action on the partisan issue means choosing a policy zt 2 [ 1; 1] for the partisan issue, and in either
case it is assumed that the period t policy on the issue on which action is not taken is set equal to the
default policy 0. Finally, player t decides whether to attempt to communicate                                  t   to player t + 1. Note
that player t makes these decisions without knowing which group will be in power in period t + 1.
         Player t cares about policy on both issues in periods t and t + 1. The di¤erence between left-wing
players and right-wing players is that they have opposite preferences about the partisan issue: left-wing
players have bliss point zt =            1, and right-wing players have bliss point zt = 1. The di¤erence between
moderates and extremists is that moderates think the major issue is more important than the partisan
issue, while extremists think the partisan issue is more important.25 Formally, the relative importance
of the two issues is measured by a constant                      2 (0; 1). Moderate player t of type                2 f 1; +1g, where
    1 corresponds to left-wing and +1 corresponds to right wing, has payo¤

             um (wt ; wt+1 ; zt ; zt+1 ; t ;   t+1 )   =   jwt      t 1j     jwt+1      tj          jzt    j         jzt+1     j.

Extremist player t of type              has payo¤

             ue (wt ; wt+1 ; zt ; zt+1 ; t ;   t+1 )   =    jwt       t 1j      jwt+1         tj     jzt       j    jzt+1     j.

These payo¤ functions make it clear that the only di¤erence between moderates and extremists is in
the weights that they put on the major and the partisan issues, and the only di¤erence between left
and right-wing players is in their bliss point for the partisan issue.
         We now describe the dynamics of power holding. Which group holds power in the initial period
t = 0 is determined by the ‡ip of a fair coin, and in every subsequent period t = 1; 2; : : : which group
holds power is determined by an election at the end of period t                              1. The potential voters are either
“independents”or are members of a group of organized supporters of the left or the right, referred to
henceforth as the left and right bases. A base has to pay some cost c > 0 in order to organize and
motivate their supporters to turn out for the election, and we assume (for now) that a base can only do
this if its own party is in power. Thus, the incumbent party’s base will turn out for the election if the
potential gain compensates for the cost of organization. We assume that the number of net votes from
independent voters for the incumbent party in each period is given by an independent draw from some
distribution G symmetric about 0; hence, without turnout from the bases, the incumbent party wins
the election with probability G (0) = 21 . Let k denote the size of each base, so when the supporters of
    25
    In particular, all di¤erences in the propensities of moderates and extremists to communicate are derived rather than
assumed. In other words, in contrast to the baseline model, extremists are not behavioral types committed to a particular
action, but choose a di¤erent action because of the di¤erent weights they put on the major and the partisan issue.


                                                                    19
the incumbent party turn out, that party wins with probability G (k) > 12 , and to simplify notation
we let 1               G (k). Note that turning out increases the probability that the incumbent party wins
                   1        1
by (1      )       2   =    2     . We make the following assumption, which serves only to focus attention on
the most interesting region of parameter space:

                                           1
Assumption POL                    1.   <       4    .
                        1                               1
          2. c 2        2         (1 + )       0;       2   (2 ) .
                                   4   +2(1         )
          3.   0   <       P OL        1+               .

    We also assume that the incumbent’s base at time t consists of individuals who are in their youth
at time t, and have the same payo¤ functions as moderate politicians. This in particular implies that
the base will not turn out in response the propaganda because it has extreme preferences or it is
fooled by this, but because even with moderate preferences it will …nd it bene…cial to turn out given
its expectations about the type of the other side.
    The last element of the model is the information of the base. We assume that the period t base
knows only whether its group is in power (but not whether it is moderate or extremist) and the
realization s~t . The interpretation is that s~t = 1 represents an “informative” message to the next
leader, while s~t = 0 represents a “propaganda” message to the base (and the probability law for s~t
re‡ects the fact that a message that is meant to be informative may be misinterpreted as propaganda).
We also assume that, as in the baseline model, all players observe calendar time.

4.2     Equilibrium
We now show that this model has a sequential equilibrium in which politicians behave much as in the
baseline model— where attempting communication is like the good action, and sending propaganda is
like the bad action— and where the base turns out if and only if it receives propaganda. Furthermore,
equilibrium is unique for generic parameter values (proof in Appendix B).26

Proposition 8 Under Assumption POL, the political partisanship model has a generically unique
sequential equilibrium. There exists an integer TP OL > 0 such that in this equilibrium:

   1. At every time t 6= 0 mod TP OL , moderate player t plays (wt =                       t 1 ; st   = 1) if s~t   1   = 1, and
        otherwise plays (zt =           1; st = 0) (if left-wing) or (zt = 1; st = 0) (if right-wing).

   2. At every time t = 0 mod TP OL , moderate player t plays (wt =                        t 1 ; st   = 1) if s~t   1   = 1, and
        otherwise plays (zt =           1; st = 1) (if left-wing) or (zt = 1; st = 1) (if right-wing).

   3. Extremist player t always plays (zt =                   1; st = 0) if left-wing or (zt = 1; st = 0) if right-wing.
  26
     In general, sequential equilibrium is not well-de…ned in games with a continuum of actions. This is not a problem
here, because the probability distribution over player t + 1’s information sets depends on player t’s strategy only through
the binary variable st . So one can de…ne sequential equilibrium by supposing that players “tremble” only on st .


                                                                     20
  4. The base turns out if and only if it receives propaganda.

   There are several di¤erences between Proposition 8 and Proposition 1. First, the analogy between
sending informative messages and the good action in the baseline model must be established. A
preliminary observation is that extremists always choose to act on the partisan issue, because for
them the partisan issue is more important than the major issue. Moderates, on the other hand,
act on the major issue if and only if they receive information about the current state, since they
cannot improve on the default policy on the major issue unless they are informed of the current state.
Now, given that the base turns out if and only if it receives propaganda, the bene…t of attempting
communication is greater when the opposing group is more likely to be moderate, while the cost of
attempting communication (i.e., the opportunity cost of not sending propaganda) does not depend
on whether the opposing group is moderate (as after propaganda the next leader always acts on the
partisan issue, as she is not informed of the state). Thus, sending informative messages is like the
good action in the baseline model.
   Second, the incentives of the base must be accounted for. When the base hears propaganda it knows
that it is in a partisan phase, so its belief about the opposing group is irrelevant (as in a partisan phase
                                                                                    1
moderates and extremists play the same way), and the assumption that c <            2     (2 ) implies that
the base turns out. When the base hears communication, it infers that the opposing group is extremist
with at most the prior probability     0   (i.e., hearing communications is “good news” about the other
                                                              1
group’s type), in which case the assumption that c >          2     (1 + )   0   implies that the base does
not turn out.
   Third, the probability of power changes is now endogenous and depends on the two groups’types,
so that now the fact that a particular group …nds itself in power is informative of the other group’s type.
This makes Bayesian updating somewhat subtle. Nonetheless, Lemma 2 in Appendix B shows that
moderate player t’s assessment of the probability that the opposing group is extremist,       t   (conditional
on player t     1 failing to communicate and player t’s group holding power in period t), behaves as in
the baseline model in the long run, and also that      1   ! 1 as   ! 0 (which implies that TP OL > 1 for
small , so that partisan cycles are not trivial).

4.3   Allowing Both Bases to Turn Out
We now dispense with the simplifying assumption that only the base of the incumbent party can
turn out. The rest of the model is as above, and in particular the out-of-power period t base cannot
receive propaganda from its party, so it cannot infer whether or not the period t leader successfully
communicates (unlike the in-power period t base). Therefore, the out-of-power period t base can
condition its turnout decision only on calendar time.
   The following result shows that there are two possible consequences of letting the out-of-power
base turn out: either it never turns out in equilibrium, and in this case, the equilibrium is exactly as
in Proposition 8, or it turns out deterministically in the later periods of each cycle, in which case the


                                                     21
cycle length can also be di¤erent from TP OL .

Proposition 9 Under Assumption POL, the political partisanship model where the out-of-power base
can also turn out has a generically unique sequential equilibrium. In this equilibrium, one of the
following two statements hold, and each holds for some parameter values:

    1. The out-of-power base never turns out in sequential equilibrium, and the sequential equilibrium
       strategies for the politicians and the in-power base are exactly as in the main partisanship model.

    2. There exist integers T^ < T~ such that the sequential equilibrium strategies for the politicians and
       the in-power base are as in the main partisanship model with cycle length T~, and the out-of-power
       base turns out at time t if and only if t       T^ mod T~.

    Proposition 9 shows that partisan cycles behave much as in the main partisanship model when both
bases can turn out. However, the corresponding turnout cycle now has an additional deterministic
component: in each cycle, the out-of-power base turns out deterministically after a certain cuto¤ time
T^. Thus, the overall turnout cycle is given by stochastic turnout of the in-power base coinciding with
the onset of the partisan phase, deterministic turnout by the out-of-power base in the latter part of
each cycle, and a deterministic drop in turnout at the end of each cycle.
    The intuition for Proposition 9 is that the out-of-power base would like to turn out if and only if
the partisan cycle has begun. Since this is more likely later in each cycle, the out-of-power base turns
out deterministically after a certain cuto¤ time T^ in each cycle. If the implied cuto¤ time is greater
than the cycle length T~, then the out-of-power base never turns out (in which case T~ must equal the
cycle length in the main partisanship model, TP OL ).


5     Related Theoretical Literature
Before concluding the paper, we take a moment to relate it, from a more theoretical perspective, to
several existing classes of models that provide explanations for cyclic behavior in dynamic games:
repeated games with imperfect public monitoring, stochastic games, reputation models of credibility,
reputation models with limited records, and dynamic games with overlapping generations of players.
In abstract terms, our baseline model is best described as a reputation model with limited records
and overlapping generations, and it is to our knowledge the …rst such model in the literature. A
central and distinguishing feature of our model is the uniqueness of equilibrium and the associated
cycles which have both stochastic and deterministic elements.27 More speci…cally, the fact that our
key mechanism can lead to unique equilibrium cycles where the end date of the cycle is a deterministic
function of time highlights that it is in essence very di¤erent from the existing literature (though we
  27
     A notable partial exception here is Pesendorfer’s (1995) model of fashion cycles. In his model, a durable-goods
monopolist faces a population of consumers who signal their types by purchasing the good, and the logic of cycles is
entirely di¤erent.


                                                        22
have shown in Section 3 that variants of our model can also generate patterns of behavior that are
more complicated and realistic than regular deterministic cycles).
   Repeated games with imperfect public monitoring date back to Green and Porter (1984). In their
model, cyclic equilibrium behavior is due to moral hazard: bad signals lead to phases of bad actions,
and vice versa. Abreu, Pearce, and Stachetti (1988, 1990) show this behavior can in fact emerge in
optimal equilibria. Yared (2010) applies these insights to cycles of war and peace. These models di¤er
from ours in that they have no incomplete information about types, they do not feature deterministic
cycles, and they do not have equilibrium uniqueness.
   Two branches of the stochastic games literature are particularly related. First, there are stochastic
games of perfect information in which behavior cycles with the state. A leading example is Dixit,
Grossman, and Gul’s (2000) model of political compromise, which extends Alesina (1988) to the case
of more than two states. See also Baron (1996), Battaglini and Coate (2008), and Acemoglu, Golosov,
and Tsyvinski (2010). Second, there are reputation games where players’ types follow a Markov
process (Mailath and Samuelson, 2001; Phelan, 2006; Wiseman, 2009; Ekmecki, Gossner, and Wilson,
2011). Letting players’ types change in our model would only produce a second reason for cycling.
Typically, these models do not have deterministic cycles or equilibrium uniqueness.
   Among reputation models, the literature on “credibility,”starting with Sobel (1985) and Benabou
and Laroque (1992), is particularly related. In these models, there is a deterministic or stochastic
cycle in which a long-run player builds her reputation by being trustworthy against a series of short-
run players, before cheating them and thus burning her reputation. As such, cycling is a short-run
phenomenon that ends when players’types are learned.
   The recent literature on reputation with limited records (Liu and Skrzypacz, 2011; Liu, 2011;
Monte, 2011) is closely related to our paper. Most closely related is Liu and Skrzypacz (2011),
where a long-run player facing a series of short-run player with limited records repeatedly builds her
reputation up to a point and then exploits it. These models do not have deterministic cycles and the
mechanism for cycles is completely di¤erent.
   Finally, our paper is related to the literature on dynamic games with overlapping generations
of players. The folk theorem often fails in these models— and indeed the overlapping generations
aspect of our model is important for equilibrium uniqueness. The …rst anti-folk theorem in this
literature is derived by Laguno¤ and Matsui (1997), who show uniqueness in an overlapping generations
coordination game. Bhaskar (1998) presents additional anti-folk theorems in a consumption-loan
model. Laguno¤ and Matsui (2004) develop a model where two groups interact over time, with a new
representative of each group drawn every period and communication between generations, as in our
model. In their model, the groups play a prisoner’s dilemma (while they play a coordination game
in our model), and there is no incomplete information in their model (while incomplete information
and learning about the other group’s type is key in our model). They show that “all defect” is the
only equilibrium, but that a folk theorem holds if communication costs or altruism within groups is
introduced. Anderlini, Gerardi, and Laguno¤ (2010) present a model of war related to Laguno¤ and


                                                  23
Matsui (2004), and show that there can be equilibrium cycles of war that hold each group below what
its minmax payo¤ would be if it were a single decision-maker. Finally, Acemoglu and Jackson (2011)
study a coordination game with overlapping generations and imperfect monitoring, where social norms
change over time and “prominent”players can try to shift the social norm to a good static equilibrium.
Their model does not have incomplete information about player types or deterministic cycles.


6    Conclusion
This paper has proposed a model of cycles of distrust and inter-group con‡ict based on the classical
idea that con‡ict often results from distrust of the other side. In a dynamic context, a real or perceived
aggression from one group makes it appear as innately aggressive to the other side, which in response
acts more aggressively itself. When the …rst group cannot be sure whether this new aggression is a
response to its own action or is due to the other side’s actually being aggressive, a spiral of aggression
and con‡ict forms. But— as our model shows— such a spiral cannot last forever, because it eventually
becomes almost certain that a con‡ict spiral will have gotten started accidentally, at which point
aggressive actions become completely uninformative of the other group’s type. At such a time, a
group experiments with the trusting action, and cooperation is restored.
    We have also argued that this mechanism is robust and can be useful in understanding a range
of situations in which there are (endogenous) cycles of distrust. First, the presence of a …rst-mover
advantage in violent con‡ict makes our approach relevant to cycles of Hobbesian ethnic con‡ict or
international war. Second, similar forces can lead to cycles of political partisanship in a dynamic
model of policy choice and voter turnout. In addition, we show in Appendix A that these forces also
emerge in a simple model of production and trade as well as in a model of communication between
groups that may be moderate or extremist, and show that they can account for cyclic breakdowns of
trade and communication.
    Though our basic mechanism is simple, it is both di¤erent from existing explanations for cyclic
behavior in dynamic games and, we believe, potentially relevant for understanding why seemingly
unending con‡icts end, and why cooperation and communication often follow periods of distrust.
Our model points to several possible areas for future research. On the theoretical side, it would
be interesting to study the more complex reputational incentives that would emerge if players lived
for more than one period, and also to consider di¤erent ways in which players might learn about
the history of con‡ict and cooperation between the groups (though we make some progress in this
direction in Section 3). Finally, empirical analysis is needed to determine whether the mechanism
we highlight— agents concluding that long-lasting con‡icts are no longer informative about the true
intentions of the other party— can indeed account for cycles of distrust, con‡ict, polarization, and
communication breakdown in practice.

Appendix A: Additional Applications
Application to Trade
We now present a simple model of inter-group trade where members of one group will produce high-
quality goods only if they expect members of the other group to produce high-quality goods for which
they can trade. If everyone is afraid that the other group is unable or unwilling to produce high-quality
goods (i.e., be a “bad”trading partner), then the equilibrium involves a cycle in which phases of trust
and trade alternate with phases of distrust and the breakdown of production and trade.
       Group A produces apples and Group B produces bananas. Group A members can produce rotten
(“bad”) apples for free regardless of whether Group A is normal or bad, but if it is normal (which
occurs with probability 1             0 ),   then they can also produce good apples at cost c > 0. Similarly for
Group B and bananas.
       All players live for 2 periods, and get utility from consuming one piece of fruit in each period.
Members of Group A have a taste for bananas, and get utility b > c from consuming a good banana,
but only get utility d 2 (0; c) from consuming a good apple. Members of Group B get b from consuming
a good apple and get d from consuming a good banana. No one gets utility from consuming rotten
fruit. Assume also that a player gets utility              " if she trades for her opponent’s rotten fruit, where
" > 0 is interpreted as a (small) transaction cost; with this interpretation, the payo¤ b of consuming
the other group’s fruit is the payo¤ net of the transaction cost.28
       At time t = 1; 2; : : :, a market opens in which players t and t              1 can exchange goods. Production
by players t and t 1 for the time t market is staggered as we describe next. Each period is subdivided
                                                                  2        1
into three subperiods, which we denote as times t                 3,   t   3,   and t for convenience.
                     2
       At time t     3,    normal player t     1 chooses whether to produce a good fruit or a rotten fruit for the
time t market (bad players always produce rotten fruit), and her quality choice is denoted yt               1   2 f0; 1g
(frotten; goodg). If she produces a good fruit, it immediately rots with probability . Both players
then observe the …nal quality of her fruit, denoted y~t            1   2 f0; 1g.
                      1
       At time t      3,   normal player t chooses whether to produce a good fruit or a rotten fruit (having
observed y~t     1 ), and her quality choice is denoted by xt 2 f0; 1g (thus, xt is player t’s quality choice
                 1                                                                     1
at time t        3 for the time t market, and yt is her quality choice at time t + 3 for the time t + 1
market). Again, if she produces a good fruit, it rots with probability , and both players observe the
…nal quality of her fruit, denoted x
                                   ~t 2 f0; 1g.
       Finally, players t and t        1 arrive at the time t market. They then simultaneously decide on
whether they would like to exchange goods: the exchange occurs if and only if both decide to do so.
Each player then consumes the fruit she is left with (and pays the transaction cost if trade occurred).
Player t       1 then dies, player t + 1 is born, and the game continues with player t making her quality
choice at time t + 31 .
       The trade model di¤ers from the baseline model in that both players’good actions (or production
  28
       The transaction cost plays only a minor technical role in the analysis as discussed below.


                                                             25
choices) can turn bad in each period, and that players makes decisions about trade as well as produc-
tion. Nonetheless, as we now show, equilibrium behavior in the trade model is closely related to that
in the baseline model.
          Consider …rst the production decision of player 0. Let us conjecture that if player 0’s fruit does
not rot (~
         y0 = 1), then normal player 1 will produce a good fruit and trade will occur provided that
his fruit does not rot. Player 0’s expected payo¤ from producing a good fruit is:29
                                   h                     i
                          (1    0 ) (1    )2 b + (1   ) d + 0 (1     ) d c.

To see this, note that player 0 gets payo¤ b if player 1 is normal and neither fruit rots, while he gets
payo¤ d if her fruit doesn’t rot and either player 1 is normal but his fruit rots or player 1 is bad. On
the other hand, player 0’s expected payo¤ from producing a rotten fruit is 0, because rotten fruit never
generates a good signal (and is worth zero in consumption). Therefore, player 0 produces a good fruit
if and only if
                                                                      1                c   (1  )d
                                       0   <   T RADE        1                    2                            .
                                                                 (1           )            b d
          Suppose that this is the case, and consider the production decisions of normal player 1 at time 23 .
Clearly, she will choose to produce a bad fruit if player 0’s fruit is bad, as in this case trade never
occurs. In contrast, if player 0’s fruit is good, the assumption that                                      0       <     T RADE     is su¢ cient to
guarantee that she will choose to produce a good fruit. Intuitively, a good fruit is more attractive
when one’s partner’s fruit is good, and the assumption that                                0   <        T RADE         implies that producing a
good fruit is optimal even before knowing the quality of one’s partner’s fruit.
          Next, consider the production decisions of normal player 1 at time 1 + 13 . His position is now
similar to that of player 0 at time 13 , except that he has a di¤erent assessment of the probability that
the other group is bad. In particular, if player 0’s fruit was good, then he is certain that the other
group is good. If player 0’s fruit was bad, then he believes that the other group is bad with probability

                                                                          0
                                                         1   =
                                                                 0 + (1               0)

as in the baseline model. Thus, if              1   is above the cuto¤ belief                  T RADE ,    then player 1 produces a bad
fruit if player 0’s fruit was bad.
          The analogy with the baseline model should now be clear. Assuming that                                           t0   >   T RADE   for all
t0   < t, then when player t 1’s fruit is bad player t believes that the other group is bad with probability

                                                                          0
                                                t   =                                               .
                                                        0 + (1        0) 1            (1       )t

Once          t   drops below     , player t will produce a good fruit for the time t + 1 market even if player
t         1’s fruit was bad, and trade will resume until the next time a good fruit rots.
          Formally, impose the following versions of Assumptions 2 and 3 from the baseline model.
     29
          Here and in what follows, we take the limit " ! 0.


                                                                   26
Assumption 200      0   <    T RADE .

Assumption 300      t   6=   T RADE   for all t 2 N.

   We obtain the following result (proof in Appendix B):

Proposition 10 Under Assumptions 200 and 300 , the trade model has a unique trembling-hand perfect
equilibrium. It has the following properties (where TT RADE             min ft :   t   <       T RADE g):


  1. For every time t 6= 0 mod TT RADE , normal player t plays xt = 1 if and only if y~t                  1   = 1; approves
     trade in market t if and only if y~t     1   = 1; plays yt = 1 if and only if y~t     1   = 1; and approves trade
     in market t + 1 if and only if x
                                    ~t+1 = 1.

  2. For every time t = 0 mod TT RADE , normal player t plays xt = 1 if and only if y~t                   1   = 1; approves
     trade in market t if and only if y~t         1   = 1; always plays yt = 1; and approves trade in market
     t + 1 if and only if x
                          ~t+1 = 1.

  3. Bad players always play xt = 0; approve trade in market t if and only if y~t                    1   = 1; always play
     yt = 0; and approve trade in market t + 1 if and only if x
                                                              ~t+1 = 1.

   Proposition 10 is the analog of Proposition 1 for the model of trade, and has a similar intuition.
When an agent receives a rotten fruit, she reckons there is a su¢ ciently high probability that the other
side is not a good trading partner, and decides not to incur the cost for producing high-quality fruit
herself. This then creates a spiral e¤ect where distrust in the ability of the other sides to be a good
trading partner perpetrates over time. But, for the same reason as in the baseline model, this spiral
also comes to an end— after a while, one of the sides concludes that the observed lack of trade is not
very informative, and thus experiments with producing a high-quality fruit, which restarts trade.
   It is also worth noting that the role of the staggered nature of production for each market,
the " transaction cost, and the strengthening of the solution concept from sequential equilibrium
to trembling-hand perfect equilibrium is to ensure equilibrium uniqueness. Without these features,
the strategy pro…le described in Proposition 10 would still be an equilibrium, but there would also
be other, more “arti…cial” equilibria. For example, if production for each market were simultaneous,
there would be an equilibrium in which players always produce low-quality fruit because they are sure
that their trading partners do so as well. Without the transaction cost and trembling-hand perfection,
there would be equilibria where, when both fruits are rotten, players use their trade approval decisions
to send cheap talk messages (which are payo¤ irrelevant for them but matter for future generations).

Application to Communication
Another example of spiral e¤ects, and hence of potential cycles, is communication between two groups
on opposite sides of an issue. Even though informative communication may be in the interest of both
parties, the fear that the other side is extremist can prevent communication between “moderates”

                                                           27
(normal players). We present a simple model illustrating this possibility. We assume that the inter-
ests of moderates on the two sides are su¢ ciently aligned to permit equilibrium communication in the
absence of extremists— indeed, we take the extreme case where moderates on the two sides prefer the
same policy, conditional on any state of the world. However, moderates will tune out the other side
when they believe that they are listening to extremists. This implies that moderate communicators
will not send extreme messages (so as to separate themselves from extremists), provided they believe
the other group is likely to be moderate, but when they receive an extreme message, they will them-
selves also send an extreme message in return. This leads to cycles of moderation and extremism in
communication, with phases of no communication (reminiscent to the “echo-chambers” of Sunstein
(2006)) being followed by phases of informative and moderated communication.
   Suppose that Group A is left-wing, while Group B is right-wing. There are overlapping generations,
and each player lives for two periods, staggered across the groups. Informally, the model is as follows:

  1. Every period, a state of the world,        t,   is randomly drawn and is observed by the old player.

  2. The old player sends a message, st , to the young player (who is from the other group), who then
      takes an action at (as in a standard cheap talk game).

  3. The young player then ages, and the stage game repeats.

   In particular, if a representative of Group A is the “sender” (resp., “receiver”) in period t, then a
representative of Group B is the “sender” (resp., “receiver”) in period t + 1.
   More precisely, the model is as follows: The …rst representative of Group A is active in period
0 only, while subsequent representative of Group A are active in periods ft; t + 1g for t odd; and
representatives of Group B are active in periods ft; t + 1g for t even. In every period t = 0; 1; 2; : : :,
                                                                                        1
the period t state    t   2 f 1; 0; 1g is drawn independently, with probability         3   on each state, and is
observed by the active Group A representative if t is even, and by the active Group B representative
if t is odd. The player who observes the state (the “sender”) then sends a message st 2 f 1; 0; 1g
to the other player (the “receiver”), who receives message s~t 2 f 1; 0; 1g, where s~t equals st with
                 2
probability 1    3   , and s~t equals each of the other two possible messages with probability              3    each
(thus, the message is replaced with “white noise” with probability ). Finally, the receiver takes an
action at 2 f 1; 0; 1g, and the game moves on to period t + 1.
   We now assume that there are three types of agents: moderates, extremists, and naifs (i.e., “naive”
players). Each group consists entirely of one of these types. The probability that a group consists
entirely of extremists is    0   > 0, and the probability that a group consists entirely of naifs is         0   > 0.
Extremists and naifs are modelled as “behavioral types.”It is assumed that left-wing extremists always
send message st =     1 and take action at =         1, and right-wing extremists always send message st = 1
and take action at = 1. Naifs, on the other hand, always send message st =          t   and take action at = s~t ;
this implies that naifs can be in‡uenced by even extreme messages. Finally, a left-wing moderate
who is active in period t gets utility uL (at ; t ) when action at is taken in state          t,   and a right-wing

                                                         28
moderate gets utility uR (at ; t ); thus, for example, a left-wing moderate who is active in periods t and

These payo¤s are realized at the end of period t + 1, so that there is no information revealed from
payo¤ realizations.
       In addition, we assume that both left and right-wing moderates have preferences that satisfy single-
crossing in (a; ) and are single peaked with bliss point equal to the state                          t   at time t. This implies
that left-wing and right-wing moderates always agree on the best action when the state of the world
is known. However, we assume that a left-wing moderate prefers action                           1 when she believes that the
state is distributed “fairly evenly” on f 1; 0; 1g, while a right-wing moderate prefers action 1 when
he believes this, in a sense formalized below. In addition, we assume that uL (a; ) = uR ( a;                                       ) for
all (a; ). This simply allows us to avoid stating separate assumptions for uL and uR ; none of our
analysis relies on this symmetry.
       We again impose a range of assumptions on uL in order to focus on the most interesting region of
parameter space (where the corresponding assumptions on uR are implied by symmetry). To facilitate
exposition, we state these assumptions “parametrically”; we view them as being fairly weak in the
leading case where        is small relative to the other parameters.30 In particular, using the notation
“belief (x; y; z)” to stand for the belief that the state is                     1 with probability x, 0 with probability y,
and 1 with probability z, we impose:

Assumption COM              1. Action         1 is optimal for a left-wing moderate given belief

              (i.e., when the state is equally likely to be              1 and 0, and somewhat more likely to be 1).
           2. Action 0 is optimal for a left-wing moderate given belief

    For concreteness, a “typical” example satisfying the next assumption is given by                 = :01,    0   = :5,    0   = :1, and
uL (a; ) given by the following table:

                (i.e., when state is most likely to be 0, somewhat less likely to be 1, and much less likely to
                be   1).

           4. uL ( 1; 0) > uL (1; 0).

       Finally, for reasons familiar from cheap talk games, sequential equilibrium is not unique in this
model, even under appropriate payo¤ restrictions (unlike in our other models). For example, one can
always “switch”messages 0 and 1, say, so that message 0 corresponds to state 1 and vice versa.31 We
therefore impose the mild restriction of message-monotonicity: a sequential equilibrium is message
monotone if for all histories, if a normal sender sends signal s with positive probability when the state
is , then she never sends a signal strictly lower than s when the state is strictly higher than .32
       The result is the following (proof in Appendix B):

Proposition 11 Under Assumption COM, the communication model has a unique message-monotone
sequential equilibrium. It has the following properties:

   1. For all times t, left-wing moderate senders send st = 0 if             t   =   1 and s~t       1   2 f 1; 0g (or t = 0),
         and otherwise send st =      t.   Right-wing moderate senders send st = 0 if            t   = 1 and s~t   1   2 f0; 1g,
         and otherwise send st =      t.

   2. For all times t, left-wing moderate receivers play at =                1 if s~t 2 f 1; 1g, and play at = 0 if
         s~t = 0. Right-wing moderate receivers play at = 1 if s~t 2 f 1; 1g, and play at = 0 if s~t = 0.

       The existence part of Proposition 11 is straightforward: one can compute a player’s posterior belief
about both the state and the other group’s type following every possible signal s~ 2 f 1; 0; 1g, and
show that Assumption COM implies that the prescribed behavior is a best response. The intuition
for uniqueness is as follows. For concreteness, focus on a left-wing sender and right-wing receiver. By
Assumption COM, a moderate receiver plays a = 1 after signal s~ =                    1, as this signal is always fairly
likely to have come from an extremist sender, in which case it contains no information about . Also,
  31
     This is true even though, because of the presence of naifs, ours is not quite a cheap talk game. If there are enough
naifs ( 0 large), then one could recover uniqueness, but it is natural to think of 0 as small.
  32
     This is adapted from Chen’s (2011) de…nition of message monotonicity to allow for mixed strategies. Chen assumes
concave loss functions and a continuous action space, ensuring that all sequential equilibria are in pure strategies. Here,
we allow for mixed strategies, even though we will show that all message-monotone sequential equilibria will still be in
pure strategies.
   It is also worth noting that while messages are assumed to be monotone in t , receiver actions are not monotone in s~t
in the unique equilibrium of our model. This is fundamentally for the same reason as in Chen (2011): extreme messages
may be more likely to come from biased senders, and therefore are discounted. In fact, our model is quite similar to
a (special case of a) dynamic and two-sided version of Chen’s model with three kinds of senders (moderate, extreme,
and naive) rather than two (normal and naive). See also Chen, Kartik, and Sobel (2008) and Kartik, Ottaviani, and
Squintani (2007) for static and one-sided communication models with a mix of normal and naive players.


                                                               30
a moderate receiver plays a = 1 after signal s~ = 1, as this signal is informative of      = 1 by message
monotonicity, and Assumption COM implies that a moderate receiver would play a = 1 in the absence
of an informative signal. Finally, a moderate receiver plays a = 0 after signal s~ = 0. This follows
because if he played a =            1 or 1 after s~ = 0, then moderate senders would play s = 0 when   = 0,
targeting naive receivers; and this, by Assumption COM, implies that moderate receivers should play
a = 0 after s~ = 0 after all. Given this characterization of moderate receivers’ strategies, Bayes rule
and Assumption COM imply that moderate senders must play as speci…ed in the proposition.
       Intuitively, Proposition 11 shows that, in the unique message-monotone equilibrium, moderates
start by moderating their “own-extreme” signals. In particular, left-wing senders will misreport a
signal of      1 (and right-wingers will misreport 1) as 0 so as to separate themselves from the extremists
on their side. Moderating one’s own-extreme signal in this way is analogous to playing the good action
in the baseline model in that it leads to Pareto-improving communication when the other group is
moderate, but is not a best response when the other group is thought to consist of extremists. Then
signals other than the sender’s own-extreme signal are interpreted as good signals, and a moderate
player who receives a good signal plays action equal to the signal, and then moderates her own signal
next period. But this also implies that an extreme signal is evidence that the sender is an extremist,
and a moderate from the other side who receives such a signal takes the opposite action and does not
moderate her own signal in the next period (i.e., she sends her own-extreme signal if she thinks this is
the state, in an e¤ort to persuade naive receivers). This then starts a spiral analogous to the spirals
we have seen in the baseline and trade models. Nevertheless, there are also important di¤erences
from the baseline model. First, here the reason why moderates refrain from sending extreme messages
is precisely because they would like to distinguish themselves from extremists— thus the presence of
extremists a¤ects the form of communication between moderates even outside the cycle of distrust.
Second, and perhaps more importantly, there are no longer any deterministic restarts of trust here.
This is because the stochastic restarts of trust are frequent enough, ensuring that an own-extreme
signal is always a strong indication that the sender is extremist.33
  33
       A similar e¤ect arises in Sections 3.2 and 3.3.

where the second equality follows by state rearrangement, and the third one simply from canceling the
terms that go to zero and nothing that (T                              1) =T ! 1 as T ! 1. The …rst part of the proposition

where the …nal equality uses                    0;n   ! 0.
Proof of Lemma 1.                 Suppose that normal players choose yt = 1 if and only if y~t                                                                              1       = 1 or player
t   1 is crazy. Now if both groups are normal, then non-crazy player t plays yt = 0 if and only if the
most recent “misperception” (i.e., time t0 such that yt0 = 1 but y~t0 = 0) came after the most recent
arrival of a crazy player. Then denote the probability of this happening in period t by                                                                                              t.   Then one
can check that
                                      tX
                                                                                                     !
                                       0 1
                                                          t                                     t
                        t0   =                  (1        )           1       (1            )            + (1                           )t0 1          (1          )t0 ,
                                      t=0

where the …rm term sums over times at which the most recent arrival of a crazy player could have
occurred, and the second term accounts for the possibility that there might not have been any crazy
players by time t0 . Summing the geometric series yields

                                                          (1   )
                                            t   =                                           1            (1                 )t (1                   )t .                                       (3)
                                                          + (1   )

    Now, by Bayes rule,
                                                                                                    0
                                                                      t   =                                                 .
                                                                               0   + (1                      0)         t
Note that     t   is decreasing in t because                          t   is increasing in t. Moreover, from (3),

                                                                               0(          + (1                   ) )
                                                                  1       =                                           .
                                                                                   0       + (1                   )

Therefore,    1    <   CRAZY          if and only if

                                                                                       (    CRAZY                               0)
                                          <                                                                                                                ,
                                                                      CRAZY                     0       +       0       1                  CRAZY

which is a positive number under Assumption 20 .
Proof of Proposition 6. Since player t + 1 plays xt+1 = 1 if and only if he is normal and y~t = 1, it
follows that (normal) player t plays yt = 1 if and only if his belief that the other group is bad is below
                                                                                                    0+   (1                     0 )t

                                                                                           33
t < T2   SIDED         (with the convention that T2                          SIDED         = 1 if                 1          ), by de…nition of T2           SIDED ,    so
player t plays yt = 0 after seeing y~t                        1       = 1, for all t < T2                    SIDED .         That player t plays yt = 0 after
seeing y~t   1   = 1 for all t 6= 0 mod T2                    SIDED          can now be established by induction, as in the baseline
model.
Proof of Proposition 7.                         Suppose not. Then there exists a time T such that at all times t                                                        T
normal player t plays yt = 0 after observing all bad signals. Suppose that both groups are normal,
and observe that the probability that player T + K observes all bad signals is at least                                                                     K.     In this
event, all subsequent players play yt = 0 and thus observe all bad signals. In the alternative event
that player T + K observes at least one good signal, the probability that player T + 2K observes all
bad signals is still at least               K.     Hence, the overall probability that player T + 2K observes all bad
signals is at least 1             1        K 2.   Now it is easy to see by induction on m that player T + mK observes
all bad signals with probability at least 1                                  1            K m.      Hence, normal player T + mK’s belief that
the other group is bad when she observes all bad signals is at most

                                                                                                0

                                                                                                                               .
                                                                        0 + (1             0) 1          (1

This belief converges to              0    as m ! 1, so it follows from Assumption 2 that ~ T +M K <                                                              for some
integer M . Therefore, normal player T + M K would deviate to playing yT +M K = 1 after observing
all bad signals, which yields a contradiction and establishes the desired result.
    Before presenting the proof of Proposition 8, we state and prove the following lemma:

Lemma 2 In the political partisanship model, let                                           t   be moderate player t’s assessment of the prob-
ability that the opposing group is extremist, conditional on player t                                                          1 failing to communicate and
player t’s group holding power in period t. Then limt!1                                                  t   =        0,   and lim   !0   1   = 1.

Proof. We work up to computing                                    t    by …rst computing three other probabilities, which will be
denoted by        t,       t,   and   t.   Let       t   be the probability that whichever group is in power today is also
in power t periods from now, when the probability that power switches each period is . Note that
this event is equivalent to power switching an even number of times out of t chances. Thus, it is
straightforward to check that

In addition, it can easily be shown that if                                  =   2   (contrary to our assumptions) then                              t   = 12 .
    Next, let          t   be the probability that the left-wing group (say) is in power in period t and does
not observe communication, conditional on the event that the left-wing group is moderate and the

This expression requires some explanation. The …rst term corresponds to the event that the left-wing
group is in power in period 0. This event is then divided into the events that the …rst time m at
which a player sets sm = 0 is m = 1; : : : ; t. Conditional on the left-wing group holding power in
period 0, the probability that m = t, the left-wing group holds power in period t, and player t                                                                              1 does

group holding power in period 0, the probability that the …rst time at which a player sets s = 0 is
m, the left-wing group holds power in period t, and player t                                                        1 does not successfully communicate

power and setting s = 1, there is                     probability 21 that              the (extremist) right-wing group takes power, and

possibility that the right-wing group is in power in period 0.
     Finally, let    t       be the probability that the left-wing group is in power in period t and does not
observe communication, conditional on the event that the left-wing group is moderate and the right-
wing group is moderate. By Bayes rule,

This formula is similar but somewhat simpler than the formula for                                                             t.       The …rst term corresponds to
the event that there are t                1 successful communications. For each term in the sum, the probability
that the …rst time at which a player sets s = 0 is m, the left-wing group holds power in period t, and
player t   1 does not successfully communicate is (1                                            )m      1       1

periods of successful communication and a single failed communication, the posterior probability that
either group holds power is 12 , and both groups subsequently set s = 0 (so subsequent power switches
occur with probability ).
     The assessment of moderate player t of the probability that the opposing group is extremist,
conditional on player t 1 not successfully communicating (and conditional on player t’s group holding
power in period t) is now simply

                                                                    0 t                                         0

Now note that limt!1                      t           =       2,    so the sum in the formula for                                                             t     converges to

Proof of Proposition 8. Fix a time t < TP OL , where TP OL is to be computed. We …rst derive the
turnout decisions of the supporters of the incumbent party. When they see communication about ,
they infer that their own party is moderate, so their net bene…t from turning out is

                                                             1
                                                                                  (1 + ) ,
                                                             2

where the …rst term is the change in probability of the same party keeping power because of the
greater turnout, the second term, , is the belief after receiving informative communication that the
other side is an extremist, and the last term is the net gain from having their own party rather than
an extremist opposing party in power, taking into account that moderates on both sides will choose
the right policy on the major issue. Under the hypothesized behavior of politicians,                                        is determined
by Bayes rule and satis…es                     0.   Intuitively, this is because both the information that the period t
base’s party is in power and the information that the period t leader successfully communicates suggest
that the opposing party is more likely to be moderate. To see this formally, note that if the opposing
party is extremist, then the only way that the period t base’s party holds power in period t and the
period t leader successfully communicates is if the period t base’s party holds power and successfully
                                                                                                       1 t+1
communicates in periods 0; : : : ; t, which occurs with probability                                    2     (1   )t+1 . In addition, if the
opposing party is moderate, then the only way that the period t base’s party holds power in period t
and the period t leader successfully communicates is if there is successfully communication in periods
0; : : : ; t (which occurs with probability (1                   )t+1 ), and the period t base’s party holds power in period
t (which, conditional on the opposing party being moderate and there being successful communication
in periods 0; : : : ; t, occurs with probability 21 ). Thus,

                                                             1 t+1

Finally, the fact that             0   combined with the assumption that c >                                 2     (1 + )   0   implies that
      1
c>    2       (1 + ) , so the incumbent’s base never turns out following successful communication.
     Next consider the behavior of the incumbent’s base following propaganda. Since every politician
acts on the partisan issue following propaganda, the net bene…t from turning out in this case can be
written as
                                                                          1

                                                                          2
                                       1
The assumption that c < 2              2            now implies that the incumbent’s base always turns out following
propaganda.

                                                                             36
       We now turn to moderate politicians’ incentives. First, consider the payo¤ from playing st = 0.
Given the above assumptions, this ensures turnout but will also cause the next leader to act on that
partisan issue. When the belief that the other side is extremist is , this has payo¤

                                                               (1         ) (1)            (1 + 2 ) :

On the other hand, playing st = 1 yields payo¤

                                                                                       1               1
                  [ (1       ) (1)      (1 + 2 )] + (1                        )          ( )             ( (1 + 2 ) + (1         ) ( )) :
                                                                                       2               2

The di¤erence between these two payo¤s is given by

                                                                                             1

                                                                                             2

which is positive for
                                                         + 2 (1     )             4
                                                           <     P OL ,   =

and negative for          above this threshold. Thus, moderate politicians attempt communication if and
only if      <    P OL   (which is always a positive number).
       In contrast, the payo¤ to an extremist incumbent from setting st = 0 equals

                                                               (1         )( )              ( + 2) ,

while the payo¤ to an extremist incumbent from setting st = 1 equals

The di¤erence between these payo¤s equals

                                                                       1                      1

which is positive for
                                                                          4        (1          )
                                                                      <                            .
                                                                                  1+

However, the assumption that                  <        4       implies that                 1+             < 0. Thus, extremist politicians never
attempt communication.
       Now to compute TP OL , note that Lemma 2 and the assumption that                                                0   <   P OL   imply that there
exists a smallest integer t such that                  t            P OL .    Denoting this integer by TP OL and following the same
argument as in the baseline model now implies that the conjectured strategy pro…le (and beliefs) is a
sequential equilibrium, with cycle length TP OL .34
  34
       In addition, the fact that lim   !0    1   = 1 implies that T > 1 when                          is su¢ ciently small.



                                                                                  37
    Finally, this sequential equilibrium is unique— up to indi¤erence at non-generic parameter values—
by the same argument as in the baseline model, with the addition that the beliefs and strategies of
the base are also uniquely determined by induction on t. In particular, the t = 0 base does not turn
out after observing communication (as its assessment that the opposing party is extreme must be                                       0,
regardless of whether or not it observes communication, in any sequential equilibrium), and the t = 0
base does turn out after observing propaganda (regardless of its assessment that the opposing party
is extreme). The rest of the induction argument proceeds exactly as in the baseline model (or as in
the proof of Proposition 10, where more details are provided).
Proof of Proposition 9. Suppose that t < T~, where T~ is the cycle length when both bases can
turn out, which remains to be computed. When the out-of-power base turns out, it increases the
                                                                                        1
probability that its party holds power in period t + 1 by                               2          (note that this is true even if the
in-power base also turns out, as in that case turning out increases the probability of a power switch
from G ( k) =      to 21 ). If player t successfully communicated and both parties are moderate, then the
bene…t to the out-of-power base of having its own party in power in period t + 1 (compared to having
the other party in power) is 0. If player t successfully communicated and only the opposing party
is moderate, then this bene…t is           1+            (so that in this case the out-of-power base would rather its
party lose the election). If player t did not successfully communicate, then the bene…t is 2 . Finally,
the event that player t successfully communicated and only the out-of-power party is moderate occurs
with probability 0. We now claim that the net bene…t to the out-of-power period t base of turning
out (for t < T~) is
                                "                   2                                              1 t

          N Bt =                                                2                                      1 t                      .

To see this, note that the probability that player t successfully communicated and both parties are

and, since the probability that player t successfully communicated and only the out-of-power
base’s party is moderate is 0, the probability that player t did not successfully communicate is
             2                                 1 t

    Note that N Bt is increasing in t, and that limt!1 N Bt = 21     (2 ). Hence, the assumption
that c < 2 1                                           ^
                 (2 ) implies that there is some time T such that the out-of-power base turns out
if and only if T < T~ and t
               ^                T^ mod T~. Now observe that if T^   TP OL (de…ned in the proof of
Proposition 8), then    is as in Proposition 8, which implies that T~ = TP OL and the out-of-power base
                          t
never turns out. If instead T^ < TP OL then the computation of t in the proof of Proposition 8 must
be modi…ed to take into account that the probability of a power switch changes deterministically at
time T^ (from 1 to 1
              2         if the in-power base does not turn out, and from to 1 if the in-power base              2
does turn out). Without explicitly calculating T~ in this case, it is easy to see that if T^ < TP OL then

                                                                      38
also T^ < T~, as if T^ T~ then the formula for T~ would be the same as for T , contradicting T^ < TP OL .
Thus, if T^ < TP OL , then there is a deterministic time T~ > T^ such that partisan phases always begin
with probability and end deterministically at times t = 0 mod T~, the in-power base turns out only
during partisan phases, and the out-of-power base turns out for the last T~                                              T^ periods of every T~
period cycle (regardless of whether the partisan phase has begun or not).
Proof of Proposition 10. First, note that in any trembling-hand perfect equilibrium (henceforth,
“equilibrium”) a player (good or bad) approves trade if and only if her opponent’s fruit is good. This
follows because trade strictly increases a player’s payo¤ if her opponent’s fruit is good and strictly
decreases a player’s payo¤ if her opponent’s fruit is bad— regardless of the quality of her own fruit—
and perfection requires that a player’s approval decision is a best response to a completely mixed
strategy of her opponent’s.35
     Second, note that in any equilibrium normal player t plays xt = 1 if and only if y~t                                        1   = 1. To see
this, note that her expected payo¤ in market t when she produces a good fruit and her opponent’s
fruit is good equals
                                                                  (1      )b        c.

Her expected payo¤ in market t when she produces a bad fruit is 0. In addition, her expected payo¤ in
market t + 1 does not depend on her choice of xt , (because player t + 1’s strategy cannot depend on the
outcome of market t, and player t                         1’s trade approval decision cannot give player t any information
about the other group’s type since a player’s trade approval decision is independent of her type).
Finally, Assumption 200 implies that                        T RADE     > 0, which in turn implies that (1                      )b      c > 0. So
Assumption        200   implies that normal player t plays xt = 1 if and only if y~t                        1    = 1.
     It remains only to determine when normal player t plays yt = 1. We proceed by induction on t.
Suppose that play in every equilibrium is as speci…ed by the proposition for all t0                                             t < T , t 2 N.
                            1
Then at time t +            3,   normal player t’s assessment of the probability that the other group is good is 1
if y~t   1   = 1 and is      t   if y~t   1   = 0 (and is    0   if t = 0). Then normal player t’s expected payo¤ in market
t + 1 when she produces a good fruit and her assessment is equals
                                h                       i
                        (1    ) (1     )2 b + (1     ) d + (1     )d                                        c,

while her expected payo¤ in market t + 1 when she produces a bad fruit equals 0. Hence, she produces
a good fruit if         <        T RADE       and produces a bad fruit if            >   T RADE .   Since        t   >    T RADE     by de…nition
of T , it follows that she plays yt = 1 if and only if y~t                     1   = 1. This proves that play in every equilibrium
is as speci…ed by the proposition for all t < T .
     The same argument now implies that, as speci…ed in the proposition, normal player T ’s assessment
is below        T RADE      regardless of y~T         1   (strictly so, by Assumption 300 ). This implies that she always
plays yT = 1. Repeating the argument from the previous paragraph now implies that play in every
equilibrium is as in the proposition for all t 2 fT + 1; : : : ; 2T g, and inducting on k 2 N then implies
  35
     Note that this argument relies on the presence of the transaction cost. It is the only place where the transaction
cost is used.

proof.
Proof of Proposition 11. We …rst establish the existence of an equilibrium of this form, and then
show that it is unique.
      Let    t   denote the probability that player t does not moderate her signal (i.e., sends st =                                                              t   for
all    t)   when both players are normal and follow the strategies described in the proposition; this is
the same as the probability that s~t              1   equals player t                     1’s own-extreme signal. We calculate player
t’s posterior belief about (1) the state, and (2) her opponent’s type, in terms of                                                               t,      conditional on
the received signal. For these calculations, suppose that the receiver is right-wing— the other case is
symmetric.
      Posteriors about the state are as follows:
      After signal s~ =         1:

                                                       (1         ) ( 0 + 0 + (1  0                            0)   +3  t)

                                                                         (1   ) 0+ 3

                                                                         (1   ) 0+ 3

For the prescribed strategies to be an equilibrium it is required that, for all t, the receiver plays a = 1
after s~ =      1, plays a = 0 after s~ = 0, and plays a =                                     1 after s~ = 1. The …rst and third of these
conditions are implied by Part 1 of Assumption COM (noting that after s~ =                                                                     1, playing a = 1 is less
appealing when        t   is higher, and Part 1 of Assumption COM implies that playing a = 1 is optimal
for    t   = 1). The second of these conditions is implied by Part 2 of Assumption COM (as this implies
that the condition holds for         t   = 0 and        t   = 1, and preferences are single-crossing in (a; )).

Here, we need that it is always optimal for the receiver to moderate his signal in the next period (i.e.,
send 0 when        = 1) after s~ =       1 and s~ = 1, but not after s~ = 0. It is easy to see that when she does


                                                                            41
so following s~ =              1, she will also do it a fortiori following s~ = 1. Now it is optimal for a sender with
beliefs        t   and   t    to moderate her signal if and only if

                         (1      t ) uL (1;   1) +     t uL (   1; 1) < (1         t ) uL (0;    1) +    t uL (1;        1) ,

or
                                                       uL ( 1; 1) uL (1; 1)
                                              t   +                                         t   < 1.
                                                        uL (0; 1) uL (1; 1)
So we need to show that, for any                  t   2 [0; 1], this inequality holds whenever            t   and    t   result from signal
s~ = 0, while the opposite inequality holds whenever                         t   and   t   result from signal s~ =              1.36 A bit of
algebra shows that Part 3 of Assumption COM is a su¢ cient condition for this to be the case.
          The existence of an equilibrium of the speci…ed form follows by noting that st =                                t   is optimal when
 t    is not one’s own-extreme state (and this is in fact true regardless of the receiver’s type).
          The proof of uniqueness of the message-monotone sequential equilibrium (henceforth “equilib-
rium”) proceeds in …ve steps. Let us continue to assume a right-wing receiver.
          Step 1: In any equilibrium, moderate receivers play a = 1 after signal s~ =                           1.
          Since preferences satisfy single-crossing in (a; ), it su¢ ces to check that a moderate receiver plays
a = 1 after signal s~ =                1 when moderate senders send s =                1 after     =     1 and           = 0, but not after
 = 1. This condition is exactly Part 1 of Assumption                         COM.37
          Step 2: In any equilibrium, moderate receivers play a = 1 after signal s~ = 1.
          By message-monotonicity, the posterior distribution after signal s~ = 1 is weakly higher (in the
sense of …rst-order stochastic dominance) than it would be if all senders sent signal s = 1 for all .
Part 1 of Assumption COM then implies that a moderate receiver plays a = 1 in that case, so the
claim follows from single-crossing.
          Step 3: In any equilibrium, moderate senders send s = 1 when                            = 1.
          This follows from Step 2, as sending s = 1 is then optimal against every type of receiver, and
strictly optimal against naive and moderate receivers.
          Step 4: In any equilibrium, moderate receivers play a = 0 after signal s~ = 0, and moderate senders
send s = 0 when                 = 0.
          First, suppose moderate receivers play a = 1 with probability 1 after s~ = 0. Then moderate
senders would send s = 0 when                     = 0 (as the moderate and extreme receivers would be playing a = 1
always, so moderate senders would target the naive receivers). But then Part 2 of Assumption COM
would imply that moderate receivers should play a = 0 after s~ = 0, yielding a contraction.
          Therefore, a moderate receiver must play either a =                      1 or a = 0 with positive probability after
s~ = 0. This implies that moderate senders send s = 0 when                                 = 0, as this is clearly optimal against
naive and extreme receivers, and it is also strictly optimal against moderate receivers by Part 4 of
Assumption COM. Hence, Part 2 of Assumption COM ensures that regardless of what moderate
     36
          This is actually stronger than necessary, because t does not take on all values in [0; 1].
     37
          This is in fact the reason why Part 1 of Assumption COM is a stronger condition than is needed for existence.



                                                                     42
senders do when         =       1, it is strictly optimal for moderate receivers to play a = 0 after s~ = 0. Thus
moderate receivers must play a = 0 with probability 1 after s~ = 0.
   Step 5:     In any equilibrium, moderate senders send s = 0 when                            =     1 if    t   +
 uL ( 1; 1) uL (1; 1)
  uL (0; 1) uL (1; 1)       t   < 1, and send s =     1 when    =   1 if the opposite inequality holds.
   This follows from the characterization of the moderate receiver’s strategy, single-crossing (which
implies that sending s = 0 is always preferable to sending s = 1), and the derivation of this inequality
in the existence part of the proof.
