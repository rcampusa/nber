Motivating Politicians: The Impacts of Monetary Incentives on Quality and Performance

JEL No. D72,D78,J33

                                              ABSTRACT

Recent studies have emphasized the importance of the quality of politicians for good government and
consequently economic performance. But if the quality of leadership matters, then understanding what
motivates individuals to become politicians and perform competently in office becomes a central question.
In this paper, we examine whether higher wages attract better quality politicians and improve political
performance using exogenous variation in the salaries of local legislators across Brazil’s municipal
governments. The analysis exploits discontinuities in wages across municipalities induced by a constitutional
amendment defining caps on the salary of local legislatures according to municipal population. Our
main findings show that higher wages increases political competition and improves the quality of legislators,
as measured by education, type of previous profession, and political experience in office. In addition
to this positive selection, we find that wages also affect politicians’ performance, which is consistent
with a behavioral response to a higher value of holding office.

1        Introduction

Governments that secure property rights, regulate entry less, and curb corruption are thought to

create the right incentives for economies to prosper.1 But while the virtues of good government

for economic development and growth are widely acknowledged, what determines the quality of

government is much less clear. One predominant view in the literature argues that political institu-

tions that restrict rent-seeking and promote electoral accountability shape the necessary incentives

for good policy-making. However, political institutions can only partially explain the variation in

the quality of government both across countries and over time.2 A complementary view is that

the quality of policy-making depends on the honesty and competence of the political class (Besley

(2006)). Recent empirical evidence suggests that leaders play an important role in enacting the

right policies and affecting economic performance (Besley, Persson, and Sturm 2007; Jones and

Olken 2005). But if the characteristics of policy-makers matter, then it is important to understand

what attracts high quality politicians into office and what provides them with the incentives to

perform according to voters preferences.

        Politicians have a variety of motivations for holding public office. Some derive personal sat-

isfaction from being in power or experience an intrinsic benefit based on a sense of civic duty;

others desire to implement their preferred policies because of ideology or to satisfy special interest

groups.3 For many, however, monetary rewards are the principal motivation. A growing theoretical

literature has shown that increases in monetary incentives affect both the types of politicians that

run for office as well as their performance. Yet, in contrast to the standard efficiency wage model,

which justifies higher levels of compensation as a way to align incentives and encourage positive

     In their account of the success story of Botswana, Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (2003) conjecture that good
institutions played an important role in Botswana’s performance. Nevertheless, they also attribute a key role to “a
number of important and farsighted decisions by the post-independence political leaders, in particular Seretse Khama
and Quett Masire”.
   3
     Alesina (1988), Calvert (1985), and Witman (1977) provide examples of models where politicians are motivated
by the desire to influence policy. The question of whether intrinsic motivations affect political behavior has received
a lot of recent attention. For instance Besley and Ghatak (2005) develop a model where incentives depend on the
extent to which agents agree with the cause. Callander (2007) use a game-theoretical model of electoral competition
to distinguish between office-motivated politicians versus policy-motivated politicians. Dal Bó, Dal Bó, and Di Tella
(2006) provide a model where legal institutions and violence affect incentives of individuals to enter public office.
Besley (2006) and Persson and Tabellini (2000) provide excellent discussions of these various models of political
motivations.

selection into firms, the benefits of increasing monetary rewards are not as clear in a political set-

ting where monitoring and accountability may be weak. For instance, using a citizen-candidate

model, Caselli and Morelli (2004) show that the competence of the elected body is increasing in the

political rewards from office. An opposite prediction emerges from the model of Matozzi and Merlo

(2008) where an increase in the salary a politician receives while in office decreases the average

quality of individuals who become politicians. Thus, the question is ultimately an empirical one.

    In this paper, we use exogenous variation in the salaries of local politicians across Brazil’s

municipal governments to study the effects of wages on political selection and performance. In

particular, we examine whether salaries affect who enters politics, the characteristics of elected

politicians, and their legislative performance. We overcome two existing obstacles to identify these

effects. First, previous studies have had to limit their analysis to elected politicians, which is a

selected group with unobserved skills (e.g. ability, valence) that may not only affect their probability

of winning but also their performance while in office.4 We gather data on all candidates that ran for

legislative office, and thus we are able to estimate the effects of wages on the number of candidates

and their characteristics. Second, and more importantly, wages are not set randomly, but often

by the politicians themselves, which introduces several identification concerns. Politicians that

perform better may be able to demand higher wages (Di Tella and Fisman 2004). We address

this identification issue by exploiting a quasi-experimental source of variation in local legislators’

salaries. A 2000 constitutional amendment introduced a cap on the maximum salary that could be

paid to local legislators. This cap, which varies according to the municipality’s population, induces

discontinuities in wages across municipalities. We use these discontinuities to estimate the causal

effects of salaries on political selection and performance using a two-stage least squares estimator

motivated by the fuzzy regression-discontinuity design (Campbell 1969; Van Der Klaauw 2002).

    Our findings indicate that increases in the salary of legislators not only attract more individuals

to run for political office, but also attracts more educated ones. A one standard deviation increase

in wages increases political competition by 0.7 candidates per seat and the share of candidates with

a high school degree by 7.4 percent. We also find that higher salaries attract more candidates from
  4
    Existing studies do not have information on political candidates, only on those elected for office. See for example
Besley (2004) and Diermeier, Keane, and Merlo (2005).



                                                          2
white-collar professions (i.e. more businessmen and lawyers compared to farmers and policemen).

Moreover, these effects are not limited to the pool of candidates. In municipalities that offer higher

salaries, politicians have higher reelection rates, particularly those that are more educated. Thus,

legislative bodies that pay higher wages have more educated and experienced legislators.

   In addition to these effects on political selection, we also find that salaries affect politicians’

performance. Legislators can influence local policy-making by submitting bills (formal requests

for project that are then passed into laws) and petitions (requests for targeted public works). We

find that higher wages increase both the number of bills submitted by the legislators and those

approved. But, our findings show mixed evidence with respect to public goods provision. While

higher salaries increase the number of health clinics and schools, and improve school infrastructure,

we find no effects on households’ access to water and sanitation.

   While these effects on legislative performance are consistent with a political agency model

where changes in the value of holding office affect political behavior, it is difficult to separate it

from a selection effect. We do however provide suggestive evidence that the increase in legislative

productivity is not entirely driven by the positive selection of politicians. Instead, our results

suggest that legislators do put forth effort in policy-making due to an increase in the future value

of holding office.

   In this paper, we present the first empirical evidence that exploits exogenous variation in politi-

cians’ wage to identify its effects on political selection and performance. Existing studies have

simulated the effects of politician wages using structural models. Diermeier, Keane, and Merlo

(2005) estimate a dynamic model of career decisions of U.S. congressmen to quantify the returns

to a career in congress. They show that a 20 percent increase in the wages of House members in-

creases the likelihood of running for re-election from 91.2 percent to 94.2 percent. Using the same

framework, Keane and Merlo (2007) examines the effects of a 20 percent reduction in salaries. This

policy simulation leads to not only a 14 percent reduction in the average duration of congressional

careers, but also induces skilled politicians to exit disproportionately more. These findings are con-

sistent with our results that higher wages decrease turnover and increase the education level of the

legislature. Our paper complements these empirical studies in several ways. It examines the effects



                                                  3
of wages, not only political selection, but also on candidate entry. With data only on members

of Congress, these previous studies cannot evaluate the effects of wages on the composition of the

pool of candidates. Moreover, our study also focuses on legislative productivity and the provision

of public goods.

        Our results lend further empirical support for the citizen-candidate models of Besley and Coate

(1997) and Osborne and Slivinski (1996), which highlight the importance of politicians’ identity

for policy choices.5 Our results are thus consistent with Besley, Pande, and Rao (2005), who use

data from Indian villages and show that education increases the chances of selection to public

office and reduces politicians’ opportunism. Our paper is also related to a large body of work in

political agency models that focus on the role of electoral accountability in disciplining incumbent

politicians.6 Our findings suggest that increases in wages are likely to make incumbent politicians

more accountable because it makes the value of holding office in the future higher. Politicians

respond by increasing their legislative effort in order to boost their chances of re-election.

        The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a theoretical framework that will

help the interpretation of our empirical findings. Section 3 provides the institutional background

and describes the data used for the analysis. Section 4 presents the empirical strategy, followed by

the results shown in section 5 and the conclusions in section 6.



2        Theoretical Framework

In this section, we summarize the existing theoretical literature that builds on the citizen-candidate

model to analyze the effects of monetary incentives on the average quality of politicians. Moreover,

because the citizen-candidate model focuses only on political entry, we summarize the use of po-

litical agency model to analyze how wages might affect the behavior of incumbent politicians. To

complement this discussion, we present, in Appendix A, a simple model that generates predictions

on how changes in politicians’ salaries affect both selection and behavior.

      See Barro (1970) and Ferejohn (1986) for original work focusing exclusively on hidden actions. More recently,

is provided by Besley and Case (1995) and Ferraz and Finan (2007).

2.1      Wages, Political Behavior and Selection

The basic theoretical framework used to study the decision to enter politics is the citizen-candidate

model [Besley and Coate (1997); Osborne and Slivinski (1996)]. In this class of models, citizens’

decide whether or not to run for public office in an environment where running for office is costly and

candidates cannot fully commit to policy implementation. Without full commitment, candidate

heterogeneity in preferences ultimately determines the policy that is then implemented. Caselli

and Morelli (2004) adopt this framework to investigate how wages affect the quality of candidates

that run for office. They present a model with high and low ability individuals, where high ability

individuals have better policymaking skills and are also more productive in the private sector.

Voters, however, do not observe the quality of the candidates, but do receive a signal from each

candidate. In equilibrium, voters will only select high-signal candidates. Thus, as the monetary

returns from office decrease, high quality individuals are less likely to run and the proportion of low

quality-high signal candidates increases.7 In a related paper, Messner and Polborn (2004) also using

a citizen-candidate framework provide a different comparative static result. The expected quality

of candidates may decrease as the benefits of holding office increase. With higher wages, more

individuals enter politics thus increasing the incentive for more-competent candidates to free-ride

on the other candidates and thus not run for office.

       A different result is obtained by Matozzi and Merlo (2008) using a dynamic equilibrium over-

lapping generations model. In their model, an increase in the salary of politicians induces two

effects: an entry effect, which affects the average quality of persons that become politicians, and

a retention effect given by the turnover in the political sector. An increase in the return to the

political profession makes it more attractive compared to private sector activities. Hence lower

quality individuals enter the political sector lowering the average quality of entering politicians. In

addition, it also increases the future earnings relative to the market wage making it more desirable

for politicians to stay in office for a second-term instead of moving to the private sector.

       While these papers provide interesting insights into the effects of wages on political selection,

they do not provide any predictions on how wages will affect the behavior of politicians once in office.
   7
   The term quality is used in most of these models as the ability to provide public goods at low costs. Caselli and
Morelli (2004) emphasize that quality is mostly determined by two factors: competence and honesty.


                                                         5
Political agency models provide a useful framework to understand these additional effects. Besley

(2004) examines the effects of wages on the selection and behavior of politicians using a political

agency model where voters are unable to observe either the politician’s type or his actions.8 In

the model, there are two-types of politicians: congruent and dissonant politicians. Congruent

politicians always act in accordance with voters’ objectives, whereas dissonant politicians receive

additional rents from taking an action that is different from voter’s preferred action. But, as

Besley (2004) shows, given the possibility of re-election, as the value of holding office increases,

dissonant politicians are much more likely to refrain from rent-seeking and behave according to

voters’ preferences. Hence, this model predicts that an increase in the remuneration increases

average politician’s performance (as dissonant politician take voters’ preferred action) and, thus

also decreases turnover of incumbent politicians.



3       Institutional Background and Data

3.1     Local Governments and the Câmara de Vereadores

Brazil is one of the most decentralized countries in the world. Local governments receive large

sums of resources to provide a significant share of public services.9 The decision on how to spend

these resources is made by an elected mayor in conjunction with the local legislature – the Câmara

de Vereadores.10 These câmaras consist of a council of legislators elected from an open list, pro-

portional representation system every four years. Its size varies from 9-55 members depending on

the municipality’s population. According to Brazil’s constitution, the legislature is responsible for

enacting laws and monitoring the executive for its use of public resources. Specifically, legislators

are in charge of proposing bills consisting of programs and budgetary projects that would become

laws, creating commissions designed to discuss local problems, and encouraging public hearings to
    8
     See Banks and Sundaram (1993) for an early agency model with both adverse selection and moral hazard.
    9
     Differently from local governments in other countries, Brazil’s municipalities are responsible for providing edu-
cation, health care, transportation, and local infrastructure. The 5,560 Brazilian municipalities receive on average
$35 billion per year from the federal government, which represents approximately 15 percent of federal government’s
revenue.
  10
     Brazil’s Câmaras de Vereadores, date back to the 1800s. They were established by the Portuguese crown in the
major Vilas and were in charge of all local decision-making including administrative, police, and judiciary acts. See
Leal (1975) for details on its historical evolution.

learn about the needs of the community.

    Legislators can influence local spending and the quality of public policy in three ways. First,

legislators must approve the municipal budget. The legislature receives a detailed budget proposal

from the mayor with spending items on all programs and public work projects. The legislature (or

a specific finance commission) analyzes the budget proposal and then returns it to the mayor with

or without line-items vetoes.11 While mayors are not obligated to spend on all of the approved

items, the budget, as approved by legislators, limits the amount that can be spent on each item.12

    Local legislators influence local policy-making mainly by submitting bills (projetos de lei) and

petitions (indicações). Bills consist of formal projects that are submitted for consideration to the

legislature in order to become municipal laws. They can be submitted by individual legislators,

a legislative committee, or the mayor himself. While most bills submitted by mayors focus on

obtaining funds for extra spending and the hiring of public employees, bills formulated by legislators

focus on the adoption of new programs or the creation of local councils to monitor the executive

for its implementation of social programs. Some examples will help to illustrate the use of these

bills. In the municipality of Brumado, in Bahia, the legislator Gilberto Dias Lima, elected in

2004, proposed two bills that directly affect the quality of education and health provided. The

first project established direct elections for municipal school directors and a second project obliges

municipal health clinics to test newborns for hearing difficulties. Bills are also used to establish new

social programs. Rosinere França Abbud, a legislator from Juiz de Fora, Minas Gerais, presented

a bill aimed at creating an emergency unemployment program. In Santa Cruz do Capibaribe,

Pernambuco, legislator Rui José Medeiros Silva proposed a bill to create a municipal council of

economic and social development.

    Petitions, on the other hand, consist of explicit requests made by legislators to the mayor, for

geographically-targeted public works and services. Most petitions consist of infrastructure projects

such as road building, construction of health clinics and schools. But it is also common to see
  11
     See Pereira and Mueller (2002) for an analysis of the budget process and the executive-legislative relations in
Brazil.
  12
     Differently from the federal congress, however, amendments play a small role in the bargaining process between
the local executive and legislative (Melo 2005). See Ames (1995) for a detailed description on the use of Emendas
Parlamentares in Brazil.




                                                         7
legislators request such items as additional doctors in local clinics or teachers and computers for

schools. For instance, in the municipality of São Manuel, São Paulo, a legislator sent a petition to

the mayor to build a primary school in the neighborhood of Conquista e Bela Vista. In Itabela,

Bahia, the legislator Genilda Farias requested resources to train primary school teachers, while

another legislator, Agnaldo Santos, proposed the hiring of doctors to attend the growing number of

patients in the Itabela health center. In the municipality of Taquari, Rio Grande do Sul, petition

no.140/06, from legislator Celso Göethel, asked for the acquisition of computers for the municipal

school “Sóror Joana Angélica”, located in Passo do Juncal. In addition to submitting bills and

public work requests, local legislators are also in charge of monitoring the executive for its use of

public resources. The quality of legislators (competence and honesty) is likely to affect whether

they overlook corruption, irregular public hires, and irregularities in the public administration.13

      Differently from mayors who face a two term limit, legislators can get reelected indefinitely.

Hence, politicians that desire a career in local politics have strong incentives to perform according

to voters expectations. Moreover, for some politicians, the local legislature is just a first step

towards a higher level political position. A large number of mayors, governors and congressmen

started their careers as local legislators. For all these reasons, increases in legislators salaries are

likely to induce vereadores to put more effort into signaling high productivity to voters in order to

get reelected or build a future career.

      We measure this effort by examining the number of bills submitted and approved by legislators

and the variation in public services using data for the number of schools, health clinics, doctors, and

water and sanitation connections. In order to illustrate how legislators inform voters about the bills

and petitions (indicações) they have submitted, we present in Appendix C three examples extracted

from the personal web sites of legislators. Each example includes the name of the legislator, the

municipality they got elected for, and the internet address of the web site that provides information

on their accomplishments.

      In the first example, legislator Ana Selma, from Cabo de Santo Agostinho, Pernambuco, de-

scribes her visit to the city of Garapu, where she informed its citizens about her petitions to benefit
 13
      See Lopez (2004) for a detailed case study of the executive-legislative relation at the municipal level.




                                                            8
the region. She requested the construction of a primary school, a health clinic for the Health

Family Program and the intensification of police escorts to control crime. In the second example,

legislator Romério, from Resende in the state of Rio de Janeiro, highlights his petitions for educa-

tional improvements. His website claims the acquisition of magazines and newspapers for school

libraries, and the construction of computer and science labs in the local schools. The third example

illustrated by José Damaso, from Palmas, informs his constituents about his requests for the con-

struction of new classrooms in the municipal school of Tiago Barbosa, as well as the construction

of a local police station in the community of Taquari.14


3.2    Constitutional Rules and the Salary of Legislators

The salary of federal deputies, as determined by Brazil’s constitution, serves as the basis for the

wages of all other legislators. State legislators are free to set their own salary subject to a maximum

of 75 percent of what federal deputies earn and until 2000 local legislators were subject to a

maximum salary of 75 percent of state deputies’ earnings. In February of 2000, a constitutional

amendment was established to further limit the maximum salary of local legislators. It defined caps

on the salary of legislators and the share of revenues that could be spent on the local legislature as

a function of municipal population. Because wages can only be set by legislators for the subsequent

administration, these new caps did not have an immediate effect on salaries during the 2001-2004

legislature.15 Even though wages are set in the previous legislature , as it will become clear in

the empirical strategy section, this does not affect our research design. Our identification strategy,

which is an intention-to-treat design, exploits cross-sectional variation and the discontinuous jumps

created by the amendment. This does not suggest, however, that the law did not affect selection

into the 2000 election or politicians’ performance during the 2001-2004 term. It is possible that

among municipalities that were able to offer a higher future wage, incumbent politicians increased

effort in order to get re-elected. We test for this in Section 5.

    Table 1 summarizes the main features of this law. There are 5 population thresholds defining the
  14
     These three examples are just a sample of many web pages and blogs used to disseminate the information about
the actions being taken by legislators. In effect, several legislators list the bills and petitions submitted on their web
pages or blogs as a way to signal productivity to voters.
  15
     Except for a small subset of municipalities that had to reduce wages to comply with the law.


                                                            9
maximum salary of legislators. In smaller municipalities, up to 10,000 inhabitants, local legislators

can get as much as 20 percent of the state deputy salary. This share increases to 30 percent in

municipalities with a population between 10,000 and 50,000 residents. For larger municipalities,

those above 500,000 inhabitants, the maximum value is set at 75 percent of state deputy salaries.

Column 3 displays the maximum allowed wages estimated for 2004/2005, given that federal deputies

had a salary of R$12,847.2 and state deputies had a salary capped at R$9,635.4.16 For municipalities

with less than 10,000 inhabitants, the maximum salary of a legislature can receive is R$1,927

per month versus R$7,227 per month for legislators residing in municipalities with a population

above 500,000 inhabitants. The constitutional amendment also capped the amount of legislative

spending as a percent of total revenues, but these percentages only vary for the municipalities with

a population above 100,000, which represents only 3 percent of the sample (see column 4).

       Given that salaries are determined by these population cutoffs, there are two potential concerns

that might affect our analysis. First, municipal governments may have influenced the law through

some bargaining process with the federal government or may have altered their population count.

This is extremely unlikely in the case of Brazil, where municipal governments (even larger ones) have

limited control over the constitutional amendments that are legislated. Also, we can indirectly test

for this when comparing the characteristics of municipalities near the threshold points. A second

concern relates to the existence of other policies that are determined by population cutoffs. As

we discuss in detail in the robustness section, these population cutoffs do not determine any other

policies and our results are robust to accounting for policies that are affected by other population

thresholds.


3.3      Data and Descriptive Statistics

The main data source used in this study comes from a new Census of Brazil’s Municipal Legislatures.

It was collected in 2005 by the Interlegis, a sub-secretary of the Brazilian Senate, for approximately

5,000 municipalities. Roughly, 260 surveyors collected data on physical facilities (e.g. building

ownership, existence of telephone lines, and access to the internet); institutional characteristics
  16
    There is almost no variation in the salaries of state deputies across Brazil. Most of the variation comes from the
perks from office.


                                                         10
(e.g. administrative structure, existence of legislative commissions, wage paid to legislators); and

personal characteristics of legislators (e.g. education, gender, age, term in office). A novel feature

of this census is the availability of municipal level data on the legislators’ wages, and measures of

legislative output (number of bills submitted and approved).17

       To study the effects of wages on political entry and selection, we construct a complementary

dataset with the characteristics of legislative candidates that ran in the 2000 and 2004 elections.

Using the electronic files available from the Tribunal Superior Eleitoral (TSE), we calculate for

each municipality, the number of candidates, the proportion of female candidates, their age, their

years of schooling, occupation, campaign spending, and their political parties.

       For the purpose of the analysis, it is important to account for any differences in municipal

characteristics and to test whether these characteristics are discontinuous at the wage cutoffs. As

such, we gathered information from several additional sources.18 The Brazilian Institute of Geogra-

phy and Statistics (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatı́stica(IBGE)) 2000 population census

provides us with socio-economic characteristics such as the percentage of urban population, Gini

coefficient, income per capita and a measure of infrastructure availability (percentage of households

with electricity). In addition, we use the IBGE inter-census population estimates to obtain data

on the 2003 and 2004 municipal populations. To control for different institutional features of the

municipality, we use the 2002 and 2005 Perfil dos Municı́pios Brasileiros: Gestão Pública. This

survey characterizes various aspects of the public administration, such as budgetary and planning

procedures, the number of public employees. It also provides us with structural features such as

the existence of local radio and the presence of a judge and public prosecutors. Public finance data

was obtained from the National Treasury (Secretaria do Tesouro) through the FINBRA dataset.

It contains municipal spending by categories and revenues by sources (i.e. local taxes, intergovern-

mental transfers). The differences in legislators’ wages across municipalities might, in part, reflect

differences in living costs across regions. In order to control for this we also gathered data on

average municipal wages from the RAIS, which includes information on all workers in the public
  17
      We also have data on total compensation (wages plus perks from office such as gas for their cars and mobile
phones) but there is considerable measurement error associated with these figures. We use wages in the analysis that
follows but our results are similar if instead we use total compensation.
   18
      See the data appendix B for a detailed description of data sources.

sector and formal private sector.

    Descriptive statistics for the main variables used in the analysis are shown in Table 2. The

average size of the legislature is about 9 legislators (which is equal to the minimum size) and the

average wage for a legislator is R$1641, which is approximately 2.6 times the average wage for

workers. In a large number of municipalities, the legislature is in session for only part of the week,

on average 10 hours. During 2005, there were approximately 0.86 bills submitted per legislator

and 0.69 got approved. The legislatures are mainly composed of male legislators (approximately 87

percent) and legislators that are either in their first or second mandate (72 percent). Approximately

one third are less than 40 years old and the average years of schooling of legislators is 9.7 (median

is 10.6), which is equivalent to a high school drop-out. Elected legislators seem to be slightly

more educated than the average candidate (9.08 years of schooling) and a smaller proportion of

woman get elected (women are, on average, 20 percent of candidates). There are, on average, 6.1

candidates per seat, but this number drops to 3.6 for the first quartile of municipalities. As for

municipalities in Brazil, they are, on average, small (23,000 inhabitants), largely urban (61% of

urban population), highly unequal (average Gini coefficient of 0.56), and approximately a quarter

of the population is illiterate.



4    Empirical Strategy

Our analysis estimates the effects of wages on politician selection and performance. To identify these

effects, we exploit exogenous variation in local legislators’ salaries induced by federally-mandated

salary caps. We begin this section by discussing the identification concerns associated with using

OLS estimation. We then present the econometric models we use to estimate these wage effects

and the assumptions needed for a causal interpretation of the parameters of interest.

    Consider the following cross-sectional relationship between wages and politicians’ characteristics

or performance:


                                        yi = β0 + β1 log(wi ) + x0i δ + εi                        (1)

                                   log(wi ) = α + x0i θ + νi


                                                     12
where yi is the average characteristic or performance indicator of politicians in municipality i (e.g.

average years of schooling or the average number of projects approved by the legislative council),

wi is the wage that members of the local legislature receive, xi is a vector of observed municipal

characteristics, and εi and νi are unobserved determinants of politician performance (or selection)

and wages, respectively. Under the assumption that E[εi νi ] = 0, the least squares estimator of β1

will be a consistent estimate of the causal effect of wages on politician performance (or selection).

       Unfortunately, there are several potential omitted factors in equation 1 that covary with both

wages and politician performance. Municipalities that offer higher wages presumably attract more

able politicians who are also more educated and more productive in submitting bills to the leg-

islature. Moreover, the correlation between wages and politician performance might capture the

fact that high performance politicians might be able to set themselves a higher wage (Di Tella and

Fisman (2004)).

       To overcome these identification concerns, we exploit the exogenous variation in legislators’

wages induced by salary caps. As we discussed in Section 3, the federal government stipulated

five ceilings for the wage of local politicians depending on population thresholds. In municipalities

with population above the cutoffs, legislators receive, on average, higher salaries compared to those

legislators in municipalities below the cutoffs, as we show in the next section.

       Our empirical approach uses these discontinuities in the wages to identify the effects on politi-

cian selection and performance. Intuitively, if legislators’ salaries are smoothly related to other

characteristics at the population cutoffs, then we can estimate the effects of wages by comparing

outcomes of legislators in municipalities with population levels just below and above these cutoffs.

In our setting, because salaries are not entirely explained by the population cutoffs, we use a fuzzy

regression discontinuity design where indicators for population cutoffs serve as excluded instru-

ments in a Two-Stage Least Squares (TSLS) setting (Van Der Klaauw 2002).19 Formally, consider
  19
     The population cutoffs act as a cap on the maximum value that can be paid to legislators. The amount that
is effectively paid, however, depends on the resources available to the municipal government, on political bargaining
between the mayor ad legislators, and on the social pressure exerted by the population. Thus, a large number of
smaller municipalities pay salaries below the cap.

the following model:


                                     yi = β0 + β1 E[log(w)i |Pi , xi ] + f (Pi ) + x0i δ + εi                        (2)
                                                5
                                                X
                    E[log(w)i |Pi , xi ] = α0 +    αk 1{Pi > P̄k } + g(Pi ) + x0i θ
                                                      k=1


where Pi is the population of municipality i, 1{·} is an indicator function that equals one if the

municipality’s population is above the k th cutoff P̄k (i.e. 10,000 inhabitants), and the functions

f (·) and g(·) are flexible functions of population.

       In the context of equation (2), consistent estimation of β1 using the TSLS approach relies

on wages being discontinuous at the cutoffs (which is testable) and f (·) and g(·) being locally

continuous at the population cutoffs (Hahn, Todd, and Van der Klaauw 2001). If the functions f (·)

and g(·) are specified correctly, they will capture all other potential effects of population on wages

and legislators outcomes far away from the cutoffs. Then, the use cutoffs indicators as excluded

instruments will provide a consistent estimate of β1 .

       In our preferred specification, we use the five population cut-offs and estimate f (·) and g(·) as

piecewise linear splines (i.e. separate regressions on both sides of each discontinuity). We also show

that our results are robust to alternative estimation strategies. First, we relax the spline functional

form assumption and allow for a flexible polynomial on population.20 Second, we restrict the sample

to only those municipalities close to the cut-offs. Finally, we use the actual value of the salary cap

as an instrument for the salary paid to legislators. This identification strategy is related to the

trend-break models used by Angrist and Lavy (1999) and Burgess and Pande (2005).
  20
    Alternatively, the fuzzy-regression discontinuity estimator could be implemented using a non-parametric ap-
proach. A local linear regression could be used to estimate the outcome and treatment regressions. Due to the small
number of municipalities to the right of the first cut-off, we preferred to estimate a parametric specification. See Lee,
Moretti, and Butler (2004), Ferreira and Gyourko (2007), Urquiola and Verhoogen (2008) for other studies that adopt
a similar strategy to ours and Imbens and Lemieux (2008) for an overview of different alternatives for estimating the
Regression Discontinuity.

5     Empirical Results

In this section, we begin by documenting the OLS estimates of the effects of legislator’s salaries on

the measures of political selection. Next, we propose an alternative identification strategy based

on discontinuities in the wages. Using these TSLS estimates, we show that salaries affect both the

type of politicians that run for and get elected into office, as well as their behavior. These results

are robust to various specifications and are consistent with the models of Caselli and Morelli (2004)

and Besley (2004).


5.1   The Effects of Wages on Political Selection

OLS Estimates

Table 3 presents the relationship between legislators’ wages and characteristics of both the candi-

dates of the 2004 elections as well as those that were elected. The first row reports the estimated

slope coefficient on log wages from a series of OLS regressions where the dependent variables are

specified in each column. Each specification adjusts for various characteristics of the legislature

(e.g. the number of assistants per legislator and the number of hours for which the legislature

functions per week) as well as characteristics of the municipality, such as: population, income per

capita and urbanization. The regressions also control for average wages in the municipality to

capture any potential differences across municipalities in politicians’ opportunity costs.

    In column 1, we report a strong positive association between the wages legislators receive and

the number candidates per seat (a measure of political competition). The point estimate on log

wages suggests that a one standard deviation increase in wages (approximately 50 percent) is

associated with a 1.35 more candidates per seat. Higher wages may not only induce more political

competition, but also attract a different composition of candidates. Increases in the salary of

legislators are associated with more educated candidates (column 2) and a higher share of female

candidates (column 4). We do not, however, find any evidence that higher wages attract a higher

share of candidates who were employed in a white-color profession (column 3). One potential

implication of higher salaries is that candidates should be willing to pay more to gain political



                                                 15
power. In column 5, we test this by examining whether there is more campaign spending per

candidate among municipalities that offer higher wages. We find a 30 percent increase in campaign

spending when wages increase by 50 percent.

       In columns 6-9, we present the OLS estimates of the relationship between wages and the char-

acteristics of those that were elected into office in 2004. In municipalities that offer higher wages,

the legislature is on average more educated (column 6) and has a higher share of white-collar pro-

fessionals (column 7). Despite a positive effect on the share of female candidates, higher wages

are negatively correlated with the share of female legislators.21 As with the result found for all

candidates, higher wages attracts more campaign spending among elected politicians: a 50 percent

increase in wages increase campaign spending by 32.5 percent.

       Overall, the results presented in Table 3 suggest that higher remuneration is associated with

increased competition and potentially higher quality legislators (more educated and white-collar

professionals). One should, however, be cautious to interpret these results as causal. There are

several omitted factors that could confound these results, and next we address these identification

concerns.


Population Thresholds and Politicians’ Salaries

As we discussed in Section 3, the federal government stipulated a ceiling for the wage of local

politicians that depends on various population thresholds. The innovation of our empirical approach

is to use this exogenous variation in wage determination to identify the effects of wages on politician

selection and performance. The effects of the federal mandate on politicians’ wages can be seen in

the 3 panels presented in Figure 1, which plots politician wages in 2005 against the municipality’s

population in 2003.22 Each panel presents unadjusted population-cell means of wages (depicted by

the small circles) along with the fitted values of a locally weighted regression calculated within each

population segment (as denoted by the vertical lines).23 The data exhibit a sharp discontinuity
  21
     In Brazil, there is a quota for female candidates, but not for female legislators.
  22
     We use the 2003 population because the wages in 2005, the first year of the legislature, had to be set by the
previous legislature in power between 2001 and 2004. Since wage changes are usually done during the last year of
the legislature and population estimates are only available in the end of the year, legislators choosing wages in 2004
were likely to be regulated based on the 2003 population.
  23
     The average wage is computed for a 200 person bin.


                                                         16
at each of the population cut-offs and a discernable step-function at each segment. For instance,

municipalities between 50,000 and 100,000 inhabitants (i.e. the third segment) display a cluster

of wages set at around R$ 4,000 per month (approximately $2,200). In the fourth segment, the

wages appear to cluster at just below R$5,000. The figure also highlights the fact that several

municipalities do not set their politician wages to the maximum allowance.

       The general patterns presented in the figure are also borne out in the adjusted regression results.

In Table 4, column 1 presents the first-stage regression of log wages on indicators for whether

population is above the first five cutoffs along with a piecewise linear spline for population. The

coefficients on the cutoff indicators estimate the average increase in log wages at each threshold

point. For instance, the indicator for the first cutoff suggests that wages in municipalities just

above the population threshold pay politicians 21 percent more than municipalities immediately

below the cutoffs. The other cutoffs display a similar pattern to the one presented in Figure 1,

except for the second cutoff where the discontinuity is close to zero and not statistically significant.

The results remain very similar when we control for municipal characteristics in column 2.

       When we only allow for differential slopes in the first two cut-offs, where most of the data are

concentrated, the regression does not lose any explanatory power and the cutoff indicators have

more predictive power.24 Overall, the regressions fit the data well. The cut-off indicators and the

population function explain almost 70 percent of the variation in wages generating a joint F-statistic

of 29.10 on the excluded instruments.


Smoothness condition and other potential confounds

The general concern with any regression discontinuity design is the possibility that other determi-

nants of the variable of interest are also discontinuous at the various cutoff points. Although we

cannot directly test this assumption for unobserved characteristics, we can examine whether the

observable characteristic have discontinuous breaks. Figure 2 present a series of municipal char-

acteristics plotted again population. Each figure depicts population cell means of the municipal

characteristic for the first three population thresholds (which represents 96 percent of the observa-
  24
    For all of our subsequent results, we use the second specification presented in Table 4 as the first stage. Using
the third specification provides similar results that given the higher F-statistic are more precise.


                                                         17
tions) along with the fitted values of a locally weighted regression calculated with each segment.25

Consider, for example, log income per capita, which is a strong predictor of the types of candidates

that run for office. As Figure 2 depicts, income per capita is smooth across each of the three

cutoff points. We also graph the following pre-determined characteristics: average private sector

wage, total expenditure in 2000, effective number of political parties in 1996 election, assistants

per legislators and hours in session. In general, the figures show only small differences at each

threshold points. Table 5 formally tests whether the population cutoffs are significant for a larger

set of municipal and mayor characteristics. It reports a series of regressions where we fit the de-

pendent variable listed in each column to equation (2). Overall, the table confirms that there are

no significant differences at cutoff points for various characteristics of the municipality. The only

exception, among 20 characteristics, is income inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient.

    The results presented in Table 5 address another potential concern. If the legislatures that

offered higher wages also provided other non-wage job attributes or perks that directly affect the

utility of politicians, then we might be overestimating the effects of wages on performance and

selection. But as columns 13 and 14 demonstrate (and as Figure 2 depicts), there are no disconti-

nuities in the two principal non-pecuniary features of the legislature: number assistants and number

hours the legislature is open.26 Alternatively, and perhaps a more reasonable situation would be for

legislatures just below the population cap to provide perks to compensate for the lower salary (e.g.

cell phones, fuel for cars). If this was the case, then the effects of wages would be underestimated.

    As another specification test of our design, Figure 3 plots the density of population. If there

were any discontinuities in the density at the cutoff points, one might be concerned that municipal-

ities were manipulating their population statistic in order to offer a higher wage (McCrary 2008).

However, as Figure 3 depicts, the density appears continuous at the various cutoff points. More-

over, the population statistics are collected by the Brazilian Statistical Office (IBGE), which is an

independent government body.
  25
     We excluded the 4th and 5th cutoffs for presentational purposes. To include these additional observations does
not affect the results.
  26
     Each regression that has been presented has controlled for these features of the legislature.




                                                        18
Two-Stage Least Squares Estimates of Political Selection

In Table 6, we investigate whether municipalities that offer higher wages attract more individuals

into politics. For each dependent variable, we estimate specifications based on equation (2), where

f (Pi ) and g(Pi ) are assumed to be piecewise linear splines in population. The excluded instruments

are the indicator variables for the five cutoff points, and the joint test of their significance is reported

for each sample. In our base specification (odd-numbered columns) we control for the number of

assistants per legislator and number of hours that the legislature functions per week; whereas, in our

full specification we adjust for all of the controls presented in Table 3 (even-numbered columns).27

       Column 1 presents the TSLS results for the effect of wages on the number of candidates per

seat that ran for election in 2004. The estimated coefficient on log wages is 1.424 (robust standard

error = 0.597) which is approximately half the size of the OLS estimate (see Table 3), and suggests

that a 50 percent increase in wages increase political competition by 0.72 candidates per seat. In

column 2, we report our full specification and find that the point estimate is similar when additional

controls are added.

       Given the increase in political competition, a natural question to ask is whether this reflects

the entry of more political parties. We find that a 50 percent increase in wages increases the

number of political parties that participate in the elections by 0.95 per seat (columns 3 and 4).

This result is perhaps not surprising given Brazil’s open-list proportional representation system

which encourages fragmentation of parties (Myerson 1993).28 In column 5-8, we demonstrate that

candidates increase campaign spending in response to higher wages and increased competition.

Among elected candidates, a 50 percent increase in wages increases campaign spending by 18.65

percent.

       In addition to these effects on political participation, Table 7 shows that wages affect the

candidate pool and the type of elected legislators. Panel A reports the TSLS estimates for the effects

on candidate characteristics, whereas Panel B reports the effects for elected legislators. Consistent
  27
     Although our base specification controls for the number of assistants per legislator and the number of hours,
removing these controls does not affect our two-stage least squares estimate in the slightest. This is not too surprising
given that the instrument is orthogonal to these characteristics as demonstrated in the figures.
  28
     Legislators in Brazil are elected based on the d’Hondt method. As a result, members of smaller political parties
are often elected despite having fewer vote totals than losing candidates of larger political parties. See Ames (1995)
for details.


                                                           19
with the OLS estimates, we find that a 50 percent increase in wages, increases candidates’ average

years of schooling by 0.31 years (see column 1). Although this effect appears relatively small, the

average years of schooling for Brazil’s adult population in 2005 was 6.5. Moreover, when we focus

only on the share of candidates with at least a high school degree, a similar increase in wages

increases the share by 7.4 percent (column 3). Different from the OLS estimates, higher wages

not only attract individuals with more education but also more females and those from white-

collar professions. For instance, in column 5, the effects of wages on the proportion of white-collar

candidates is 0.062 (standard error=0.028), which represents a 16 percent increase from the average.

Another natural question is whether municipalities that offered higher wages attracted politicians

from other municipalities. Although not reported, we do not find any evidence that this case (point

estimate = 0.031, standard error of 0 .071).

   Although wages induce a positive selection on the pool of candidates, this does not necessarily

imply a change in the composition of elected politicians. The results do indicate that wages affect

the characteristics of the legislative body. The estimates reported in columns 1-2 suggest that a 50

percent increase in wages increase the average education of the legislature by 0.47 years of schooling

and the share of legislators with at least a high school degree by 10 percent. Columns 5-6 and 7-8

report the effects of wages on the share of legislators from a white-collar occupation and share

female legislators, respectively. The effects are large and significant for share of legislators from a

white-collar occupation, while measured with less precision for the share of female legislators.

   According political agency models, we expect a lower turnover of legislators among municipal-

ities that can offer higher salaries (Besley 2004). In Table 8 we examine how higher salaries affect

both reelection rates and the tenure of legislators. Columns 1 and 2 report the estimated slope

coefficient from a TSLS regression where the dependent variable is the proportion of legislators

that were re-elected in the 2004 elections. Using the full specification (column 2), the estimated

effect is 0.063 (standard error = 0.037). In columns 3-6, we show that the increase in re-election

rates is predominately among more educated legislators (columns 5 and 6). A 50 percent increase

in wages increased re-election rates on legislators with at least a high school education by about 30

percent. Consistent with these results, columns 7-14 provide further evidence that legislatures are



                                                  20
more experienced among municipalities that offer higher wages. For instance, the estimated effect

of log wages on average number of terms is 0.41 (see column 8) and highly significant (robust stan-

dard error = 0.151). When we consider the entire distribution, we find that higher wages increase

the share of legislator with 4-7 terms (approximately 0.09 percentage points, robust standard er-

ror=0.03), while decreasing the share of legislators with only 1 term of experience (0.038 percentage

points, robust standard error = 0.053). These results support the theoretical prediction that higher

wages decrease turnover rates of politicians and echo the empirical findings of Diermeier, Keane,

and Merlo (2005).

    In sum, exploiting discontinuities in the wages that local legislators receive, the findings indicate

that higher salaries attract a better pool of candidates and elected legislators (more educated and

a higher share of white-collar professionals).29 Given this positive selection, a natural question to

ask is whether or not wages also affect politicians’ behavior and performance. As we discussed in

the theoretical framework, there are many reasons why legislative performance might be affected.

First, as the monetary benefits from holding office increase, elected officials will exert more effort in

order to signal productivity to voters and get re-elected. Second, as we change the composition and

type of legislators that are elected, we would expect performance and effort to change. Next, we

investigate whether higher salaries affect legislative performance using indicators of bills submitted

and approved, and measures of the provision of local public goods.


5.2    The Effects of Wages on Politician Performance

Although there are several potential indicators of politician performance, it is not easy to obtain

an objective measure for local legislatures. We use the data available in the legislative census to

measure performance as the number of bills submitted and the number of bills approved by the

legislators in 2005. Although these measures do not account for the quality of the bills and projects

submitted, we would expect the number of bills to be a function of legislators’ effort.30

    Table 9 presents estimates for the effects of wages on the various measures of legislative perfor-
  29
     These characteristics may not necessarily lead to more competence in office. We do, however, believe that they
are positively correlated with public sector performance.
  30
     See for example Clinton and Lapinski (2006) for a discussion on measuring legislative accomplishment.




                                                        21
mance. The TSLS results are displayed in panel A while the OLS results are shown in panel B for

comparison. For each dependent variable, we estimate equation (2) with municipal controls and a

piecewise linear spline in population (not shown in results). The excluded instruments are again

the indicator variables for the five cutoff points.

    Column 1 of Panel A reports the estimated slope coefficient from a TSLS regression where

the dependent variable is the log of the number of bills submitted per legislator.31 In the first

specification, which adjusts for the population of the municipality, the number of assistants per

legislator, and the number of hours the legislature is in session, we find a strong positive association

suggesting that a 50 percent increase in wages increases the number of bills submitted by 25 percent.

The estimated effect is approximately 0.07 percentage points lower than the OLS estimate. In

column 2, we report our full specification and find that the point estimate is virtually unchanged

with additional controls. Even though the number of bills submitted does capture a measure of

politician’s effort, perhaps more important for society is whether these bills get approved. In

columns 3 and 4, we re-estimate the specifications reported in the first two columns but use the

log number of approved bills per legislator. We also find a significant and positive relationship

between wages and the number bills approved, with an elasticity of 0.51 (robust standard error =

0.264). Moreover, when we divide the number of bills approved by the bills submitted and compute

a share of bills approved, we find that higher wages also increase this share (see columns 5 and

6). For instance, a 50 percent increase in wages increases the share of bills approved by about 15

percentage points. This point estimate lies in contrast to the OLS estimates which suggest that

share actually decreases.

    In addition to bills, we use another measure of the organization of the legislative process –

the functioning of the committee system. Several scholars argue that in legislatures, the existence

of committees reduce the possibility of opportunistic behavior by legislators (e.g. Weingast and

Marshall 1988 suggest that committees improve ex-post enforceability). Even though most mu-

nicipalities only have one or two committees, their existence induces gains from specialization and

improvements in the quality of decision-making. In columns 7 and 8, we report the estimated
  31
     Before taking the log, we add a one to the total number of bills submitted to avoid losing the municipalities that
had zero bill in 2005. To do so, does not affect our results in the slightest.

effects of wages on an indicator for whether the legislature has a functioning legislative commis-

sion. We find that legislatures with higher wages have a higher probability of having a functioning

commission, but the effect is small (a 50 percent increase in wages increase the chances of having

a commission by 0.10 percentage points).

       In sum, the estimates presented in Table 9 suggest that wages have an important effect on

legislative productivity. Local legislatures that pay their elected officials higher wages have more

bills submitted and approved and are more likely to have functioning commissions. But whether

these legislative acts map into population welfare gains is not entirely obvious, especially given

that we are unable to distinguish the type of bills in our data. In the next section, we explore one

potential effect of legislative quality given by the provision of public services.


5.3      The Effects of Wages on Public Goods

As described in the Section 3, legislators affect policy both through formal bills as well as informal

requests (petitions). These informal requests are a common way for legislators to provide patronage

to their constituents and consist of various types of public works (as depicted in Appendix C).

Unfortunately without data on the number and type petitions, we cannot test whether wages affect

the number of petitions that legislators submit. Instead, we examine the relationship between

salaries and the provision of public goods and services that are most frequently cited in these

petitions – schools, local clinics and sanitation infrastructure.32

       Table 10 presents the relationship between wages and the provision of various public goods.

For each dependent variable, we estimate equation (2) controlling for our full set of covariates.

Columns 1-4 present the effects of wages on various educational inputs, columns 5-7 present the

effects on health inputs, and columns 8 and 9 present the effects on household access to water and

sanitation. Each of these public inputs is found in the petitions presented in Appendix C.

       Column 1 reports the effects of log wages on the number of primary and secondary schools per
  32
     If bills and petitions are viewed as substitutes then it is quite possible that higher wages may have even lowered
the number petitions. Using data for 148 legislators on the number of petitions and bills that were submitted in 2005-
2007 by legislator for a sample of 14 municipalities, we estimate a positive correlation coefficient of 0.151 (bootstrap
standard error=0.083). Unfortunately this is not based on a random sample of municipalities. We could only gather
this information for a subset of the municipalities that posted this information on the legislatures’ websites.

school-aged child in 2006. A 50 percent increase in wages increases the number of schools by 0.64

schools per 1000 children. Moreover, for municipalities that offer higher wages, there is an increase

in the school infrastructure as measured by the share of schools with a science lab (column 2) and

a computer lab (column 3).33 In columns 5-7, we also find that higher wages affect the provision of

health services. For instance, a 50 percent increase in wages increases the number of health clinics

by 0.12 per 1000 inhabitants (column 5). There is also an effect on the number of doctors per

capita (point estimate = 0.639; robust standard error=0.279), and the average number of doctor

visits (point estimate 0.521; robust standard error= 0.241). Differently from education and health

inputs, we do not find robust evidence that increases in salary lead to differential changes in the

provision of water and sanitation for households (columns 8-11).


5.4      Discussion

Behavior versus Selection of Politicians

Thus far the findings that politicians’ performances change with higher salaries are consistent with

the standard political agency models where higher salaries increase the value of holding office in

the future and induce more effort. There are however, at least two other explanations for our

results. One possible interpretation is that the results are driven exclusively by selection: higher

wages attract higher quality politicians and this induces better performance. This is the intuition

behind the Caselli and Morelli (2004) model and the original efficiency wages models (e.g. Weiss

(1980)).34 Another potential interpretation of our findings is that higher wages increases worker

morale or dedication, as discussed by Akerlof (1982).

       Although our research design does not allow us to separately identify whether higher wages in-

crease performance through effort (rather than selection), we can test whether wages still affect our

measures of performance after accounting for the changes in the composition of the legislative body.

Assuming that the observed characteristics of the politicians are correlated with their unobserved

characteristics, then this approach attributes to the observed characteristics of the legislature all
  33
     The results are similar if we use the change in the stock of public of goods from 2004-2006 as a measure of new
public goods.
  34
     Higher quality politicians may also induce positive social interactions that leads to more productivity.



                                                        24
the effects of the unobserved variables. Thus, if politician productivity is largely due to changes

in the pool of local legislators, then we would expect that accounting for these differences should

attenuate the wage effects.35

       Table 11 shows that some characteristics of the legislative body have significant power in predict-

ing legislative performance. More educated and male-dominated legislative bodies are associated

with higher performance.36 We do however find that adjusting for the observable differences has

only a minimal effect on the wage coefficient; in most cases, attenuating the effects only slightly.

Thus, if the politicians’ unobserved abilities are correlated with their measured characteristics,

selection cannot entirely explain our results.


Specification Tests

Given the differences in income inequality across the third population threshold and some of the

other slight differences in the observable characteristics that we observed in Table 5, we re-estimate

all the models presented in Tables 3-10 including a flexible-functional form for each of our control

variables (a fourth-order polynomial). The results are presented in column 1 of Table 12, where

each coefficient is the TSLS estimate of the dependent variables listed in each row on log wages.

As column 1 reports, the estimates are not only similar, but in some cases measured with more

precision.

       In Table 12, columns 2-5, we test whether our results are sensitive to the functional form as-

sumption of a linear spline. We present TSLS estimates of a model where instead of allowing for

different slopes in each side of the discontinuities, we control for a fourth degree polynomial in

population and again use the cutoffs as the excluded instruments (columns 2-4).37 This model,

unlike the linear spline where the identification is limited to the cutoff points, imposes additional

structure by assuming a constant treatment effect.38 As seen in Column 2, virtually all of the
  35
     An obvious concern with this test is that we can only capture observable differences in politician characteristics,
and controlling for these difference may not be sufficient to partial out all the effects of the unobserved variables. For
instance, higher wages may have encouraged more able politicians and if ability is not captured in the observable
differences, we are not fully accounting for the selection effect.
  36
     The negative coefficient on the share of female legislators while difficult to interpret is not unprecedented. Jeydel
and Taylor (2003) provides a discussion of these issues.

results are qualitatively similar. In general the point estimates are slightly larger and more pre-

cisely estimated. In columns 3-4, we re-estimate this model using only observations close to the

discontinuities (i.e. the set of observations that are 5 and 10 percent above and below the cutoff

points). The point estimates are consistent with the previous results, although as expected with

fewer observations, they lose precision.

   In column 5, we present estimates of an alternative TSLS model, which is based on the approach

used in Angrist and Lavy (1999) and Burgess and Pande (2005). Instead of using the cutoffs, we

estimate the model using the maximum wage that a municipality could offer as the excluded

instrument. As expected, the results are similar to those presented in column 2 and again highlight

the robustness of the results.


Tests of potential confounds

An important contribution of our paper is the use of discontinuities in the wages that local legisla-

tors’ receive to identify the effects of wages on political selection and performance. One potential

threat to our research design comes from the possibility that other forms of federal spending or

policies are discontinuous at the same cutoffs. Although we demonstrated in Table 5 that there

is no evidence that other characteristics of the municipality change discontinuously at these cutoff

points, both the size of the legislature and the amount of block grant a municipality receives vary

according to other population cut-offs.

   To account for these potential confounds, columns 6 and 7 present estimates of our model,

where we control for a 4th degree polynomial in the amount of the block grant and the size of the

legislature. In both columns, our results remain highly robust. As an alternative test, we estimate

the extent to which the block grant affects our measures of political selection and performance,

restricting the estimation sample to a set of municipalities where the maximum wage does not vary

(i.e. for municipalities between 10,000 and 50,000 inhabitants). As reported in the appendix Table

A1, the block grant does not have any effect on our dependent variables. Finally, our approach of

using only those municipalities just around the cut-offs points isolates our results from the effects

from these other discontinuities (see columns 3-4, Table 12).



                                                 26
6    Conclusions

Despite the general consensus that good governance matters for economic development, there is

much less agreement on which aspects of governance are important or how it can be improved. The

existing political economy literature has mostly focused on how incentives shape the quality of gov-

ernment. But recent studies have introduced an important role for political selection. Institutions

and policies are shaped by those holding power, so improvements in governance may require good

leaders (Besley 2006).

    In this paper, we estimate the effects of monetary rewards on political selection and legislative

performance. While there has been a growing theoretical literature that examines how monetary

rewards to politicians affect political selection (Caselli and Morelli (2004), Matozzi and Merlo

(2008)), data limitations and identification concerns have limited the empirical tests of these models.

Moreover, little is known about how monetary rewards affect politicians’ performance (Besley 2006).

    The empirical analysis exploits discontinuities in the wages of local politicians across Brazil’s

municipal governments that are based on population thresholds. We find that higher wages increases

political competition and improves the quality of legislators, as measured by education, type of

previous profession, and political experience in office. In addition to this positive selection, we

find that wages also affect politicians’ performance, which is consistent with a behavioral response

to a higher value of holding office. We are unable, however, to identify whether this increase in

performance is due to the positive selection or the incentive effects of higher wage. Future research

should focus on the complementarity of improvements in selection and the adoption of appropriate

incentives for elected politicians to improve public service provision.

    More importantly, whether these effects ultimately translate into improvements in voters’ wel-

fare remains an open question. While we find an increase in a number of visible public goods (e.g.

number of schools, computer labs, health clinics, and doctors) in municipalities that offer higher

salaries, there is no improvement on others (e.g. water and sanitation). Without a more compre-

hensive data on public goods and services and other dimensions of political quality (e.g. honesty

and competence), it is difficult to fully assess the welfare effects of increasing politicians’ salaries.

    In sum, this paper provides evidence that improving financial incentives can improve the quality


                                                   27
of government, at least in a local context, consistent with Caselli and Morelli (2004) and Besley

(2004). This can occur even in an environment where agents are intrinsically motivated (Benabou

and Tirole (2003); Besley and Ghatak (2005); Prendergast (2008)) or care about other aspects of

the position they hold.

Appendix A: Simple Model of Political Selection and Accountabil-
ity
Consider an infinite horizon economy comprised of a finite number of citizens who are heterogenous
in their ability θ. An individual’s ability is private information, but the distribution of ability across
the population, F (θ̄, σθ ), is common knowledge. Each individual has preferences over their income y
and a policy outcome g, according to a well-behaved quasi-linear utility function U (y, g) = y+H(g).
The policy outcome g is set by the elected official as:

                                               g = θ + e,

where e is the effort level put forth by the elected official. Effort is costly in terms of disutility
and measured according to the following cost function: ψ(e, θ), which is increasing in effort but
decreasing in ability.
    Each individual can run for public office, and if elected will experience the following per-period
utility while in office:
                                 U p (e, θ) = wp + H(g(e, θ)) − ψ(e, θ)

where wp is the politician’s wage. Individuals who were not elected for public office work in the
private sector and earn a wage of wm (θ) which is increasing in θ, i.e. wm (θi ) > wm (θj ) for θi > θj .
Thus their ex-ante utility in the private sector is:
                                                    Z
                               U m (θ) = wm (θ) +        H(g(e(θ), θ))dF (θ)
                                                    A

where A is set of individuals who run for office. Assuming that there is a probability π of getting
elected as a non-incumbent, in any given period an individual with ability θ will enter politics if:
                                                         Z                    
             π wp − wm (θ) + H(g(e(θ), θ)) − ψ(e(θ), θ) −   H(g(e(θ), θ))dF (θ) ≥ 0.                  (3)
                                                                 A

Note that because an individual’s opportunity cost of entering politics increases with ability, if an
individual of type θ̂ is willing to participate then every individual of ability θ ≤ θ̂ is also willing to
enter politics.
    The timing of events is as follows. In every period an incumbent runs for office knowing both
his type and the effort provided in producing public goods. In addition, a set of citizens decides to
become candidates before observing the level of public goods g. The level of public goods becomes
publicly known and an election is held where all individuals cast their votes. Candidates vote for
themselves, whereas non-candidate vote according to a voting rule r. As in Alesina and Tabellini
(2007), and Ferejohn (1986), we assume that citizens vote retrospectively and will re-elect the
incumbent if their utility exceeds a threshold Ḡ. To set this threshold, voters understand that the

                                                    33
alternative to re-electing the incumbent is to randomly select another politician from the pool of
candidates, and require that he exert an effort level that makes the individual indifferent between
seeking re-election or exiting politics. Thus, the voting rule will be as follows:
                                                
                                                1       if g ≥ g(ê, θ)
                                             r=
                                                0       otherwise

where ê is equilibrium level of effort that will leave an individual of average ability indifferent
between seeking re-election or entering the private sector.
       To examine the level of effort that incumbents exert while in office, let ē denote the amount of
effort an incumbent of type θ must exert in order to provide Ḡ. Let e∗ denote the optimal level of
effort an incumbent would exert in a single period without re-election concerns. Thus given this
reelection rule, an incumbent will exert enough effort to be re-elected if:

                   wp + H(g(ē, θ)) − ψ(ē, θ)                                    δ
                                               ≥ wp + H(g(e∗ , θ)) − ψ(e∗ , θ) +     Um                           (4)
                           1−δ                                                   1−δ

where δ is the discount rate.39 Equation 4 can be rearranged in order to express a net utility as a
function of ability, i.e. Ũ (θ):

                   Ũ (θ) = [δwp + (H(g(ē, θ)) − H(g(e∗ , θ))) − (ψ(ē, θ) − ψ(e∗ , θ))]
                           − δ [U m + H(g(e∗ , θ)) − ψ(e∗ , θ)] ≥ 0

Figure A1 illustrates the solution to the model graphically.40 It compares the value of holding
office to the value of remaining in the private sector, assuming that the politician exerts at least
the minimum level of effort required to produce Ḡ. Given that Ũ (θ) is concave in θ, we can separate
individuals into four regions, as depicted in Figure A1.41

   1. For individuals with θ ≤ A1, the effort required to get re-elected is too costly and Ũ (θ) < 0
         (see Panel A). These individuals, if elected, will simply exert effort level e∗ and enter the
         private sector in the next period (see panel B).

   2. For individuals with θ ∈ (A1, A2], the benefits of office are greater than those in the private
         sector, i.e. Ũ (θ) > 0. These politicians will exert just enough effort to set public goods equal
         to Ḡ and get re-elected. As depicted in Panel B, effort will decline with ability up to A2.

   3. For individuals with θ ∈ (A2, A3], the benefits of additional public goods will exceed the
  39
     This model assumes that once a politician leaves office, he can no longer return to politics.
  40
     The figure shows the equilibrium outcomes under the following functional form assumptions. Politician’s utility:
U p = wp + ln(θ + e) − 21 ( θe )2 . Utility in the private sector:U m = α + βθ + ln(θ∗ + e∗ ); Public Goods: g = θ + e
  41
     Ũ (θ) is concave because of the concavity of H.



                                                         34
      costs and thus will provide a level of public goods above Ḡ, (i.e. will exert effort above the
      minimum need for re-election).

   4. For individuals with θ > A3, politics is too costly to enter.

The Effects of Wages on Political Selection and Performance

As the model illustrates, the wages politicians receive play an important role in attracting can-
didates and influencing politician’s behavior while in office. In Figure A2, we show the effects of
an increase in wages on the equilibrium outcomes of this simple model. Panel A depicts how an
increase in salaries affect the decision to enter politics (Equation 3). An increase in politicians’
wages has two effects. First, the benefits of holding office increases, thus attracting more able
candidates. Second, as the quality of candidates improves, the expected level of public goods that
                                      ∂
                                         R
will be provided also increases (i.e ∂w p A
                                            H(g(ē(θ), θ))dF (θ) > 0), thus decreasing the incentives
for running for office. Panel A illustrates these two opposing effects. As wages increase from wp to
wp0 , the marginal individual who enters politics goes from A3 to A30 , thus increasing average ability
in pool of candidates.
   In panel B, we show the effects of wages on the set of elected officials that will remain in office.
As shown in Panel A, an increase in wages increases the ability of the politician that is willing to stay
in office from A3 to A30 . But as the quality of candidates improves, voters impose a higher standard
to re-elect the incumbent politician, i.e. a higher Ḡ. Consequently, a lower ability incumbent, who
under the previous wage regime was willing to stay in office, now finds it too costly to exert the
effort to get re-elected. Thus higher wages create a positive selection by inducing higher types to
get re-elected and lower types to exit.
   In panel C, we illustrate how higher wages affect effort. Individuals with ability θ ∈ [A1, A10 ]
are unwilling to provide Ḡ and thus decrease effort and exit politics. For individuals that have the
incentive to remain in politics, an increase in wages will increase their efforts, except for sufficiently
high quality politicians where effort will remain unaffected.
   In sum, this simple model of political agency predicts that higher wages will increase the quality
of both those that enter politics, as well as, those that hold office. Higher wages will, however, have
an ambiguous effect on performance. Given the results of our model and those the literature, the
question of whether wages affect political selection and performance is an empirical one, which is
the paper’s main contribution.

Appendix B: Data Sources
The data used in the paper comes from a variety of sources. The data is at the level of the
municipality, the lowest government unit below a state in Brazil. The main data source is the
legislative census collected during 2005 by the Interlegis, a branch of Brazil’s senate. Although
Brazil’s had 5,564 municipalities recorded as of 2005 by Brazil’s Statistical Office (IBGE), the
legislative census only recorded information from 5,414 municipalities. Next, we describe the source
of each variable used in the analysis.
   Legislature characteristics: Characteristics of the legislature come from the 2005 legislative
census. Next to the answers to the questions on the wages there was a question to whether the
person answering the question was sure about the wages. We restricted our analysis to answers
where the informant was sure about the wage and removed some remaining outliers that represented
less than 1 percent of the sample. The variables used in the analysis are as follows: Legislator’s
salary – monthly salary paid to local legislators, expressed in Reais; Number of legislators – the
size of the legislature in 2005; Weekly hours – the number of hours per week the legislature is open;
Assistants per legislator – the average number of assistants each legislator has; Bills submitted per
legislator – the number of bills submitted in 2005 divided by the size of the legislature; Bills approved
per legislator – the number of bills approved divided by the size of the legislature; Functioning
Commission – an indicator variable for whether the legislature has a commission that functions;
% female legislator – the number of female legislators divided by the size of the legislature; %
legislators age < 40 – share of the legislature that is less than 40 years old;% legislators age 40 − 49
– share of the legislature that is between 40 − 49 years old;% legislators age > 49 – share of the
legislature that is older than 40 years old;% legislators in 1-2 mandate – share of the legislature
with 1-2 terms of experience; % legislators in 3-7 mandate – share of the legislature with 3-7 terms
of experience; Years of schooling – the average years of schooling of legislators.
   Politician’s Characteristics: the Tribunal Superior Eleitoral (TSE) provides basic demo-
graphic information on each candidate that ran in the 2004 municipal elections. These data is
available at www.tse.gov.br. We use this information to create the following municipal level in-
dicators: Number of candidates per seat – the number of candidates that ran for local legislator
divided by the size of the legislature; Age – the average age of the candidates that ran for office in
2004; % female – the share of candidates that were female; Years of Schooling – the average years
of schooling for the candidates.
    Municipal demographic characteristics: Demographic characteristics of the municipality
come from 2000 population census, available at IBGE (www.ibge.gov.br). The estimate for the 2003
population was obtained from the IBGE inter-census population estimates. The variables used in
the analysis are: % Urban population – the number of inhabitants that live in urban areas divided
by the population; Gini coefficient – income inequality based on household income in 2000; Literacy
Rate – share of the population that is literate; % households with electricity – share of households


                                                   36
with access to electricity; Household income per capita – Total household income divided by the
number of persons residing in the household.
   Municipal institutional and public management characteristics: the 2002 and 2005
surveys of the Perfil dos Municı́pios Brasileiros: Gestão Pública provide information on various
aspects of the public administration, such as budgetary and planning procedures, the number of
public employees. It also provides us with structural features such as the existence of local radio
and the presence of a judge and public prosecutors.
   Municipal public finance information: the National Treasury (Secretaria do Tesouro)
provides information of spending and revenues through the FINBRA dataset. It contains municipal
spending by categories and revenues by sources (i.e. local taxes, intergovernmental transfers). See
www.tesouro.com.br
   Private sector wages: the RAIS provides information of public and private sector wages for
all (formal) firms in Brazil. We use this data to construct a measure of the average wage of private
sector employees in municipalities.
   School data: information on the number of primary schools (Ensino fundamental), their
characteristics (whether they have a science or computer lab), and their teacher’s characteristics is
available from Edudata (www.edudata.gov.br), based on yearly school census undertaken by INEP.
   Health data: information on the number of clinics managed by the municipal government
and the number of doctors was taken from the Cadastro Nacional de Estabelecimentos de Saúde
(CNES). The information is only available at www.datasus.gov.br for 2006. Data on the average
number of medical visits for 2004 and 2006, was obtained from the Indicadores do Pacto de Atenção
Básica 2006 and are available at www.datasus.gov.br.
   Water and Sanitation data: information on sanitation and water network extension and
connections was obtained by the Sistema Nacional de Informações sobre Saneamento (SNIS). The
information is available at www.snis.gov.br. The information is collected using a survey of sanitation
service providers in a representative sample of municipalities.

Notes: This table reports the OLS estimate of the effects of the population cutoff on log wages. The running variable x refers to
the population in 2003. All regressions control for the number of hours the legislature functions per week and assistants per
legislator from the 2005 Brazilian Legislative Census (Censo do Legislativo). Municipal Characteristics include Log household
income per capita, % urban population, Gini coefficient, % households with energy, % literate population and Log average wages
in municipality. All regressions control for log(average wage in private and public sector in municipality). * indicates statistical
significance at the 10% level, ** at the 5% level and *** at the 1% level. Robust standard errors are reported in brackets. The
reported F-test refers to the cut-off indicators.

Notes: This table present OLS estimates for the effects of the block grant cutoffs on various characteristics of political selection and performance, for municipalities with a
population of 10,000-50,000, where wages are held constant. All regressions control for the number of hours the legislature functions per week and assistants per legislator.
Municipal Characteristics include Log household income per capita, % urban population, Gini coefficient, % households with energy, % literate population and Log average wages
in municipality. All regressions control for log(average wage in private and public sector in municipality). * indicates statistical significance at the 10% level, ** at the 5% level
and *** at the 1% level. Robust standard errors are reported in brackets. The instruments used are the indicators for the cutoffs at 1{x>10,000}, 1{x>50,000}, 1{x>100,000},
1{x>300,000} and 1{x>500,000}. The reported F-test refers to cutoffs.
