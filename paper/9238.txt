       In France, public health insurance is universal but incomplete, with private payments
accounting for roughly 25 percent of all spending. As a result, most people have supplemental
private health insurance. We investigate the effects of such insurance on the utilization of physician
services using data from the 1998 Enquête Santé Protection Sociale, a nationally representative
survey of the French population. Our results indicate that insurance has a strong and significant
effect on the utilization of physician services. Individuals with supplemental coverage have
substantially more physician visits than those without. In a context where patients are free to choose
their provider, we find no evidence that adults with supplemental insurance are more likely to visit
a specialist than a general practitioner.

                                     I. INTRODUCTION

    In France, as in many other European countries, a publicly financed system provides

universal health insurance coverage, but that coverage is not complete. France’s Social Security

system covers roughly 75 percent of the overall individual health expenditures. The remaining

25 percent consists of co-payments for basic services, spending on services that are either not

covered or poorly covered by the public system and provider charges in excess of official

reimbursement amounts. In response to these gaps in the public system, 85 percent of the French

population has supplemental health insurance.


    The effects of supplemental insurance coverage on medical care utilization are of

considerable interest to health economists and policy makers, as they have significant

implications for both economic efficiency and equity. The issue of efficiency relates to how

supplemental insurance interacts with the public system. Like public financing schemes in other

countries, the French system imposes cost-sharing on patients as a strategy for controlling

utilization [1]. Because most insurance policies reimburse patients for their out-of-pocket

payments, supplemental insurance is likely to render ineffective the desired incentive effect,

raising both total and public sector health spending, and reducing economic welfare.


    The utilization effects of supplemental insurance also have significant implications for

equity. Private health expenditures in France are more regressive than in other countries, with

the exception of the US and Switzerland [2]. While France rates very highly in terms of life

expectancy and other health indicators, the aggregate figures obscure large differences related to

income and social class [3]. The fact that both supplemental insurance coverage and access to



                                                1
medical care are positively related to income and social class raises the concern that the

limitations in the coverage provided by the public system may contribute to the inequity in

health outcomes. Seeking to reduce these inequities in access, in 2000 the French government

introduced a new means-tested program, the couverture maladie universelle (CMU), to

supplement the health insurance coverage provided by the Social Security system so as to reduce

the out-of-pocket costs faced by low-income patients.


    As a starting point for understanding the impact of this policy on health spending and access

to care, it is useful to examine the relationship between supplemental insurance coverage and

utilization in the period just prior to the implementation of the CMU. Using a nationally

representative survey of the French population conducted in 1998, we investigate the two most

important ways that health insurance is likely to affect health spending. First, by lowering the

cost of care, insurance may cause a general increase in the quantity of medical care demanded,

thus increasing the number of visits. Second, we consider whether supplemental coverage

influences the choice of provider, conditional on seeking care. Specifically, we examine the

effect of insurance on the choice between seeing a specialist rather than a general practitioner

(GP).


    The greatest challenge with this type of analysis is distinguishing a causal effect of health

insurance—i.e., moral hazard—from the effect of unobserved heterogeneity—i.e., adverse

selection. The most obvious concern is that individuals with greater expected medical care use—

say, for reasons of poor health—may be more likely to purchase supplemental insurance. If this

is the case, the empirical relationship between insurance and utilization will overstate the moral

hazard effect. We address this issue in several ways. First, the fact that our data includes detailed




                                                 2
information on individual health status allows us to investigate the relationship between health

risk and insurance coverage. While it does not rule out the possibility of selection based on

unobservable characteristics, the richness of the health variables in our data provides a strong

test for health-related adverse selection. The inclusion of these variables in our utilization

regressions also mitigates concerns that our estimated insurance effects are driven by differences

in health status between people with and without private insurance. Second, using a strategy

previously employed by Ettner [4] and Genier [5], we contrast the effects of insurance that is

obtained through the workplace with individually purchased coverage. To the extent that adverse

selection is an issue in the market for supplemental insurance, the problem should be limited to

policies purchased directly by individuals. We also estimate several bivariate probit models that

treat insurance coverage and the probability of having a physician visit as jointly determined

outcomes.


    Our results point to a strong effect of supplemental health insurance on the use of physician

services. Probit models of the insurance coverage provide no support for the hypothesis that

people with supplemental insurance are “sicker” than those without such coverage. Models of

the effect of insurance on physician visits indicate a large and statistically significant effect and

the magnitude of the effect is comparable for individually purchased and employer-provided

insurance. Similarly, the point estimates from bivariate probit models are essentially the same as

those from simpler models that treat supplemental insurance as exogenous. Taken together, these

results support a moral hazard interpretation of the effect of the relationship between

supplemental health insurance and the use of physician services.


    The following two sections summarize the key aspects of the French health care system and




                                                 3
review the relevant empirical literature, respectively. Section IV describes our data and Section

V presents our regression results. Concluding comments are in the sixth and final section.


            II. HEALTH INSURANCE AND ACCESS TO CARE IN FRANCE

    All legal residents of France are covered by public health insurance, which is one of the

Social Security system's entitlement programs. Between 1980 and 1995, the public sector’s share

of spending on health care services declined from 79.4% to almost 75%; it has stayed roughly at

that level since then. This trend has coincided with an increase in the proportion of the

population with private supplemental health insurance. Whereas in 1970 roughly one-half of the

population had such coverage, throughout the 1990s the figure increased to 85%, with private

insurance accounting for half of all private health expenditures.


    Because roughly half of all supplemental insurance contracts are provided through the

workplace, industrial/occupational affiliation is an important factor determining health insurance

coverage. Coverage tends to be higher for managers and highly educated professionals than for

semi-skilled and unskilled workers, and is lowest for the unemployed [6]. The vast majority of

individually purchased policies are through non-profit organizations known as mutuelles, which

are organized largely on occupational, professional or regional lines and which neither exclude

potential subscribers on the basis of health nor use risk-rated premiums. Some institutions

increase the premium when individuals retire but the adjustment is highly regulated and far from

actuarial. About one-quarter of individually purchased coverage is through for-profit insurers

who can legally use health status in the underwriting process.


    Whereas in other countries supplemental coverage provides access to providers operating

outside the public system or a means of “jumping the queue” to obtain hospital or specialty care,


                                                 4
this is not the case in France. Patients with and without private coverage see the same physicians

and neither face any explicit constraints on access. Patients can see as many physicians as they

like, as often as they like, and do not need a referral to see a specialist. Thus, in the French

system, the main benefit provided by private insurance is to reduce out-of-pocket payments.


    In the case of physician visits, there are two sources of out-of-pocket payments: the ticket

modérateur, an official co-payment set by the government, and the difference between a

provider’s fee and the “standard tariff”, which is the maximum amount reimbursed by the public

system. Out-of-pocket costs are higher for specialists in part because the ticket modérateur is

defined as a fixed percentage of the standard tariff, which is higher for specialists, and because

specialists are more likely to balance bill. Thirty-eight percent of specialists are allowed to

charge more than the standard tariff, compared to 11% of GPs.


    In principle, supplemental insurance may induce substitution away from GPs toward

specialists by reducing the price difference between the two types of providers. This may be

viewed as an effect of insurance on patient demand for quality, particularly in France where the

hierarchical nature of medical education is likely to contribute to a perception that specialists

provide a higher quality of care. However, the magnitude of this effect in the current French

context may be small as the price difference between specialists and generalists is not generally

large. At the time of our data, the standard tariffs were 22.9 euros for specialists and 17.5 euros

for GPs, which translates to less than a 2 euro difference in the ticket modérateur. The amount

by which specialist fees exceeds the amount reimbursed by the public system varies. In our data,

average total charges for specialist and generalist visits would translate to out-of-pocket

payments of roughly 15.5 and 6.6 euros, respectively.




                                                5
III. PREVIOUS RESEARCH ON SUPPLEMENTAL INSURANCE AND UTILIZATION

    Although there is a large literature on the effects of health insurance on medical care

utilization, most studies are from the US and, for various reasons, are of limited applicability to

France and other European countries. The best-known research comes from the Rand Health

Insurance Experiment [7]. Individuals randomly assigned to a plan with first dollar coverage had

37% more physician visits than those facing co-insurance rates of 25% and 50% more than

individual with 50% coinsurance. These are the results that are most relevant to the French

experience since French patients with comprehensive supplemental insurance face co-insurance

rates for ambulatory that are close to zero, compared to rates of between 25% and 50% for

individuals without supplemental coverage.


    More recent US studies use data from large, cross-sectional data sets that, similar to the

French data we use, include considerable information on health status as well as economic and

socio-demographic variables [8,9,10]. Controlling for observable individual characteristics, these

studies find that uninsured adults have roughly half as many physician visits per year as the

insured. Perhaps more relevant to the French system are studies on the effects of private

“Medigap” insurance, which supplements Medicare coverage for elderly Americans. A number

of studies find that Medigap coverage is positively associated with utilization [11,4,12] though it

is unclear how much of this effect represents moral hazard and how much is due to self-

selection.


    Research from several European countries indicates a significant positive effect of

supplemental private health insurance on outpatient utilization (for instance Harmon and Nolan


                                                6
[13] for Ireland, Vera-Hernandez [14] for Spain, and Schellhorn [15] for Switzerland) while

others concentrate on hospital care [16]. Most relevant to our work are several prior studies

focusing on France. Chiappori et al. [17] analyze a natural experiment resulting from the

response of a private supplemental insurer to a change in cost-sharing required by the public

system. They compare changes in utilization for a reference group for whom coverage was

nearly complete and constant over time and a “treatment group” that experienced a slight

increase in required cost sharing. While this approach mitigates the problem of selection bias, it

raises other problems relating to the generalizability of the results. All the individuals analyzed

had supplemental insurance and even after the regime change the cost sharing required of the

“treatment group” was quite modest. These facts combined with the likelihood that individuals in

both groups had higher than average incomes, may explain their finding that co-insurance had

little effect on use. Differences in utilization between individuals with and without any

supplemental coverage may be greater, especially in a broader population.


    Three other French studies use nationally representative data. Mormiche [18] presents

descriptive evidence on the relationships among social class, medical care utilization, and

insurance coverage. Individuals from higher income occupations have more physician visits

overall and, conditional on having any visits, are more likely to receive care from specialists.

Access to supplemental insurance coverage also varies with income and social class. However,

because they do not control for other factors, these correlations are difficult to interpret. Two

other studies [19,5] use data from 1980 and 1991-92 to examine the relationship between

supplemental insurance and utilization with regressions that control for income and a limited set

of health and demographic variables. Both studies find significant effects of insurance on the

probability of having any physician visits, but no significant effect on the number of visits


                                                7
conditional on having any.


    As noted in the introduction, insurance coverage may be endogenous with respect to

utilization. Many studies treat insurance as exogenous and rely on extensive health-related

control variables to mitigate the bias due to unobserved heterogeneity. Ettner [4] takes an

innovative approach to disentangling moral hazard and adverse selection effects of Medigap

insurance. First, she estimates models of the determinants of Medigap coverage to test for

adverse selection based on observable health status. Then, in her utilization regressions she

distinguishes between Medigap coverage provided by a former employer and individually

purchased policies. The idea is that adverse selection is unlikely to be a major issue for

employer-provided coverage, but may be for individually purchased plans. A third set of studies

uses a variety of multiple equation strategies (e.g. bivariate probit, instrumental variables). In our

work, we use all of these methods.


    There has been much less research on the effect of insurance on the choice between

specialists and generalists. Marquis [20] addresses this question using data from the Rand

experiment and generally finds no effect. Using survey data from the US, Cooper et al. [21]

(1996) find that among the non-elderly, uninsured patients are no less likely to see specialists

than those with private insurance. For patients over age 65, they find a significant and positive

relationship between supplemental health insurance and the decision to see a specialist. Apart

from the descriptive results presented by Mormiche [18] this question has not been examined for

France or other European countries.

                        IV. DATA AND DESCRIPTIVE EVIDENCE

    Our data are from the enquête sur la santé et la protection sociale (ESPS), a national

household survey conducted by CREDES every other year. In 1998, 7,996 households were

interviewed. In this study, we focus on the behavior of adults ages 25 and above. A small

fraction of the French population is exempted from the payment of ticket modérateur either

because of high cost chronic conditions or extremely low incomes. It is difficult to classify their

insurance status because this exemption provides less financial protection than typical

supplemental policies, and yet these individuals do not face the same prices as the uninsured. For

this reason, and the fact that eligibility for these exemptions is linked to variables that could

influence both utilization and the demand for insurance (most notably poor health), we exclude

these individuals from our analysis. It should be noted that because people who receive an

exemption are less likely than average to hold private supplemental insurance the percentage of

people in our sample without coverage is less than in the population. Since health status is a

crucial control variable for analyzing medical care utilization, we also exclude respondents who

did not complete the part of the survey pertaining to health. Our sample consists of 8,689

individuals.


    ESPS respondents are asked to keep a record of all medical consumption during a month,

including information on the nature of the good or service consumed, the medical condition that

prompted the utilization, the type of professional providing the service, the content of the visit,

and the amount charged for the care. The main advantage of this survey methodology is that the

utilization data are highly accurate and complete. The cost of this accuracy, however, is that in a

one-month period the vast majority of respondents have no utilization, and among users the

modal number of visits is one.


                                                9
    Table 1 presents the distributions for the utilization outcomes that we analyze: visits to any

physician, visits to GPs and visits to specialists. The data are presented for the full sample and

separately by insurance status. For all three measures, the mean is significantly higher for sub-

sample with supplemental coverage. Considering all types of physicians, those with coverage

have nearly twice as many visits as those without (0.43 vs. 0.21). A closer investigation reveals

that this difference is driven by a difference at the extensive margin: insurance is associated with

a doubling of the probability of positive utilization (30% vs. 14.9%). For GP and specialists

visits, the insurance-related difference in having any visits is 10 and 7 percentage points,

respectively, which are large effects given sample means for these outcomes. Conditional on

having at least one visit, there is not a statistically significant difference in the mean number of

visits for the two groups. Given this pattern, our econometric analysis will focus mainly on the

effect of insurance on the probability of having any visits.


    Summary statistics for our independent variables are reported in Table 2. The ESPS

provides information on the source of each person’s insurance coverage. Because employer-

provided health insurance represents a relatively small share of total compensation in France and

comparable insurance is readily available outside the workplace, there is no reason to expect

workers to choose jobs based on their demand for insurance. As a result, to the extent that

adverse selection is an issue in the French system it should be limited to individually purchased

contracts. Therefore, following Ettner [4] and Genier [5], we can test for adverse selection by

comparing the effect of these two types of policies on utilization. The validity of this test rests on

the comparability of the two types of coverage. While limited, the information on the quality of

coverage that is available in the ESPS does not point to large differences in quality. When asked

about the quality of reimbursement for specialized care, 45% of respondents with group


                                                 10
insurance and 43% of persons with individual contracts said their coverage was complete.


    The potential for bias from unobserved heterogeneity is also reduced by the fact that the

ESPS includes a rich set of health status measures and other controls. Self-assessed global health

status is measured using a 10-point scale. We use this variable to construct indicator variables for

people in excellent health and those whose health is fair or poor. Respondents are also asked to

list their medical conditions, to report information about risk factors (smoking) and to say

whether or not they frequently experience pain or difficulties in performing daily activities.

Based on responses to these questions, physician researchers have constructed categorical

variables reflecting mortality risk and levels of disability. In our analysis, we use this

information to construct indicators for individuals with a high mortality risk and for those

reporting some type of disability. Our regressions also include three dummy variables relating to

smoking, a dummy for individuals who report experiencing frequent pain, and one for women

who are pregnant at the time of the survey.


    Demographic and economic control variables include age, gender, family income (reported

in intervals and normalized by the number of consumption units in the family), education,

employment status and occupation/labor force activity. Two additional control variables describe

whether the individual lives in a region where the density of physician is high or low.


                                          V. RESULTS

The Determinants of Supplemental Insurance Coverage

    An important first step in testing for adverse selection is to examine the effect of observed

health status on insurance coverage. The first column of Table 3 reports results from a probit

regression in which the dependent variable equals one for individuals with private supplemental


                                                11
health insurance and zero for those without. In the next two columns, we report coefficients from

a multinomial logit model with three outcomes: no supplemental insurance (the base category),

employer-provided insurance and individually-purchased coverage. Slightly more than half the

people with supplemental insurance, receive it from the workplace. For both models the

regressors include seven health status variables, four indicators of smoking behavior along with

other economic and demographic controls.


    First and foremost, we find no evidence that individuals in poor health are more likely to

obtain supplemental insurance. Some of the probit coefficients indicate a positive relationship

between poor health and coverage, though others have the opposite sign. Most importantly none

of the health coefficients are statistically significant individually and they are insignificant as a

group as well. This result is consistent with the findings of Hurd and McGarry [12] for Medigap

insurance in the US, Shmueli [22] for supplemental insurance in Israel, as well as Genier [5] on a

different French survey. Our results are stronger than those studies because we have substantially

more information on health status. Similarly, the multinomial logit results indicate no significant

relationship between health and insurance coverage.


    In contrast, we do find a significant relationship between smoking behavior and coverage.

Evaluating the probit function at the sample means implies that heavy (light) smokers are 3.5

(1.8) percentage points less likely than non-smokers to have private insurance. One possible

interpretation is that smokers have a higher tolerance for risk and/or place a lower value on their

health than non-smokers. However, answers to subjective questions that were addressed to only

a subset of ESPS respondents seem to argue against the idea of self-selection on the basis of

“tastes”. These questions ask respondents to state what influence they believe medical care and




                                                 12
other factors (work conditions, family tensions and the environment) have on health. Individuals

with and without supplemental coverage answer these questions quite similarly. In particular,

there is no statistically significant difference in the percentage saying that medical care is either

important or very important.


    The other coefficients confirm that socioeconomic status has a significant impact on the

probability of having supplemental insurance. Coverage increases with income and, relative to

working adults, is lower for the unemployed and higher for retirees. The marginal effect of age

on any supplemental insurance coverage is quadratic, with the probability of coverage increasing

until age 43 and declining thereafter. However, this result is somewhat deceiving given the large

positive effect of being retired. The multinomial logit results reveal that age is not significantly

related to individual purchases of insurance relative to having no supplemental coverage. Since

medical care utilization increases with age, this also runs counter to the notion that this market is

subject to adverse selection.


The Effect of Supplemental Insurance on Physician Visits

    Table 4 presents results for probit models in which the dependent variable equals one for

individuals with at least one visit to any type of physician and zero otherwise. In column 1,

insurance is represented by a single indicator variable; the model in column 2 allows for a

differential effect of insurance by source of coverage.


    Turning first to the controls, all of the health status variables have a statistically significant

effect on utilization, which suggests that these measures capture different aspects of health. All

else equal, individuals with the poorest self-assessed health are 9 percentage points more likely

to have a visit than our baseline health category, who are themselves 10 percentage points more


                                                 13
likely to have a visit than individuals with the best self-assessed health. Heavy smokers have

slightly lower utilization than non-smokers (a 3 percentage point difference), while former

smokers have more (by 5 percentage points). Utilization is significantly higher for women than

for men and pregnancy substantially increases utilization by women. Utilization increases

slightly with income and education.


    The effect of insurance is large and statistically significant. The results in column 1 show

that controlling for individual characteristics, supplemental insurance increases the probability of

having at least one physician visit by nearly 13 percentage points, which is roughly 80% of the

raw difference reported in Table 1. To put this in some perspective, this effect is approximately

twice the magnitude of the difference in utilization between the highest and lowest income

categories; the effect of insurance is smaller than the difference in utilization between the least

healthy and the healthiest individuals in the sample.


    In column 2, the coefficient on employer-provided insurance is slightly larger than that for

individually purchased coverage. This is the opposite of what we should find if the relationship

between insurance and utilization were being driven by adverse selection. However, like in

Genier [5], the difference between the two coefficients is not different from zero at standard

levels of significance. The coefficients on the control variables are very similar across the two

specifications.


    An alternative strategy to account for the potential endogeneity of insurance is to estimate

insurance coverage and utilization jointly using a bivariate probit model. The key issue here is to

identify variables that can reasonably be assumed to influence coverage, but no direct impact on

utilization. Variables related to occupation and labor force status are the most viable candidates

in the ESPS, with the most plausible instrument being an indicator of employment in the public

sector. All public employees are able to participate in mutual insurance contracts designed for

civil servants, and most of them take up these contracts, but there is no reason to expect

employment in the public sector to have an impact on health status or the consumption of care.

In fact, in our data, there is no significant difference in the observed health of public employees

and other adults and when this indicator variable is included directly in the utilization regression

(controlling for insurance coverage) its coefficient is not statistically different from zero.

Variables describing employment status (five categories) and professional occupation (eight

categories) are also candidate instruments which have been use in other studies (for instance,

Vera-Hernandez [14]).


    Table 5 presents the main results for bivariate probit models that exclude different

combinations of variables from the utilization equation, while maintaining them in the equation

for insurance coverage (note that we include all these variables in the models reported in table 4

and none of their coefficients are significant). Since the results for the control variables are

essentially the same as in Tables 3 and 4, we report only the supplemental insurance coefficient,

the estimate of the correlation between the error terms of the coverage and utilization equations

(ρ) and the likelihood ratio for testing the bivariate probit model to the simpler (restricted) model

in which coverage and utilization are estimated separately. We report these results for several

versions of the model to show the sensitivity of the results to the assumed exclusion restrictions.

Because we believe the theoretical basis of the public employment dummy is stronger than the

other two sets of variables, we exclude it from the utilization equation in all bivariate probit

specifications.




                                                 15
    Although the point estimates vary somewhat depending on which variables are excluded

from the utilization equation, the qualitative results are the same across the different

specifications. For all versions of the bivariate probit model, the insurance coefficient is larger

than the one from the single equation probit model, though less precisely estimated. The

correlation coefficient is negative for all specifications, though it is never statistically significant.

Taken at face value, these results would suggest that there is favorable selection into

supplemental insurance coverage, which would imply that treating insurance as exogenous leads

to an understatement of the true moral hazard effect. However, given the imprecision of the

point estimates, a more prudent interpretation is that there is no significant difference between

the model that treats insurance as exogenous and the bivariate probit specification. This

interpretation is supported by likelihood ratio tests as well as by an alternative test proposed by

Lollivier [23].


    The pattern of results from the bivariate probit models as well as from the models that use

the source of coverage to test for adverse selection support the idea that in France supplemental

insurance increases utilization by lowering the out-of-pocket cost of care. This view is also

supported by responses to a question in the ESPS about whether in the year prior to the survey

the person had foregone seeking care for financial reasons. Individuals without supplemental

insurance are substantially more likely to report having foregone care than those with insurance

(32% vs. 12%) and the difference remains significant after controlling for other individual

characteristics.


    We also estimated several other regressions which are not reported, but which we will

discuss briefly here. First, we estimated separate probit models of the probability of having any




                                                   16
GP or specialist visits. As with the results for any visits, for both of these outcomes, the

regression-adjusted effect of insurance is nearly as large as the raw difference reported in Table

1. The results for the control variables are also qualitatively similar to those in Table 4. In

particular, all the coefficients on the health status variables are statistically significant with the

expected sign. We find no statistically significant difference between the effects of employer-

provided and individually purchased insurance. Likewise, bivariate probit results for the

probability of having at least one GP or specialist visit contradict the adverse selection

hypothesis and give the same qualitative results as the ones described above.


    For all three utilization measures, we also estimated models of the total number of visits

conditional on positive utilization. Alternative specifications (e.g., OLS, Poisson, negative

binomial) yield a consistent finding of no relationship between insurance and conditional visits,

which is not surprising given that even the unadjusted data suggest a zero effect of insurance.

One possible explanation is that while the decision to seek care is made by patients, subsequent

visits are the outcome of the interaction between providers and patients and, therefore, less

sensitive to financial factors [24]. However, because in the one-month period so few people have

multiple visits, these results should be interpreted with caution.


Insurance and the choice of physician

    As noted above, since cost sharing is generally greater for specialty as compared to primary

care, supplemental insurance might also influence the type of physician a patient chooses to see.

We test for this type of effect by taking the physician visit as the unit of observation and

estimating a probit model of the decision to see a specialist rather than a GP. A key issue here is

that the choice between the two types of providers is not relevant for all medical conditions that



                                                 17
prompt a visit. In many situations visiting a GP is the only reasonable option, whereas other

conditions lie clearly within the domain of a specialist. In these extreme cases, while financial

considerations may affect the decision of whether or not to seek care, conditional on seeking care

there is little reason to expect an effect of insurance on the type of provider chosen.


    A more informative test, therefore, is to examine the effect of supplemental insurance on the

choice of physician type for conditions where either a GP or specialist could provide the care.

We identify such cases according to observed patient behavior in earlier ESPS surveys (1992-

1995). In those data, we group all visits by the ICD-9 code for the condition prompting the visit.

For each ICD sub-chapter we calculate the proportion of visits that took place in a specialist’s

practice and sorted the data according to this measure (excluding sub-chapters for which the

number of visits was too small to get a reliable estimate). Then, we distinguish three groups of

medical conditions: those which are treated by a specialist in less than 30% of cases, those

treated by a specialist in more than 70% of cases, and those in between, for which we consider

the possibility of substitution to be most likely (results do not vary when these arbitrary

thresholds are changed). Thus, in addition to analyzing the full sample of visits (3591 over a

month), we estimate a model on the sub-sample that falls in this middle category (1402 visits). In

addition to the independent variables used to model the probability of having any visits, we

include an indicator of whether or not the visit was referred by a physician.


    The full results are reported in Table 6. As expected, the referred visits are much more

likely to take place at a specialist's. For the most part, other control variables have limited

impact on the type of provider chosen. The effect of insurance is stronger when we limit the

analysis to visits where substitution between specialists and GPs seems more plausible.




                                                 18
However, even there, the impact of insurance is not significantly different from zero.


    The lack of a significant effect of insurance on choice of provider may not be surprising

given that, as noted in Section II, even for people without supplemental insurance the difference

in out-of-pocket cost for a GP and a specialist is often very small. However, this “non-result” is

subject to several important caveats. First, because it is difficult to identify exactly those cases

where a patient could see either a GP or a specialist, our estimates are necessarily imprecise.

When we limit the sample to visits where substitution seems most plausible, the point estimate is

actually quite large, but is insignificant because of a large standard error. Thus, while the 95%

confidence interval includes zero, it also includes very large effects.


    Second, since we only observe the choice of provider for people who seek care, these results

need to be interpreted in light of the strong effect of insurance on that preceding decision. In

particular, since out-of-pocket costs are higher for specialists (if only slightly so) the tendency of

uninsured patients to forego care for financial reasons may be greatest in cases where the

services in question are those of a specialist. Thus, our results for this conditional decision may

be biased toward zero due to self-selection. In principle, one could account for this selection with

a Heckman-type model, though in our data there are no variables that can plausibly be argued to

affect the decision to seek care but not the choice of provider.


                                        VI. DISCUSSION

    Our main results can be summarized as follows. We find a large and statistically significant

difference between French adults with and without supplementary health insurance in the

probability of seeing a physician during a one-month period. In contrast, conditional on having at

least one visit, we find no statistically significant effect of insurance on the number of visits or


                                                 19
the type of physician chosen. However, both of these latter results are subject to important

caveats. Given the short time period over which utilization is measured in our data, very few

people have multiple visits. With respect to the choice of physician, insurance may have a

stronger effect in settings where there the difference in out-of-pocket costs for specialists and

GPs is more pronounced. Even in the French context, our estimates may be biased downward by

the fact that we cannot model the decision to seek care and the choice of provider as joint

decisions.


    The magnitude of the effect of insurance in our data is comparable to the effect of health

status and larger than the partial effect of income. While differences in data preclude precise

comparisons, this effect is large relative the findings of previous studies. In percentage terms, the

difference we find between individuals with and without supplemental insurance is of a

comparable magnitude of the gap in utilization between Americans with and without any

insurance and is larger than the percent effects found in the Rand experiment. This might seem to

suggest that our estimates of the causal effect of insurance on utilization are biased by adverse

selection. However, considerable evidence argues against this interpretation. If adverse selection

were an important factor, we would expect individuals whose observed health status was poor to

be more likely to purchase insurance. Despite having several different measures of health status,

we find no evidence of this kind. Similarly, while these health status measures and other

demographic variables are strongly related to utilization, only a small part of the insurance-

related difference in utilization can be explained by differences in observed characteristics of

individuals with and without coverage. Two distinct tests for the effect of unmeasured

characteristics also provide no support for the adverse selection hypothesis, while auxiliary

regressions point to out-of-pocket costs as a factor reducing the utilization of individuals without


                                                 20
private insurance.


    Because in France private health insurance coverage increases with income, the strong effect

of insurance on utilization contributes to income-related inequality in access to care. The

magnitude of this effect is illustrated in Table 7, which for four income groups reports mean

actual utilization and predicted utilization under the assumption that everyone had private

supplemental insurance. The latter figures are estimated based on the regression results reported

in Table 4. The figures show that in 1998, individuals in the highest income category were 33%

more likely to have at least one physician visit during a one-month period than individuals in the

lowest income group (32.5% vs. 24.4%).         Extending supplemental insurance to the entire

population would increase mean utilization for all groups, but the change would be larger for the

lower income groups because of their lower baseline level of insurance. Thus, achieving

universal coverage in this way would reduce the difference in utilization between the highest and

lowest income groups from 8 percentage points to 6.5 percentage points. All in all, these results

have direct implications for legislation that was enacted in 2000 with the goal of improving the

insurance coverage of low-income families (the CMU). Our results imply that this policy should

increase utilization for the target population, though the effect on overall inequalities in access

will be relatively modest. The actual impact of the CMU is an important subject for future

research.

Notes: Actual utilization represents the percent of individuals in each income category with at least
one physician visit. Predicted utilization under universal coverage is calculated by estimating for each
individual the probability of having at least one visit if covered by supplemental insurance and then
