JEL No. I1

                                           ABSTRACT

Nutrition is a key input in the health production function, and a better understanding of how we
eat can aid in guiding effective policy change towards better population health. This study
documents prevalence rates, trends in, and potential correlates of nutrient intake for panels of
countries, categorized by geographical regions and levels of development. We assemble data
from 209 countries, spanning 51 years (1961-2011), based on original data compilations using
960 country-years for BMI, 370 country-years for glucose, and 321 country-years for cholesterol.
Our estimates inform the nature and scope of nutrient intake on a global scale, and contribute
towards an understanding of the drivers of the general upward trend in food intake and obesity.
The cross-national trends, across countries spanning the spectrum of economic development and
geographic regions, suggest that simply analyzing aggregate caloric intake masks the
heterogeneity in trends for the various food groups. Food groups analyzed include cereals, sugars
and sweeteners, vegetable oils, meat, starch, milk, fruits, animal fats, alcoholic beverages, oil
crops, pulses, vegetables, fish, and eggs. Fixed effects regression analyses reveal that caloric
intake is strongly associated with hunger depth, body mass index, cholesterol levels, and glucose
levels. Moreover, changes in real GDP per capita, labor force participation, and health care
measures in a nation can partly explain the increase in caloric intake. We note that substantial
heterogeneity remains. While these associations should not be interpreted as causal, they provide
a first step towards understanding shifts in aggregate eating patterns across the globe and levels of
economic activity.

I.     Introduction

       Nutrient intake varies drastically around the world and has exhibited substantial

variation across countries and over time. In 2011, the United Nations General Assembly

identified unhealthy diet as one of four global causes of noncommunicable diseases, together

with tobacco use, harmful use of alcohol, and insufficient physical activity (WHO, 2011a).

Nutrition is a key input into health, both indirectly as it is related to food consumption which

regulates body weight and obesity, as well as directly (WHO 2011a). Since what we eat can

have complex direct and indirect effects on health, disease and comorbidities, a better

understanding of how we eat can aid in guiding effective policy change towards better

population health.

       Higher obesity rates across countries and over time can be partly attributed to higher

levels of food consumption and caloric intake (WHO, 2011a). However, associated with

changes in levels are potential changes in the composition of caloric intake, which would in turn

affect nutrient intake and have independent effects on morbidity and mortality, even after

accounting for any effects on obesity. Thus, if the increase in obesity cross-nationally and over

time is associated with shifts towards poorer nutrient intake, then this would compound any

adverse effects on health. While the focus in the public health literature on obesity s well-

placed, this therefore presents only a partial picture of health production. A significant gap

exists with respect to an understanding of the shifts in nutrient and caloric intake globally and

over a long time span.

       Poor diets, in combination with lack of exercise, are found to affect the heart, the brain,

and the peripheral arteries, leading to cardiovascular diseases, intestinal cancers, high blood


                                                                                                    3
pressure, and obesity, diabetes and other diseases (Eurodiet, 2000; World Cancer Research

International, 2009; European Chronic Diseases Alliance, 2011). As fewer people in developed

countries cook their own food, the food industry gains an increasing impact on human eating

behaviors (McCarthy et al., 2013).

       In Europe, the focus has been shifting from "healthy foods" to "healthy eating." For

example, the European Medical Research Council has conducted research ranging from

patterns of meals, to brands of foods, labeling, food perceptions, and public engagement in

policy (European Science Foundation, 2009) and the International Association for Research on

Cancer (2011) has determined a connection between nutrition and heart disease, as well as

nutrition and various cancers. Overall, research in Europe has shown an excess rather than a

lack of nutrients (Elmada, 2009). There has been a gap in the empirical literature in terms of

studying differences in nutritional intake based on wide country panels. Studies that focus on

broad country panels and other health outcomes, such as infant mortality, immunizations, and

HIV prevalence, have found that there is a strong link between income and health cross-

sectionally, but this link weakens over time (Casabonne and Kenny, 2012).

       For most of the developing world, addressing food security and in some parts, coping

with hunger, has been the central question. Eliminating malnutrition – one of the Millenium

Development Goals – has been the focus of evidence-based direct nutrition interventions, and

the "scaling up" nutrition movement (Horton, 2008). The above problems were exacerbated by

the food price crisis of 2007-2008. The food price index increased from 127.2 in 2006 to 201.4

in 2008, falling again in 2009 to 160.3. (See

http://www.fao.org/worldfoodsituation/foodpricesindex/en/.) The 2007-2008 food price crisis


                                                                                                 4
and the subsequent global economic crisis have led to an increase in the number of people

suffering from hunger worldwide (FAO, 2009, 2011). Since poverty lines are defined based on

pre-determined food and non-food baskets, the increase in food prices has a direct impact as

income-based poverty increases (Ravallion, 1994). Country-specific studies on income and price

elasticities of demand for different types of nutrients have shown that changes in food prices

generally shift the composition of demand towards cheaper nutrients (Ecker and Qaim, 2010).

Income is generally found to have a negative scale effect on overall caloric consumption and a

neutral effect on food composition (Ecker and Qaim, 2010).

       Our study, which focuses on the economic correlates of the trends in disaggregated

caloric intake, makes several contributions to the literature. We assemble data from a

multitude of sources, and provide the most comprehensive cross-national evidence to date on

the prevalence and trends in indicators of caloric intake and related outcomes such as hunger

depth, body mass index, cholesterol levels and glucose levels. This evidence spans a diverse set

of 209 countries, across the full spectrum of economic development, over 51 years. Specifically,

we closely follow disaggregated trends in the caloric intake of nutrients pertaining to cereals,

sugars and sweeteners, vegetable oils, meat, starch, milk, fruits, animal fats, alcoholic

beverages, oil crops, pulses, vegetables, fish, and eggs. Unlike many previous studies, we

analyze data from both developed and developing nations and test for differences across

regions and levels of development. The panel structure of the data allows us to account for all

time-invariant country-specific heterogeneity, thus bypassing an important potential source of

confounding bias, and also makes it feasible to statistically test for inter-regional differences in

these trends. We further exploit the panel nature of the data to move beyond descriptive


                                                                                                       5
evidence and assess several questions of interest, relating changes in caloric intake and the

composition of food intake to hunger depth and body mass index, as well as glucose and

cholesterol levels. These latter outcomes are important indicators of health independent of

obesity and food deprivation. We also conduct a joint estimation of equations relating caloric

intake with economic factors such as GDP and labor force participation. Production functions

relating food and caloric intake to BMI, for instance, and modeling how income or labor status

affect the demand for calories and categories of food have generally not been estimated at the

cross-national level. The significance of doing so stems from the fact that prior work has shown

that obesity is a global epidemic, and while there are some differences across world regions, it

has been rising across the spectrum of economic development. BMI and obesity are final

observed outcomes realized from underlying behaviors relating to caloric intake and

expenditure. In order to understand trends in obesity, it is therefore important to understand

the behavior of these underlying inputs, and while this has been studied at the micro-level

(usually for an individual country), we are not aware of any comprehensive long time-span

cross-national studies on caloric intake and on the composition of the caloric intake. That being

said, the results obtained in this study should not be interpreted as causal estimates.

Nevertheless, these associations provide a useful first step towards understanding shifts in

aggregate eating patterns across countries and levels of economic development.

       The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section II details our empirical methodology,

and section III describes the data and variables assembled for analysis. Section IV discusses the

results, and the final section concludes with some implications for public health.

II.    Empirical Implementation


                                                                                                   6
       We proceed in a stepwise manner to assess three issues: 1) trends in caloric intake

across various food groups; 2) relationship between caloric intake across key food groups and

health-related indicators; and 3) economic correlates of caloric intake across the various food

groups.

       Our empirical methodology begins with the following specification that allows us to

estimate long-term trends in outcomes related to caloric intake.

       (1)     Ln Caloric Intakeit = β0 + β1 Post2011t + μi + εit

Equation (1), estimated for a sample of countries for 1961 and 2011, relates the natural log of

caloric intake for the ith country in year t, to an indicator for 2011 (Post2011). The natural log

facilitates the interpretation of the parameter β1 as the growth in caloric intake over the sample

period, and also adjusts for the skewness of the caloric intake distribution across countries.

Models further include country fixed effects, which account for all unobservable time-invariant

country-specific heterogeneity, for instance relating to geography, cross-national differences in

data collection and reporting, and stable institutional factors. All standard errors are adjusted

for arbitrary correlation in the error term (ε) within each country over time.

       We estimate the above model for the full sample of countries, as well as for countries

stratified across geographic regions and level of economic development. The World Bank

classifies countries by income according to gross national income (GNI) per capita. The groups

are: low income, lower middle income, upper middle income, and high income. The countries

are divided according to 2012 GNI per capita, based on the World Bank Atlas methodology (see

http://data.worldbank.org/about/country-classifications).




                                                                                                     7
       We analyze caloric intake for 15 food categories. While public health researchers and

the community have with good reason focused on obesity trends, it is informative to broaden

the lens and consider the composition of food consumption and related shifts in nutrient

intake. Nutrient Intake is an important determinant in the health production function along

with BMI. Ceteris paribus, both indicators have important independent effects on health in

addition to cross-product effects. Analyzing individual food groups can help shed light on issues

related to whether the increase in obesity is simply due to a scale effect (an increase in the

aggregate consumption of calories) or whether individuals have substituted away from

'healthier' food options toward 'unhealthier' options, as is arguably the case during

recessionary periods (Dave and Kelly 2012). These results are reported in Tables 3 and 4.

       Our second step is to proceed to estimate the structural production function. This is a

direct estimation of the effects of caloric intake on hunger depth, body mass index (BMI),

glucose, and cholesterol:

       (2)     Ln Outcomeirt = α0 + α1 LnCaloricIntakeirt + μr + ψt + εirt

Specifically, model (2) relates these health outcomes (for country i in region r and year t) to a

direct measure of caloric intake, fully exploiting the panel nature of the data (described in the

next section), and includes region fixed effects (μ) and year fixed effects (ψ) to account for

unobservable stable region-specific factors and common trends affecting all countries,

respectively. The parameter of interest, α1, captures the total effect of caloric intake (across

the different food groups) on health-related indicators. Thus, when we consider cholesterol

and glucose, α1 reflects the marginal product of caloric intake from vegetable-based vs. animal

based foods reflecting both the direct effect as well as the indirect effect. The latter indirect


                                                                                                    8
effect reflects that greater (lower) consumption of calories from (vegetables) animal-based

foods may raise BMI and in turn affect cholesterol and glucose levels. In order to isolate the

direct effect, which does not flow through body weight and obesity, we also estimate equation

(2) adding BMI as a control. This model relates to and underscores our earlier point that

nutrient intake may be an independent direct input in the health production function. We also

recognize that these inputs may have cumulative and durable effects on outcomes, and the

panel structure of the data makes it possible to assess lagged effects. These results are

reported in Table 5 and 6. We again adjust all standard errors for arbitrary correlation within

each country; this also helps to partly adjust degrees of freedom and inferences for the fact

that the data on BMI, glucose, and cholesterol are imputed based on other original data sources

(see data description below) and thus are flat for some country-year pairs, thus providing no

new information over the preceding year.

       Next, we model the economic correlates of caloric intake:

       (3)     Ln Caloric Intakeirt = δ0 + δ1 Ln GDPirt + δ2 LFPirt + Xirt Ψ + μr + ψt + εit

Caloric Intake represents intake from the seven food categories, GDP refers to per-capita gross

domestic product, LFP refers to labor force participation, and the vector X controls for both out-

of-pocket health expenditures and the number of physicians per capita. Equation (3) may be

viewed as a quasi reduced-form input demand function. Running the equations separately and

conducting a multivariate test on the correlation across the error terms reveals the error terms

to be expectedly and highly correlated; unobservables that affect the demand for some forms

of caloric intake would be expected to affect the demand for other food groups as well. We

therefore estimate the seven equations using a seemingly unrelated regression (SURE)


                                                                                                  9
framework to account for the inter-equation correlated error structure (Zellner 1962). These

results are reported in Table 7.

III.   Data

       We assemble data on obesity, related outcomes, and its proximate inputs for 209

countries, spanning 51 years (1961-2011), from three main sources which are publicly available:

1) Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO); 2) World Health Organization (WHO); and 3) World

Bank (WB). These data are publicly available at the following sources:

http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.A867?lang=en,

http://faostat.fao.org/site/354/default.aspx, and

http://databank.worldbank.org/ddp/home.do.

       The mean aggregate caloric intake per person, expressed in kilocalories (kcal) per day, is

a measure of the average number of calories consumed, including all food groups. These data

are derived by the FAO from food balance sheets for 1960-2011. A food balance sheet captures

the pattern of a country’s food supply during a given period, and shows for each basic food

item or primary commodity its total availability for human consumption, corresponding to the

sources of supply and its utilization. The total quantity of food commodities produced is

adjusted for the total quantity imported or exported. A distinction is also made between food

commodities fed to livestock or used for seed and net supplies available for human

consumption, although actual food consumption may be lower than the net supplies as food

availability depends on the magnitude of wastage and losses of food in the household. The per

capita supply of each broad food commodity available for human consumption is obtained by

dividing the respective quantity by the total population. Through the application of appropriate


                                                                                               10
food composition factors for all primary and processed products, these data are then expressed

in terms of dietary energy and calories. This is an average measure for both genders. Caloric

intake is also obtained separately for animal-based and vegetable-based products, which are

closely correlated with nutrient and fat intake (WHO, 2011a). Sufficient consumption of fruits

and vegetables has been shown to be necessary for lowering the risk for cardiovascular

diseases, stomach cancer, and colorectal cancer (WHO, 2011a). Saturated fats and trans-fatty

acids are associated with heart disease (WHO, 2011a). Moreover, the following 15 food

categories are identified: cereals, sugars and sweeteners, vegetable oils, meat, starch, milk,

fruits, animal fats, alcoholic beverages, oil crops, pulses, vegetables, fish, eggs, and a

miscellaneous (“other”) category that includes tree nuts, stimulants, offals, spices, and aquatic

products (each with an average daily caloric intake less than 20 kcal).

       Data for the mean body mass index (BMI) for the “adult” population, defined as ages 20

years old and older, are obtained from the WHO for 1980 to 2008. The data were collected

from population-based surveys and surveillance systems, based on objective measurements of

height and weight of the respondents. Obesity, defined as having a BMI greater than or equal

to 30 kg/m2, has been identified as a significant risk factor for morbidities such as diabetes,

coronary heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, and several cancers related to the colon,

breasts, and the prostate.

       The mean fasting blood glucose level is defined for the population of adults ages 25

years and above, measured in mmol/L. The mean total cholesterol of a defined population,

adults ages 25 years old and above, is also measured in mmol/L. These data are also obtained

from the WHO for period spanning 1980-2008, and the information is derived through


                                                                                                  11
biochemical measurements from country-specific population-based samples and surveillance

systems. We assess all trends and prevalence rates for BMI, and glucose and cholesterol levels

separately across gender. Note that the WHO data employed here for BMI, glucose, and

cholesterol are largely based on estimates using Bayesian hierarchical models carefully

compiled from numerous studies and reported in a set of 2011 Lancet articles (WHO 2011b,

Danaei et al. 2011a, Danaei et al. 2011b, Finucane et al. 2011, Farzadfar et al. 2011). In spite of

the extensive data collected by the authors of these studies, many country-years had missing

information since annual data are difficult to obtain for some countries (Danaei et al. 2011a).

The estimates employed in this study are based on original data compilations using 960

country-years for BMI, 370 country-years for glucose, and 321 country-years for cholesterol.

       Given that BMI, glucose, and cholesterol represent our outcome measures (in equation

2), the variance surrounding the imputation will be captured by the disturbance terms in

equation (2) and only affect the precision of our estimates. The country fixed effects further

account for the possibility that the measurement error in the imputed values may be

systematically difference across countries. Hence, any remaining unsystematic measurement

error associated with the imputed values will not bias our results. Our specification checks

(detailed in the results section) provide some evidence on this.

       Data on depth of hunger, GDP per capita, labor force participation, age structure, out-

of-pocket health expenditures, and physicians per capita are obtained from the World Bank.

(Following a reviewer’s suggestion, we also run models with total health spending in lieu of out-

of-pocket health expenditures. Our main conclusions are not materially affected by these

alternate controls.) According to the World Bank, the depth of hunger, measured in daily


                                                                                                  12
kilocalories per person, is a measure of the intensity of food deprivation. It shows how much

food-deprived individuals fall short of minimum food needs, measured by comparing the

average amount of dietary energy that undernourished individuals obtain from the food they

eat with the minimum amount needed to maintain body weight and pursue light activity.

IV. Results

Trends

         Tables 1 and 2 present the summary statistics for our key variables for the most recent

year of our sample period, for all countries and subsets based on geographic strata and the

level of economic development. The mean daily caloric intake was 2828 calories in 2011 across

all countries and 3639 for the United States in particular. The U.S. Department of Agriculture

(USDA) recommends that men (women) consume 2,000-2,600 (1,600-2,000) calories if they are

sedentary, 2,200-2,800 (1,800-2,200) calories if they are moderately active and 2,400-3,000

(2,000-2,400) calories per day if they are active (USDA and USDHHS 2010). Given that the

information on caloric intake across countries does not separate genders, and given that

between 32-39% of the population is physically inactive, the mean caloric intake appears to be

higher than the recommended daily allowance, at least for the overall sample of countries.

Aggregate caloric intake in the United States (US), Middle East & North Africa (MENA), Western

Europe (WE), and Eastern Europe & Central Asia (EECA) is significantly higher than that in the

rest of the world. In contrast, that in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is significantly lower.

         In terms of animal-based versus vegetal-based products, we see that the US, WE, and

EECA have substantially higher than average intakes of animal-based products. SSA has a

significantly lower intake of animal-based products. The MENA region has a significantly higher


                                                                                                 13
intake of vegetal-based products and a significantly lower intake of animal-based products,

which may be reflective of the Mediterranean diet (Díaz-Méndez and Gómez-Benito 2010).

         The breakdown into separate food categories shows some interesting findings. For

sugars and sweeteners, the South/East Asia & Pacific (SEAP) and Sub-Saharan regions have

significantly lower intakes (at 228 and 146 calories, respectively) than the global average (284).

For vegetable oils, consumption in the US is very high (701 calories) compared to the global

average of 283, followed by WE (431) and MENA (361). Starch consumption is significantly

higher in SSA (344) compared to the world average (167). Meat consumption is highest in the

US (432 calories), followed by WE (400). These values are high considering the world average

for meat consumption is 233 calories per person per day. Milk consumption is highest in the

US, WE, and EECA, while consumption of fruits is highest in Latin America & the Caribbean

(LAC).

         Results for the mean BMI, cholesterol, and glucose levels are discussed in more detail

elsewhere (Doytch et al. 2016). Figure 1 reveals upward trends in aggregate caloric intake,

intake of vegetal products, and intake of animal-based products from 1961 to 2011. Figures 2a

and 2b break aggregate caloric intake down by food category (using 15 categories) for 1961 and

2011. Here we see contrasting trends – a drop in both cereal consumption as a percentage of

total calories and starch consumption and upward trends for sugars and sweeteners, vegetable

oils, and meats. Below, we discuss the main trends underlying these estimates.

         Average calories consumed increased worldwide by 20%, from 2352 to 2828, between

1961 and 2011 (Table 3). This overall net increase is attributed to an increase in caloric intake

from the consumption of vegetable oils (96%), meat (55%), and sugars and sweeteners (41%).


                                                                                                  14
There was also a large increase in the consumption of eggs (71%), vegetables (67%), fish (59%),

and oil crops (57%), yet it should be noted that while calories consumed from these groups

increased at such high rates, the relative contributions of eggs, fish, oil crops, and vegetables

remains quite low; in 2011, eggs accounted for only 0.9% of total caloric intake, and vegetables

accounted for 2% (Table 1). The largest share of caloric intake in 2011 can be attributed to

cereal (40%), followed by sugar and sweeteners (10%), vegetable oils (10%), meat (8%), milk

(6%), and starch (6%). In contrast, for the United States, cereal accounted for only 22% of total

calories while sugar accounted for almost 16% in 2011. High income and upper-middle income

countries have significantly higher caloric intake than the rest of the world (Table 2). They also

have significantly higher intakes of animal-based products, particularly sugars and sweeteners,

meats, milk, and eggs. Over this time period, we find that a structural break in the trend

occurred for total caloric intake, as well as caloric intake of vegetal products, in 1982. For

animal-based products, a structural break occurred in 1969.

       Aggregate caloric intake increased substantially in all regions and studied groups, except

for the EECA region, which experienced a very low growth rate of 0.4% (Table 3). The fastest

growth (26%) among all income groups was experienced in Lower Middle Income countries

(Table 4), and the fastest regional growth is observed in the MENA region (42%).

       The EECA region experienced a drastic drop in total caloric intake during the beginning

of the 1990s, which drives the minor drop visible in Figure 1 during the 1990-92 period. The

changes in caloric intake post-1990 are likely associated with an overall economic contraction

of most of the EECA economies. This period was plagued with staggering growth of real GDP,

high unemployment rates, downsizing and shutting-down of the majority of existing


                                                                                                    15
enterprises, overall uncertainty, and high inflation rates due to the transition from centrally-

planned to market economies. The region has also experienced drastic declines in birth rates

and increased emigration. The decline in caloric consumption may also therefore reflect a shift

in the composition of an EECA country’s population due to this emigration as the average

caloric intake of the stayers may be very different than the average caloric intake of the

migrants. However, we do not explicitly measure these factors in our study.

       World cereal consumption increased by 8% over the time period analyzed, with SSA,

MENA, and the U.S. leading this trend with growth rates of 24-26%. Nevertheless, as noted

above, the U.S. also has some of the lowest levels of cereal consumption over this entire

timespan. The EECA region, experienced a steep decline in cereal consumption of 28% over this

period. World consumption of starch and pulses has been almost flat during the examined

period. This, however, conceals significant variation across regions; while the MENA region

experienced significant increases in these food groups, WE experienced decreases.

       As previously noted, the growth in global sugar consumption was 41% over the 1961-

2011 time period. However, this net aggregate increase again masks considerable

heterogeneity. Increase in sugar intake was particularly high among the SSA (75%) and SEAP

(67%) regions (Table 3). In terms of absolute caloric intake from sugar, the U.S. continues to

have the highest level of consumption (569 kcals in 2011). With respect to level of

development, sugar intake experienced the steepest growth among the low-income countries

(73%); for all other income-based groups, growth was positive but below average (Table 4).

Specifically, among high-income countries, sugar intake increased by a relatively modest 11%.

Some of the increase in caloric intake through sweeteners has been linked to agricultural


                                                                                                   16
policies in the U.S. such as subsidies to corn farmers (Beghin and Jensen 2008; Rashad 2007). A

significant portion of the increase in sugar (sweetener) consumption in the U.S. can be

attributed to soda and other sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB), which has prompted some

cities and municipalities to propose interventions that limit SSB consumptions such as taxes and

availability restrictions. Note that sugar consumption in this context includes sweeteners such

as high fructose corn syrup.

       While estimates from Tables 1 and 2 and the figures present a snapshot of cross-

regional differences in caloric intake and related outcomes, they do not inform the dynamic

trends in these factors and the underlying drivers of these trends. We discuss these results

next based on the multivariate specifications.

Health Outcomes

       Table 5 shows results for our structural model, which relates total caloric intake and

disaggregated caloric intake across vegetal- and animal-based foods on outcomes related to

hunger depth and BMI. Panel A shows results for health outcomes as a function of aggregate

caloric intake, while Panel B separates nutrient intake into vegetal and animal-based products.

The first column shows results for hunger depth. Note that hunger depth is equal to calories

needed minus average caloric intake for the undernourished. If we have aggregate average

caloric intake for the population on the right hand-side of the equation, it suggests that, if

hunger depth were measured for the whole population, the coefficient (α1 from equation 2)

should be -1. Since the population for which average calories is being measured is different on

both sides of the equation, α1 will not be exactly -1 and would reflect a distributional effect. In

other words, if a 100% increase in caloric intake reduces hunger depth by less than 100%, it


                                                                                                 17
might suggest that the additional calories are not going to the undernourished population. A

value of α1 greater than 1 in absolute value might suggest that the additional calories are going

where they are most needed. The parameter estimate in Table 5 of -1.2479, significant at all

conventional levels, suggests that this may be the case. This is consistent with effective

agricultural, food, and welfare policies which are targeted to the at-need population, and thus

are effective in raising their caloric intake relatively more than the average.

       Results for BMI in Panel A of Table 5 exhibit the expected positive signs, significant at

conventional levels. In Panel B, we see that BMI is significantly affected by both vegetal and

animal-based products.

       Additional results for our structural model are shown in Table 6, which relates total

caloric intake and disaggregated caloric intake across vegetal- and animal-based foods on

outcomes related to glucose and cholesterol for females and males, respectively. The expected

positive, significant effects of total caloric intake and disaggregated caloric intake on glucose

and cholesterol can be seen when BMI is not controlled for on the right-hand side. Once BMI is

controlled for, however, some interesting results emerge. With the exception of animal-based

products for females, caloric intake independently of BMI does not appear to have an effect on

glucose. However, disaggregated caloric intake has a significant effect on cholesterol even

when BMI is controlled for as a confounding factor. This points to the strong independent

effect that caloric intake plays in raising cholesterol independently of BMI. When viewing

disaggregated caloric intake, we see that animal-based products are significantly associated

with higher cholesterol while vegetable-based products are significantly associated with lower

cholesterol. These effects of total and disaggregated caloric intake on glucose and cholesterol


                                                                                                    18
levels capture the total effects, which represent the marginal product of these inputs operating

directly as well as indirectly through their effects on BMI. As the results in both Panels A and B

of Table 5 suggests, caloric intake raises BMI, and this increase in BMI has adverse effects on

glucose and cholesterol levels, as seen in Table 6. Caloric intake overall, and the composition of

calories consumed, therefore have direct effects on glucose and cholesterol levels, conditional

on BMI. These results highlight the dual mechanisms through which calories and the

composition of calories may impact health, first through their effects on bodyweight, and

second directly conditional on a given bodyweight. We also run models similar to those in

Tables 5 and 6 but including one- and two-year lags for caloric intake and BMI. These models

reveal significant lagged effects, especially with respect to the two-year lagged measures, which

is consistent with the inputs having cumulative and durable effects on the output. Moreover,

contemporaneous measures remain significant even after controlling for lags. This suggests

that, in models that do not control for the lags, the contemporaneous measures are capturing

both the current annual effect as well as potential lagged effects. These results are available

upon request.

Correlates of Caloric Intake

       Results for our analysis of the economic correlates of nutrient intake using a SURE

regression framework, which accounts for the joint correlation in the error terms of the

separate models for each of the 15 food groups, are presented in Table 7. Note that GDP per

capita and labor force participation, our key variables of interest, may represent proxies for a

host of other variables that are correlated or jointly determined. Generally, we see that some

food groups are "normal" and some are "inferior" along the lines of what we would expect. In


                                                                                                   19
particular, the elasticities for cereals and starch are negative for GDP per capita. All other food

categories are positive and significant for GDP per capita, with the exception of pulses. This has

implications for the composition of food consumption and nutrient intake over the course of

economic development; as a country develops, overall food consumption and calories rise, yet

there is also some substitution and shifting from some food groups to other groups.

        In contrast, we see that labor force participation is generally associated with lower

levels of consumption for many food categories, exceptions being alcohol, starch, fish, and

meat.

V.      Discussion

        This study documents prevalence rates and trends in caloric intake for various food

categories. Prior studies have focused on BMI, obesity, and aggregate caloric intake, usually

within a country or for a subset of countries. Focusing on nutrient intake for various food

categories can shed light on substitution across food categories over time and highlight the

independent effect of nutrition on health. Increases in BMI alone may not be a cause for

concern for some parts of the world. An increase in BMI may represent different things for

countries at various stages of development. For higher-income nations, the increase may be a

cause for concern, on average, as it is a signal of the increasing trend towards overweight and

obesity. For low-income and perhaps some middle-income nations, the increase in BMI may

signal positive developments, such as a decrease in food insecurity and an increase in access to

adequate food products and nutrition. Thus, looking directly at trends in nutrient intake can

further help us assess differences across nations and over time in a key input into the health

production function and also disentangle average health-promoting trends from average


                                                                                                 20
health-depreciating trends. Hence, this study bridges that gap and goes a long way towards

assessing those trends and drivers of those trends.

       Our estimates highlight the following key points. First, with the marked exceptions of

cereal in the EECA region and starch in the WE region, caloric intake has been steadily

increasing across world regions and across the spectrum of economic development, and has

increased by 20% between 1961 and 2011, although the overall rate of increase masks

considerable heterogeneity across subsets of countries and across food categories. Aggregate

caloric intake clearly exceeds recommended amounts, and this increase can at least partly

account for the rise in BMI and obesity (Doytch et al. 2016). Second, this increase in caloric

intake represents both an increase in levels and also a shift in the composition of the foods

consumed. High income and upper-middle income countries have significantly higher caloric

intake than the rest of the world. They also have significantly higher intakes of animal-based

products, particularly sugars and sweeteners, meats, milk, and eggs. The increase in low-

income countries such as those in SSA (with a low level of caloric intake) can be viewed as

responsible for improved nutrition and reduced food insecurity. Third, our multivariate

analyses confirm that these shifts in the level and composition of caloric intake are associated

across levels of development cross-sectionally and over time. Higher GDP per capita is

associated with higher caloric intake of all food groups, with the exception of cereals and

starch. Furthermore, caloric intake is associated with lower levels of hunger depth but higher

levels of obesity, glucose, and cholesterol. Intake of animal-based products but not vegetal

products is significantly associated with higher levels of cholesterol. Fourth, these effects are

significant overall as well as conditional on BMI (with the exception of glucose), which further


                                                                                                    21
underscores the importance of studying the composition of calories consumed and nutrient

intake. That is, the trends which have led to an increase in obesity have also led to changes in

how we eat. This appears to have independent effects on clinical risk factors such as

cholesterol levels. To the extent that some of the costs of lower population health are borne by

the public, this increase in risk factors for noncommunicable diseases such as heart disease

reflect some of the negative externalities associated with the compositional shifts in caloric

intake beyond the economic costs of obesity.

       While our study is novel in many respects, it has some limitations. We do not purport to

estimate causal effects, and thus the results should be interpreted as associations. While the

FAO, World Bank, and WHO have used methodologies to ease comparisons across countries

and over time, they are necessarily imperfect and should thus be interpreted with caution. As

previously noted, FAO data on caloric intake refer to data available for human consumption and

not actual calories consumed. We also focus in this study on caloric and food intake, one of the

two proximate drivers of bodyweight. Some of the issues that we have underscored in the

study with respect to caloric intake and the composition of food consumption also apply with

equal importance to physical activity. Future work should thus consider the role of physical

activity in driving the observed levels and trends in BMI across nations.

     Notes: Each cell represents the coefficient of the 2011 indicator from a separate regression model for the natural log
     of caloric intake, based on the sample of countries noted for 1961 and 2011. All models, except for those for the
     U.S., include country fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered for arbitrary correlation within each country over
     time. Asterisks denote growth rate is statistically significant as follows: *** p-value ≤ 0.01; ** 0.01 < p-value ≤

Notes: Each column represents a separate regression model and controls for percentage of the total population
between the ages of 15 and 64, and the percentage of the total population 65 years of age and above. Standard errors
are clustered for arbitrary correlation within each country over time. Asterisks denote statistical significance as
follows: *** p-value ≤ 0.01; ** 0.01 < p-value ≤ 0.05; * 0.05 < p-value ≤ 0.10.

  Notes: Out-of-pocket health expenditures (%), physicians per capita, and controls for total population between the
  ages of 15 and 64 (%), and total population 65 years of age and above (%) are included in regressions to capture
  health care differences across countries. Results are from a seemingly unrelated regression (SURE) model due to the
  correlation across the error terms in the seven equations. The λ2 value for the Breusch-Pagan test of independence of
  error terms was 2809.81, rejecting the null hypothesis of independence with a probability of 0.0000.
