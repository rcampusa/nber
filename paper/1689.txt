         The purpose of this paper is to compare the pricing of bank loans and

bonds in international markets. The results obtained, using data on LDC

debtors, indicate that in both markets the country risk premium has responded

to some of the variables suggested by the theory. However, the way in which

these variables affect the risk premium differs across these markets. Data on

LDC bond yields in the secondary   market   for 1980-85 are also used to analyze

the way in which this market reacted and anticipated the debt crisis.

I. Introduction

           The recent international debt crisis has generated renewed interest

in the study of the determinants of default country risk premia. A number of

papers have recently investigated, both theoretically and empirically, issues

related to the pricing of developing countries' foreign debt and to optimal

borrowing and lending strategies in international financial markets. In most

theoretical models sovereign borrowers face, up to a certain limit, an upward

sloping sipply curve of foreign funds. This upward-sloping portion of the

supply   curve reflects the fact that as the level of the debt increases, the
perceived probability of default (or rescheduling) also rises. 1/
          Most recent empirical studies on creditworthiness and country risk

have   dealt with the international bank   loan   market, and have ignored the bond

market in their effort to analyze the process of determination of default risk

prernia. For example, in Herring's (1983) volume on risk in international

markets the word "bond" is not listed in the subject index. On the other

hand, only one paper in Smith and Cuddington's (1985) recent volume addresses

the difference between the international bank loan and bond markets. AlSO,

most studies on debt rescheduling and on the determinants of risk spreads have

concentrated exclusively on the bank loan market. 2/

          Although the international bank loan market has been significantly

more important, both in terms of coverage and volume, than the bond market, by

ignoring the latter in empirical analyses researchers may be omitting an

important source of information. In fact, some authors have pointed out that

the international bond and bank loan markets are significantly different both
                                      —2—




from economic and institutional points of view. 3/ It has even been argued

that whereas interest rates charged in the bank loan market do not reflect the

true risk associated with lending to the developing countries, yields on LDC

bonds do in fact capture this risk [Folkerts—Landau (1985)]. In the present

paper, data on spreads on bank loans to LDC5 and on yields on LDC bonds are

used to analyze the behavior of these two markets.

         The purpose of the present paper is threefold. First, data on a

large number of developing debtor countries are used to compare the pricing of

bank loans and bonds in international financial markets. Data on Eurocurrency

loans granted to 26 developing countries between 1976 and 1980, and on bonds

issued by 13 developing countries during the same period are used to analyze

the determination of the default risk premium. The second objective of the

paper is to test some of the implications of the more recent models of foreign

borrowing and country risk. In particular, the propositions that the default

risk premium is a positive function of the level of debt and a negative

function of the level of investment are tested. LI]   And third, data on yields

on Mexican and Brazilian bonds in the secondary market between 1980 and 1985

are used to analyze the way in which this market anticipated and reacted to

the debt crisis.

         The paper is organized in the following form: Section II briefly

discusses some of the more important economic and institutional differences

between the bank loan and bond. markets. In Section III data on spreads on

bank loans granted to 26 developing countries between 1976 and 1980 and on

initial offering yields on 167 bonds floated by 13 developing countries

between 1976 and 1980 are used to analyze the process of risk pricing in these

markets. In this section the results obtained from the bank loans data set
                                         —3—




and from the bonds data set are formally compared. In Section IV monthly data

on yields on Mexican and Brazilian bonds in the secondary market for the

period 1980—85 are used to analyze the market reaction to the debt crisis.

Finally, in Section V sane concluding remarks are offered.



II. The International Bond Market and the International Bank Loan Market

         During the nineteenth century and early twentieth century the public

floatatlon of bonds was the most important form that developing countries had

of obtaining international financing. In order to induce investors to hold

these bonds, their yields were quite high, reflecting the market's perceived

probability of default. In fact, during this period many countries actually

defaulted on their bonds. 5/ On the other hand, during the 1970s and 198Os, the

role of the bond market has been greatly reduced. International borrowing by

developing countries has been largely dominated by bank loans, the majority of

which have been granted by bank syndicates. Also, during this period outright

defaults have   been   replaced by multilateral reschedulings. In spite of the

reduced importance of the bond market in modern times, a number of developing

countries have been able to float bonds. Between 1978 and 19814, for example,

50 developing countries issued bonds for an equivalent of approximately US27

billion. Even though this amount represents no more than ten percent of new

bank lending during the same period, it is still quite substantial in absolute

terms.

         Some authors have pointed out that the international bank loan and

bond markets are significantly different both from institutional and economic

perspectives. In particular, it has even been argued that while interest

rates charged in the bank loan market do not reflect the true risk associated
with lending to the developing countries, yields on LDCs' bonds do in fact

capture this risk [Folkerts—Landau (1985)]. In this section some of the more

important differences between the international bank loan and bond markets

will be briefly discussed. In the next section data on spreads on bank

Euroloans and on LDCs' bonds will be used to empirically analyze the extent to

which the process of determination of the country risk premium differs between

these two markets.

         A first important difference between the international bank loan and

bond markets is that in the former banks form a fairly cohesive group; bond-

holders, on the other hand, are highly dispersed. This cohesion allows banks

to react uniformly to debt repayment problems, and makes the job of monitoring

and enforcing debt contracts much easier. Two fairly recent institutional

developments have enhanced banks' ability to form a cohesive group. Ftrst,

the fact that most international bank loans are made by syndicates implies

that fairly large groups of banks establish a partner-type relationship at

early stages of the lending process. Second, as a result of cross default

clauses, when a bank (or syndicate) gets in trouble because of a borrower's

default, all other banks that have loans outstanding with that country will

also be affected by the crisis. 6/

         Banks' cohesive behavior gives them an additional advantage to impose

sanctions on those countries that default, or threaten to default. In fact,

banks' ability to act cohesively has allowed them to enter into efficient

negotiations processes with troubled debtor countries, and to reschedule most

of their debt. Bondholders, on the other hand, usually are too dispersed to

agree with each other on how to handle a debt crisis. 7/ Sachs and Cohen

(1982) have actually argued that whereas bank lending is implicitly lending
                                         —5—



with an option to renegotiate, bond lending excludes the possibility of re-

scheduling. Consequently, in their model bond lending is more risky ——        that
is, for the same amount of debt, country risk premia are higher on bonds than

on bank loans. 8/

           There are other, perhaps more important, reasons why the level of

risk involved in international bank lending might be lower than that implicit

in bond lending. During the last twenty years or so monetary authorities,

both in developed and developing countries, have increasingly guaranteed bank

deposits and loans. In fact, nowadays bank deposits and loans are, in most

countries, implicitly or explicity insured; in a way Central Banks have agreed

to become lenders of last resort. Consequently, it has been argued by McKinnon

(19814) and Folkerts-Landau (1985) among others, that the moral hazard factor

has become increasingly important in bank lending. According to this view,

risk premia charged on bank loans do not reflect the real risk involved in

these operations (see also Gutentag and Herring [1985a]). The bond market, on

the other hand, has not been affected by this broadening implicit insurance

scheme. Folkerts—Landau (1985) has argued that whereas bank loan spreads

reflect the probability of recheduling, bond spreads reflect the probability

of default.

           Another   important difference between the bank   loan and bond markets

is that, while there are no secondary markets for bank loans, there is a

fairly active secondary market for developing countries' bonds. In fact, the

existence of this secondary market can be exploited to advantage in empirical

studies of the country risk issue. For example, the behavior of bond yields

in   the secondary market can provide important information on the extent to
which, after the debt crisis, the value of LDCs debt has been discounted by
                                     —6—



the international financial community. 9/ This is done, for example, in

Section IV of this paper.

         According to Eaton and Gersovitz (1981b) and Gersovitz (1985), it is

not clear whether there is more risk involved in international bank lending

than in bond lending. They recognize that banks behave in a more cohesive way

than bondholders, and that consequently have a clear advantage to impose

sanctions. On the other hand, they argue that the non—cohesive behavior of

bondholders forces countries to give them a "generous treatment relative to

banks" (Gersovitz, 1985). The reason for this is that if'   payments on bond
debt are suspended, bondholders have no alternative to calling a default. In

fact, almost every country that has recently run into debt difficulties has

tried to continue paying interest and amortizing their publicly sold bonds.

Even though legally there are rio debt seniority provisions in international

lending, the tradition is that, as in the case of domestic lending, bond-

holders have precedence. 10/ Banks, on the other hand, can actually postpone

the declaration of default while they negotiate with the debtor country the

conditions under which the existing debt can be restructured. Eaton and

Gersovitz (1981b) have further argued that, since public bonds are usually

sold by prospectus, in the bond market there is more information regarding the

level and conditions of foreign debt than in the bank loan market.

         In sum, there are a number of economic, legal and institutional dis-

tinctions between the international bank loan and bond markets. In general,

the majority of authors seem to be in agreement that there is a somewhat

greater risk involved in bond lending. As a result of the implicit or ex-

plicit central bank guarantees on bank deposits and loans, spreads on these

loans would not reflect the real default country risk involved. On the other
hand, according to this view, spreads on bonds would reflect in a more

accurate way this risk. If this is the case, it is expected that spreads on

bank loans and spreads on bonds will in fact be determined in a different way,

with the latter being more sensitive to those variables that, according to the

theory, affect the level of country risk. In Sections III and IV of this

paper this issue is investigated empirically.



III. The International Bank Loan Market, the Bond Market and Default

      Country Risk: 1976-80

            In this section data on over 900 Eurocurrency bank loans granted to

LDCs between 1976 and 1980, and on 167 bonds issued by LDCs during this period

are used to investigate the process by which the bank loans and bond markets

determine the default country risk premium. 11/ In particular, it is tested if,

as numerous models on foreign borrowing have suggested [i.e., Hanson (19714),

Eaton and Gersovitz (1981a,b), Sachs (1982, 19814), Sachs and Cohen (1982),

Edwards (1983)], the level of the country risk premium increases with the

level of foreign indebtedness (i.e., the debt GNP ratio). Also, other

implications of some theoretical models are tested, including the negative

relationship between the investment—GNP and international reserves—GNP ratios

and the country risk premium. In this section the results obtained from the

bank loans and bond regressions are formally compared in order to assess

whether these two markets price risk in a different way.

            In the case of a developing country that cannot affect the world rate

of interest, the cost. of foreign funds obtained from abroad is formed by two

elements:     (1) "the" (exogenously given) risk—free world interest rate (i*);

and (2) a country—risk premium (s) related to the probability of default or
                                               —8—




rescheduling. Suppose that this probability of default, as perceived by the

lender (p), depends positively on the debt-output ratio D, and negatively on

other variables, like the investment-GNP ratio. In order to simplify the

discussion, consider the case of a one—period loan, where in case of default

the lender (i.e., foreign bank or bondholder) will completely lose the

interest and the principal. In this case the equilibrium condition for a

risk-neutral lender will be given by:


            (i—p)   [i÷(i*i.s)j   = (ii-i).                                     (1)

From here, this country's risk premium can be written as:


                                                                                (2)



where k =   (1+1*).   12/ If, alternatively, it is assumed that when default occurs

only a fraction       of interest and principal is lost, equation (2) should be

replaced by s =       [(l—)p/(l    —
                                       (1—c)p)]k.    13/

          Since the probability of default p is assumed to depend positively on

the debt-output ratio D, according to equation (2) the country in question

will face an upward—sloping supply curve for foreign funds (i.e., s/D > 0).

Moreover, when the probability of default approaches unity, the country risk

premium s will approach infinity. This means that developing countries will

face an upward-sloping supply curve of foreign funds up to a certain point,

and that when the probability of default gets very close to unity, a credit

ceiling will be reached. At that point, the country in question will be

completely excluded from the world's credit markets [Eaton and Gersovitz

(1981),   Sachs   (1982,   19811), Sachs and Cohen (1982), Kharas   (19811)].
                                            —9--




         With respect to the probability of default, in the empirical analysis

I follow the standard convention and assume that p has a logistic form:


                exp Z.x.
            =                                                                      (3)
                i+exp z.x.


where the xs are the determinants of the probability of default (including

the level of indebtedness) and the s are the corresponding coefficients.

Combining (3) and (2), and adding a random disturbance ,         the   following

equation, which can be estimated using conventional methods, is obtained:


          log s =   log   k +
                                Zx1    +                                           ()4)


         Regarding the determinants of the probability of default (i.e., the

xs in equation (3)) a number of variables suggested by theoretical studies

were considered:

         (1) The debt—output ratio. As has been pointed out above, in most

theoretical models of foreign borrowing the debt—output ratio plays a crucial

role; it is expected that this variable will have a positive coefficient in

the regression analysis [Hanson (1971), Harberger (1980), Sachs (19814), Eaton

and Gersovitz (1981a), Edwards (1983)]. The data for the debt-output ratio

used in this paper refer to public and publicly guaranteed debt and were

obtained from various issues of the World Debt Tables. It should be noted,

however, that a number of previous empirical studies, that have used data on

bank loans spreads, have failed to find this positive effect of the level of

debt on the country risk premium. For example, Feder and Just (1977b) found,

using data for 1973 and 19714,        a very low and insignificant regression

coefficient for the debt—output ratio. Moreover, in their preferred
                                        —10—




regression they dropped this variable from the analysis. Sachs (1981), on the

other hand, obtained a very small (0.0008) and insignificant coefficient for

the debt—output ratio in his cross—section study. Burton and Inoue (1985)

also obtained small and insignificant coefficients for this variable in their

analysis of banks' risk premia. 114/

         (2) Ratio of international reserves to GNP. This indicator measures

the level of international liquidity held by a country, and as suggested in

Edwards (1983), it is expected that its coefficient will be negative.

Gersovitz (1985), however, has recently argued, that under a willingness—to—

pay approach to foreign borrowing, higher international reserves will reduce

creditworthiness and will result in an increase in the country risk premium

(s). This variable was   constructed   from data obtained from the International

Financial Statistics.

         (3) Investment to GNP ratio. This variable captures the country's

perspectives for future growth. As is shown in Sachs and Cohen (1982), Sachs

(1982, 198)4) and in Edwards (1983), it should be negatively related to the

spread; a higher investment ratio enhances creditworthiness. However,

Gersovitz (1985) has recently argued that if borrowers use foreign funds to

undertake risk-reducing investment, they will reduce the cost of the penalty

in case of default. Hence, higher investment ratios will reduce creditworthi—

ness and increase the default country risk premium. Whether this variable

affects positively or negatively the risk premium is, then, an empirical

issue. The data on the investment ratio were obtained from various issues of

the World Tables and the World Development Report.

         )4) Ratio of the current account to GNP. Sachs (1981) has argued

that this variable will be negatively related to the spread. The data on this
                                     —11—




variable were obtained from World Tables and various issues of the World

Development Report.

         (5) Debt service ratio. This indicator, computed as the ratio of

debt service to exports, measures possible liquidity (as opposed to solvency)

probleuis faced by a particular country. It is expected that higher debt

service ratios will reduce the degree of creditworthiness and result in a

higher s (Feder and Just, 1977b). Data on this ratio refer to public and

publicly guaranteed debt and were obtained from various issues of the World

Debt Tables.

         (6) Imports—GNP ratio. This indicator measures the degree of openness

of the country in questi'on. To the extent that, as Frenkel (1983) has post—

lated, more open economies are more vulnerable to foreign shocks, it is

expected that the coefficient of this variable will be positive. This indi-

cator was constructed with data obtained from the International Financial

Statistics.

         (7) Growth of per capita GDP. It has been suggested [Feder and Just

(1977b)] that a higher rate of growth of per capita output will enhance

creditworthiness. Data on this indicator were obtained from the World Tables

and World Development Report.

         (8) Index of real effective exchange rate (REER). Cline (1983) has

recently argued that the inappropriate exchange rate policies followed in a

number of LDCs were one of the most important causes of the debt crisis. In

particular, according to this view the sustained real appreciations of these

countries' currencies played a major role in the process of overborrowing. In

order to analyze whether the real exchange rate behavior indeed affected the

perceived degree of creditworthiness, an index of trade—weighted real
                                            —12-



effective exchange rates for these countries was also included in the

analysis. The data on this index were obtained from           Edwards and   Ng (1985).

           In addition to these variables related to the degree of country risk

of a particular country, variables that summarize the specific characteristics

of bank loans and bond issues --     like    maturity and so on —— were also

incorporated in the respective regressions.



111.1 Country Risk and Bank Loans

           In the   analysis on bank loans that follows, it      is assumed that the

world's   risk-free interest rate i   can     be approximated by   LIBOR.    It is also
assumed that in the bank loans market the default country risk premium s is
given by the spread over LIBOR charged to different countries. The assumption
that the spread over LIBOR captures the probability of         default   has some
problems, since the cost of borrowing        includes additional elements, like fees

and   commissions. Unfortunately there are no      reliable   data on these components
of the cost. 15/ However, during the period considered           in this section

(1976-80),   these additional elements were typically very small compared           to the

interest   cost, and were relatively uniform across loans and countries. This, of
course, has not been the case in the more recent period, where debt
resehedulings have been characterized by very substantial fees and commissions.
           In the regression analysis, data on spreads for 26 countries during
1976—1980 were used. 16/ The spread variable was constructed, in each year, as a
weighted average of spreads actually charged for public and publicly guaranteed
Eurocurrency bank loans, denominated in U.S. dollars, and granted to each
particular country. The weights were given by the value of each loan. The
basic data were obtained from various issues of the World Bank's Borrowing in
International and Capital Markets.
                                             —13—



           Following the traditional convention, of the following type of pooled

regressions were estimated (where n refers to the nth country and t to the t

time period):


            log 5nt =     +       +



where      and     are country—specific and time—specific fixed effects terms,

and - is      an error with the usual characteristics. Note that the time—specific

term       is capturing log k [       = log(1+i)]   from equation (a).   In   order to test

whether the       and     dummies should indeed be included in the regression, F-

statistics for their significance as a group were computed. 17/ In every case it

was found that the null       hypothesis   that each of these effects were zero as a

group was strongly rejected; consequently both               and cz were included in the

estimation. Equation (5) was estimated using both OLS and instrumental

variables techniques. The reason for this is that sane of the country risk

determinants may not be completely exogenous. 18/

           In addition to the country risk variables described above two variables

related to the specific characteristic of bank loans were also included. The

variable "maturity" measures the (weighted) average maturity of bank loans

granted to a particular country. As has been shown by Feder and Ross (1982),

its a priori sign in the regression analysis is ambiguous. The weighted average

of loan maturities was constructed from data reported in Borrowing in

tional Capital Markets.         The variable "loan volume" shows the weighted average

value of   each   bank loan, and was constructed using data obtained from Borrowing

in International Capital Markets. Also, a priori, its sign is ambiguous.

           ifl Table 1 the results obtained from the estimation of equations of the

type of (5) for the case of bank loans are presented. As can be seen these
                                       —14—




results    are quite satisfactory. First, and contrary to most previous results

[i.e., Feder and Just (1977b), Sachs (1981), Burton and Inoue (1985)J, the

coefficient of the debt-output ratio was positive, as expected, and always

significant at conventional levels. Also, the value of the coefficient was

quite robust across specifications; its point estimate ranged from 0.75 to

1.09. These results provide support to most modern theoretical models which

postulate that LDCs face, up to a certain point, an upward-sloping supply curve

of foreign funds.

           The coefficient of the reserves to GNP ratio was in most cases

negative, but it was never significant. This suggests that for these countries

and during this level period the international liquidity held by each country

played no significant role in the process of determination of bank-loan country

risk premia.

           On the other hand, the coefficient of gross investment to ON? was in

all cases negative, as expected. Further, in all the regressions, this

coefficient was significant at conventional levels. These results provide

important support to those   models that postulate that the level of the country
risk premium is   affected by the way in which the borrowed funds are spent. The

absolute  value of the point estimate of this coefficient is quite similar to
that of the debt outpit ratio. In order to test whether these two coefficients
were significantly different in absolute terms, an F—test was computed. The F—

statistic had a value of 0.005, indicating that the null hypothesis that these

coefficients are equal in absolute terms cannot be rejected. This suggests

that, if a country uses all its additional foreign indebtedness to increase

investment, its level of creditworthiness will tend not to change. However, if

some of the additional foreign funds are used to finance consumption, the

perceived probability of default will increase. 19/

         Perhaps   surprisingly, the coefficient of the current account to GNP

ratio, which measures the fraction of investment financed through borrowing from

abroad, was never significant. This contrasts with Sachs' (1981) findings,

where in a cross country analysis (for 1979), this ratio was found to be

significantly negative.

         The coefficient of the debt service ratio was always positive, as

expected, and in three of the regressions significantat conventional levels.

This provides some indication that the determination of the country risk premium

in bank lending has reflected both solvency and liquidity considerations. 20/ The

import/GNP ratio, on the other hand, turned out to be negative in all the

regressions where it was included, and in two of these is was significant at the

10 percent level. The coefficient of growth was always insignificant, as was

that of the real exchange rate index. This provides some evidence indicating

that a real exchange rate overvaluation did not result in higher perceived

probabilities of default. It should   be   recognized, however, that this result is

not conclusive, since only under fairly restrictive assumptions can declines in

REER be interpreted as a movement towards over valuation. 21/ With respect to the

variables that measure the loans' characteristics, the coefficient of the loan

maturity was negative in all cases, and was significant in only one of the

regressions. The coefficient of loan value also had negative coefficients in

every regression; only in one of them was it significant.

        In the equations reported in Table 1 a number of the country—risk

variables turned out to be insignificant. For this reason, and in order to

check the robustness of this results, some regressions that excluded these

variables (but still included the country and time—specific dummies, the loan

value and maturity) were also run. The results obtained clearly support those
                                            —16—



reported in Table 1 and discussed above. For example the reestimation of

equation (5.1) after dropping the insignificant country risk variables yielded

the following result:



     logsnt   = Y        +   + 1.071 (Debt/GNP)        -1.280 (Gross Investment/GNP)
                    fl                                                               nt

                                                F = 214.71

         In sum, the results reported here indicate that the pricing of bank

loans has indeed responded to (some of) the variables suggested by the theory.

In particular these regressions show that the country risk premium Is positively

affected by higher level of indebtedness and higher debt—service ratio, and

negatively affected by higher levels of investment. Given the relatively small

variation that spreads and bank loans exhibited both across countries and over

time during this period, it is somewhat surprising to find that they have in

fact responded to the most important elements pointed out by the theory. In

fact, until very recently some authors had argued that since bank spreads have

varied so little, they could not have reflected the economic determinants of the

country risk premium [Gutentag and Herring (1985), Folkerts-Landau (1985)]. The

results reported here provide some evidence to the contrary.

though the data on bonds yields used in this section are not exactly equivalent

to the data on bank loans spreads used in. Section 111.1, both sets of results

are later compared in order to assess the extent to which these two markets have

behaved differently.

         Since only a small number of developing countries floated bonds in the

1976—80 period, we faced a degrees of freedom problem. For this reason, the

data on bonds' yields were treated somewhat differently than the data on bank

spreads. First, bonds denominated in Us dollars, DM, Yen, and Swiss Francs were

considered. Consequently, currency dummies were incorporated to the

regressions. Second, bonds placed both by the public and private sectors were

included, and an index that distinguishes across borrowers was   introduced   in the

regression analysis. However, only 26 out of the 167 bonds were issued by the

private sector. And third, the yields were not averaged for every year; the

independent variable, then, is the spread on each individual bond.

         Both international (i.e., Eurobonds) and foreign bonds were included,

and a dummy variable (Type) that took the value of 1 for Eurobonds was intro-

duced. The majority of the bonds considered (9i4 out of 167) were, in fact,

foreign bonds. In the regression a distinction was also made as to whether a

particular bond had been publicly or privately issued. The dummy variable

"Issue" took the value of one for publicly floated bonds. Finally, in order to

have a homogeneous data set, floating rate notes were excluded from the

regression analysis. 23/

         The data on LDC bond yields were obtained from various issues of the

World Bank Borrowing in International Capital Markets. Since the World Bank

discontined this publication in 1981, the yields considered here include all the

data available from this particular source. Depending on the currency of
                                              —19—




denomination of each bond, the spreads were constructed as the difference

between their yields        and   the yield of long—term US, German, Swiss or Japanese

government bonds. The data on the developed countries bond yields were obtained

from various issues of the IFS. With respect to the country risk explanatory

variables, exactly the same variables used in the bank loan regressions were

incorporated. Of course, in addition to these country-risk variables, the bond—

specific variables —— such as maturity, type, issue and borrower -— were also

incorporated.

              Equations of the type of (5)    were   estimated for spreads on all the LDC

bonds and for the subset of LDC         foreign   bonds. As in the case of banks, the

regressions were estimated using both an OLS          fixed   effect method and a fixed

effect      instrumental variables procedure. 2L/ In Table 2 the results obtained are
presented. These results are quite interesting. First, as in the case of bank
loans, the coefficient of the debt output ratio is positive, and in most equa-
tions significant at conventional levels. It is interesting to note that the
point    estimate of this coefficient appears to be, in general, slightly higher

for the bonds regressions than for the bank spread regressions of Table 1.

              Another interesting finding relates to the gross investment ratio. As

was    expected,   and as in the case of the bank spreads, this coefficient was

always negative and significant. In the bonds regressions, however, the

absolute valie of the point estimate is significantly smaller than that obtained

in    the   bank loan regressions.      This indicates that increases in the investment

ratio    enhances creditworthiness by significantly more in the bank loan market
than    in the bond market. This finding is in fact indicative that, as suggested

by some authors and discussed in Section II of this paper, bonds and bank loans

are priced in      a   different way.

         A puzzling result relates to the debt service coefficient. Contrary to

what was expected, and to the case of bank loans, this coefficient turned out to

be negative. Moreover, in one of the six equations it was marginally signifi-

cant. The coefficients of imports/ GNP, growth, REER, borrower, type and issue

were in all cases insignificant at conventional levels. The coefficient of

maturity, however, was significantly negative. As in the case of bank loans,

this is somewhat puzzling since it suggests the presence of a negatively sloped

yield curve.

         The results reported in this section, then, further &upport some of the

more important implications of modern models of external borrowing. First,

there is evidence that bond spreads depend postively on the level of

indebtedness of the country. This result is in agreement with the findings

reported in Section 111.1 for bank loans. Second, the results reported in Table

2 also indicate that the perceived degree of country risk is negatively affected

by the level of investment a country undertakes. With the exception of maturity

and the debt service ratio, the other coefficients included in these bond spread

regressions were typically not significant.



111.3 Comparison

         A comparison of the bank and bond spread regressions does suggest that,

as was discussed in Section II of this paper, there are some differences in the

way in which risk is priced in each of these markets. While both spreads are

affected in a significant fashion by the debt—output, debt-service and gross

investment ratios, a casual look at the evidence suggests that bond spreads are

(slightly) more sensitive to increases in the debt output ratio, and that they

are less sensitive to changes in the investment ratio. This latter difference
                                        —22—




was actually quite marked. Also, while the bank spreads regressions suggested a

negative relation between the reserves ratio and the degree of creditworthiness,

the bonds spreads regressions indicate in that market that such relation is

either non-existent or positive. Moreover, as expected, the bank spreads were

positively affected by a higher debt service ratio; the bond regressions,

however, indicate a negative relation between spreads and debt service ratio.

Finally, in both sets of regressions, the coefficient of maturity turned out to

be negative.

          In order to get additional insights on the process of risk pricing in

these two markets, regressions for bonds and bank loans spreads were

simultaneously estimated using jointly generalized least squares (i.e.,

seemingly unrelated regressions). The data set used was slightly smaller, and

excluded bonds issued by the private sector. Tests for the equality, across

equations, of the coefficients of the debt—output ratio, the investment ratio,

the reserves ratio, the debt service ratio and the current account to GNP ratio

were performed. The F—statistics obtained indicate that the null hypothesis of

equality across equations of the debt output coefficient cannot be rejected (F =

0.33).   On the other hand, the hypothesis of equality across equations of the

debt service ratio was strongly rejected (F =    5.79),    as were the hypotheses of

equal coefficients across equations for the investment ratio (F         2.9) and for

the reserves ratio (F =   2.7).   Finally, the equality of the current account

ratio could not be rejected at marginal levels (F =       2.1).
         In general, then, the comparison of the bank and bond spread re-

gressions suggest some differences between the process of risk pricing in these

markets. The more important of these differences relates to the impact of the

investment ratio on the risk premium. While in both markets higher investment
                                         —23—



enhances creditworthiness, this effect is much more important in the bank loans

market. Even though the results reported here are by no means conclusive, they

do indicate that in both markets (some of) the relevant theoretical variables

played an important role in determining the country risk premium.



IV. The Secondary Market for LDC Bonds and the Debt Crisis: 1980-85

            The results presented in the preceding section showed that, during

1976—80, spreads in the international bank loan market and in the bond market

reflected    (some of) the theoretical determinants of the default country risk
premium. However, the data used in that analysis did riot include the debt
crisis    period. In   this section the behavior of country risk premia during and
iediately     after the debt crisis is investigated. Some interesting questions

relate to whether the international financial community anticipated the crisis

and the extent to which the market reflected, after the crisis erupted, the

higher risk involved in LDC lending. Unfortunately these questions cannot be

addressed   with data of the type used   in Section III. After   mid-1982 the vast
majority of these countries     could not float bonds. Also, since that date a

large   proportion of bank loans have reflected "forced lending," where the
spreads   charged -— even   corrected by fees and commissions -- don't necessarily
reflect the implicit riskiness of dealing with these troibled countries.
           However, the change in perception regarding the degree of riskiness of
LDCs debt can be analyzed using data from the secondary market for LDC bonds.

In this section data on yields on Mexican and Brazilian bonds in the secondary

market are used to analyze the characteristics of this market, and its reaction

to changes in the perception of the level of risk. Figure 1 presents monthly

data on the spread between a Mexican government bond and a World Bank comparable

bond and between a Brazilian bond and the same World Bank bond, for the period

October 1980 through March 1985. Since it can be reasonably assumed that World

Bank bonds are quite safe, these spreads can be considered as good proxies for

the default country risk premium. 25/

         Perhaps the most interesting feature of this figure is that, contrary

to bank loan spreads, the bonds' yield spreads 'experienced significant

variations during this period. For both countries it was slightly negative from

October 1980 through mid—1982. It then jumped, reaching peaks of more than 800

basis points for Mexico and 1400 basis points for Brazil. In late 19814 and early

1985 the spreads experienced an important decline for both bonds. Also, this

figure suggests that the market anticipated by only a few weeks -- and only

partially ——   the   Mexican debt crisis of August 20, 1982. As late as July of

1982, the spreads were negative, and not significantly different from the

average for the preceding 18 months. Gutentag and Herring (1985a), however,

have argued that the market anticipated by approximately a full year the

crisis. Clearly, that contention is not reflected in our spreads data presented

in Figure 1.

         It is interesting to see whether the major turning points in these

spreads were in any way related to major economic or political events in these

countries. The first major increase in       the   spreads took place in early August

1982, just prior to Mexico's official announcement that it was facing serious

problems to pay its debt. This August jimp in the spread —— which for Mexico

was equal to 319 basis points —-    took   place only 30 days after Mexico had

obtained a jumbo loan for US$2.5 billion under convenient conditions. The

relative tranqiility observed in the spreadst behavior until July of 1982 is

somewhat puzzling. Between the third quarter of 1981 and June of 1982, the
                                        —26-



international media was plagued by stories that clearly pointed out that both

the Mexican and Brazilian economies were facing serious problems. For example,

between July 1981 and mid—August 1982, the New York Times published twelve

stories that stressed the sharp weakening of Mexico's external position. 26/

During the same period, the New York Times published four stories related to

Brazil's external sector. A possible interpretation for the apparent normal

behavior of the spreads, is that until July of 1982 most analysts —- and the

market ——   believed   that these countries were going through temporary cash flow

problems, but that their solvency was not seriously at stake. 27/

            During September of 1982, new negative developments affected the

Mexican economy. On September 1, President Lopez Portillo nationalized the

banks; on September 7, the government announced that all principal payments of

the foreign debt would be suspended until the end of 198g. On the positive

side, the IMF announced that it expected to have a US$5 billion package for

Mexico by late 1980. The market reacted to this news by further discounting the

value of Mexico's debt: in October of 1982, the spread reached 612 basis points.

            Interestingly enough, between July and October of 1982 no major

negative events affected the Brazilian economy. In spite of this, between July

and October, the Brazilian spread increased by 418 basis points. There is

little doubt that the market was reacting to the Mexican and Argentinian

situations, and was in fact anticipating Brazil's formal acknowledgement that it

was also in serious trouble, and that it could not make payments on its           debt.
Between October of 1982 and April of 1983, while the Mexican spread continued to

climb, the Brazilian spread stabilized around 280—300 basis points. The fact

that Brazil reached an early agreement -—      in   February of 1983 -—   with   its

creditors, was reflected in the relatively lower and stable spread on its bonds.
                                       —27—



         Clearly, at least until December of 1982, the behavior of the Mexican

spread reflected the chaotic situation that characterized the last few months of

the Lopez Portillo administration. In December of that. year, President de la

Madrid was sworn in, and strict austerity measures were announced. On December

22, the IMF gave final approval to a Us$14 billion loan to Mexico. Between

December 1982 and April of 1983, the Mexican government continued to negotiate

with banks, and to implement corrective measures. In May 1983, the IMF

announced that Mexico's economic performance during the first quarter was in

line with the agreement with the Fund. In that month the Mexican spread

experienced, for the first time in 10 months, a significant decline: 152 basis

points. For the next 13 months the Mexican spread continued to decline, as the

economy's conditions improved significantly. On August 27, 1983, an agreement

to reschedule Mexico's debt was signed. After further reductions, in June of

19814, the spread reached its lowest value since mid—1982. In July 19814 the

spread began to climb once again. A possible explanation for this is that

during the second half of 1982 the market was unsure whether the Mexican

government was also going to reschedule its bond debt. In late 19814, however,

it was officially announced that neither bonds nor debt to international

agencies would be rescheduled and the spread, once again, declined.

         Throughout this period —-   April   1983 to June 19814 —-   the   Brazilian

authorities continued to make some progress in further negotiations with the IMF

and with banks. In July of 1983, a new agreement with the IMF was reached, and

the disbursement of the Us$5.14 billion standby loan continued. At the same

time, the political system was going through important reforms, as Brazil got

ready for the first civilian president in 20 years. Between April 1983 and May

19814, the Brazilian spread was remarkably stable, averaging 285 basis points.
                                          —28—



Between May 1984 and January 1985 —-      the month when the new president was
supposed to be chosen --    the   Brazilian spread experienced a steep increase,

climbing by more than 490 basis points. The behavior of the spread during this

period reflected, basically, political uncertainty. These months were

characterized by political turmoil, as the issue of whether the next president

should be elected by direct popular vote was actively -— and sometimes

violently -—   discussed.   On January 15, 1985, Tancredo eves was elected,

without major incident, as the first civilian Brazilian president in more than

20 years. That month the government reported that it had made important

progress in negotiations to reshedule US$50 billion of its debt. During March

and April, the Brazilian spread dropped dramatically to its June 1982—June 1984

levels.

          In order to formally analyze the behavior of the risk premium in the

bond secondary market, a regression analysis using data on the Mexican bond

spreads was undertaken. Due to some data deficiency, the Brazilian spreads were

not scrutinized as closely. A problem with this analysis, however, is that

there are no monthly data on total debt, total debt service, or GNP for

Mexico. For this reason, in this regression analysis it is not possible to ise

the same independent variables as in Section lIlt; a number of proxies were

used. The ratio of the financial system long-term foreign debt relative to

exports was used as a proxy of the debt output ratio. 28/ The international

reserves to imports ratio was used as a proxy for the reserves output ratio.

Also, the balance of trade, the annual rate of growth in manufacturing

production, the index of the effective real exchange rate and the price of

Mexican oil were included in the regression. 29/ In the specification used the

spread was the dependent variable and the spread lagged one period was included

as an explanatory variable; all independent variables were lagged one month. 30/
                                           —29--




         The following results were obtained from the estimation of the time

series of the Mexican bonds spreads in the secondary market.



     spread = —6.6141 + 0.820(Debt/Export) — 0.768(Reserves/Imports)
             (—1.623) (2.807)              (—3.6314)


                 +    0.0005(B of Trade) — 9.2811(Growth Manuf. Prod.)
                     (1.233)             (—1.695)


                 +    0.062(Real Effective Exchange Rate) + 0.187(Price Mexican Oil)
                     (1   .429)                              (1 .801)


                 +
                      0.653(Spread)1                  2 09514
                     (8.290)                          DW =   2,079



         These estimates are quite interesting. First, as expected, the
coefficient of the debt—export ratio was positive and significant at conven-

tional levels. This result is in agreement with those obtained th Section III,

and indicates that the secondary market takes into account se of the economic

variables suggested by the theory when pricing LDCs' bonds. Also, as expected,

the coefficient of the reserves—imports ratio was negativeand significant.

With the exception of the price of oil all other explanatory variables were

insignificant.

         These results were obtained using the actual values of the explanatory

variables. However, modern theories of financial markets' behavior have

suggested that expectations play a crucial role and that asset prices react to

unanticipated changes of the relevant variables. In order to anlayze the extent

to which this has been the case for Mexican bonds, this equation was also

estimated using proxies for the unexpected changes of all the right—hand side
                                     —30-




variables. Interestingly enough the results obtained when "surprises" of the

right-hand side variables were used basically confirm those reported above. 31/



V. Concluding Remarks

         In this paper several aspects of LDCs' foreign borrowing and country

risk have been investigated. The empirical analysis looked at the process of

determination of country risk premia both in the bank loan and bond markets, and

compared the way in which LDCs' debt is priced in these two markets. These two

markets have important differences both from economic and institutional

perspectives. Some authors (e.g., Folkerts—Landau, (1985)) have even argued

that, whereas interest rates charged by banks do not reflect the true risk

associated with lending to the LDCs, yields on developing countries' bonds do in

fact capture this risk.

         The main findings of this analysis can be summarized as follows.

First, it was found that, both in the bond and bank loan markets, the country

risk premium has been a positive function of the debt output ratio and a

negative function of the investment GNP ratio. This corresponds to what most

modern models of foreign borrowing have suggested, and contradicts findings

reported in previous studies [i.e., Feder and Just (1977b), Sachs (1981) and

Burton and Inoue (1985fl, where, using spreads on bank loans and different data

sets, this coefficient was not significant. In the bank loan regressions it was

also found that other variables, like the reserves to GNP ratio and the current

account ratio, had the expected sign but were typically non—significant; the

debt service ratio was, however, marginally significant.

         Second, a comparison of the bank and bond regressions indicates that,

as argued by some authors, there are some differences in the process of
                                      -31—




determination of country risk premia in these two markets. These differences

are reflected by the fact that in the regressioas some of the coefficients are

significantly different across markets. However, the coefficient of the debt

output ratio is the only coefficient not significantly different across these

two regressions.

         Third, using data on yields on Mexican and Brazilian bonds in the

secondary market, it was found that the international financial market had only

anticipated by a few weeks —- and only partially --   the   Mexican crisis of August

20, 1982. These data also show that after the debt crisis, the market dis-

counted quite heavily the Brazilian and Mexican debt. A regression analysis

performed using time series of monthly spreads of Mexican bonds in the secondary

niarket confirm the results obtained in the preceding sections, in the sense that

the country risk premium had responded to some of the variables suggested by the

theory. Also, this analysis indicates that changes in the Mexican country risk

premium responded to unanticipated changes (or surprises) of the relevant

exogenous variables.

      situations through different organizations, including the Foreign

      Bondholders Protective Council and the Council of Foreign Bondholders.

      Historically, however, different bondholder groups have many times engaged
                                         —33—



    in internal discussions and have negotiated separately (Wynne 1951). Also,

    in actual debt crisis situations, bondholders and banks have usually

    disagreed sharply on how to face the problem. Perhaps the most recent and

    extreme case is that of Costa Rica in 1980 where the bondholders,

    represented by the Banque Nationale de Paris, and the banks, led by the Bank

    of America, entered into a serious conflict. On the Costa Rica case see,

    for example, Suratgar (19814).

8/ In Sachs and Cohen (1982) bond borrowing is also characterized by a lower

    ceiling. Even though traditionally bonds have not been included in debt re—

    schedulings, there is at least one recent case where this has happened. In

    1980 ADELA   --   a small Latin American development financing agency ——

    rescheduled a US$25 million floating notes issue.

9/ See, for example, Kyle and Sachs (19814). Recently, however, a very limited

    secondary market for LDCs' bank loans has developed.

10/ See Suratgar (19814).

11/ Basically, there are two possible strategies that can be followed in order

    to motivate the empirical analysis reported below. First, a model of

    borrowing and foreign debt pricing can be explicitly derived. Second, the

   more important implications of existing models can be tested. In this paper

    I have decided to follow the second route, since it    allows   a more general

    type of analysis. This     approach also has the advantage of   allowing testing

   of the relative merits of alternative models. However, in a previous paper

    (Edwards, 1983) I followed the first strategy and formally derived a model

   of foreign borrowing and debt pricing.

12/ If, however, a risk averse lender is assumed, equation (2) will contain some

   additional terms. See Gutentag and Herring (1985b).
                                     _314_




13/ For an alternative way of deriving an equation similar to (2) in the context
   of monopolistic banks, see Feder and Just (1977b).

114/ See, however, Edwards (1984).

15/ The papers by Feder and Just (197Th), Sachs (1981) and Edwards (19814) have

   also excluded fees and commissions. Mills and Terell (19814) have found that

    fees and commissions have been equivalent, on average, to 214 basis points.

16/ In my 198'4 article, I used data for only 19 countries. Also, in that study

   a different estimation technique was used. The countries considered in the

   present study are: Algeria, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia,

    Costa Rica, Ecuador, Greece, India, Indonesia, Ivory Coast, Jordan, Korea,

   Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, Panama, Philippines, Portugal, Spain, Thailand,

   Tunisia, Uruguay, Venezuela and Yugoslavia. Not all these countries had

   data for every year. The data are available on request. It is important to

   notice that, contrary to the more recent period, during 1976—80 spreads over

    LIBOR experienced a nontrivial variation across countries in any particular

   year.

17/ This, of course, is a standard procedure. See Judge et. al. (1980).

18/ The following instruments were used: constant, lagged debt-output ratio,

   lagged reserves-GNP ratio, lagged and current current account ratio,

   imports—GNP ratio, loan maturity, growth investment ratio, exports, debt

   service ratio, real effective exchange rate index and growth.

19/ This statement has to be qualified in an important way. To the extent that

   the debt—service ratio plays a role in the determination of the risk

   premium, even if all of the newly borrowed funds are used for investment,

   the spread will increase. The results reported in Table 1 indeed suggest

   that the debt—service ratio has played some role in the process of

   determination of the risk premium.
                                       —35—




20/ SInce the debt ratio is computed relative to GNP and the debt service ratio

    relative to exports, both point estimates cannot be directly compared.

21/ These assumptions are: 1) the equilibrium real exchange rate is constant in

    every country, and 2) the equilibrium real exchange rate is the same across

    countries for the period under study. These assumptions are, of course,

    very restrictive.

22/ The countries included in this section are: Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador,

    Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Panama, Philippines, Spain, Thailand,

    Venezuela, and Yugoslavia. This is a subset of the countries included in

    the bank loan spreads analysis.

23/ Only a relatively smaller number of floating rate bonds were issued by the

    developing countries during this period. Most of the bonds considered in

    this study were straight bonds. A potential problem with these data is that

    the   different bonds may have different call provisions. Unfortunately it is
    not   possible to find data on these provisions from standard sources like the

   World Bank or AGEFI.

214/ As before, F—statistics were computed to test whether the time specific and

    country specific fixed effect dummies shoud be included in the regression.

   The null hypothesis that the country dummies are jointly zero cannot be

   rejected. However, the hypothesis that all the year dummies are zero is

   rejected. As a result, these regressions included       and excluded

25/ These data refer to yields on US dollar denominated bonds of comparable

   maturities. For 1982 through 1985 the data were taken from Folkerts—Landau

    (1985). For 1980—1981 the data were directly obtained from the

   International Herald Tribune, which is the source used by Folkers—Landau.

   The same bonds were followed through time. The following bonds were used:
                                        —36—



    World Bank, 10 1/4, June 1987; Mexico, 8 1/4, March 1987; Brazil, 8 i/it,

    Decenber 1987. For all cases, except December 1981 and January 1985, the

    yields refer to the first Monday of each month. For January 1985 and

    December 19814, the second Monday was used. Kyle and Sachs (1985) also used

    yields differentials with respect to World Bank notes to illustrate the

    change in the valuation of the LDCs debt. Gutentag and Herring (1985)

    looked at the spread over LIBOR on Nafinsa floating rate notes.

26/ These stories included the Alfa group announcement that it could not pay its

    foreign debt (10 May 1982), Minister Silva Herzog's forecast of zero growth

    for 1982 (13 May 1982), and Mexico's request for an IMF team to visit the

    country (17 August 1982).

27/ This interpretation is somewhat consistent with the result of Section III,

    where it was found that liquidity considerations played no major role in the

    determination of risk premia in the bond market.

28/ This variable has also been used by Melvin and Schiagenhauff (1986). These

    data were obtained from the IFS.

29/ Since Mexico is not a member of OPEC, the actual price obtained for Mexico's

    "isthmus" quality oil was used. Unfortunately the time series for this

    price start only in January 1981.

30/ Note that in this regression the role of political events has not been

    incorporated formally. The reason for this is that it is not easy to

    construct a "political instability" index. However, an analysis of the

   residuals of this equation confirms the hypothesis that political

    developments affected in a nontrivial way the pricing of Mexican bonds in

    the   secondary market.
