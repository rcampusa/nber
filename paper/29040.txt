Biden, COVID and Mental Health in America

NBER Working Paper No. 29040

JEL No. I1,I3

                                           ABSTRACT

Using US Census Household Pulse Survey data for the period April 2020 to June 2021 we track
the evolution of the mental health of nearly 2.3 million Americans during the COVID pandemic.
We find anxiety, depression and worry peaked in November 2020, coinciding with the
Presidential election. The taking of prescription drugs for mental health conditions peaked two
weeks later in December 2020. Mental health improved subsequently such that by April 2021 it
was better than it had been a year previously. The probability of having been diagnosed with
COVID did not rise significantly in the first half of 2021 but COVID infection rates were higher
among the young than the old. COVID diagnoses were significantly lower in States that had
voted for Biden in the Presidential Election. The probability of vaccination rose with age, was
considerably higher in Biden states, and rose precipitously over the period among the young and
old. Anxiety was higher among people in Biden states, whether they had been diagnosed or not,
and whether they were vaccinated or not. The association between anxiety and depression and
having had COVID was not significant in Biden or Trump states but being vaccinated was
associated with lower anxiety and depression, with the effect being larger in Biden states. Whilst
being in paid work was associated with lower anxiety, worry and depression and was associated
with higher vaccination rates, it also increased the probability of having had COVID.

1. Introduction
When it broke, the COVID pandemic had a sudden, unprecedented impact on the United States
and its economy. The moment the shock occurred is traced in Chart 1 which plots Google Trends
data showing the use of the term `covid' in the United States from March 2020-June 2021.
Numbers represent search interest relative to the highest point on the chart for the given region
and time. A value of 100 is the peak popularity for the term. A value of 50 means that the term is
half as popular. A score of 0 means there was not enough data for this term. The use of the term
exploded upwards from the start of March 2020 reaching an early peak of 95 on 22nd March 2020
before falling back. It reached a global maximum (1st November 2020=100) just before the
presidential election in November 2020.

A more conventional way to measure an economic shock is with unemployment figures.
According to the Department of Labor initial weekly claims for unemployment assistance (NSA)
in the United States averaged just under 250,000 a week through 14th March 2020 and then
exploded to 2.9 million on 21st March 2020 and 6 million on 28th March 2020. 1 The latest release
has initial claims at 407,798 on 12th June 2021, still higher than pre-pandemic. The official US
unemployment rate reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) went from 3.5% in February
2020 to 4.4% in March to 14.7% in April. That turned out to be an underestimate because the
systems were not set up to deal with a shock that was also a major health shock. The true number
for April 2020 was actually 19.7% once account was taken of the number of workers who were
classified as employed but absent from work. 2 The undercount has continued since then and in
the most recent data the unemployment rate is understated by 0.2 percentage points due to this
misclassification problem. The labor market continues to struggle. In the most recent data for June
2021, BLS data show non-farm payrolls stood at 145,759,000 - still 6.8 million below their
February 2020 peak.

This economic shock occurred in response to policy efforts to contain the COVID-19 virus by
going into lockdown in March 2020. On March 16, President Trump announced "15 Days to Slow
the Spread" - a series of guidelines based on Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
recommendations on topics such as physical distancing, self-isolation, and protecting those at high
risk. By March 21st, 2020, state governors in California, New York, Connecticut and Illinois
issued stay-at home orders. By the end of March many other governors had done the same.

The spread of disease through large pandemics, and the deaths that come with it, are often
associated with fear (Amsalem et al., 2020) which, when compounded by restrictions on

  Special instructions were sent to household survey interviewers to ensure that all employed persons absent from
work due to coronavirus-related business closures were to be classified as unemployed on temporary layoff. However,
it is apparent that not all such workers were so classified. "If the workers who were recorded as employed but absent
from work due to `other reasons' (over and above the number absent for other reasons in a typical April) had been
classified as unemployed on temporary layoff, the overall unemployment rate would have been almost 5 percentage
points higher than reported (on a not seasonally adjusted basis). However, according to usual practice, the data from
the household survey are accepted as recorded. To maintain data integrity, no ad hoc actions are taken to reclassify
survey responses". See Employment Situation, May 8th, 2020.

movement, social interaction and economic activity leading to further deteriorations in mental
health (Berkowitz et al., 2020). The United States does not have a long-run series on well-being
but the United Kingdom does. Since 2011 it has included four well-being measures in its Labor
Force Survey - which is used to calculate the unemployment rate and is the equivalent of the
Current Population Survey in the United States. They relate to life satisfaction, happiness,
worthwhileness and the one we examine here, anxiety. Respondents are asked:

Q1. "On a scale where 0 is "not at all anxious" and 10 is "completely anxious", overall, how
anxious did you feel yesterday. 3

As shown below there was a decline in the level of anxiety over time; averaging the quarterly
estimates we see anxiety declined from a mean of 3.15 in 2011 to 2.96 in 2013 and averaged 2.91
from 2013 to 2019.

2011            3.16
2012            3.05
2013            2.96
2014            2.90
2015            2.86
2016            2.90
2017            2.92
2018            2.86
2019            2.95
2019Q4          2.97

The UK has also included these questions in 31 weekly surveys conducted since the middle of
March 2020. These data show that as the pandemic hit anxiety rose sharply as is illustrated in
Chart 2. We included an estimate of 2.96 for the first observation (taken from the able above) we
called January 1st to March 1st, 2020, to best illustrate the unprecedented rise in anxiety. The series
made an extraordinary jump to 5.2 for 20-30 March, broadly consistent with what we saw for the
word `Covid' in Chart 1. The other well-being variable saw similar discontinuities. Similar
findings are apparent in the UK's Household Longitudinal Survey (UKHLS), which recorded
marked increases in mean GHQ-12 scores. The survey revealed an increase in the prevalence of
clinically significant levels of mental distress from 19% in 2018/19 to 27% in April 2020, one
month into UK lockdown (Pierce et al., 2020). The rise was greatest among those aged below 34
years and particularly among those aged 18-24 years. 4 These changes in mental health are
unprecedented in both magnitude and speed.

In this paper we contribute to the literature by analyzing US Census Household Pulse Survey data
for the period April 2020 to June 2021 to track the evolution of the mental health of nearly 2.3
million Americans during the COVID pandemic, and its correlates.

2. Mental health in the United States
Even prior to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announcement of the first
COVID case in the United States on January 21st, 2020, the country had already suffered a
prolonged decline in the mental well-being of its citizens.

As Chart 3 makes clear, reported happiness has been in decline since the beginning of the General
Social Survey series in the early 1970s. 5 There was a small decline during the Great Recession
from 2.18 in 2008 to 2.11 in 2014, but happiness recovered quickly. Similarly extreme distress
has been steadily rising since data became available in the early 1990s. 6 This rise is shown for
those under 30 and 30 and older in Chart 4. This has prompted economists to warn of a rising tide
in deaths of despair (Case and Deaton, 2020), especially among those of prime age, the less
educated and natives (Blanchflower and Feir, 2021). The growth in despair among the young is
particularly notable: having been roughly flat in the first decade or so of the 21st Century, rates of
despair rose precipitously among the under-30s from 2014/15, passing the rates of despair
experienced by the over 30s in 2016.

The United States is not unusual in terms of the mental health problems in its population. It is
mid-ranking among OECD countries, slightly above the average for the 11 OECD countries in
Chart 5. Nor is it exceptional in experiencing a substantial deterioration in the mental health of its
younger population. Countries like the UK have experienced similar trends (Sacker et al., 2021;
Gagné, et al., 2021). Like other countries it had to contend with a massive shock to health with
the COVID pandemic.

To date, evidence on trends in mental health in the United States during the COVID pandemic is
limited. Mental Health America (2021) used a screening program to identify mental ill-health.
They found that youth mental health in particular was worsening and even before the incidence of
COVID the prevalence of mental illness among adults was also rising. They reported that 35% of
the people they screened had depression while 20% had anxiety from January-September 2020.
The proportion with moderate to severe anxiety rose from 71% in January to 80% in September
(p. 6). Their findings are broadly consistent with what we report below.

There is evidence from Gallup (Witters and Agrawal, 2021) on a small sample of 4820 adults that
the percentage of people reporting 7 or higher on a life satisfaction scale fell from 67.7% in the
fall of 2019 to a low of 56.9% in April 2020. However, it has risen again subsequently back to
69.0% in June 2021. Analogously the percentage of people experiencing stress rose from 46% in
2019 to a peak of 60% during April 2020. The proportion of people reporting stress has now fallen
back to 44% in June 2021. Worry followed a similar path.

Using a version of some of the data we use below Vahratian et al. (2021) tracked the change in
anxiety and depressive disorders as well as taking prescription medications or receiving

  This is obtained from the question `taken all together, how would you say things are these days--would you say that
you are very happy (=3), pretty happy (=2), or not too happy (=1)?' For further details see Blanchflower and Oswald
(2004).
6
  Here `despair` is measured using data from the BRFSS (https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/index.html), using the question
"Now thinking about your mental health, which includes stress, depression, and problems with emotions, for how many days
during the past 30 days was your mental health not good? Despair is measures as 1 if the answer is 30 last 30 days are bad
mental health days. For details see Blanchflower and Oswald (2020).

counselling between August 19 and February 1st, 2021. They found the increase in the percentage
reporting symptoms on the majority of days rose most quickly among those aged under 30 (the
`young'). They also report an increase in prescription drug taking which peaked in midlife, as
found in Blanchflower and Oswald (2020). Panchal et al. (2021) analysed the KFF Health
Tracking Poll show that other signs of mental health deteriorated over the period including
substance use, particularly among the young.

We extend this literature with data from the Household Pulse Survey, conducted by the US Census,
which began in April 2020 and is ongoing and surveys nearly 2.3 million Americans
(https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/household-pulse-survey/data.html). Currently we
have data from 31 sweeps of the survey that we pooled together.

We show that anxiety, depression and worry peaked in November 2020, coinciding with the
Presidential election. The taking of prescription drugs for mental health conditions peaked two
weeks later in December 2020. Mental health improved subsequently such that by April 2021 it
was better than it had been a year previously. The probability of having COVID was roughly stable
in the first half of 2021 for those aged under 30 (the `young') and over 30s (the `old') but levels
of COVID infection were higher among the young than the old. COVID diagnoses were also
significantly lower in States that had voted for Biden in the Presidential Election.

The probability of vaccination rose with age, was considerably higher in Biden states, and rose
precipitously over the period among the young and old. Anxiety was higher among people in
Biden states, whether they had been diagnosed or not, and whether they were vaccinated or not.
The association between anxiety and depression and having had COVID was not significant in
Biden or Trump states but being vaccinated was associated with lower anxiety and depression,
with the effect being larger in Biden states. Whilst being in paid work was associated with lower
anxiety, worry and depression and was associated with higher vaccination rates, it also increased
the probability of having had COVID.

3. Data and Estimation
Our data are the Household Pulse Survey (Covid 19), a 20-minute, online, survey conducted by
the US Census Bureau gathering data for nearly 2.3 million people chosen randomly via residential
addresses on the impact of the pandemic on their lives. 7 It began on April 23rd 2020 and continues
to run. The data we use in this paper ends in June 2021. These are repeat cross-sectional data:
there is no way to link the surveys at the level of the individual respondent over time.

As Vahratian et al (2021) note, there are methodological differences between phase 1 (April 23-
July 21, 2020) and phase 2 (August 19-October 26, 2020) which complicate examination of trends
across the two phases. These differences, they note, include a change in the data collection period
from 6 days to 13 days, additional reminders sent to nonrespondents in phase 2, and elimination
of a longitudinal component that was present in phase 1. We deal with this by including in all our
regressions data of interview controls.

Respondents are asked to provide information on:

                                                        4
Q1. How often they have been feeling anxious/depressed/worried over the last seven days? 8

Weighted responses are reported in Table 1 and suggest that by 2021 mental health had improved
on all three measures. In 2020 almost one-third (31.4%) of respondents said they were feeling
anxious most of the time, compared with one-fifth (21.6%) who said they were depressed most of
the time, and over one-quarter (25.2%) who were worried most of the time. Mental health
improved in 2021, with the percent feeling bad most of the time falling on all three metrics (29.5%
were anxious most of the time; 20.6% were depressed most of the time; and 23.1% were worried
most of the time). In Section Three we model these ordinal outcomes as if they were measured on
cardinal scales using OLS. 9

Since sweep 13 of the survey in August 2020, respondents have also been asked

Q2. "At any time in the last 4 weeks, did you take prescription medication to help you with any
emotions or with your concentration, behavior or mental health?"

We have data on 1,255,987 respondents and 20.8% percent answered `yes' to this question. 10 We
examine trends in prescription drug taking in Section Three running linear estimation on this (0,1)
outcome.

To establish the incidence of COVID infection we rely on the yes/no response to the question
asked in 2021 but not in 2020.

Q2. "Has a doctor or other health care provider ever told you that you have COVID-19?"

This has been asked since sweep for January 6th-18th 2021and we have 740,710 respondents of
whom 14.1% percent answered `yes' to this question. 11

To identify those who have received, or are about to receive the vaccine, we combine responses to
the two questions

Q3. "Have you received a COVID-19 vaccine?"

and

Q4. "Did you receive (or do you plan to receive) all required doses?".

Those responding yes to either question are coded 1 on the (0,1) outcome identifying vaccination.
Overall, 44.9% percent of survey respondents were vaccinated or intended to get vaccinated when

  These are based on 3 of the 4 items validated in the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4) for depression and
anxiety. For details of how they were modified for the Pulse survey see Vahratian et al. (2021: 490).

  Results are similar if we run ordered probits.
10
   Weighted means are reported using the weight variable pweight. The regressions are unweighted.
11
   Of course, having the COVID virus is a necessary but not sufficient condition to answering `yes' to this question
since only those who have actually been diagnosed by a doctor or health care provider will say `yes'. This depends,
in part, on the likelihood that respondents will visit a health care provider for such a diagnosis or are sought out by
health care professionals.

surveyed. As we show below there has been a rapid upward rise in this variable over the ten
surveys that asked the question, from 7.7% in week to 78.9% in week 31 (May 26-June 7).

All independent variables used in the analysis are self-explanatory, with the exception, of our
classification of Biden and Trump states. These are based on electoral college votes in 2020. 12

3. Results
Table 2 presents regressions estimating the correlates of our three mental health measures ­
anxiety, depression and worry ­ for the period April 23rd, 2020, through to June 7th, 2021, together
with a model identifying the correlates of prescription drug taking for mental health reasons for a
shorter period over which these data were available (from late August 2020). In all cases we
include controls for age, gender, education, race, state of residence, labor force and marital status
and survey week.

Based on the coefficients on the dates of interview dummies, anxiety, depression and worry were
all rising through most of 2020, peaking in November 2020, coinciding with the Presidential
election on November 20th, 2020. 13 This is telling, given the evidence from previous research that
the electorate tend to vote out incumbent leaders when subjective well-being is deteriorating
(Ward, 2020).

The taking of prescription drugs for mental health conditions peaked two weeks later in December
2020 (column 4). Mental health improved subsequently on all three measures and was still
improving by the end of our series (June 7, 2021) such that, by mid-April 2021, it was significantly
better than it had been in April 2020 just shortly after the outbreak of the pandemic. Mental health
was continuing to improve through to June 7, our last data point. This is also apparent in the raw
data (Chart 6). Prescription drug taking, which was rising during the autumn, peaked at Christmas
2020, then dropped in the new year stabilising in March 2021 above previous levels.

Most of the correlates of mental health during the pandemic are similar to what we might expect
in more `normal' times. For example, Blacks and Asians exhibit poorer mental health than Whites;
the married are happier than those who are not; the less educated have poorer mental health, as do
the unemployed compared to those in paid work. It is also apparent that men are less likely than
women to exhibit poor mental health. 14 But the correlates of poor mental health differ from those
found in `normal' times in one key respect. First, the standard finding in the literature is that well-
being is u-shaped in age (Blanchflower and Graham, forthcoming) and depression and worry are
hump-shaped in age (Blanchflower, 2020:472 Table 5). We would therefore expect poor mental
health to peak in middle-age then recover. Instead, mental health is monotonically improving with
age, a finding that is apparent with respect to anxiety, worry and depression. It would appear that

   See https://www.archives.gov/electoral-college/2020 The Trump states are Alabama; Arizona; Arkansas; Florida;
Georgia; Idaho; Indiana; Iowa; Kansas; Kentucky; Louisiana; Mississippi; Missouri; Montana; Nevada; North
Carolina; North Dakota; Ohio; Oklahoma; South Carolina; South Dakota; Tennessee; Texas; Utah; West Virginia and
Wyoming. The Biden states are Alaska; California; Colorado; Connecticut; Delaware; District of Columbia; Hawaii;
Illinois; Maine; Maryland; Massachusetts; Michigan; Minnesota; Nebraska; New Hampshire; New Jersey; New
Mexico; New York; Oregon; Pennsylvania; Rhode Island; Vermont; Virginia; Washington and Wisconsin.
13
   It is, however, notable that anxiety was falling in May, just as it did in the UK (Charts 2 and 8).
14
   The literature consistently finds that women are both more likely than men to suffer disproportionately from poor
mental health and, at the same time, express greater happiness (Graham and Chattopadhyay, 2020).

                                                         6
the mental health of the young has been particularly adversely affected by the pandemic, consistent
with other studies for the United States and the UK discussed above. It is also notable that there
are substantial differences in mental health across States. As we show below, mental health tends
to be poorer in Biden states. 15

In contrast the age effects on taking prescription drugs peak in midlife at age 40-44. This is
consistent with evidence reported in Blanchflower and Oswald (2016) using Eurobarometer data
for 2010 who found that the taking of anti-depressants in European countries peaked in people's
late forties. We re-estimated this equation for 2020 and 2021 in light of the fact that Vahratian et
al (2021) found that the peak of the function was lower in 2021 than in 2020. Blanchflower and
Graham (forthcoming) find similarly using these data from Week 24, February 3-15, 2021. We did
find in 2020 the peak was at age 45-49 whereas it was at age 40-44 in 2021. There was some
evidence of the function flattening ­ below are the coefficients by age for the two periods compared
to the excluded category 18-19. Each coefficient has a t-value of over 4.5 as is significantly
different than the youngest age group.

Table 3 shows estimates of the probability of having received a diagnosis of COVID by a health
professional (column 1) and the probability of being vaccinated (column 2) in the first half of 2021.
We do not have any data on COVID for 2020. The probability of having had COVID was roughly
stable over time during the first six months of 2021 as the virus spread much less rapidly than it
had previously as an increasing proportion of the population was vaccinated (column 2). Of
course, the rise in COVID infection rates occurred in 2020, prior to our data starting. The very big
increase in the probability of being vaccinated over the period (column 2) reflects the incoming
government's priority to vaccinate citizens on a mass scale along with the increased availability of
the vaccines.

The proportion who said they had received or will take vaccine rose rapidly in 2021 and was fast
approaching President Biden's stated goal of having 70% of the adult population vaccinated by

Workers had higher COVID diagnosis rates than non-workers, despite a higher probability of
being vaccinated, consistent with the possibility that being at work ­ or commuting to it ­ raised
the possibility of infection. Women were more likely than men to have been diagnosed with

  When we replace the State fixed effects with a Biden state dummy the coefficients are as follows: anxiety +.0496
(36.20); depressed +.0089 (8.00); worried +.0094 (7.23); prescribed medication -.0159 (21.54).

COVID, even though they were also more likely to be vaccinated. Similarly, White Hispanics
were more likely to be diagnosed with COVID than other racial groups but, with the exception of
Asians, they were also more likely to be vaccinated.

COVID diagnoses were significantly lower in States that had voted for Biden in the Presidential
Election: living in a Biden state was associated with a 4 percentage-point lower probability of
being diagnosed with COVID. Perhaps surprisingly COVID infection probabilities were highest
among those aged 20-24 years, falling almost monotonically with age after that point. The CDC
has supporting evidence on this showing that at the outset of the pandemic infection rates were
highest among the old, but as time went on the younger age groups overtook them presumably as
the vaccine was given to the older groups. This is reported in Chart 7. The question is why?

Presumably this has to do with availability of the vaccine and testing. Students, including those at
Dartmouth, for example, have been tested frequently. It remains unclear what proportion of the
young infected with COVID were asymptomatic. Finally, in keeping with the literature which
suggests education promotes healthy behaviors, vaccination probabilities rise and COVID
diagnoses fall with educational attainment.

Table 4 splits the analyses presented in Table 3 into separate estimates for the young (under-30s)
and old (30 and over). It confirms little trend in the COVID diagnosis rate for either age group in
2021, but sharp rises in vaccination rates for both groups over time, with the slope slightly greater
for over-30s. The lower probability of being diagnosed with COVID in a Biden State is apparent
for both age groups, as is the higher rate of vaccination in a Biden State, though this is particularly
pronounced among the over-30s. Most of the correlates of being diagnosed with COVID are
similar across age groups, though the lower COVID diagnosis rates among the better educated are
more apparent in the older age group.

Table 5 presents anxiety and depression equations separately for those in Trump and Biden States.
The coefficients on nearly all variables in the models are very similar, as are the trends in anxiety
and depression, as indicated by the similarities in the coefficients on time. However, the
associations between having a COVID diagnosis and mental health are quite different: whereas
having been diagnosed with COVID is not associated with anxiety or depression in Trump States,
it is associated with significantly higher anxiety and depression levels in Biden States. Vaccination
lowers anxiety and depression in both Trump and Biden states, but does so to a significantly greater
extent in Biden states.

Finally, in Table 6 we consider the correlates of anxiety during 2021 for two mutually exclusive
groups, namely those who had received a diagnosis of COVID at some point (column 1) and those
who had not (column 2). The third column considers anxiety for the group who had been
vaccinated, regardless of whether they had received a COVID diagnosis at some point with column
4 for those who had not. What is perhaps striking is that there is very little difference between the
four equations. The models explain roughly 10% of the variance in anxiety in each case and
coefficients on each variable are roughly comparable. For instance, we see that those in Biden
states are significantly more likely to suffer anxiety than those in Trump states, whether they have
been diagnosed with COVID or not, and even when they had received a vaccination.

4. Discussion
According to Mental Health America (2021) "the number of people looking for help with anxiety
and depression has skyrocketed" since the beginning of the COVID pandemic. Between January
and September 2020 315,220 people took their `anxiety screen', an increase of 93% over 2019.
Over half a million (534,784) took the depression screen ­ a 62% increase. The percentage
reporting thoughts of suicide and self-harm is also rising. They say "young people are struggling
most with their mental health".

There are indications though, that anxiety, depression and worry levels are declining once more
(Chart 8 for the UK and Chart 9 for the United States). However, these improvements in well-
being in the United States are more apparent among older people aged 30 and above than they are
among the young aged under 30. Indeed, for the young, anxiety levels in early June 2021 were
similar to those in late April 2020 and remained well above anxiety levels for older people (Chart
9).

The young are the most likely to have been diagnosed with COVID in 2021 and the least likely to
have been vaccinated. This is true whether they live in a state that voted for Trump or Biden in
the Presidential elections. It is notable that all of our mental health measures spiked at the election
date of November 20th, 2020, and then declined.

It is troubling that during this period anxiety, depression and worry are falling with age, something
that we think is specific to this COVID era. This contrasts with the usual finding that unhappiness
is hump-shaped in age (Blanchflower, 2020 and Blanchflower and Graham, 2021a, 2021b). There
is an inverted U-shape in the taking of anti-depressants more likely reflecting long run behavior.
What we are seeing here are short run changes in well-being by the young who seem most impacted
by the onset of the pandemic, lockdown and recession.

Whilst mental health problems have been in decline since they peaked in November 2020, major
concerns remain regarding the impact of the pandemic on mental health and wider prospects,
particularly among the young.

A major concern is that the young are likely to see long-run scarring as a result of the pandemic
which has disrupted their ability to make the transition from school to work. The literature
indicates that spells of unemployment create permanent scarring effects of workers' prospects,
particularly for the young (Bell and Blanchflower, 2011a, 2011b; Ellwood, 1984; Gregg, 2001;
Gregg and Tominey, 2005). The longer the spell the greater the scarring, as unemployment among
the young prevents the young establishing a foothold in the labor market.

Being a member of large cohort also makes it harder to make a successful entry into the world of
work. As Korenman and Neumark (2000) have noted the elasticity of the youth unemployment
rate with respect to relative youth cohort size is positive. Furthermore, cohorts who graduate in
worse national economies tend to end up in lower-level occupations. Giuliano and Spilimbergo
(2009) suggest that the period of early adulthood (between the ages of 18 and 25) seems to be the
age range during which people are more sensitive to macroeconomic conditions. They find that
being exposed to a recession before age 17 or after age 25 has no impact on beliefs about life
chances. However, youngsters growing up during recessions tend to believe that success in life

                                                  9
depends more on luck than on effort; they support more government redistribution but have less
confidence in public institutions. Recessions seem to make youngsters more pessimistic about
their lives.

Moreover, the lockdown may also have an impact on graduates' abilities to make their first step
into the world of work given that Kahn (2010) has shown that there are deleterious consequences
of graduating from college in a bad economy. This is potentially a particular problem given the
number of workers that are furloughed, which are likely to be the first hired as the economy returns
back to normal. Young people are likely to be at the back of the hiring queue, whether they are
high school dropouts or graduates or college graduates.
