Taxes and Mutual Fund Inflows Around Distribution Dates

                                              ABSTRACT

Capital gain distributions by mutual funds generate tax liability for taxable shareholders, thereby reducing
their after-tax returns. Taxable investors who are considering purchasing fund shares around distribution
dates have an incentive to delay their purchase until after the distribution, since this will reduce the
present value of their tax liability. Non-taxable shareholders, such as those who invest through IRAs
and other tax-deferred accounts, face no such incentive for delaying purchase. This paper compares
daily shareholder transactions by taxable and non-taxable investors in the mutual funds of a single
no-load fund complex around distribution dates. Gross inflows to taxable accounts are significantly
lower in the weeks preceding distribution dates than in the weeks following them, but gross inflows
to tax-deferred accounts do not change around these dates. This finding suggests that some taxable
shareholders time their purchase of mutual fund shares to avoid the tax acceleration associated with
distributions. Taxable shareholders who purchase shares just before distribution dates also have shorter
holding periods, on average, than those who buy after a distribution. The cost of the distribution-related
tax acceleration for pre-distribution buyers is therefore somewhat less than that for those who buy
after the distribution.

         How capital income taxes affect financial market equilibrium depends on whether investors alter

their behavior in response to tax incentives. A voluminous literature has examined the impact of dividend

taxes and capital gains taxes on the behavior of common stock investors, with particular emphasis on how

these taxes affect portfolio composition and asset trading decisions. In contrast, even though data from

the Investment Company Institute (2007) suggest that more than 22 million U.S. households – 19 percent

of all households – own mutual funds outside a tax-deferred retirement account, relatively little is known

about how taxes affect the behavior of investors in intermediated investment vehicles such as mutual

funds. Lipper Associates (2007) estimates that in 2006, open end mutual funds distributed $234 billion in

long-term capital gains, $31 billion in short-term gains, and $154 in taxable dividends, thereby generating

at least $24 billion in investor tax liability. Taxes on capital gain distributions accounted for nearly $14

billion of this total.

         Mutual fund investors are taxed under a specialized set of tax rules. All fund shareholders as of a

given date share in a fund distribution in proportion to their fund ownership, regardless of their holding

period or whether the fund’s share price has increased or decreased since their date of purchase. This tax

provision raises the possibility that a fund investor who purchases fund shares just before a taxable

distribution will be liable for capital gains taxes even though the value of her fund shares may have fallen

since her date of purchase. Financial advisors caution taxable investors against buying mutual fund

shares just before distribution dates. This advice is widely reported in the popular press, particularly as

the year-end distribution season approaches.

         Several legislative proposals, for example Saxton (2004), have called for modifying the tax rules

governing mutual fund distributions to allow deferral of the tax liability on distributed gains until the

investor sells her fund shares. Assessing how these proposals would affect investor behavior requires

information on several aspects of the mutual fund market, including the current effect of distribution taxes

on the purchase and sale decisions of fund investors.

         Tax return data leave little doubt that taxable investors report and pay taxes on billions of dollars

in mutual fund distributions, but there have been relatively few studies of how taxes affect the behavior of

mutual fund investors. Barclay, Pearson, and Weisbach (1998) were among the first to focus on capital


                                                                                                                 1
                                                      22


gains “overhang” in open end mutual funds. They found that funds with substantial embedded unrealized

capital gains, which place investors at greatest risk for future capital gain distributions, attract smaller net

inflows than comparable funds without a capital gains overhang. Bergstresser and Poterba (2002)

examined gross inflows and gross outflows from equity mutual funds in an effort to understand whether

investors consider the tax burden on fund returns in making their investment decisions. They found that

open-end funds with high historical tax burdens on taxable shareholders attract smaller inflows than funds

with comparable before-tax return experiences but lower shareholder tax burdens. Ivković and

Weisbenner (2006) analyzed the sale of mutual fund shares and found that fund investors, unlike common

stock investors, harvest losses and defer gains. It is unclear whether this reflects a focus on tax concerns

or an extrapolation of past returns to prospective performance.

        Several studies have suggested that fund managers consider the implications of their asset

management decisions for taxable investors. Plancich (2003) found that that the mix of distributions

shifted toward long-term gains after the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 reduced the tax burden on these

gains relative to short-term gains. Khorana and Servaes (1999) found that fund management companies

responded to the accumulation of capital gains “overhang” in a fund by creating new funds that mimic

existing funds, but lack the embedded capital gains that may discourage taxable investors from buying the

fund’s shares. Christoffersen, Geczy, Musto, and Reed (2005) observed that the investing public displays

substantial tax rate heterogeneity, which complicates the challenge facing managers who try to consider

their investors’ tax burdens.

        This paper investigates the impact of taxes on the timing of mutual fund purchases. We test

whether shareholders follow the advice of financial advisors who warn about the tax consequences of

buying mutual fund shares prior to a distribution date. We exploit a proprietary six-year panel database

that includes all trades within and across all funds in one actively managed no-load mutual fund family.

We compare trades made through tax-deferred accounts, primarily traditional and Roth IRAs, with trades

made through taxable accounts. While we cannot be certain of the marginal tax rate that applies to

distributions received by the funds’ taxable shareholders, we know that distributions paid to tax-deferred

accounts are untaxed. We find that taxable shareholder inflow is 27 percent lower in the four weeks
                                                     33


before a distribution date than afterward, which suggests that at least some taxable shareholders are aware

of impending distributions and time their purchases to reduce their tax impact. By comparison, we find

no evidence of inflow deferral by tax-deferred investors. These findings offer new evidence on the broad

questions of whether and how taxes affect shareholder behavior, as well as on the specific issue of how

the specialized income tax rules for mutual funds affect open-end fund shareholders.

        Although we observe a modest decline in fund inflows just before the distribution date, we still

find many taxable investors purchasing fund shares before distributions. These investors may regard the

potential near-term change in the fund’s net asset value (NAV) as large enough to warrant purchasing the

fund, and the associated tax payment acceleration, before the distribution. While we cannot observe what

investors believe about the NAV, we can measure another aspect of investor heterogeneity: holding

period. We find that fund investors who purchase shares just prior to distribution dates on average

liquidate their accounts sooner than those who purchase just after distribution dates. Because the cost of

tax acceleration is increasing in the investor’s holding period, this finding suggests that pre-distribution

buyers may have a smaller incentive than post-distribution buyers to defer purchase.

        Our study is similar in spirit to Graham and Kumar’s (2006) analysis of how individual investor

characteristics are correlated with trading decisions around ex-dividend days for common stocks. They

found that older and lower income investors are more likely to purchase stocks before ex-dividend days

than afterward, and they suggested that this could potentially be explained by tax considerations. Their

data set, however, did not include any information on investors’ tax circumstances. Our study offers a

more powerful test of how tax status affects trading around the dates of record that determine tax liability.

        Our paper is divided into five sections. The first describes the tax treatment of mutual fund

shareholders and explains how a mutual fund capital gain distribution accelerates capital gains tax

liability. Section two describes the data set that we analyze and presents summary statistics. The third

section presents our findings on the differences between gross inflows before and after fund distributions.

It reports results for both taxable and tax-deferred households; it contrasts patterns before and after the

enactment of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, which altered the marginal tax rates on capital gains.

Section three also presents some tests for turn-of-year effects. The fourth section fits proportional hazard


                                                                                                               3

models for the risk that a shareholder decides to close her account, thereby comparing shareholders who

open accounts prior to distribution dates with those who open accounts afterward. The last section

summarizes our findings and outlines directions for future work.



1. Tax Treatment of Capital Gains on Mutual Fund Holdings

        Investments in open-end mutual funds are taxed under a specialized set of income tax rules. One

of the most important is the requirement that in order to avoid taxation as corporations, funds must “pass

through” dividends and capital gains to their shareholders. Dickson, Shoven, and Sialm (2000) describe

how the regulations affecting pass-through of realized capital gains from funds to their shareholders can

accelerate capital gains tax liabilities for buy-and-hold fund shareholders. They also illustrate how the

current tax rules create “externalities” by making the capital gains tax liability of each fund shareholder

dependent on the redemption decisions of all other shareholders. When a fund manager realizes capital

gains by selling portfolio holdings, the fund must make a taxable capital gain distribution which creates

an immediate capital gains tax liability even for buy-and-hold investors. Such distributions do not

increase the shareholders’ nominal capital gains tax liability over their entire holding period, but they

increase the present value of this liability by accelerating the tax payments relative to what they would

have been if the fund investment had been taxed like a common stock. Investors in mutual funds more

generally lose the opportunity to apply tax-timing strategies of the type described by Constantinides

(2004) in his analysis of portfolios consisting of directly-held common stock.

        To quantify the tax consequences of deferring a mutual fund investment until after a taxable

capital gain distribution, consider a shareholder who is planning to hold mutual fund shares for exactly

twenty years. Assume that the nominal annual twenty-year interest rate is 100*r percent, that the

impending distribution equals 100*d percent of the fund’s net assets, and that the current and future tax

rate on realized capital gains is τcg. Set the fund’s pre-distribution share price to unity. If the shareholder

invests one dollar immediately prior to the capital gain distribution, she purchases one share of the fund,

receives a capital gain distribution of d, and pays tax of τcg*d.
                                                          55


        On the distribution date, the fund’s share price drops from 1 to 1-d. If the shareholder reinvests

the distribution of d and draws on other resources to pay her capital gains tax bill, her tax basis in the fund

will be 1+d. She will own 1+d/(1-d) = 1/(1-d) shares of the fund. Since shares cost 1-d dollars, the

shareholder once again has one dollar invested in the fund. If the fund’s assets appreciate at an annual

rate of g, then after twenty years the shareholder’s position will be worth (1+g)20. Her capital gains tax

due at the time of sale will equal τcg*[(1+g)20 – (1+d)]. The present value of the tax due on the mutual

fund purchase and sale, combining the tax due on the initial distribution and that due when the shares are

sold, and computed using an appropriate after-tax discount rate r, is:

(1)     TAXbuy before distribution = τcg*d + (1+r)-20*τcg*[(1+g)20 – (1+d)].

        In contrast, if the shareholder invests one dollar in the same mutual fund immediately after the

distribution, she would also have a fund position in twenty years worth (1+g)20, but her tax basis would be

1, so her capital gains tax liability at the time of sale would be τcg*[(1+g)20 – 1]. The present value of her

tax payment is:

(2)     TAXbuy after distribution = (1+r)-20*τcg*[(1+g)20 – 1].

The difference between these two present value tax measures, τcg*d*[1-(1+r)-20], is the cost of

accelerating capital gain realizations. A shareholder who purchases a fund just prior to a distribution date

extends an interest-free loan of τcg*d to the government. If a fund distributes eight percent of its net

assets, the nominal twenty-year interest rate is five percent, and the capital gains tax rate is 20 percent, the

cost of acceleration equals 0.0099, or just under one percent of the fund investment. Buying the fund

before the distribution is equivalent to paying a 100 basis point load. In some fund-years, the capital

gains distribution can be as large as twenty percent of NAV. The median fund distribution for all equity

mutual funds in our 1994-2000 sample period was approximately 3.5 percent of NAV. Some funds made

much larger distributions in some years, thereby generating larger investor tax burdens.

        The expected tax cost of purchasing fund shares prior to a taxable distribution is a declining

function of the shareholder’s expected holding period. If a fund shareholder who has not yet sold her

shares has a constant probability p of selling her shares each year, then the expected present discounted

value of the difference between the tax burden from buying just before and just after a distribution d is:


                                                                                                                 5
                                                          66


(3)     EPDV(p, r, d, τcg)tax differential from distribution = τcg*d - Σj=1 p*(1-p)j-1*τcg*d*(1+r)-j = τcg*d*[r/(r+p)].

Note that when p = 1, so that the mutual fund position will be sold with certainty one year after it is

purchased, this expression reduces to τcg*d*[r/(1+r)]. This is cost of loaning the government τcg*d for one

year without interest.

        Table 1 reports the value of EPDV/d, the increased tax burden from buying before a distribution

as a fraction of the distribution. The table considers a variety of discount rates, turnover probabilities, and

capital gains tax rates. The results illustrate that the incremental tax burden as a fraction of the

distribution can be substantial when the probability of sale is low and the nominal discount rate is high.

When the sale probability is two percent per year, for example, the nominal interest rate is nine percent,

and the tax rate on long-term gains is 15 percent, the present value of the tax acceleration cost is 12.3

percent of the current tax burden associated with buying a fund share. With lower discount rates, lower

tax rates, or higher trading probabilities, the tax burden associated with acceleration is much smaller. The

effective cost of buying mutual fund shares before the distribution date is likely to vary across taxpayers,

with the expected holding period playing an important role in generating this variation.

         Funds generally announce their planned distributions several weeks before the record date,

which permits potential shareholders to respond to impending distributions. To avoid accelerating their

capital gains tax liabilities, taxable shareholders might shift their intended purchase from a fund that is

about to make a distribution to a different fund, or they might defer their purchase until after the

distribution date. Our empirical work explores the extent of these responses by studying fund inflows

before and after distribution dates.



2. Account-Level Data on Mutual Fund Shareholders

        We examine data on the daily trading behavior of all mutual fund shareholders at a no-load open-

end mutual fund complex. The anonymous fund family that provided the data operates with fees and

policies that are comparable to industry standards. It includes approximately ten funds, including both

equity and fixed-income portfolios, but we focus our analysis on the equity funds. Data from this fund

family are the basis for Johnson’s (2004, 2006) studies of heterogeneity in shareholder trading patterns.
                                                     77


The transfer agent for the mutual fund family provided a database consisting of over 50,000 shareholders

and nearly one million transactions in the family of funds between late 1994 and mid 2000. The database

includes information on the registration information for each account, as well as on daily net asset values

(NAVs) and distributions for each fund.

        Shareholders have traditionally purchased no-load mutual fund shares directly from the fund.

These are "direct" shareholders. However, many shareholders now purchase shares through an

intermediary, such as a mutual fund supermarket, that collects the transactions of its customers and passes

them through to the fund. These are "indirect" shareholders. The distinction between direct and indirect

shareholders is important because the tax status of the former but not the latter can be determined reliably

at the account level. Our strategy for identifying the effects of taxes, therefore, requires that we exclude

the indirect shareholders from some of the analysis. Moreover, we generally further restrict our analysis

to households in order to avoid confounding tax effects with other clientele effects than might arise in a

broader sample of account types. “Non-household” shareholders include trusts, college endowments, and

corporate treasury accounts.

        We investigate whether shareholders reduce their purchases of fund shares just before the fund

pays a distribution. Although distributions could also affect shareholder redemptions under certain

assumptions, the effect of taxes on redemption decisions are less clear than those on inflows and we

therefore focus on this margin of investor behavior. In work not reported here, we studied gross outflows

and found no unusual patterns around distribution dates.

         We aggregate individual purchases to create daily gross inflows for each fund. Following

previous studies such as Bergstresser and Poterba (2002), we scale daily gross inflows by the fund's

lagged net assets. In all cases, we exclude fund distributions from the inflows whether or not the

shareholder reinvests them. Most shareholders reinvest dividends. In our sample, 97.1 percent of

accounts, and 95.9 percent of the dollar-weighted accounts, reinvest dividends. These reinvestment rates

are similar to those found in the mutual fund industry as a whole.

        Table 2 presents sample summary statistics on gross inflows. The first row presents results for

aggregate inflows, while the last two focus only on gross inflows from households who are direct


                                                                                                               7
                                                    88


shareholders. The average daily gross inflow is 0.0053 times fund assets, or just over one-half of one

percent. There is substantial variation in daily gross inflows, which is indicated by the disparity between

the mean and median as well as the large standard deviation. Table 2 also shows that gross inflows to

taxable direct household accounts represent roughly one-seventh of the aggregate gross inflows, while

inflows to tax-deferred direct household accounts represent about one-eleventh of all gross inflows.

Some of our analysis focuses on inflows from subsets of accounts, and in such cases, the total dollar value

impact of proximity to a distribution date is smaller than when we consider total inflows.

        The mean return on the equity funds in our sample is 0.084 percent per day. Multiplying by an

average of 252 trading days per year, this translates to an average annual return of 21.2 percent. The

standard deviation of returns is 1.24 percent per day, or 19.7 percent per year. The corresponding

benchmark returns for the equity funds in our sample average 16.6 percent, and the annual standard

deviation is also 16.6 percent. Thus, the average return on the sample funds exceeded the average

benchmark returns, but the sample funds were also substantially more volatile than the benchmark.

        Each of the funds in our sample usually makes distributions in December, although there are

several years in which some funds made two distributions, the first in the second half of the year but

before December, and the second in December. The sample fund family is somewhat unusual in not

making a distribution in the first half of the calendar year. For the entire universe of U.S. equity mutual

funds making distributions in 2000, 38.3 percent of the distributions occurred in December, 11.4 percent

occurred in June, 10.2 percent in March, and 9.8 percent in September. The median fund distribution in

our sample is 3.6 percent of NAV while the mean is approximately five percent. The average annual

distribution at the funds in our sample is very close to the average of all funds for our sample period.



3. Gross Inflows before and after Distribution Dates

        Many previous studies of mutual fund flows, including Warther (1995) and Sirri and Tufano

(1998), suggest that fund flows are sensitive to lagged returns. Johnson (2006) confirms this relationship

for our sample funds. We develop a simple empirical model for gross inflows and use it to consider

inflow patterns around distribution dates. We refine our analysis by examining differences in
                                                      99


distribution-related effects before and after the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, which changed relevant

shareholder tax rates, and by distinguishing between large and small transactions.

3.1 Specification Issues

        We focus on empirical models that relate gross inflows at fund i to the lagged return on fund i,

denoted Ri,t as well as lagged returns on either the aggregate equity market or on the benchmark index

identified in the fund's prospectus. We denote these returns by Rm,t and Rb,t, respectively. With respect to

the lag structure for returns, even with daily flows data, a long and unrestricted lag structure would absorb

many degrees of freedom. To allow lagged returns to affect fund inflows for periods as long as a year,

but to reduce the number of parameters that we estimate, we allow separate coefficients for the inflow

effect of returns on each of the previous five days, but we constrain all returns in the previous three weeks

to have an identical effect by including the average return over that period (trading days t-6 to t-21). We

also include the average return in each of the previous five months, and the average return over the period

between seven and twelve months earlier. In this way, returns for the entire previous year enter the

specification but we do not lose many degrees of freedom. Thus, we would include twelve lagged return

variables when explaining the inflow to a fund on the first trading day in January. These variables would

be five distinct daily returns for the last five trading days in December, the average daily return over days

t-21 through t-6, five variables corresponding to lagged monthly returns between July and November, and

one variable measuring the average return over the period between the roughly six month interval that is

t-252 through t-127. Our findings were not substantively affected when we included longer lags.

        The basic equation that we estimate throughout our analysis is

(4)     INFLOWi,t = α1 + ∑j β1j*Ri,t-j + ∑j γ1j*Rb,t-j + ∑k=-1,1 λ1k*WINDOWi,k,t + ε1i,t.

The variable capturing patterns around distribution dates, WINDOWi,k,t, is set equal to 1 if day t occurs in

the 30- or 15-day window before or after (k equals -1 or 1, respectively) a distribution date for fund i. We

are primarily concerned with the {λk} coefficients. We often estimate two inflow equations, such as one

for taxable accounts and one for non-taxable accounts, and we are interested in testing cross-equation

coefficient restrictions. To simplify such testing, we estimate the two equations using a Seemingly




                                                                                                              9
                                                        10

Unrelated Regression (SUR) procedure, and we calculate test statistics using the resulting variance-

covariance matrix for all estimated parameters.

        Table 3 reports return and WINDOW coefficients from estimates of (4) for all equity funds in our

sample. The table shows estimates with robust and heteroscedastic-consistent standard errors in

parentheses. The first model uses a 30-calendar-day window on each side of the distribution while the

second uses a 15-calendar-day window. The first two rows present evidence on gross inflow patterns in

the periods just before and just after fund distributions, and the third row reports p-values for the

hypothesis test of equality between the estimates in the first two rows. The estimates imply that for each

of the 30 days before a distribution, gross inflows average 24 basis points lower per day than the average

at other times. In the 30 days after the distribution date, inflow averages 11 basis points per day below

their average other times. Thus, we estimate a “distribution effect” of -13 basis points per day, which

cumulates over 21 trading days in the 30 calendar days before a distribution to a reduction in net fund

inflows of 2.73 percent (21*0.0013) of fund net assets. We reject the null hypothesis that the coefficients

for the pre- and post-distribution periods are identical. The difference between the before-distribution and

after-distribution inflows is even more pronounced when we use a 15-day window. In that case the

difference is 16 basis points per day, and we once again reject the null hypothesis that gross inflows

before and after the distribution date are the same.

        The coefficient estimates below the first three rows of Table 3 show that lagged fund returns have

a positive effect on shareholder inflows, with the largest estimated coefficients in the previous few trading

days. There is relatively little decay in the effect of returns as the lag length increases. In the 30-day

window specification, a one percentage point increase in the fund return on a given day increases the

gross inflows to the fund by 22 basis points in the next five days.

        The coefficients on the benchmark portfolio returns are always of the opposite sign of the lagged

fund returns. In many cases, the individual coefficients on daily or monthly benchmark returns are not

statistically significantly different from zero, but we reject the null hypothesis that all of the benchmark

return coefficients are jointly zero. The coefficient patterns suggest that some shareholders base their

fund purchase decisions on relative performance.

        Before comparing shareholder behavior in taxable and non-taxable accounts, we consider the

sensitivity of the gross inflow model to the choice of alternative specifications of lagged returns. Table 4

presents the coefficients on the 30-day indicator variables {λk} from five different specifications of (4)

that differ only in the included set of lagged return measures. The specification with the highest

explanatory power is the one that includes both fund returns and market returns, measured as the CRSP

value-weighted index return. The specification that includes both fund and fund benchmark index returns

has the second highest explanatory power. Constraining the coefficients by including either (fund return

– market return) or (fund return – benchmark return) reduces explanatory power, as does excluding both

market and benchmark returns. While the fit of the various models differs, the estimated differences in

both inflows in the 30-day window before and after the distribution date are remarkably stable across

specifications. The change is approximately 13 basis points in every specification except for the third

one, in which it is 7 basis points. Our conclusions about flow patterns do not appear to depend

substantively on our return specification choices.

3.2 Taxable and Non-Taxable Accounts

        We follow in the tradition of Barber and Odean (2004), Ivković and Weisbenner (2006), and

Ivković, Poterba, and Weisbenner (2005) by using differences between the behavior of household

shareholders in taxable and tax-deferred settings to estimate the impact of taxes on fund purchases. We

focus on households to avoid confounding tax effects with other clientele effects than might arise in a

broader sample of account types. Data limitations prevent us from reliably identifying households in the

indirect distribution channel. Thus, our household sample is drawn solely from the direct distribution

channel. To understand how this selection rule might affect our findings, we compare gross inflows

around distribution dates from direct household accounts with gross inflows around distribution dates

from all other accounts. The second group includes all shareholders in the indirect channel, as well as all

non-households in the direct channel.

        Table 5 presents the results, which suggest that gross inflows increase after distribution dates for

both direct household accounts and for all other accounts. The change in gross inflows is statistically

significant at the 10 percent confidence level for both the 30-day window and the 15-day window.


                                                                                                             11
                                                      12
                                                     12


Focusing on the 30-day inflow results for the direct household sample, the pre- and post-distribution

coefficients are -4.37 and -2.15, respectively. For the other sample, the corresponding coefficients are -

19.31 and -8.81. Note that the absolute values of the WINDOW coefficients in Table 5 are smaller than

those in Tables 3 and 4, reflecting our focus on only subsets of inflows.

        Table 6 presents our central results on the differences in gross inflow patterns around distribution

dates between taxable and tax-deferred direct household accounts. The results suggest that some taxable

shareholders alter their fund trades around distribution dates while tax-deferred shareholders ignore

distribution dates. For taxable shareholders, gross inflows increase after distribution dates by a

statistically significant 2.22 basis points in the case of the 30-day window and a statistically significant

2.65 basis points in the case of the 15-day window. For tax-deferred shareholders, we cannot reject the

null hypothesis that inflows are the same before and after distribution dates. This is true for both the 30-

day and 15-day windows. To place the results in perspective, recall that in Table 2 the average daily

gross inflow from taxable households is 8.23 basis points. Thus, taxable household inflows decline about

27 percent (2.22 / 8.23) in the period prior to fund distributions.

3.3 The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 and the Composition of Fund Distributions

        The tax code changed during our sample period. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 (TRA97)

reduced the top marginal tax rate on realized long-term capital gains from 28 percent to 20 percent for

taxpayers in the highest income tax brackets. The transition from one tax regime to another was complex,

because the legislation changed both the definition of the long-term holding period and the rates that

applied to long-term gains. Prior to TRA97, gains were defined as long-term if the underlying asset had

been held for at least twelve months. TRA97 redefined long-term gains as gains on assets held for at least

18 months, effective July 29, 1997.

        TRA97 also retroactively reduced long-term capital gains tax rates from 28 to 20 percent with an

effective date of May 6, 1997. Gains on assets held for at least 18 months and sold after that date faced a

maximum tax rate of 20 percent. Gains on assets held for less than 12 months were taxed as ordinary

income throughout the year. Gains on assets held for between 12 and 18 months, however, faced a top

marginal tax rate of 28 prior to May 6, when they were long-term gains taxed under the old top marginal
                                                     13
                                                    13


tax rate, 20 percent between May 6 and July 28, when they were long-term gains taxed under the new but

retroactive rate, and 28 percent after July 29, when they were defined as a new category of “mid-term”

capital gains that were subject to a new rate. The Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform

Act of 1998 eliminated the category of mid-term gains, and effective January 1, 1998, gains on assets held

for more than 12 months qualified as long-term and were taxed at a maximum tax rate of 20 percent.

        TRA97 also changed other tax rules that may affect inflow patterns to tax-deferred accounts. The

legislation introduced Roth IRAs, Education IRAs, and 529 plans. Contributions to Education IRAs and

529 plans must be made by the end of the calendar year, rather than by April 15 of the following year as

with traditional and Roth IRAs. While this could affect gross inflows, neither Education IRAs nor 529

plans account for substantial gross fund inflows at our sample of funds.

        The 1997 and 1998 tax reforms reduced mutual fund shareholders’ tax penalty from the

acceleration of capital gains tax liability. We test whether the inflow difference around distribution dates

was larger before the TRA97 than afterward by interacting an indicator variable for observations in our

sample after July 29, 1997 (POSTTRA97) with the WINDOW variables. We do not attempt to capture

the effects of the brief mid-term holding period because it applies for only five months. We also control

for other potential changes in the level of gross inflows before and after TRA97 by also adding an

indicator variable that equals one in the post-TRA97 regime to our specifications. The new inflow

specification is

(5)     INFLOWi,t = α1 + α2*POSTTRA97i,t + ∑j β1j*Ri,t-j + ∑j γ1j*Rb,t-j

                         + ∑k=-1,1 (λ1k+λ2k*POSTTRA97i,t)*WINDOWi,k,t + ε1i,t.

        Table 7 presents estimates using the 30-day window. Findings from the unreported 15-day

specification are similar. The first specification in Table 7 shows that the decline in taxable inflows

before a distribution date was larger for taxable direct household accounts before TRA97, at 4.89 (0.14 -

(-4.75)) basis points per day, than afterwards, when it was 0.67 basis points per day (-0.66 - (-1.33)).

Additionally, the pre-1997 decline is statistically significantly different from zero while the post-1997

decline is not. The post-1997 indicator variable, included without an interaction with distribution date

variables, shows that gross inflows were lower in the later part of our sample than they were earlier. The


                                                                                                            13
                                                                  14
                                                                 14


differences between gross inflows in tax-deferred accounts before and after distribution dates are never

statistically significantly different from zero.

         We have not yet considered differences in the tax burden on different distributions for taxable

investors, even though Plancich (2003) explains that the mix of long-term gains and ordinary income in

fund distributions varies across distributions. The acceleration of capital gains tax liability is greater

when a distribution contains short-term gains than when it contains only long-term gains. If shareholders

have information on the composition of distributions prior to the distribution date, there may be larger

changes in trading patterns around distributions that generate large tax penalties than around those with

smaller penalties.

         We measure each distribution’s relative tax burden, IMPACT, as:

(6)      IMPACTi,k,j = [τordinary*(1- μlt,i,k,j) + τlong-term cg*μlt,i,k,j]/ τlong-term cg.

In this expression, μlt,i,k,j is the fraction of the distribution that is taxed as a long-term gain. If μlt,i,k,j equals

one, then IMPACT for a distribution equals one. If μlt,i,k,j equals zero, so that the entire distribution is

taxed as ordinary income, the tax impact factor equals τordinary/τlong-term cg,, which is greater than one. In the

pre-1997 period, this ratio could be as large as 39.6/28 = 1.41. In the post-1997 period, the ratio could be

as high as 1.98 (= 39.6/20). Thus, it is potentially more important to distinguish long-term and short-term

gains after the TRA97 than before. In our sample, the average value of μlt,i,k,j is roughly two-thirds. We

aggregate distributions of ordinary income, which are rare, with short-term capital gains when

constructing this variable.

         We test for the importance of tax status variation across distributions by interacting IMPACT

with WINDOW and estimating the following model

(7)      INFLOWi,t = α1 + α2*POSTTRA97i,t + ∑j β1j*Ri,t-j + ∑j γ1j*Rb,t-j

                              + ∑k=-1,1 (λ1k+λ2k*POSTTRA97i,t)*WINDOWi,k,t*IMPACTi,k,t + ε1i,t.

The second and fourth columns of Table 7 present estimates of this specification. The coefficient patterns

are very similar to those in equations that do not allow for variation in the tax burden across distributions.

One potential explanation for the similarity of the results is that shareholders may not be aware of the

subtle tax consequences that come from differences in the composition of different distributions.
                                                        15
                                                       15


        The cost of tax acceleration is proportional to the size of the distribution, so tax-sensitive

shareholders should respond more strongly to large distributions than to small ones. In an unreported

specification patterned after equation (7), we consider this possibility by interacting WINDOW with the

size of the distribution, measured as a percentage of NAV. The results are qualitatively similar to the first

specification in Table 7. We were not able to reject the null hypothesis that the change in inflows around

a distribution is unrelated to the size of the distribution.

3.4 Controlling for Turn-of-the-Year Effects

        The funds in our sample often have distributions in late December. Therefore, the pre-

distribution period may overlap with the last few weeks of the calendar year and the post-distribution

period may correspond to the first few weeks of the New Year. Thus, differential trading around the turn

of the year might be inappropriately identified in the prior specifications as a distribution effect. We test

for this possibility by adding indicator variables for each of the first four and last four weeks in the

calendar year to equation (7). We estimate the gross inflow equation for both taxable and tax-deferred

direct household accounts.

        Table 8 shows that turn-of-the-year effects are not driving our distribution results. For taxable

shareholders, we continue to find a statistically significantly lower rate of gross inflows in the 30 days

before a distribution than in the 30 days afterward, with a more pronounced effect prior to the enactment

of TRA97 than afterward. Tax-deferred accounts remain insensitive to distribution dates in the new

specification. For both types of accounts, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the eight indicator

variables for weeks around the turn of the year are jointly equal to zero.



4. Holding Periods before and after Distribution Dates

        Our findings suggest that at least some taxable shareholders reduce their mutual fund purchases in

the weeks before distributions. Yet it is still evident that many taxable investors purchase fund shares in

the weeks and days prior to distribution dates. These buyers may not be aware that a distribution is about

to be paid, or they may have specialized tax circumstances, such as capital loss carryforwards, that

eliminate their tax liability on the distribution. It is also possible that these buyers believe that the fund’s


                                                                                                              15
                                                      16
                                                     16


NAV will rise enough by the distribution date to offset the cost of capital gains tax acceleration. Buyers

with such beliefs would expect a higher after-tax return from purchasing fund shares before, rather than

after, the distribution date.

        Our data set does not contain any information that enables us to measure a fund buyer’s expected

NAV appreciation, or that identifies the buyer’s detailed tax positions. We do, however, observe one

investor attribute that is correlated with the cost of tax acceleration: the investor’s holding period for fund

shares. The cost of buying shares before rather than after a distribution is smaller for an investor with a

short holding period than for one who expects to hold the fund shares for many years. We can study

whether investors who buy fund shares before distribution dates sell them sooner, on average, than post-

distribution buyers.

        We test this possibility by fitting a Cox (1975) proportional hazards model to the shareholder's

risk of account closure. This is an appropriate measure of how long shareholders hold fund shares

because shareholders do not generally trade between account opening and account closing. The risk of

closure is inversely related to the shareholder’s holding period. We measure time in calendar days since

the account opening, and we model the probability of closure as a function of the same explanatory

variables that we used in the last section.

        Table 9 reports our estimates of hazard ratios, which are easier to interpret than the coefficients

from the proportional hazards model, along with robust standard errors. Estimated hazard ratios that are

smaller than one are associated with low closure risk and long holding periods while ratios larger than one

are associated with high closure risk and short holding periods. The first and third specifications, which

only include indicator variables for account openings in the 30 days before and after a distribution date

and fund-specific intercepts, do not suggest any differences between the investment horizon of

shareholders who open their accounts before and after distribution dates. The results in the second and

fourth columns, however, which control for turn-of-the-year effects, TRA97, “tax impact”, and returns,

suggest some differences between pre- and post-distribution buyers. The hazard ratios indicate that

taxable shareholders who open accounts after a distribution are approximately 25 percent less likely each
                                                      17
                                                     17


day to close their accounts than those who open accounts before a distribution. Tax-deferred shareholders

have a similar tendency, but it is economically smaller and statistically insignificant.

        The hazard ratio differences translate into substantial differences in expected holding periods for

taxable shareholders. In the pre-TRA97 period, shareholders who invested in the 30 days before a

distribution had a 27 percent chance of liquidating their position within one year while those who invested

in the 30 days after a distribution had a 19 percent chance of liquidation. In the post-TRA97 period, the

corresponding numbers are 28 percent and 15 percent. Thus, the evidence indicates that the differences in

one-year closing rates between those who buy before distributions versus those who buy after

distributions are 8 and 13 percent. For tax-deferred shareholders, expected holding periods do vary

around distribution dates; however, the differences are much smaller. In both the pre- and post-TRA97

regimes, the difference is four percent.

        This evidence suggests that there are differences in holding periods between investors who open

accounts before and after distributions. We reject the null hypothesis of equal liquidation hazard rates for

these two groups of account openers in taxable accounts, but cannot reject the null hypothesis of equal

closure rates for tax-deferred accounts. If investors know their closure probabilities when they open their

accounts, then the anticipated tax acceleration penalty for the pre-distribution account openers is smaller

than that for the post-distribution account openers. Together, these results offer some evidence that

investors may consider their own investment and tax circumstances when they make trading decisions.



5. Conclusion

        Our analysis of account-level mutual fund purchases suggests that a substantial group of

shareholders heed the advice of financial advisors who warn about the tax penalty associated with buying

mutual fund shares prior to a distribution date. At the fund family we study, gross inflows from taxable

investors decline by approximately one quarter in the four weeks before a distribution, and on average a

fund’s net assets are 2.7 percent lower by the distribution date than they would have been in the absence

of a distribution. We attribute this decline in inflows to the tax-avoidance behavior of individual

investors whose capital gains tax liability would be accelerated, and increased in present value, if they


                                                                                                            17

purchased fund shares before rather than after the distribution date. The decline in pre-distribution fund

inflows is more pronounced in the period prior to the enactment of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 than

afterward. This legislation reduced the long-term capital gains tax rate from 28 to 20 percent, thereby

reducing the income tax penalty for receiving a capital gains distribution. We also find that taxable

shareholders who open accounts just before fund distribution dates are more likely to close their accounts

within a year than taxable shareholders who open accounts just after fund distribution dates. We find no

such difference for investors in tax-deferred accounts. This is consistent with investors who face the

greatest tax cost from tax acceleration deferring purchase decisions.

        One important question about our findings is the extent to which they generalize to the broader

universe of mutual fund shareholders. Since the results are based on data from only one mutual fund

family, they may not be representative. Johnson (2006) suggests that the observed pattern of flows at the

fund family we study is similar to that at other fund families. One risk is that because our tests focus on

the behavior of households who invest through the direct distribution channel, they may not generalize to

other shareholders who trade through brokers or fund supermarkets. It is impossible to resolve this

question definitively using our data, but it warrants study with information from other fund families.

        A second issue, which we have not been able to address with any precision in our data set,

concerns investor heterogeneity. We found, but do not report, some evidence that investors who make

large transactions are more sensitive to distribution dates than their smaller-transaction counterparts, but

the pattern varied within our sample period. Data collected from mutual fund accounts offer very limited

information on investor attributes, but future work could usefully explore ways to either collect additional

information, perhaps with a follow-on survey of shareholders, or to impute additional data, perhaps using

geographical identifiers. Our evidence on holding period differences between pre- and post-distribution

fund buyers suggests that investor heterogeneity may be reflected in trading and portfolio choices.

        Our results relate to a number of issues that are broader than the behavior of mutual fund

investors. One is the ongoing public policy discussion about the tax treatment of mutual fund

distributions and mutual fund shareholders more generally. Our evidence on the difference between fund

inflows before and after distribution dates suggests that changing the tax law to allow deferral of tax
                                                      19
                                                     19


liability on realized gains within funds, as suggested by Saxton (2004) and others, would change fund

inflow patterns. Our results do not address the important question of whether such a policy change would

increase the assets held in open-end mutual funds relative to other financial products. The potential

substitution between traditional open-end mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is particularly

intriguing. Most ETFs avoid taxation of realized capital gains by using redemption-in-kind distributions

as described in Poterba and Shoven (2002). Fama and French (2006) suggest that this difference between

ETFs and traditional mutual funds “gives ETFs a substantial advantage over traditional open-end funds in

the competition for customers.” Our results support Bergstresser and Poterba’s (2002) finding that

mutual fund investors consider after-tax returns in their investment decisions. This body of work broadly

suggests the potential importance of taxation in affecting investment in intermediated financial products.

        Second, our findings also bear on a broad issue involving asset market equilibrium in the

presence of taxes. They underscore the possibility, documented in Graham and Kumar’s (2006) work as

well, that the clientele of shareholders holding a security may vary around significant events, such as a

fund distribution date or an ex-dividend date. They provide some evidence that investors view the

involuntary realization of capital gains as costly, as Chay, Choi, and Pontiff (2006) suggest based on

security price movements. The unresolved but central empirical question in this field is whether clientele

variation is large enough to induce changes in asset prices and the associated signals that asset markets

send to managers.

        Finally, while our findings suggest that shareholder behavior is affected by taxes, they do not

provide any guidance on the efficiency costs of tax-induced distortions. If shareholders simply delay the

purchase of a particular mutual fund by a few days or weeks, the efficiency cost can be evaluated by the

cost of holding an alternative portfolio that is not the desired one for a modest period of time. If

shareholders respond to the unusual tax treatment of mutual funds by choosing to hold other asset classes,

then the efficiency calculation must recognize the cost of such portfolio changes. Analysis of the

efficiency costs of these behavioral changes is an important direction for future work.

Source: Authors’ calculations as described in the text. Daily shareholder transactions are aggregated to
the fund level and scaled by the fund's total net assets on the prior day. The resulting ratio is multiplied
by 10,000. Thus, an entry of 53.02 implies inflow of 0.0053, or just over one half of one percent of assets.

Notes: The dependent variable is the sum of daily shareholder transactions, divided by the fund's total net assets
on the prior day and multiplied by 10,000. The first coefficient therefore translates into a 24 basis point decline
in fund inflow in each of the 30 days immediately prior to a fund distribution. Robust standard errors are shown
in parentheses. See text for further discussion.

Note: Entries are hazard ratios from Cox proportional hazards models estimated by maximum likelihood.
The equations are estimated on daily data from late 1994 through mid 2000 and are adjusted for "tax
impact." The equations in columns one and three include fund-specific intercepts. The equations in
columns two and four include fund-specific intercepts as well as fund and benchmark returns. Robust
standard errors for the hazard ratios are shown in parentheses. See text for further discussion.
