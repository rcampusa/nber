                 Length of Service, Terminations and the
                  Nature of the Employment Relationship




                                 ABSTRACT




        This paper presents new survey evidence that relative protection

against job loss grows with length of service, independent of their

net value to the firm. This protection makes good sense given that

at most companies employees appear to earn less than their value marginal

product in the early part of their tenure and more than their value

marginal product in the latter part; without job protection policies

for senior employees, the firm would have an incentive to terminate

them when their "spot" earnings went above their "spot" value marginal

product. In particular, we find that a very large percentage (over 95

percent) of hourly union members outside of agriculture and construction

are   covered by protective policies for senior workers and, that a
somewhat smaller, but still substantial, percentage (about 85 percent)
of comparable nonunion hourlies also have some protection against job
loss in their senior years. The potential reasons for these findings

are briefly discussed.

         Over the course of the past several years, there has been a growing

consensus among economists that wages grow more rapidly with company service

than does productivity. Substantial empirical evidence supporting this

proposition has been amassed and theorists have begun to develop coherent

explanations for the deferral of compensation from early to late in the

worklife.—' Clearly, employees should not be willing to accept wage

schemes under which they are paid less than their current contribution early

in the workilfe and promised more than their current contribution later in

the worklife unless they have some assurance of job security;— under

this sort of wage scheme, an employee who is prematurely terminated may lose

compensation to which he or she is in some sense entitled. Given the

existence of a substantial deferred—payment component in senior workers'

wages, It Is thus logical to ask the following questions: What guarantee do

senior workers have that they will not be Involuntarily separated from their

jobs? How does the strength of this guarantee vary across settings?

         The responses to a mail questionnaire which we recently sent to a

large sample of U.S. firms have provided useful data for answering the above

questions. Based on our survey results, we reach two central conclusions.

First, for a large majority of both union and nonunion employees, protection

against job loss grows with seniority. Reasonable estimates are that over

80 percent of nonunion employees and almost 100 percent of union employees

are employed in settings where senior employees are favored substantially in

reduction in force decisions, so that junior employees are laid off instead

of senior employees considered to be worth less on net to the firm. Second,

the relative risk of senior employees losing their jobs is substantially
smaller in union settings than in comparable nonunion settings, even when

written provisions making seniority the most important factor in layoff

decisions are found at both.

         Section I of the paper describes the collection of the survey data

on which our conclusions are based. The survey results appear in the next

two sections of the paper, with information on written layoff provisions

presented in Section II and our central results on actual layoff practice

presented in Section III. The paper's concluding section deals with the

interpretation and implications of our findings.



I. Collection of the Data



         We sent our survey to 1,025 randomly selected nonagricultural,

nonconstruction firms from the 1981 edition of Standard and Poor's Register

and 250 randomly selected manufacturing firms from a 1980 News Front listing

of approximately 3,000 publicly held manufacturing corporations. Firms

based outside the U.S. were excluded from both samples. Standard and Poor's

generally lists companies with 50 plus employees and $1,000,000 plus in

sales in their Register. What fraction of total U.S. nonagricultural,

nonconstruction employment do these companies represent? Tabulations based

on the Nay 1979 Current Population Survey show that 56 percent of those

whose primary employment was in the nonagricultural, nonconstruction private

sector said they worked for companies with 100 plus employees and 70 percent

said they worked for companies with 25 plus employees. Data from the ES—202

program indicate that unemployment insurance reporting units with 50 or more

employees account for 64 percent of total covered private sector employment

outside agriculture and construction; since firms may contain more than one

unemployment insurance reporting unit, firms with 50 or more employees



                                    —2—
 should account for some larger fraction of covered employment in the

 relevant sectors. A conservative guess would be that the Standard and

Poor's listing contains firms accounting for perhaps two—thirds of total

U.S. nonagricultural, nonconstruction employment. We chose to oversample

manufacturing by adding companies from the News Front list because of the

very large fraction of the economy—wide variation in employment which occurs

in this sector.

         Whenever possible, we mailed our survey to that individual at each

firm who appeared to be in charge of personnel matters (e.g., the Executive

Vice—President for Personnel, the Personnel Director or the Industrial

Relations Vice—President). In cases where no such individual's name could

be obtained, the letter was sent to the Chief Executive Officer of the

corporation. If no response was received from a firm within six weeks after

our first request was mailed, a second request was sent to the original

contact. Altogether, we received 429 responses from firms in the Standard

and Poor's sample (a response rate of 42 percent) and 113 responses from

firms in the News Front sample (a response rate of 45 percent). Because of

various data problems, there were in both cases somewhat fewer usable

responses.

         A question at the start of the survey form asked how many exempt

employees (most likely managers and/or professionals), nonexempt salaried

employees and hourly employees were affected by the respondent's personnel

decisions; all subsequent answers refer to the largest of these subordinate

groups. One of the later questionnaire items inquired whether a majority of

those in the relevant group were covered by a collective bargaining

agreement. In the analysis which follows, we look separately at three

response categories: union hourly employees; nonunion hourly employees; and
                                                            3/
nonunion salaried employees (nonexempt and exempt combined).—



                                    —3—
          Much previous work on the role played by seniority in layoff

 decisions has focused on collective bargaining agreement provisions. We

 asked whether either a collective bargaining agreement or a written policy

 dealing explicitly with the role of seniority in permanent layoff decisions

 covered the group of employees referred to by each respondent. Where we

 were told that such an agreement or policy did exist, we asked whether the

 relevant language stated that seniority should be the single most important

 factor in determining who would be laid off in the event of a permanent

workforce reduction.

          Our primary objective was to learn more about actual practice

 concerning the role of seniority in permanent layoff decisions. Those

respondents who had witnessed a reduction in force which affected the

relevant work group were asked the following question:

         In the event of a workforce reduction, are senior employees
         permanently laid off in place of junior employees?

         L7 Yes, If it is believed that the junior employee will be
             worth more on net to the company than the senior
             employee.


         II Yes, if it is believed that the junior employee will
             be worth sIgnIfIcantly more on net to the company than
             the senior employee.

         /T No, never.

This question produces the most important information in our data set. The

responses indicate the strength of the favoritism afforded senior employees

when permanent layoffs occur.

         In addition to the above information pertaining to permanent layoff

policies and practices, we also asked our survey respondents to tell us the

following: number of people employed by the firm (used in in units as a

firm size measure); information on products produced by the firm (used to

construct industry dummies); and the respondent's address (used to create

region dummies).

                                    —4—
[I. Written Layoff Provisions Covering Various Groups



         As stated above, our questionnaire asked about written layoff

provisions covering both nonunion and union employee groups. The Bureau of

Labor Statistics has published data on the prevalence and characteristics of

layoff provisions contained in major collective bargaining agreements;

however, to the best of our knowledge, there exist no similar data on layoff

provisions contained in written policies covering nonunion employees.

         Table 1 summarizes the relevant raw responses from our Standard and

Poor's firms. Almost a quarter of nonunion hourly groups (24 percent) are

covered by written layoff provisions which specify the role of seniority in

permanent layoff decisions. Interestingly, where such written provisions

covering nonunion hourly groups exist, a relatively large fraction (68

percent) state that seniority should be the most important factor in

deciding which employees to let go. Taken together, the above figures imply

that approximately 16 percent of nonunion hourly employee groups are covered

by written provisions which specify that seniority should be the most

important factor in permanent layoff decisions. Separate tabulations

indicate that, among nonunion hourly employee groups, those at larger firms

are more likely to be covered by this sort of provision, a result which

holds up even when industry and region are controlled for. We return to

this finding below. The nonunion salaried responses indicate that only a

tiny fraction of those employee groups (under 3 percent) are covered by

written last—in--first—out layoff provisions.

         How does unionization affect the probability that the rules

governing seniority's role in cutbacks will be spelled out in writing?

Fully 92 percent of the responses for hourly union employees (versus 24

percent for hourly nonunion employees) indicated the presence of written

provisions dealing with the role of seniority in permanent layoff

decisions. Of such provisions covering hourly union employees, 84 percent

(versus 68 percent for hourly nonunion employees) stipulated that seniority

should be the most important factor in layoff decisions. Overall, the above

proportions imply that 78 percent of union hourly groups (versus 16 percent

of nonunion hourly groups) are covered by written provisions which make

seniority the most important factor in permanent layoff decisions.

         The raw figures presented in Table 1 could potentially be

misleading insofar as the responses we received from firms on our Standard

and Poor's list were not randomly distributed with respect to firm size and

industry (as reported in the Register listings for the firms we surveyed).

Large firms were more likely to return our questionnaire than small firms.

Firms in the mining, manufacturing, transportation, communications,

utilities, or trade sectors were more likely to provide answers pertaining

to hourly employees than were firms in the service, finance, insurance or

real estate sectors; the opposite was true for answers pertaining to

salaried employees. In addition, it would arguably be preferable to

estimate the proportion of employment to which a given statement applied

rather than the proportion of employee groups to which the same statement

applied. These considerations lead us to develop two sets of weighted

figures. The first set of weights corrected for response rate variation

across nine firm size/industry cells; the second set yielded estimates of

employment proportions rather than employee group proportions. These

weightings did not change any of our qualitative conclusions.

         A further concern is that the figures presented in Table 1 might be

misleading if the respondent firms differed systematically in unobservable

ways from the nonrespondent firms. Obviously, we have no direct information

on the answers that nonrespondents would have given to our survey



                                    —7—
 questions. However, we do have answers both from firms that responded to

  our original mailing and from firms that responded only after we sent them a

 followup mailing. Comparison of early versus late responders provides a

 seemingly reasonable test of whether our estimated proportions should be

 considered suspect because of likely nonresponse bias. We divided the

 sample used in Table I into early responders and late responders, then

 recalculated the raw proportions presented there separately for the two

 groups. The only noteworthy difference is that early nonunion hourly

 respondents were significantly more likely than late nonunion hourly

 respondents to report the existence of a written policy governing the use of

 seniority in permanent layoff decisions (.283 versus .135). This gap does

 not appear to be attributable to differences in the firm size, industry

 and/or region characteristics of the two groups. Thus, the Table 1 figures

 for the nonunion hourly population must be treated with some caution.

          Partial confirmation that the figures presented in Table 1 are

reasonable can be garnered from Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data on

major collective bargaining agreement provisions. The most recent relevant

BLS data are for 1970—1971. They indicate that 95 percent of major

collective bargaining agreements outside of construction contain some type

of layoff provision. Examination of a sample of those contracts containing

layoff provisions showed seniority to be the "sole" or "primary" factor in

determining layoff rights for 74 percent of the contracts in the sample,

exclusive of those contracts in which the issue was "subject to local

negotiations,"' Combining the relevant fractions, the BLS data imply

that just over 70 percent of union hourly employee groups are covered by

layoff provisions which specify that seniority should be the most important

factor in permanent layoff decisions; the comparable figure derived from our
Standard and Poor's responses was 78 percent,



                                    —8—
III. Practice Concerning the Role of Seniority in Actual Layoff Decisions



         Ultimately we would like to know not only what written policies or

collective bargaining agreements say about the role of seniority in

permanent layoff decisions but also how much weight seniority actually

receives when a reduction in force occurs. In this section, we first

discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the survey data we have collected

for exploring actual layoff practice. Our next step Is to look at the

overall pattern of responses to our question concerning how permanent layoff

decisions are made. We then proceed to a more careful examination of the

various factors which we expect to influence the weight given to seniority

in reduction—in—force situations, giving particular consideration to union

versus nonunion differences.



Pros and Cons of Using Survey Data to Explore Layoff Practice

         There are several reasons for our belief that the survey data on

layoff practice we have collected can provide a better overall picture of

the role played by seniority in firms' permanent layoff decisions than any

feasible analysis of actual layoff rates.

         Suppose that we could obtain detailed personnel records for a large

number of firms that had carried out reductions In force. These records

could be used to calculate firm—specific permanent layoff rates for

employees with varying amounts of seniority. Unfortunately, a lower layoff

rate among senior employees at any particular firm could result either from

those employees having greater expected net worth or from their receiving

favored treatment. Thus, this layoff rate information would have to be

supplemented with information on individuals' expected net worth to their

firms before one could be certain of its interpretation. Our questionnaire



                                    —9—
 asks whether senior employees are favored in permanent layoff decisions

 rather than whether layoff rates are lower among senior employees. The

 responses obtained thus should shed light on an issue that layoff rate data

 alone could never help us with.

              In actual fact, firm—specific layoff rates for workers with

 different amounts of seniority would be exceedingly difficult to obtain.

 Longitudinal micro data sets like the National
                                                   Longitudinal Survey (NLS) and
 the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) are possible sources of

 information on permanent layoff rates. There are at least two serious

 problems with using these data for the purpose at hand, in addition to that

 discussed above. First, the unit of observation is the individual, not the

firm. To see how this might cause problems, suppose that union sector

layoffs typically occurred at sites with mostly long—service employees but

that nonunion sector layoffs typically occurred at sites with mostly

recently—hired employees. In this situation, even if senior union employees

at any given site are relatively less likely to be laid off than would be

true without a union, the aggregate data might show less decline in the

layoff rate with length of service in the union sector than in the nonunion

sector. This sort of problem can only be avoided through the use of firm

level, rather than individual level, data. A second problem with both the
NLS   and   the PSID is that the sample sizes are relatively small.   For

example, the PSID offers usable observations on permanent layoff experience

over the 1974—1975 period for only 70 private sector nonagricultural,

nonconstruction union blue collar workers with 2O—plus years of company

service and for only 43 comparable nonunion workers. These may sound like

reasonably large numbers; however, even during the 1974—1975 recession the

annual permanent layoff rate for individuals with 20 plus years of company




                                       —10—
service was probably no more than 5 percent, so that much larger numbers

would be needed to reliably detect even large proportional differences

between the union and the nonunion rates.

        The survey data on layoff practice analyzed in this section of the

paper have the advantages of pertaining directly to the question of whether

senior employees are favored in permanent layoff decisions and of providing

a relatively large number of firm—level observations. Perhaps the most

serious shortcoming of the data is that each observation represents only one

person's assessment of how layoff decisions at his or her firm are made.

Ideally, one would like to collect information on of the layoff decision

process at each firm from people at all levels of the corporate hierarchy,

including those at lower levels as well as those at the top level. Another

potential weakness of the data is that our respondents might not be wholly

candid concerning seniority's role in permanent layoff decisions. While

this possibility cannot be ruled out, we see no good reason for our

respondents to mislead us, particularly since they were assured that their

responses would be kept strictly confidential. On balance, we would argue

that our data represent the best available source of information for

exploring the role played by length of service in reductions in force.



The Pattern of Actual Layoff Practice

         Table 2 summarizes the raw responses concerning actual layoff

practice received from our Standard and Poor's firms. A substantial

majority of the answers pertaining to nonunion hourly groups indicate that

senior employees enjoy considerable protection against being permanently

laid off, meaning either that a senior employee would never be let go ahead

of a junior employee (42 percent of all responses) or that this would occur




                                    —11—
 only if the junior employee was considered to be worth significantly more to

 the firm on net (44 percent of all responses). Even among the responses

 pertaining to nonunion salaried groups, 24 percent indicate that a senior

 employee would never be let go ahead of a junior employee and 57 percent

 indicate that this would occur only if the junior employee was considered to

 be worth significantly more to the firm on net.

           How does the layoff protection afforded senior union employees

 compare to that afforded senior nonunion employees? Comparing the relevant

 figures for union hourly and for nonunion hourly employee groups, 97 percent

 of the union respondents versus 86 percent of the nonunion respondents

 reported substantial protection for senior employees and 84 percent of the

 union respondents versus 42 percent of the nonunion respondents reported

 that a senior employee would never be let go in place of a junior employee.

 Thus, layoff protection for senior union employees seems to be both more

 prevalent and stronger than that for senior nonunion employees in broadly

similar jobs.

           We also calculated two sets of weighted proportions like the raw

proportions just discussed. The first set of weights corrected for response

rate variation across nine firm size/industry cells and the second set

yielded estimates of ent proportions rather than employee group

proportions. None of the weighted proportions differs appreciably from the

comparable raw proportions.

           To determine whether we ought to be concerned about possible

nonresponse bias in the figures presented in Table 2, we again divided the

observations into those received from early responders and those received

from late responders, then prepared separate tabulations for the two

groups. There were no significant differences between the two sets of
numbers.

 Modelling the Analysis of Factors Affecting Actual Layoff Practice

          What underlies the union/nonunion differences in layoff practice

 just noted? Given similarly-worded written policy statements governing the

 role of seniority during reductions in force, are the actual layoff

 practices followed in union and nonunion settings also similar? In

 econometric terms, answering these questions requires that we explain the

 variation in a trichotomous dependent variable which captures senior

 employees' vulnerability to being involuntarily terminated ahead of junior

 employees during a reduction in force. This can be modelled using an

 ordered probit. Assume that there exists some unobserved continuous

variable, y, which measures senior employees' relative vulnerability to

layoff. We do not observe y directly but do have some Information about y.

Specifically, it can be assumed that if the y value for a particular group

is below some threshold c1, our survey respondents will say that a senior

employee would never be let go before a junior employee; that if y is

between c1 and some higher threshold level c2, respondents will say that

a senior employee would be let go before a junior employee only if the

junior employee was worth significantly more on net to the company; and that

if yis above c2, respondents will say that a senior employee would be let

go before a junior employee if the junior employee was worth more on net to

the company. Let the latent variable y be a function of various X's

including union status and the terms of written layoff provisions:



    (1) y=X+c

where y represents the unobserved continuous measure of senior employees'

vulnerability to permanent layoff, the X's are Independent variables, the
 's are parameters,   is an error term, and I indexes observations. If the



                                   —14—
C's are normally distributed, the probability of a respondent Indicating

that a senior employee would never be involuntarily terminated before a

junior employee is equal to:


              1   c—XE
                    I   exp (—z /2) dz



the probability of a respondent indicating that only a senior employee who

was worth significantly less on net than a junior employee would be let go

implies greater senior employee vulnerability to being involuntarily

terminated.



Factors Affecting Senior Employees' Relative Vulnerability to

Permanent Layoff

         The models presented in Table 3A were estimated using the ordered

probit technique just described. We included responses from firms In our

News Front sample In estimating these equations. Since the various



                                          -15--
 potentially relevant factors are likely to have a different impact on

 permanent layoff decisions affecting salaried employees, we included only

 union hourly and nonunion hourly observations in the sample used to fit

 these models.

          Column (1) presents the coefficient estimates obtained for a model

 which included a union dummy plus firm size, industry and region variables.

 The union hourly dummy assumes a large, statistically significant positive

 coefficient. Thus, controlling for size of firm, industry and region does

 not alter the conclusion which emerged from the simple cross—tabulations in

Table 2, that senior union hourly employees are relatively less vulnerable

 to permanent layoff than senior nonunion hourly employees. The coefficient

estimates from model (1) can be used to predict the probability that union

and nonunion respondents with otherwise average characteristics for

nonagricultural, nonconstruction blue collar workers (as derived from the

May 1979 CPS) would give each of the three possible answers to the question

we asked about the role of seniority in actual layoff decisions; these

probabilities are reported in Table 3B. Union respondents are almost twice

as likely as similar nonunion respondents to say that a senior employee

would never be permanently laid off in place of a junior employee (.773

versus .410); union respondents are 6.5 times less likely than similar

nonunion respondents to say that a senior employee would be permanently laid

off if it was believed that a junior employee would be worth more on net

(.025 versus .162).

         While the result just documented is interesting in itself, it also

raises some further questions. In particular, we wondered whether union and

nonunion employee groups covered by similarly—worded written layoff policies

would in fact be treated similarly when workforce reductions occurred.

if there is a written layoff provision specifying that seniority

the most Important factor in permanent layoff decisions and a second dummy

variable which equals one if there is some other written layoff provision,

in addition to firm size, industry, and region controls. Two things about

the parameter estimates obtained are of particular interest.

         The first noteworthy fact is that, not surprisingly, written

provisions which specify that seniority should be the most Important factor

in layoff decisions are associated with a substantial reduction In senior

employees' relative vulnerability to losing their jobs. As can be seen by

looking at Table 3B, coverage by a last—in—first—out layoff provision

increases the probability of a "senior employee never let go before a junior

employee" response by .297 for a union group with otherwise average

characteristics (from .590 to .887) and by .373 for a comparable nonunion

group (from .360 to .733). The corresponding reductions in the probability

of a "senior employee let go If junior employee believed to be worth more on

net" response are .054 for a union group with sample average characteristics

(from .060 to .006) and .142 for a nonunion group with sample average

characteristics (from .168 to .026)..' Written layoff provisions which do

not specify that seniority should be the key factor in layoff decisions have

no statistically significant estimated effect on senior employees'

vulnerability to losing their jobs.

         The second noteworthy fact is that unionism per se still seems to

matter even after the above—described written layoff provision variables are

introduced. The union hourly dummy coefficient in the column (2) equation

is strongly significant. On average, unionization is associated with a .189

increase in the probability of a "senior employee never let go before a

junior employee" response (from .543 to .732) and with a .066 decrease in



                                      —19—
  the probability of a "senior employee let go if junior or employee believed

  to be worth more on net" response (from .103 to .037). These effects are

  roughly 50 percent as large as the corresponding effects derived from the

  model which included no layoff provision controls, meaning that differences

  in the existence and nature of written
                                             layoff provisions covering union

  versus nonunion groups can account for perhaps half of the reduction in

  senior employees' vulnerability to layoff that is associated with union

  status.

             The Table 3 models do not
                                         directly address the question of which
 senior nonunion hourly employees enjoy the greatest protection against being

 permanently laid off. We estimated a second set of models like those in

 Table 3 using only nonunion hourly observation.       Since nonunion hourly

 employee groups at larger firms are significantly more likely to be covered

 by written provisions specifying a key role for seniority in permanent

 layoff decisions, we expected that the in of employment variable in the

 model patterned after that in column (1) would assume a significant negative

 coefficient, This coefficient was in fact close to zero and statistically

 insignificant. One way to state these results is that large and small

 employers of nonunion hourly employees differ more in form than in substance

with regard to layoff decisions affecting long—service workers.

            Are the results presented in Table 3 apt to be contaminated by

nonresponse bias? The appropriate x2      tests   show that neither adding a

dummy variable which captures whether an observation represents a late

responder nor adding a full set of interaction terms to the ordered probit

equations contributes to the models' explanatory
                                                      power.

            We were also concerned about the possible existence of a somewhat

different type of bias that has not been mentioned until this point, One

might argue that what we should be interested in knowing is the distribution



                                      —20—
across all employers of practice with regard to the role played by seniority

in the event a permanent layoff occurs; what we actually observe is the

distribution of relevant practice across the set of employers such that

respondents there have witnessed reductions in force. These two

distributions may differ. One might expect that firms which avoid layoffs

as a matter of policy might also place greater emphasis on seniority in the

event that a layoff does occur. There is no satisfactory method of dealing

with this problem. However, we did experiment with estimating a censored

ordered probit model. Censoring takes place because we only observe layoff

practice at those firms where our respondents have witnessed reductions in

force; we specified a probit equation containing the ln of firm size,

industry dummies and region dummies to describe this censoring process. We

then reestimated each of our ordered probit equations simultaneously with

this censoring equation using maximum likelihood methods, allowing for some

correlation rho between the relevant errors. Unfortunately, we were unable

to achieve usable estimates.' At this point, the best we can do is note

that the censoring of our data is a potential concern.



IV. Concluding Thoughts



         The results just reported indicate that over 80 percent of private

sector nonagricultural, nonconstruction employment is located in settings

where senior workers enjoy substantial protection against losing their

jobs. One would expect at least a credible promise of this sort of

protection to accompany wage policies which pay workers less than their

value marginal product early in their tenure and more than their value

marginal product late in their tenure. Nonetheless, it might be asked what

actually motivates firms to adhere to a practice of favoring senior



                                    —21—
 employees when cutbacks affecting their nonunion workforce occur, given that

 there would appear to be a short—run incentive to terminate senior employees

 Instead of junior employees expected to be worth more on net to the firm.

          Someone unacquainted with U.S. law might suppose that senior

 nonunion workers were guaranteed some legal protection against losing their

 jobs. In fact, senior nonunion workers have virtually no legal recourse If

 they are laid off before their juniors. Ignoring situations in which a

 termination has been predicated on a consideration expressly made unlawful

 by statute (e.g., sex, race, religion, national origin, age, union

 organizational activity, or protected concerted activity), nonunion

 employment relationships are generally "terminable at will," regardless of

an employee's length of service. Even written company manuals stating that

layoffs will occur In inverse order of years of service have not generally

been viewed by the courts as enforceable contracts, because employers have

the right to alter this "policy" at any time.Z.1 Nevertheless, It appears

that practices favoring senior workers do go hand in hand with stated

policies to that effect; our survey responses indicate that nonunion firms

with Inverse—seniority layoff policies are second only to union firms with

such provisions In their collective bargaining contracts when It comes to

actually protecting senior workers' jobs.

         Other possible motivations for nonunion firms to protect the jobs

of senior workers where current pay is above current contribution Include:

avoiding unionization; maintaining the morale of the current workforce so

that short—term efficiency is not Impaired; and preserving the firm's

reputation as a fair employer so that prospective new hires are not deterred

from joining the firm's workforce. Information concerning the relative

importance of these three potential motlvators would greatly enhance our

understanding of the issue at hand.



                                      —22—
        While a significant number of senior hourly nonunion workers are

protected against some forms of job loss, senior hourly union workers are

both more often protected and better protected. As mentioned above, we

estimate that almost 100 percent of private sector hourly union workers

outside of agriculture and construction receive job loss protection,

compared to about 85 percent of such nonunion workers; further, we estimate

that over 80 percent of these hourly union workers were covered by plans

which would "never" result in the involuntary termination of a senior

employee in place of a junior employee, whereas only about 40 percent of

such hourly nonunion workers were so securely protected. Why do union

members receive better protection than comparable nonunion workers?

         One reason for expecting senior workers to be more favored in

layoff decisions in union than in nonunion settings is that the collective

bargaining process very likely leads to older workers' preferences receiving

greater weight than they otherwise would.1 Unionism also adds two

enforcement mechanisms: the law and the union itself. As discussed above,

nonunion workers are generally not protected by law from losing their jobs

in place of more junior employees; union members' contracts are enforceable

in court and so have added weight. In addition, the union itself can

monitor employer actions to ensure employer compliance with seniority rules;

in a nonunion setting, most workers will probably not have much power to

make sure the employer is keeping his word. And, in the most desperate

situations, the union can organize work interruptions, giving it a powerful

bargaining tool in the establishment, preservation, and carrying out of

seniority provisions.

         Our result that senior unionized workers enjoy relatively greater

protection against job loss than comparable senior nonunion workers may help

with the resolution of a puzzle that has disturbed diverse analysts.

Numberous studies of the impact of trade unionism have concluded that length

                                    —23—
 of service raises union wages less than nonunion wages, which suggests that

 senior workers benefit less from unionism than do junior workers. This

 result is puzzling because, as just stated, it is generally supposed that

 senior workers' preferences carry greater weight in union settings. Recent

 research suggests that the solution to this paradox may be found in a

 demonstration that, whereas wages rise less rapidly with seniority under

 unionism, the expected value of total compensation rises more rapidly.2!

 One of the most important benefits increasing the slope of the

 union—service! expected—economic—rewards profile is the greater job

 protection provided under unionism.

          Thus far in this paper we have presented evidence that senior

unionized workers enjoy greater protection against permanent layoff

vis—a—vis junior unionized workers than do senior nonunion workers vis—a—vjs

junior nonunion workers. Is it also true that senior unionized workers are

less vulnerable to losing their jobs than senior nonunion workers? To put

the issue somewhat differently, we have shown that unionism reduces senior

workers' relative vulnerability to permanent layoff; is it also true that

unionism reduces senior workers' absolute vulnerability? This might not be

the case if the presence of a union increased the
                                                    overall permanent layoff

rate sufficiently to outweigh the fact that senior union workers are lower

on the list of those to be let go. Back—of—the—envelope
                                                          calculations based

on our survey data suggest that senior union workers have a much lower

probability of being permanently laid off than do senior nonunion

workers.' Francine Blau and Lawrence Kahn have recently reported on the

1971—1972 permanent layoff experience of those included in the NLS male

panels; their results are supportive of the belief that, among older

(presumably more senior) men, coverage by a collective bargaining agreement
                                               11/ Other evidence
is associated with a lower permanent layoff rate.—                on



                                   —24—
union policies during downturns is consistent with these findings. While

during mild recessions, unions favor the use of temporary layoffs to

maintain high wage rates, as downturns begin to threaten the jobs of senior

employees, unions become more willing to discuss wage cuts, reopening of

contracts, and changes in work rules and policies. This change in union

behavior can be seen by studying the 1974—1975 and current recessions.-'

         To summarize, we have found that even though senior nonunion

workers are often protected against job loss in place of more junior

workers, unionism raises the incidence and strength of such protection.

While both implicit and explicit contracts may exist, they appear to have

significantly different consequences for senior workers. Job rights appear

to grow with seniority to a much greater extent under collective bargaining.

1/ For a summary of empirical evidence pertaining to the deferral of

    compensation from early to late in the workilfe, see F1edcff and Abraham

    [1981]. Theoretical work related to the question of why sucn deferred

    compensation schemes might be adopted includes Becker and Stigler

    [1974], Salop and Salop [1976], Viscusi [1978], Lazear [1979], Harris

    and Hoinstrom [1981], and Iannrides and ?issarides [1982].

2/ In principle, a policy of awarding appropriate severance pay it.   the
   event   of a termination could accomplish the same end as a policy rf

   assuring senior employees' job security. We have seer. no gno evidence

   that many workers are in fact covered by severance pay plans which serve

   this purpose. As of 1978, only 37 percent of the major contract

   workforce was covered by severance pay provisions. Tabulaticns based or.

   the 1974 Employer Expenditures for Employee Compensation survey

   (described in ij.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics [l976] indicate that 2

   percent of union production employees and only 3 percent of nonunior.

   production employees worked in establishments where the employer made

   contributions to a severance pay or supplemental unemployment benefit

   fund during l972 Even where severance pay plans exist, it is not at

   all clear that the formulas used for determining the level of benefits

   appropriately compensate laid off employees for the stream of deferred

   wages they lose. In addition, at least in the union sector, it appears

   that severance pay provisions most often accompany rather than replace

   provisions which protect senior employees against being laid off. See

   Medoff and Abraham [1981] for a discussion of why one would not expect

   severance pay plans to be the preferred mechanism for protecting senior

   employees' deferred earnings.

3/ There were a very small number of responses pertaining to unionized

    salaried employees which were excluded from the sample we used f or

    analysis.

4/ These data are reported in U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics [1972].

5/ The probability changes for the union group do not equal those for the

    nonunion group because the ordered probit Is a nonlinear model; that is,

    the changes in the probabilities of being in the various categories

    produced by a given change in X depend upon the initial level of        X3.

6/ When we allowed rho to vary freely, it approached one rapidly but the

    likelihood function failed to converge. We then looked at a series of

    constrained models, with rho set equal to 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and

    1.0 in turn. The model with rho equal to one produced the best fit.

    However, it is unclear what this means.

7/ A number of recent state court decisions have begun to modify the

    "employment at will" doctrine using the theory of employees having

    "implied contracts" with their employers, but these jurisdictions are

    still very much in the minority. See Bureau of National Affairs [1982]

    for an up—to—date discussion of legal developments in this area.

8/ See Freeman and Medoff [forthcoming]. Giving greater weight to senior

   workers' preferences may or may not be socially desirable; this point is

   developed in an interesting paper by Kuhn [1982].

9/ See Freeman and Medoff [forthcoming].

10/ In our survey data, 61 percent of union hourly respondents and 52

   percent of nonunion hourly respondents said they had witnessed workforce

    reductions; the average portion of the relevant work group affected was

    14 percent for the union hourlies and 12 percent for the nonunion

   hourlies. Thus, a reasonable, if crude, estimate Is that over the

   relevant reference period 9 percent of union hourly workers and 6

    percent of nonunion hourly workers were permanently laid off. How many

    of these could conceivably have been senior employees? Only 16 percent

                                    —27—
    of our union hourly respondents said that senior employees might

    sometimes be let go ahead of junior employees; 58 percent of our

    nonunion hourly respondents said this might sometimes happen. Thus,

    among union employees layoffs involving roughly 1 percent of the

    workforce might have affected senior workers, whereas among nonunion

    employees layoffs involving roughly 3 percent of the workforce might

    have affected senior workers.

11/ See Blau and Kahn [1981].

12/ See Medoff [1979] for an examination of the impact of collective

    bargaining on temporary layoffs which analyzes data from the 1974—75

    downturn. For discussions of collective bargaining during the current

    recession, see Dunlop [1982] and Mitchell [1982].
