                                             ABSTRACT


        The traditional case for flexibility in nominal exchange rates assumes that there is nominal price
stickiness that prevents relative prices from adjusting in response to real shocks. When prices are sticky
in producers’ currencies, nominal exchange rate changes can achieve the relative price change that is
required between home and foreign goods. The nominal exchange rate flexibility provides the desired
“expenditure-switching” effect of relative price changes. But if prices are fixed ex ante in consumers’
currencies, nominal exchange rate flexibility cannot achieve any relative price adjustment. In fact,
nominal exchange rate fluctuations are undesirable because they lead to deviations from the law of one
price. So, fixed exchange rates are optimal. The empirical literature appears to support the notion that
prices are sticky in consumers’ currencies. This paper surveys the approaches taken in the new open
economy macroeconomic literature to formalize the role of optimal monetary policy. The survey explores
how this literature has dealt with the empirical evidence on pass-through of exchange rate changes to
consumer prices.

1. Introduction

        Exchange-rate flexibility, it has been argued, is useful because it facilitates relative price

adjustment among countries.           Currency depreciation is a quick and painless way to lower

domestic prices relative to foreign prices. A burgeoning literature has examined the benefits of

exchange-rate stability in emerging economies. That literature has focused on the potential for

greater monetary and financial stability from either fixing exchange rates, or taking more

extreme measures such as adopting a currency board or dollarizing. But that analysis is not

directly applicable to the choice of adopting the euro facing some European countries. These

countries uniformly have stable monetary policy (at least as stable as the policy conducted by the

European Central Bank) and have deep, well-regulated financial markets. The economic benefit

of adopting the euro is the increased efficiency of transactions and the elimination of uninsurable

exchange-rate risk. On the other hand, a country adopting the euro cedes its monetary policy to

the European Central Bank, and no longer has the option of using monetary policy to respond to

local conditions. Furthermore, adopting the euro eliminates one possible avenue for adjustment

between countries – the relative price changes induced by exchange rate movements. It is this

latter effect that is the focus of this survey.             Specifically, I shall examine how the recent

theoretical literature in open-economy macroeconomics has addressed empirical evidence on the

effects of exchange rates on prices, and its implications for the choice of exchange-rate regime.

        Much recent evidence has found that consumer prices are not much affected by nominal

exchange rate changes.1 This finding may imply that nominal exchange rate changes do not play

much of a role in changing relative prices of goods. If consumer prices are not responsive to

exchange rates, then a depreciation of the home currency, for example, may not increase much

 I have been the perpetrator of some of this literature: for example Engel (1993, 1999, 2000) and Engel and Rogers
(1996, 2001). Other important works include Rogers and Jenkins (1995), Obstfeld and Taylor (1997) and Parsley
and Wei (2001a, 2001b). Mussa’s (1986) classic paper stimulated much of this research.

the price that consumers pay for imported goods. However, there are other interpretations of the

evidence on exchange rates and consumer prices. For example, there might be important relative

price effects but not for final consumer goods.        One possibility is that intermediate firms

(distributors, marketers or retailers) substitute between domestic and foreign goods based on

relative price changes, but set prices for consumers in a way that is unresponsive to exchange-

rate changes.

        Understanding the extent of to which exchange rates alter relative prices is crucial for

examining the desirability of exchange-rate flexibility among advanced nations       Milton

Friedman (1953) was an early advocate of flexible exchange rates, on the grounds that they could

allow rapid change in relative prices between countries (p. 162):

       “A rise in the exchange rate … makes foreign goods cheaper in terms of domestic
currency, even though their prices are unchanged in terms of their own currency, and domestic
goods more expensive in terms of foreign currency, even though their prices are unchanged in
terms of domestic currency. This tends to increase imports [and] reduce exports.”

        This passage makes two assumptions: that goods prices are unchanged in the currency of

the producer of the good, and that there is significant pass-through of the exchange rate change

to the buyer of the good. On the nominal price stickiness, Friedman argues that the choice of

exchange-rate regime would matter little if nominal goods prices adjusted quickly to shocks (p.

165):

        “If internal prices were as flexible as exchange rates, it would make little economic
difference whether adjustments were brought about by changes in exchange rates or by
equivalent changes in internal prices. But this condition is clearly not fulfilled. … At least in the
modern world, internal prices are highly inflexible.”

        Friedman makes the following famous analogy (p. 173):

         “The argument for flexible exchange rates is, strange to say, very nearly identical with
the argument for daylight saving time. Isn’t it absurd to change the clock in summer when
exactly the same result could be achieved by having each individual change his habits? All that
is required is that everyone decide to come to his office an hour earlier, have lunch an hour
earlier, etc. But obviously it is much simpler to change the clock that guides all than to have
each individual separately change his pattern of reaction to the clock, even though all want to do
                                                 2
so. The situation is exactly the same in the exchange market. It is far simpler to allow one price
to change, namely, the price of foreign exchange, than to rely upon changes in the multitude of
prices that together constitute the internal price structure.”

       In his case against the euro, Feldstein (1992) makes a similar argument:

        “A currency union means, of course, that nominal exchange rates cannot adjust to
achieve a needed change in the real exchange rate. The local price level must, therefore, adjust
to bring about the change in the real exchange rate. Thus a 10% fall in the real value of a
currency can be achieved either by a 10% fall in the nominal exchange rate or by a 10% fall in
local wages and prices.
        Either form of adjustment can bring the real exchange rate to its equilibrium value, but a
decline in domestic prices is likely to require a period of increased unemployment. It would
certainly be better to have a decline in the nominal exchange rate. The shift to a single currency
in Europe would preclude such nominal exchange-rate adjustments and force real exchange-rate
reductions to be achieved through lower local wages and prices.”

       In assessing this relative-price effect and its significance for the choice of exchange-rate

regime, Friedman is certainly correct to emphasize the importance of nominal goods price

stickiness. As Buiter (1999) has forcefully emphasized, the decision to join a monetary union, or

the choice of an exchange-rate regime, is a monetary issue. Relative-price behavior is usually

independent of monetary regime in a world of perfect goods price flexibility. The choice of

monetary regime in this case only matters for short-run adjustment problems – the period during

which nominal prices are adjusting.

       I shall begin the survey by laying out a simple version of the type of new open economy

macroeconomic model that has built on the pioneering work of Obstfeld and Rogoff (1995, 1998,

2000a.) (Hereinafter, I shall call these authors OR.) Their initial work has assumed that nominal

prices are fixed in the producers’ currencies, so that prices for consumers change one-for-one in

the short run with changes in the nominal exchange rate. This is exactly the assumption of

Friedman and Feldstein. I shall call this the PCP (for “producer-currency pricing”) model. The

OR models offer a sound analytical foundation for the claim that flexibility of exchange rates is




                                                3
desirable in this setting.2 They derive three important results: (1) Exchange-rate flexibility is

desirable as a means of achieving relative price adjustment under PCP pricing. Indeed, in their

models, flexible exchange rates are a perfect substitute for flexible nominal prices. That is, the

flexible nominal price allocations are achieved with PCP pricing but flexible exchange rates. (2)

The policy that achieves the flexible price allocation is a constrained Pareto optimum. The

monetary authorities can do no better. (3) This optimal policy is completely self-oriented. No

policy coordination across countries is required or desirable. In this sense, exchange rates are

perfectly flexible and optimal.

          A number of recent papers (Betts and Devereux (1996, 2000), Chari, Kehoe, and

McGrattan (2000), and others) have examined OR-style models in which nominal prices are set

in advance in the currency of consumers. In that case, nominal exchange rate changes do not, in

the short run, change any prices – nominal or real – faced by consumers. I shall call this the LCP

(for “local-currency pricing”) model. Devereux and Engel (2001) have examined monetary

policy in this setting, and have concluded that there is no case for nominal exchange rate

flexibility – indeed, a fixed exchange rates are preferred. I shall demonstrate their case briefly.

          However, there are other possible interpretations of the evidence that consumer prices do

not respond much to exchange rates. One is the approach of OR (2000b). In their model,

transportation costs and distribution costs increase the cost of imported goods, and serve to

segment national markets. Even if imported goods are nearly perfect substitutes for domestically

produced goods, they may not be consumed in great quantity because their cost is higher. In that

case, an exchange rate change will have only a small effect on the consumer price index.

          A related approach observes that the actual physical good is only a small part of what the

consumer buys. The consumer also pays for the nontraded marketing, distribution and retailing


2
    See Lane (2001) for an excellent general survey of the work stimulated by Obstfeld and Rogoff.

                                                          4
services that bring the good to the buyer. Perhaps these costs are quite large, and dominate the

cost of the physical good. If so, the influence of exchange-rate changes on real allocations is

likely to be small, since the exchange rate change only affects a small part of the cost of the good

cum service purchased by the consumer. This is the approach taken by McCallum and Nelson

(1999).

          The new open economy macro literature also probably has not paid enough attention to

another possibility: that the low degree of pass-through of exchange rates to prices may not

primarily reflect price stickiness, but instead optimal price discrimination. Bergin and Feenstra

(2001) and Bergin (2001) build general equilibrium models in which pass-through is not 100

percent even when there is price flexibility. Corsetti and Dedola (2001) describe a setting in

which incomplete pass-through arises because of the differential distribution costs in home and

foreign markets.

          Another approach is one where imported goods are intermediate products for which there

are domestic substitutes. Local producers combine imported intermediates with local goods to

make a final good for consumers. The price for consumers may be sticky in the local price, but

the intermediate import price may be sticky in the currency of the producer of that good. So, the

importer might switch between the imported intermediate and the locally produced alternative

when the exchange rate changes. Obstfeld (2001) argues that in this type of economy, there may

indeed be a significant expenditure-switching effect. It is not consumers who switch between

imports and locally-produced goods, but rather local producers who combine intermediate goods

to make the final consumer product. On the other hand, Devereux, Engel and Tille (1999) posit

that while distributors may indeed import goods priced in the exporter’s currency, they have little

opportunity for substitution with domestically produced products. It is both the degree of pass




                                                 5
through and the amount of substitutability that determine the strength of the expenditure-

switching effect.

       I have mentioned now several alternatives to the LCP model – ones in which consumer

prices do not respond much to exchange rate changes, but in which nominal exchange rate

flexibility still is important in allowing relative price movements. One additional wrinkle that

needs to be considered is the observation of Corsetti and Pesenti (2001), which is that in some

settings even if flexible nominal exchange rates can substitute for flexible nominal prices, such

an arrangement may not be optimal.         They show how there may be a tradeoff facing

policymakers between closing the output gap (that is, achieving the flexible-price equilibrium)

and eliminating deviations from the law of one price. It may be that limiting exchange rate

movements can actually improve on the flexible price equilibrium when in the presence of

monopolistic distortions that engender price discrimination across borders.

       The new open economy macroeconomic models have delivered important new insights

into monetary and exchange rate policy objectives in open economies. But as these models have

developed, they point to areas where we need more empirical study. Until we have those studies

in hand, we must be cautious about interpreting existing evidence as being supportive of any type

of exchange-rate regime.



2. Models of exchange rates and relative prices

       I examine some “new open economy macroeconomic” models in this section that have

the property that measured consumer prices are not very responsive to nominal exchange rate

changes. These models are fully-integrated equilibrium models in which households and firms

make optimal choices, but in which some nominal prices are not completely responsive to




                                                6
shocks. I will work with a simplified framework in which I can embed all of the approaches I

want to discuss.

       The older open-economy macroeconomic literature that put an emphasis on the strength

of the “expenditure-switching effect” is a direct sire of the newer literature. What the newer

literature is trying to achieve is a firmer micro foundation for our understanding of how nominal

exchange rates can help to reallocate resources in a more desirable way. The new studies build

micro-based macro models which try to match some of the stylized facts about exchange rates

and prices, in the hope of getting some insight into the channels through which exchange rates

influence aggregate outcomes.     The models can also provide a welfare-based criterion for

choosing between exchange-rate regimes.

       There are two countries in the general model. I will assume that there is a single period,

though most of the results I discuss carry over to a multi-period framework.             I assume

households in the home country maximize:

                                     1                 æMD   ö
                               U=        C 1− ρ + χ lnçç     ÷ − ηL .
                                                             ÷
                                    1− ρ               è P   ø

C is a consumption aggregate. Households consume goods produced in the home country and

in the foreign country. I will discuss a few different models with different sets of assumptions on

goods preferences.     All of the models assume homothetic preferences (so consumption

aggregates and price indexes are defined), but I will make no further assumptions beyond that for

now.

Households get disutility from work, L . η is a shock to disutility of work.

       Foreign households are assumed to have similar utility functions:

                                      1− ρ                è P ø

Starred (*) variables are the foreign counterparts to the home-country variables.

       Money is supplied exogenously through transfers. In equilibrium we have money supply

equals money demand in each country: M = M D , and M * = M D* .               Four variables will

determine the aggregate state of the economy: the distaste for work for the representative home

agent, η ; the analogous variable for the representative foreign agent, η * ; aggregate per capita

home money supply, M ; and aggregate per capital foreign money supply, M * .

       I will assume there are complete financial markets of the type discussed in Devereux and

Engel (2000). Specifically, there are assets traded that have payoffs specific to each possible

state of the world. These assets are traded of course prior to the realization of the state. Most of

the models we consider have home and foreign consumers facing different prices for the same

good on spot markets. That is, the markets are segmented. We assume that it is impossible to

make state-contingent trades that allow payoffs in physical goods, as that would allow

households to get around paying the price set in their market. Instead, payoffs are specified in

nominal terms. In that case, optimal contracts ensure that the marginal utility from an additional

unit of currency is proportional between home and foreign consumers in all states (where I have

assumed the constant of proportionality is one):

                                            C − ρ C *− ρ
                                                 =       .
                                             P     SP *

S is the nominal exchange rate, expressed as the home currency price of foreign currency.

       The assumption of complete markets is, of course, unrealistic. It is a useful benchmark,

and here it allows us to arrive at a simple flexible model that can be used to analyze relative-

price effects in general equilibrium. We can reproduce Friedman’s claim that nominal exchange

                                                   8
rate flexibility allows desirable relative price adjustments to occur rapidly under his assumption

of nominal prices fixed in producer’s currencies, but we can also analyze other assumptions

about how prices are set.

        The following equilibrium conditions emerge using the first-order conditions for the

household optimization problem:

                     M = χPC ρ                                               M * = χP * C * ρ

                     W = ηPC ρ                                              W * = η * P *C * ρ




Here, W and W * are the home and foreign wage, respectively.

        This framework, while making very specific assumptions about preferences, has the

advantage that it is easy to analyze under a variety of assumptions about goods pricing, and

about preferences over goods. We can derive a solution for the nominal exchange rate that does

not depend on any assumptions about the production side of the economy, about how nominal

prices are set, or without making any further assumption on goods utility:

                                                        M
                                                   S=      .
                                                        M*

        Now we turn to the production side of the economy. There are a large number of goods

produced in each country, each by a monopolist (who faces a constant elasticity of demand,

given our CES assumption on preferences.) We will initially consider models in which output

for each firm i is produced using only a labor input: Yi = Li , and Yi* = L*i .3 We will consider a

variety of possible assumptions about how prices are set. Prices may be flexible – that is, set

  One of the models we examine later will have an iceberg transportation cost for shipping goods overseas. We
will also consider models in which intermediate goods are used as inputs into final goods production.

with full information about the state. Or, in the new open economy models, firms must set

nominal prices in some currency prior to knowledge about the state.



3. Flexible Nominal Prices

       It is helpful first to examine some of the properties of this model under completely

flexible nominal prices. We shall assume home and foreign households have identical CES

preferences over consumption goods.       Firms face constant elasticity demand curves, and

therefore set prices as a constant mark-up over wages. We allow firms to discriminate across

home and foreign markets. But because we assume identical preferences and CES utility, firms

choose to set the same price in both markets.

       Aggregating across all home firms, we get

                                           PH = µW ,

where PH is the home currency price of home goods. We have also PH = SPH* , where PH* is the

foreign-currency price of home goods. Likewise,

                                           PF* = µW * ,

and PF = SPF* .

       We can also derive these equations for nominal wages in equilibrium:

                       η                                                 η* *
                  W=     M                                        W* =     M
                       χ                                                 χ



       It follows from the equilibrium conditions that

                                         PH PH*   η
                                            = * = *.
                                         PF  PF η



                                                10
The relative price of home goods falls when there is an increase in η , which is the parameter

measuring the distaste for work. When home households prefer to work less, home firms must

pay higher wages to entice workers into the workforce. Those wage costs are passed onto to

consumer in the form of higher prices.

           I will not undertake a formal welfare analysis of the models I present here. Instead, I will

focus on what turns out to be a critical aspect of the welfare analysis: to what extent an

exchange-rate regime is beneficial in achieving the adjustment of the price of home goods

relative to foreign goods. Under the Friedman framework, exchange-rate flexibility allows

immediate adjustment of that relative price in response to real shocks. But, as we shall see, that

finding is a special case that depends critically on how Friedman assumes nominal goods prices

are set.



4. Sticky Nominal Prices: PCP Case

           Now consider the model when firms must set nominal prices in advance. In the one-

period framework here, this means that prices are set in advance of knowledge of the preference

shocks and money supply realizations. Perhaps there are menu costs or some other sorts of costs

that make it more profitable to set a non-state-contingent nominal price. First we take up the

case in which firms set prices in their own currencies. That is, home firms set prices in the home

currency, whether for sale to home or foreign households. We call this the PCP case.

           Because of our assumptions of zero transportation costs for firms to ship the goods

overseas, and identical preferences of home and foreign households, firms do not set a different

price for home and foreign households (even though, in principle, we allow for price

discrimination.) That is, the law of one price holds for goods sold at home and in the foreign

country.

                                                   11
       It follows that

                                           = * = H* .
                                        PF  PF  SPF

Under the PCP assumption, both PH and PF* are fixed ex ante and do not respond to shocks to

demand or money supply. Define κ ≡            . Because these nominal prices are set in advance of
                                        PF*

the realization of the state, κ does not depend on the outcomes of the random variables. Then

the relative price of home to foreign goods varies inversely with the exchange rate:

                                              PH κ
                                                 = .
                                              PF  S

Substituting in the expression for the equilibrium exchange rate, we get under PCP pricing:

                                           PH    M*
                                              =κ    .
                                           PF    M

       Here we can see the gist of Friedman’s argument for flexible exchange rates. If the

exchange rate were fixed, there would be no channel to translate real demand shocks into a

relative price change. That is, if the exchange rate were held constant at a value of S , the

relative price of home to foreign goods would not depend on the shocks that hit the economy:

                                              PH κ
                                                 = .
                                              PF  S

But with exchange-rate flexibility and the correct monetary policy (for example, one in which

monetary policy responds to local shocks so that M = k / η and M * = k * / η * ), the real demand

shocks can be translated precisely into the same relative price effect that occurs under flexible

prices. Here, the appropriate monetary policy involves having the monetary authorities set

                                                                                k
monetary policy in a way that ignores the real shocks. In fact, if                 = κ , the relative price will
                                                                                k*

equal exactly its value under flexible prices:

                                                PH PH*   η
                                                   = * = *.
                                                PF  PF η

        Although I have only shown that under flexible exchange rates we can achieve exactly

the relative price response that we find under flexible prices, Obstfeld and Rogoff (2000a)

demonstrate a stronger result. They show that in fact when monetary authorities follow policies

that allow the exchange rate to adjust in such a way that the relative price mimics the flexible-

price solution, we can achieve exactly the same welfare as under flexible prices. That is, very

much in accord with Friedman’s intuition: flexible exchange rates are a perfect substitute for

flexible goods prices in the presence of real shocks.

        Moreover, in the models of OR (1998, 2000a), mimicking the flexible price allocation is

the constrained globally efficient monetary policy. While the flexible-price equilibrium itself is

not Pareto efficient (because of the monopoly distortions), optimal monetary policy can do no

better than to replicate the flexible-price allocation.

        Moreover the monetary policy I set out above is not only the policy that would be set by a

global central planner.        It is, as OR (2000a) show, the policy that self-interested national

economic planners would follow.                That is, there is no gain to international monetary

coordination. Central banks following policies that maximize their own country’s welfare can

achieve the constrained globally efficient outcome. Thus, a system in which central bankers do

not cooperate at all and allow the exchange rate to float freely is optimal, as Friedman claimed.4

  OR (1998, 2000a) have delicate sets of assumptions on preferences and market structure that insure that markets
are actually complete. But OR (2001) show that these basic conclusions are to a first order robust to market
incompleteness.

        This model, however, has implications that seem counterfactual: that exchange rate

changes are passed through one-for-one into consumer prices, and that the law of one price holds

for all goods. It is this characteristic of the model that has led some researchers to consider the

local-currency pricing version of the sticky-nominal price model.



5. Sticky Prices: LCP Case

        An alternative model for price setting is that firms set prices in the currency of consumers

of the product. That is, when a home firm sells in the home market it sets prices in the home

currency. But for sales to the foreign market, it sets prices in the foreign currency. We call this

the “LCP” (for “local currency pricing”) case.

        It follows immediately in this case that a flexible nominal exchange rate cannot achieve

the optimal relative price adjustment. Ph and Pf are both set in the domestic currency and do

not respond to contemporaneous shocks. We cannot replicate the flexible-price solution of

PH PH*   η
   = * = * with flexible exchange rates, no matter what the monetary policy.                            In fact,
PF  PF η

Devereux and Engel (2000) go further and demonstrate that the optimal monetary policy in this

case delivers fixed exchange rates.5 Or, put another way, if the foreign country is following

optimal monetary policy, while the home country is using the exchange rate as its policy

instrument, the optimal exchange rate policy is to fix.

        There is a simple way to understand the striking difference in optimal policy in the PCP

world versus the LCP world. There are two types of deviations from efficiency which monetary

policy might be able to rectify in a sticky-price world. One is that relative prices might not


5
 Bacchetta and van Wincoop (2000) and Devereux and Engel (1998) also examine exchange-rate rules with local-
currency pricing. However, those analyses do not examine the real shocks that are at the heart of the issues we
discuss here.

                                                       14

respond in the correct way to real shocks, so that we might not achieve         = * = * . In the
                                                                             PF  PF η

absence of optimal relative price changes, consumers do not receive the correct signals and do

not alter their demand for goods in the appropriate way when real shocks hit. As a consequence,

resources will not be allocated efficiently.

       The other type of inefficiency comes because deviations from purchasing power parity

lead to incomplete risk sharing. As noted above, with a complete set of nominal contingent

                                C − ρ C *− ρ
claims traded, in equilibrium        =       . Asset markets do not deliver complete risk sharing
                                 P     SP *

unless purchasing power parity holds, P = SP * .

       When prices are set in producers’ currencies (PCP), purchasing power parity does hold,

so asset markets do deliver complete risk sharing. In that case, monetary policy can be devoted

entirely toward ensuring that relative prices respond in the appropriate way to real shocks. But,

of course, exchange rate flexibility is needed to deliver the relative price response.

       Under local currency pricing, relative prices simply cannot change in the short run in

response to real shocks. It is useless for monetary policy makers to devote any effort to

achieving an efficient relative price response. But, under LCP pricing, both P and P * are

predetermined and not affected by real shocks. If the nominal exchange rate is fixed so that

                                       P
purchasing power parity holds, S =        , then asset markets will achieve complete risk sharing.
                                       P*

So fixed exchange rates are optimal.

       This model is also apparently consistent with the empirical evidence that consumer prices

are unresponsive to exchange rate changes in the model. The law of one price does not hold in

the model: Ph ≠ SPh* and Pf ≠ SPf* .


                                                 15
       Corsetti and Pesenti (2001) develop a model of “partial” pass-through of exchange rates

to final consumer prices. Ex ante, firms may pass-through only a fraction λ (taken to be

exogenous) of any exchange rate change to consumer prices. The PCP model is one extreme in

which λ = 1 , and the LCP is the other extreme in which λ = 0 . They examine optimal monetary

policy, and the optimal degree of exchange-rate flexibility in this framework. Since Corsetti and

Pesenti assume goods are sold directly to consumers (as do OR, and Devereux and Engel), it

seems as though the empirically relevant case is the one in which λ is nearly zero since pass-

through to consumer prices is very small in the short run.

       Corsetti and Pesenti show in their model that optimal policy minimizes a function of the

“output gap” and deviations from the law of one price. The output gap is “the distance between

actual and equilibrium employment levels.” In the context of the model above, the equilibrium

employment level in the home country is the flexible price level of L . OR (2000a) show that in

the PCP setting, the flexible price level of L is attainable under floating exchange rates when

policy is set as described above: M = k / η and M * = k * / η * . That policy allows the terms of

trade to change exactly as under flexible nominal prices, so labor demand in home and foreign

industries is the same as under flexible prices. That is, it eliminates the output gap. Since the

law of one price holds for all goods in the PCP model, we can conclude from the theorem of

Corsetti and Pesenti that such a policy is optimal.

       But it is not always the case that eliminating the output gap is the optimal feasible policy.

Corsetti and Pesenti’s theorem implies that policy makers can improve welfare by using

monetary policy to help eliminate deviations from the law of one price. Sometimes there is

tension between that goal and the goal of eliminating the output gap. The Corsetti and Dedola

(2001) model, discussed below, is an example where monetary policy can eliminate the output



                                                 16
gap with sufficient exchange-rate flexibility, but where that policy is not optimal because it

leaves intact deviations from the law of one price that would exist under flexible prices.

       Sutherland (2001) derives results that are similar to Corsetti and Pesenti: when the degree

of pass-through is close to unity, exchange-rate flexibility is desirable. Sutherland shows that

when we let leisure enter the utility function in a more general way (i.e., not the quasi-linear

specification of the model of section 2), that exchange rate flexibility may be desirable for a

small open economy even when pass-through is low. When the elasticity of substitution between

leisure and consumption is high, stabilizing the exchange rate may reduce the average terms of

trade for the small country. This occurs because the optimal ex ante price of exports is sensitive

to the degree of exchange rate volatility. Of course, this is quite a different case for exchange-

rate flexibility than the one advanced by Friedman.

       In essence, Devereux and Engel (2001) take the evidence against the law of one price for

consumer goods as support for the position that nominal exchange rate changes are not capable

of achieving desirable relative price changes. But there are other ways to interpret the evidence

that do not rely on LCP behavior. We turn to a few of these alternatives.



6. Shipping Costs

       The evidence on deviation from the law of one price for consumer goods uses data that is

not refined enough to distinguish between domestically produced goods and imported goods.

Even relatively narrowly defined goods, such as in the studies of Parsley and Wei (2001a,

2001b) do not make this distinction. A box of facial tissue (one of the goods in the Parsley and

Wei, 2001a, study) bought in Japan may be imported or not, and it probably is not exactly the

same brand and type of tissue that is purchased in the U.S.




                                                17
        One explanation for why the law of one price fails for tissues is that Japanese and

American consumers are consuming slightly different products. That is, suppose there are two

types of facial tissue, one produced in the home country and the other produced in the foreign

country. Assume no difference in tastes, but assume there are shipping costs as in OR (2000b).

With CES utility and an elasticity of substitution between types of tissues greater than one, home

residents will spend a greater share of income on the home-produced good. If the elasticity and

the per-unit transport costs are high enough, foreign goods may constitute a small share of

overall consumption and thus a small share in the measured price of home-country tissue

consumption. The converse will characterize the foreign country. So, the law of one price may

hold literally for specific types of tissues, but may fail grossly for the price index of tissues.

        Let Pi be the price of a particular good, such as facial tissues. However, Pi is itself an

index over the price of two types of tissues – one produced at home and one in the foreign

country. Suppose home and foreign households have the same preferences for facial tissue:

                                                                        λ
                                              λ −1             λ −1         λ −1
                                  C i = æçαC iH λ + (1 − α )C iF λ ö÷              ,
                                         è                          ø

where the i subscript is for the good “facial tissues”, of which there are two types: H for home

and F for foreign. Let the per unit iceberg transport cost for exported goods be δ > 1 . Suppose

the law of one price holds for the prices not including transport cots. We have PiH* = δPiH S and

PiF = δSPiF* . The rest of the macro model is the same as specified above.

                                                                   = α λ δ 1−λ S λ −1 PiH*1−λ + (1 − α ) λ PiF*1−λ   )   1

The pass-through elasticity for the home country, for example, is

                                                 (1 − α ) λ δ 1−λ S 1−λ PiF*1−λ
                                     ε=                                               .
                                          α λ PiH1−λ + (1 − α ) λ δ 1−λ S 1−λ PiF*1−λ

For λ > 1 , ε → 0 as δ → ∞ . If the foreign good is a sufficiently high substitute for the

domestic good, then if the cost of the foreign good is high enough there will not be much effect

of exchange rates on home consumer prices. The point here is that the empirical studies of

consumer prices cannot measure the price of imported goods specifically. They only measure

prices of (sometimes very narrowly defined) categories of consumer goods. The price indexes of

these categories may not be very responsive to exchange rate changes.

       Here we have a model in which the nominal exchange rate can play the role of adjusting

                                                                            PiH     P*
relative prices. Exchange rate flexibility allows                               (or iH* ) to adjust to changes demand. The
                                                                            PiF     PiF

model also fits the stylized fact that measured consumer price levels do not respond much to

exchange rate changes.

       But the problem with this model is that the reason there is so little pass-through of

exchange rates to consumer prices in the home country is that foreign goods are a small share of

total consumption. In fact, ε measures not only the elasticity of consumer prices with respect to

a change in the price of foreign goods; it also measures the share of foreign goods in

expenditures. So pass-through can only be small in this model if the expenditure share on

                                                                    19
foreign goods is small. The case for floating rates is weak in this case. Floating rates might be

needed to achieve optimal relative price adjustments, but those relative price adjustments are not

very important to the functioning of the economy in this model.

        In fact, Obstfeld and Rogoff (2000b) reason that the low pass-through to consumer prices

could not be fully explained by transportation costs, and that some other factors must be at play.



7. Non-traded Distribution Services and PCP

        One possible explanation for the apparent non-responsiveness of consumer prices to

exchange rate changes is that CPIs measure a basket of both prices of consumer goods and the

distribution services that bring the goods to consumers. The argument is that the law of one

price might very well hold for the actual physical good (as in PCP models), but the measured

consumer price includes the price of the distribution service which is nontraded and for which

the law of one price need not hold. (See, for example, McCallum and Nelson, 1999.)6

        Let the home price of imported good i be a composite of a traded goods price PiF for

which the law of one price holds, PiF = SPiF* , and the price of a nontraded distribution service,

PiN :


                        (

If PiF* is fixed in foreign currency terms, the pass-through of exchange rates is given by:

                                                   (1 − α ) λ S 1−λ PiF*1−λ
                                       ε=                                         .
                                            α λ PiN1−λ + (1 − α ) λ S 1−λ PiF*1−λ

As α → 1 , ε → 0 . That is, as the share of the nontraded distribution service increases toward

unity, the pass-through elasticity falls toward zero.

6
  The model of OR (2000a) could be interpreted this way. The “final good” in that type of model is a composite of a
traded home-produced good, a traded foreign-produced good and a nontraded distribution service.

                                                                    20
        To flesh out this model a bit, assume the market for traded goods is competitive, and that

it takes a single unit of labor to make a good. So, PiF* = W * , and for goods produced in the home

                           PH   W
country, PiH = W . Then       =    . Under nominal wage and price flexibility, we have
                           PF SW *

PH  η
   = *.
PF η

        Suppose instead that nominal wages are fixed ex ante. Goods markets are competitive, so

PiF* = W * and PiH = W , which implies that PiF* and PiH are also fixed. To achieve the flexible-

price outcome when nominal wages are fixed, we need nominal exchange rate flexibility and

monetary policy in which M t = k / η and M * = k * / η * . This is in essence a version of the PCP

model. But, the final consumer price does not show complete pass-through because of the

distribution costs.

        As in the model with transportation costs, if the nontraded marketing services are such a

large component of the cost of consumer goods that we barely observe any effect of exchange

rate pass-through, then the physical import must not be a very important component of our

consumer basket. Even if exchange-rate flexibility is desirable for achieving relative price

adjustments, it is not very important.

        There is no requirement that there be only one explanation for why there is little response

of consumer prices to exchange rates. Perhaps a combination of the model involving nontraded

distribution services, and the model with transportation costs (from section 6) would bring us

close to a description of the real world: one in which pass-through to consumer prices is small,

but imports are not a negligible fraction of consumption.

        Corsetti and Dedola (2001) take a special case of the above model in which the elasticity

of substitution between the physical product and the distribution service is zero, so that the

                                                21
traded good and the non-traded distribution service must be combined in fixed proportions. In

this model, the distribution sector is competitive, so the final goods price is equal to the cost:

PiF = PiF + σPiN . However, Corsetti and Dedola do not assume that the law of one price holds

for the traded good. That is, they do not have PiF = SPiF* . Instead, the exporting firm, which is a

monopolist, marks up the price optimally. So, if it takes one unit of labor to produce the physical

good in the foreign country, and θ (> 1) is the elasticity of demand for the product, Corsetti and

                                                                                  θ æ      σ    ö
Dedola show that the optimal price set by the exporter is: PiF =                     ç SW + PiN ÷ . The final
                                                                                         *

goods price is then given by PiF =
                                               θ
                                              θ −1

                θ

elasticities are smaller than unity. Actually, the pass-through to the final good would be exactly

the same if the producer incurred the distribution costs itself, rather than selling to a distributor.

But Corsetti and Dedola want to explain the observations that (1) there is less than 100 per cent

pass-through to imported goods prices, but (2) more pass-through to imported goods prices than

to final goods prices.

           In this model, if wages were flexible, and using the general model of section 2, relative

                            W           η
wages are given by                  =      . As Corsetti an Dedola demonstrate, if nominal wages are fixed
                           SW   *
                                        η*

ex ante, but the exchange rate is freely floating, then the flexible-wage allocation can be

achieved through the inward-looking monetary policies that have M = k / η and M * = k * / η * . 7


7
    This is true assuming the values of the constants are chosen appropriately, of course.

                                                           22
       The fact that the law of one price does not hold for traded goods implies that the flexible

exchange-rate policy might not be optimal. As Corsetti and Dedola point out, the Corsett-Pesenti

theorem shows that the monetary authorities face a trade-off when there is price discrimination.

They want to use monetary policy to eliminate the output gap (i.e., achieve the flexible-price

allocation), but they can also use monetary policy to help eliminate the distortionary failures of

the law of one price. An inward-looking non-cooperative monetary policy that seeks only to

achieve the flexible-price allocation and allows the exchange rate to float freely may be less

desirable than a cooperative policy that to stabilizes exchange rates some extent and helps

eliminate international price differences.

       Nonetheless, if this model is the sole explanation for the observed low pass-through

elasticities, it would require the distribution sector’s cost component, σ , to be very large.



8. Price Discrimination

       In Corsetti and Dedola’s model, firms set goods prices flexibly, but segment home and

foreign markets so that the law of one price fails for traded goods. Their model has the feature

that the optimal mark-up varies with the exchange rate. However, in their set-up, the difference

in local distribution costs is important in the failure of the law of one price. Another approach in

which exporting firms actively price discriminate is that of Bergin and Feenstra (2001).

       In their model, preferences are not CES but instead translog. Assume that all goods are

tradable, and that each good requires a unit of labor to produce. Further, assume as in section 7,

that nominal wages are fixed ex ante (home wages fixed in the home currency and foreign wages

in the foreign currency.)

       Assume that there are N goods produced in each country, a fraction 1 − φ of which are

                                         ~
tradable. Thus in each country there are N = (2 − φ ) N different goods that are consumed.

                                                 23
Under symmetric translog preferences, the unit expenditure function is defined by (here I follow

Bergin, 2001 and Bergin and Feenstra, 2001):
                                         ~                 ~   ~

       The elasticity of demand for each product is 1 + ~ , where ϕ i is the expenditure share
                                                        Nϕ i

on product i. The expenditure share depends on the prices of all goods:
                                                ~
                                      1         N         γ ln( Pj ) γ

       Bergin (2001) shows that the price set by firms depends on costs and on prices of

competing goods. The foreign firm selling traded goods sets different prices for sale to foreign

households ( PF* ) and home households ( PF ):

                                   (2 − φ )(1 + γ )              (1 − φ )γ
                        PF* =                         W* +                       PH* .

                             (2 − φ )(1 + γ )                             γ
                PF =                                  SW * +                                PH .

Using similar equations for the home country, we derive:

                                æ    γ 1−φ ö * æ γ 1−φ ö
                         PF* = çç1 −           ÷÷W + çç              ÷÷(W / S ) .

                           PF = çç1 −           ÷÷ SW * + çç              ÷÷W .

       Here we see that if nominal wages are fixed ex ante, the elasticity of pass-through is less

than unity. The elasticity is given by




                                                      24

As long as γ > 0 , this ε is less than unity. Note however that the foreign price of the foreign

good is also sensitive to the exchange rate. In fact, if all goods were traded ( φ = 0 ), the law of

one price would hold for these goods. Thus, substantial deviations from the law of one price

require that there be a large proportion of goods that are traded (and that γ > 0 .) But in this

model, those nontraded goods are not necessarily distribution services (as in the models of

section 7), but can be any nontraded product or service.

          While Bergin (2001) is a model in which all nominal prices are flexible, and Bergin and

Feenstra (2001) takes an approach that is somewhat non-comparable to the other models, it

appears we can draw conclusions similar to those in Corsetti and Dedola (2001). Namely, if

wages were flexible, and using the general model we have set up earlier, relative wages are given

     W            η
by            =      . If nominal wages are fixed ex ante, but the exchange rate is freely floating, then
     SW   *
                  η*

the same relative wage can be achieved through the inward-looking monetary policies that have

M = k / η and M * = k * / η * .

          But in this case, while flexible exchange rates can achieve the same relative wage as

under complete price and wage flexibility, they are not a perfect substitute for wage and price

flexibility. Specifically, they cannot yield the same terms of trade as under flexible prices

because of the incomplete pass-through. For the home country, the terms of trade are:

                                    æ         γ     1 ö             æ γ        1 ö

                                                         25
With flexible prices and wages, and using the general model of section 2, the terms of trade are:

                                        æ         γ     1 ö * æ γ                1 ö

But no policy for exchange rates can achieve those terms of trade when W and W * are fixed.

           This model requires further study. It seems likely that some exchange rate flexibility

would be desirable, but since the flexible-price allocations are not obtainable, the exact form of

optimal monetary policy is not immediately obvious.



9. Imports as intermediates

           Obstfeld (2001) models imported goods as intermediate products. They are combined

with products produced locally to make final consumer goods (which are nontraded). There is

complete pass-through of exchange rates to imported goods prices in this framework. That is,

the price of imported goods is set in the producers’ currencies, so the imported price varies one

for one with the exchange rate. But imported goods are not sold directly to consumers. The

price of the final good is set in the consumers’ currencies.

           This model, then, is completely consistent with the observation that consumer prices do

not respond much to exchange rate changes in the short run. But there is still an important role

for exchange-rate flexibility in changing relative prices. The final goods producer faces a

“sourcing” decision – to use imported intermediates or locally produced intermediates. There is

not perfect substitutability between the two, but there is some.8 So, a nominal exchange rate

adjustment can change the price of imported relative to locally produced intermediates.

    Specifically, in Obstfeld’s framework there is a unitary elasticity of substitution.

                                                             26
       There is a single final consumer good, sold by a monopolist that buys intermediate inputs

in competitive markets. The price of the final good in the home country is P , and it is fixed in

home-currency.

       The cost of producing the good is not fixed ex ante. The cost is given by:

                                  (

Here, PH is the price of the home-produced intermediate good. That good is produced using a

variety of labor inputs. In the Obstfeld set-up, each household is a monopoly supplier of a

unique type of labor. Nominal wages are fixed ex ante. The intermediate goods market is

competitive with free entry. The price, PH , is in principle flexible but under competitive

conditions it is equal to the ex ante fixed nominal wage (given the normalization that the total

number of units used to produce one unit of intermediate is one.)

       Likewise, PF* is the price of the foreign produced intermediate in the foreign currency.

The structure of the foreign intermediate market is the same as in the home market, which

implies that PF* is fixed ex ante in the foreign currency. The home-currency price, PF = SPF* ,

changes with the exchange rate.

       Under flexible nominal prices, using the general model of section 2, we find

monetary policy of the form M = k / η and M * = k * / η * , the flexible price equilibrium can be

mimicked. Indeed, Obstfeld demonstrates that prices and allocations are identical under flexible

prices as under sticky nominal wages with this inward-looking monetary policy that has

exchange rate flexibility.9

         Obstfeld and Rogoff (2000) present evidence that shows there is much more pass-through

of exchange rates to imported goods prices than to final consumer prices. While the pass-

through is certainly not 100 per cent (as in the model just described), there appears to be a

sufficient degree of pass through to allow for a significant expenditure-switching effect

following from nominal exchange rate changes.

         An important aspect of the Obstfeld (2001) model is the idea that there are final goods

producers or distributors who can substitute between locally produced and imported

intermediates. Devereux, Engel and Tille (1999) take an approach that is quite similar to

Obstfeld (2001). However they take the limiting case of the cost function in which the elasticity

of substitution is zero. That is, their model can be interpreted as one in which the distributor

combines imported goods and locally produced goods in fixed proportion.10 In that case, of

course, there is no possibility of substitution between imported goods and local goods when the

exchange rate changes, even though there is complete pass-through of the exchange rate to

imported prices.

         Potentially there are wealth effects from exchange rate changes in this case. The demand

for imported goods is fixed because their price is fixed in consumers’ currencies and the

distributor cannot substitute toward locally produced goods.                          When the home currency

depreciates, it raises the price that local distributors must pay for imported goods and lowers

9
   In fact, in terms of real variables and prices of output, the model is isomorphic to the PCP model of Obstfeld and
Rogoff (2000a).
10
    That is not exactly the set-up in Devereux, Engel and Tille, but there is little difference in substance between the
model I describe here and their precise model.

their profits. Foreign distributors have a windfall gain. In Devereux, Engel and Tille (1999),

these profit effects are not consequential because of their assumption of complete markets. But

Tille (2000) investigates the importance of these wealth effects on equilibrium demands. These

wealth effects, however, are a completely different channel through which exchange rates affect

equilibrium than the relative price effects that are so important to the Friedman-Feldstein

analysis.

        The model of Devereux, Engel and Tille (1999) is best described as one in which imports

are primarily branded final goods. The distributor cannot substitute any local product for that

brand. That is, a Toyota dealer cannot substitute a Chevrolet Lumina for a Camry if the yen

becomes too expensive. The Obstfeld (2001) model is best thought of as a model in which the

consumer cannot differentiate between local and imported sources of inputs. Perhaps the typical

product in this set up is a can of beans, which may be filled with either imported or locally grown

varieties.

        The empirical question is to what extent substitution occurs at some stage before the good

reaches the consumer.      For the question of exchange-rate flexibility, the key is whether

substitution can occur between imported and local products. That is, if the U.K. is considering

adopting the euro versus keeping an independent pound, the question is whether in response to a

pound depreciation British consumers can substitute toward British goods. Let me clarify what

by way of an example. Suppose the imported good is wine. If the euro appreciates relative to

the pound and dollar and thereby raises the pound price of French wine (as in the PCP

specification), then British might substitute away from French wine toward American wine. But

for that margin of substitution, the flexibility of the pound/euro rate does not matter at all. Even

if the pound/euro rate were fixed, the price of French wine would rise relative to American wine.

The question is the degree to which a euro appreciation leads British distributors to substitute

                                                29
away from goods produced on the Continent toward U.K. produced goods. If a large degree of

such substitution occurs (as in the Obstfeld (2001) model) then exchange-rate flexibility is

desirable. If little such substitution occurs (as in Devereux, Engel and Tille (1999)), then there is

not so strong a case for an independent currency with freely floating rates.



10. Conclusions

       The famous case for flexible exchange rates advanced by Friedman (1953) is based on a

view that appears at odds with empirical evidence. Friedman’s approach assumes that nominal

prices are set in producers’ currencies, and exchange rate changes are passed through completely

to final users of the goods. Thus an exchange rate change delivers a relative price adjustment

between foreign and domestically produced goods.

       Recent theoretical papers confirm Friedman’s policy prescription under his assumption

about goods pricing.      Empirical evidence appears to contradict this assumption, because

consumer prices are not very responsive to exchange rates. If there is no effect of exchange rates

on prices that are paid by demanders of goods, then the exchange rate does not play the role in

adjusting relative prices that Friedman posits. However, we have seen that there are several

interpretations that still assign an important expenditure-switching role to the exchange rate, yet

can reconcile the evidence of low exchange rate pass-through to consumer prices.

       In many cases, nominal exchange-rate flexibility is a perfect substitute for nominal wage

and price flexibility. If exchange rates are allowed to adjust freely, the same real allocations are

achieved as under price and wage flexibility. But even so, Corsetti and Pesenti (2001) raise

doubts as to whether full exchange-rate flexibility is optimal. In cases where there are deviations

from the law of one price, some control of the exchange rate might be desirable even if it moves

the economy away from the flexible-price, zero output gap equilibrium.

                                                 30
        It is sometimes argued that in the presence of local-currency pricing, there is a prima

facie case for stable nominal exchange rates. Volatile nominal exchange rates can lead to large

short-run deviations from the law of one price when goods prices are set in consumers’

currencies. So, the case is made that fixing the exchange rate at the appropriate level can

eliminate the distortion that arises when consumers face different prices for identical goods. But

Engel and Rogers (2001) demonstrate that the logic of this argument is not airtight. Fixing the

exchange rate, or joining a currency union, entails altering monetary policy, which in itself has

welfare implications.        That paper produces a simple example to show that the loss of

independence of monetary policy might entail a cost equal in size to the welfare costs of

deviations from the law of one price.11

        The example of Engel and Rogers (2001), as well as all of the models discussed here

assume that the exchange rate is driven by monetary and real factors, and there is no significant

role for speculative bubbles. If bubbles are important in determining exchange rates, then

perhaps a stronger case for fixed exchange rates or currency union can be made. Bubbles would

cause real distortions, especially under local currency pricing. Friedman (1953) was aware of

this, but defended floating exchange rates with his well-known refutation of the possibility of

destabilizing exchange-rate speculation (p. 175):

        “People who argue that speculation is generally destabilizing seldom realize that this is
largely equivalent to saying that speculators lose money, since speculation can be destabilizing in
general only if speculators on the average sell when the currency is low in price and buy when it
is high.”

Friedman, of course, was writing at a time when the world had limited experience with exchange

rate flexibility. Perhaps his conclusions would be less sanguine in view of our experience with

floating exchange rates in the post-Bretton Woods era.

11
    Devereux and Engel (2001) find fixed exchange rates are optimal under LCP when monetary policy rules are
optimal. The example in Engel and Rogers (2001) is one where exchange rates are fixed but monetary policy rules
are suboptimal.

                                                      31
       The new open economy macroeconomics has given us a structured way to think about the

issues that are important when considering the desirability of floating exchange rates versus

currency union. Unfortunately for policy makers facing a near-term deadline for choosing an

exchange-rate system, our knowledge has not advanced far enough to offer a firm

recommendation backed up by appropriate theory. We will undoubtedly see many advances in

this area of research over the next decade, further refining the models to determine exactly what

matters for the choice of exchange rate regime. In addition, the models point the direction for

empirical researchers to take to gather the precise information we need to calibrate the size of the

expenditure-switching role for exchange rates.
