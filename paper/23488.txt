'Notice and Choice' has been a mainstay of policies designed to safeguard consumer privacy. This
paper investigates distortions in consumer behavior when faced with notice and choice which
may limit the ability of consumers to safeguard their privacy using field experiment data from the
MIT digital currency experiment. There are three findings. First, the effect small incentives have
on disclosure may explain the privacy paradox: Whereas people say they care about privacy, they
are willing to relinquish private data quite easily when incentivized to do so. Second, small
navigation costs have a tangible effect on how privacy-protective consumers' choices are, often in
sharp contrast with individual stated preferences about privacy. Third, the introduction of
irrelevant, but reassuring information about privacy protection makes consumers less likely to
avoid surveillance, regardless of their stated preferences towards privacy.

1     Introduction

Since the initial formalization of privacy policy towards consumer data in the Privacy Act
of 1974, there has been an emphasis on ‘Notice and Choice’ to safeguard privacy. ‘Notice’
gives consumers information about data collection and use, and then consumers make a
‘Choice’ about whether or not to allow their data to be collected or used in that way. These
mechanisms may not be sufficient. In this paper, we present evidence about a variety of
distortions in the notice and choice process, relating to consumer decisions to share data and
choose more or less privacy-protective technologies.
    To do this we use data from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology digital currency
experiment where every undergraduate student at MIT was offered in the fall of 2014 $100
in Bitcoin (Catalini and Tucker, 2017). The main focus of the experiment was establishing
a cryptocurrency community at MIT. However, as part of the experiment, students had to
make at least three digital privacy choices: Whether they wanted to disclose the contact
details of their closest friends; whether they wanted to maximize the privacy of their trans-
actions from the public, a commercial intermediary or the government; and whether they
subsequently wanted to take additional actions to protect their transaction privacy when
using Bitcoin. We use randomized elements of the experiment, often not directly focused
on the question of privacy itself, to understand how responsive this demographic is to small
changes in incentives, costs and information.
    The first randomization offered 50% of the students a small incentive in the form of
pizza in exchange for the emails of their friends. The original goal of this randomization
was to reconstruct accurate social network information on participants to study Bitcoin
adoption on campus. However, it also allows us to examine the effect of small incentives on
the willingness to disclose information. The second randomization changed the ordering of
wallet technologies and the amount of information given about these wallets. We exploit this



                                                1
variation to test whether students’ choices of wallets were consistent with their stated privacy
goals, and whether increasing transparency about the wallets’ privacy features improved
privacy outcomes. The last randomization was whether or not students were exposed to
information about the possibility of using encryption to protect their initial disclosure of
information to us. Our prior was that this additional information would have increased
participants’ attention to privacy issues. We investigated whether the additional text made
students more likely to protect their privacy from the public by obfuscating their transactions
on the Bitcoin public ledger, from the intermediary by not revealing additional identifying
information to wallet provider, or from the government by not linking their Bitcoin wallet
to a traditional bank account which is subject to government oversight.
   We have three main findings. First, the effect small incentives have on disclosure may
explain the privacy paradox: Whereas people say they care about privacy, they are willing
to relinquish private data quite easily when incentivized to do so. Second, small frictions in
navigation costs surrounding privacy choices can have large effects in terms of technology
adoption, even in the presence of transparent information about the privacy consequences
of those choices. Third, our information treatment on encryption - possibly by giving par-
ticipants an illusion of protection - surprisingly did not increase privacy-enhancing behav-
ior as we expected, but actually reduced it. After being randomly exposed to irrelevant,
but reassuring information about a tangential technology, students were less likely to avoid
surveillance in their use of the technology. In all these cases, privacy-decreasing decisions
take place regardless of stated preferences for privacy.
   This paper contributes to three main literatures.
   The first stream is a growing literature that uses field experiments to explore the conse-
quences of psychological, cognitive and social factors on economic choices (Harrison and List,
2004; Gneezy and List, 2006; DellaVigna and Malmendier, 2006; DellaVigna, 2009; DellaV-
igna et al., 2012; Landry et al., 2010; Allcott and Rogers, 2014). In particular, our results


                                               2
on the ordering of digital wallets and on the effect of additional transparency on privacy
outcomes relate to previous research that has highlighted the role of defaults, salience, and
limited attention on individual choices (Madrian and Shea, 2001; Ho and Imai, 2008; Chetty
et al., 2009; Bertrand et al., 2010).
   The second literature is a policy-oriented literature on notice and consent (Posner, 1981;
Acquisti et al., 2016). Work in computer science has tended to suggest that the failure of
notice and consent lies with firms who purposely obfuscate their privacy notices (McDonald
and Cranor, 2009), and that if presented with transparent information, consumers would
make the right privacy choices (Tsai et al., 2011). Echoing this literature, legal commentary
on notice and choice has tended to emphasize failures on the part of firms to be sufficiently
transparent and compliant with existing policy (Marotta-Wurgler, 2016; Reidenberg et al.,
2016). By contrast, our paper suggests that compliance with notice and consent may still
not achieve the policy goal of protecting consumer privacy: Due to the effect small frictions
can have on shifting consumer behavior away from privacy preferences, consent may not
actually reflect true consumer intent.
   Another more general contribution of the paper to this literature is to emphasize that
practically, the choice about whom to keep data private from is more complex in a world
where an individual has to rely on a custodian to store their digital data, whether it be a
firm, the government, or an open-source community. This differs from earlier privacy work
on notice and consent, which focused on the question of protecting consumer privacy from
commercial firms, and where the choice was whether to generate data in the first place.
   The third literature is a literature on the privacy paradox. Though the term ‘privacy
paradox’ has often been used loosely by policymakers and commentators to cover the general
mismatch between stated privacy preferences and behavior, the academic literature has been
squarely focused on the disconnect between stated privacy beliefs and behavior on social
media websites (Gross and Acquisti, 2005; Barnes, 2006). The most similar paper to ours is


                                             3
(Adjerid et al., 2013), which shows, in the context of a lab experiment regarding a university
social media site, that misdirection encouraged students to volunteer more sensitive academic
data. We extend this literature beyond social media, and not only document it using field
experimental data, but also show that consumers deviate from their own stated preferences
regarding privacy in the presence of small incentives, frictions and irrelevant information.
   Though there are policy implications of our paper, it is important to emphasize that
our empirical results can be used to support two highly contrasting stances towards privacy
protection.
   The first policy stance is that our results could be taken as suggesting that consumers’
revealed behavior regarding privacy – as revealed by their stated privacy preferences in our
surveys– is slanted away from their actual normative preferences (Beshears et al., 2008).
This might suggest that consumers need to be protected from themselves, above and beyond
the protection given by a notice and choice regime, to ensure that small incentives, search
costs or misdirection are not able to slant their choices away from their actual normative
preferences.
   The second policy stance our results document is that there is a disconnect between stated
privacy preferences and revealed preference, but that revealed preference is actually closest
to the normative preference. When expressing a preference for privacy is essentially costless
as it is in surveys, consumers are eager to express such a preference, but when faced with
small costs this taste for privacy quickly dissipates. This would suggest that basing privacy
protection on stated preference data regarding privacy expressed in surveys is misguided,
especially since such policies have been documented to impose costs on firms (Miller and
Tucker, 2011; Kim and Wagman, 2015).

2         Empirical Setting and Data

In the Fall of 2014, the MIT Bitcoin Club raised capital from a group of alumni to give each of
4,494 MIT undergraduates $100 in Bitcoin. We emphasize that the aim of this experiment
was not to study privacy. Instead, the objective of the students was to jumpstart the
ecosystem for the digital currency on campus, and expose their peers to the opportunities
enabled by cryptocurrencies.1 However, as part of the signup process, participants were
asked for their preferences for privacy, and then subsequently had to make choices regarding
what data they provided and how privacy-protecting their subsequent technology choices
were. This presents a unique opportunity to explore disconnects between stated privacy
behavior and actual privacy choices.
        Our data covers the 3,108 undergraduates that signed up for a digital wallet. Partic-
ipation ranged from 79% among first year students to 62% among fourth year students.
International and biology students were slightly less likely to participate (61% and 59% re-
spectively), and enrollment was highest (80%) among electrical engineering and computer
science students. About a third of the students in the data (32%) had strong self-assessed
programming skills (‘Top Coders’), and 55% were male. We complement this survey data
that we collected when students signed up for their bitcoin with demographic information
about the students provided by the Institutional Research section of the MIT Office of the
Provost. Descriptive statistics for our sample are shown in Table 1.
        To compare students’ stated preferences for the privacy features of digital wallets to
their revealed preferences, before students selected a wallet we asked them to rate multiple
privacy dimensions as part of the sign up process. In particular, students had to rate wallets
in terms of their traceability by peers, the wallet service provider, and the government.2
    1
     In another paper we evaluate the effect of identity and delay on the diffusion and cashing out process.
In terms of use of Bitcoin, by the end of our observation period (February 2016), 13.1% was regularly active,
39% of students had converted their bitcoin back to US dollars (‘Cash Out’), and the majority of participants
(47.9%) was still holding on to their original bitcoin. (Catalini and Tucker, 2017).
   2
     The survey questions asked how important the privacy features of a digital wallet were on a scale from

                                                     5
We use the students’ answers to divide the sample into high versus low taste for privacy
from each one of the three audiences.3 According to the answers (see Table 1), 38% of
students had high taste for privacy from their peers (‘High Privacy from Peers’), 55% from
intermediaries (‘High Privacy from Intermediary’), and 42% from the government (‘High
Privacy from Government’).
    We also build measures of the students’ degree of trust in different institutions for financial
services in the same way.4 Based on the responses, 51% of the sample had high trust in the
government (‘High Trust in Government), 26% in a startup (‘High Trust in Startup’), and
43% in a retailer (‘High Trust in Retailer’) to provide services such as digital wallets, credit
or debit cards, or mobile payments.
    There were three randomizations within the experiment that we focus on since they
have implications for privacy. The first is whether being given a small incentive to provide
friends’ emails changed behavior (‘Incentive Randomization’, randomly shown to 50% of the
sample, see Figure A-1b). The key dependent variable for this part of the analysis is a binary
indicator equal to one if the student provided us only with invalid emails for their friends
(All Invalid).
    The second randomization we use was the random ordering of wallets as a source of
exogenous variation in wallet choice. This allows us to look at the propensity of students to
select a wallet that maximized privacy on different dimensions as a function of the order in
which wallets were presented on the page. Figures A-3a and A-3b are two examples of this
randomization.
1 (not at all) to 5 (very important). The dimensions used were: “Trackability of your transactions by the
government”, “Trackability of your transactions by the service provider”, “Trackability of your transactions
by your peers”. The order the features were listed in was randomized.
   3
     Students who do not answer a specific question are grouped in the high privacy part of the sample, as
not answering could be a reflection of their privacy attitude. Results are robust to including them in the
opposite group or removing them.
   4
     The relevant survey questions asked participants “To what extent do you trust the following entities to
provide financial services such as digital wallets, credit or debit cards, or mobile payment services?” - and
the scale used was from 1 (not at all) to 5 (to a great extent).



                                                     6
        The third randomization we used was whether or not we included an additional text
about encryption. This ‘Encryption Randomization’, was randomly shown to 50% of the
sample, and is depicted in Figure A-5. The text highlighted how ‘Pretty Good Privacy’
(PGP) software can be used to ensure the security of communications between a sender and
a receiver through encryption. We measured responses to this randomization by observing
whether or not students took one of three actions to reduce the possibility of subsequent
surveillance. The first outcome we use is whether students performed any coin mixing to
make it more difficult for the public to trace their transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain.
Mixing is the act of pooling one’s transactions together with others, so that inputs and
outputs are more difficult to link to a single entity on the Bitcoin public ledger. In the
absence of mixing, it is relatively easy to track entities across transactions (Athey et al.,
2016). The second measure captures whether students using a bank-like digital wallet such
as Circle or Coinbase, also revealed additional, identifying information to the intermediary
(either a mobile phone number or their home address). The third measure is a dummy
equal to one if participants linked their wallet to a traditional bank account, making it
possibly easier for the government to link their Bitcoin transactions to their transactions in
fiat-currency.



3         Results

3.1        Small Money

When asked by the National Cyber Security Alliance (NCSA) in a survey,5 60% of consumers
said that they would never feel comfortable sharing their list of contacts if asked. In the same
survey, information about one’s contacts ranked as the second most private piece of data,

right below social security numbers (68% would never share their social security number
when asked).
       In order to study the diffusion of Bitcoin on campus, we needed information about the
participants’ social ties. This posed a challenge, as it is difficult to collect accurate social
network information without relying on Facebook Connect, an option that was discarded
in this context to avoid attrition due to privacy concerns. Aware that simply asking about
the email addresses of one’s friends would give us poor coverage, we decided to randomly
include a question during the signup process for 50% of our sample that incorporated a small
incentive to encourage disclosure: A pizza that participants could share with their closest
friends. This allows us to compare the choices students made in terms of protecting (or not)
the privacy of their friends under the non-incentivized (‘Ask’)6 and the incentivized (‘Ask +
Incentive’) regime.7
       Our key outcome variable in this section is whether students decided to protect the
privacy of their friends by giving us invalid addresses or not. Both in the incentivized and in
the non-incentivized regime, our dependent variable is equal to one if students provided all
invalid emails, and zero otherwise. Since students could only list MIT addresses during the
sign up process, we are able to check the validity of these entries by using the MIT People
Directory.8 We focus on cases where all emails provided are invalid to rule out typing errors,
and identify the subset of students that clearly did not want to share this type of information
with us.
       In the raw data, within the subsample randomly exposed to the incentive, 5% of students
   6
      The non-incentivized question, which was presented to the full sample, used the following text: “List 5
friends you would like to know the public addresses of. We will email you their addresses if they sign up for
the directory.”
    7
      “The incentivized question, which was randomly presented to 50% of the sample, used the following text:
“You have been selected for an additional, short survey (1 question). If you decide to complete the survey,
you will receive one free pizza that you can share with your friends. List 3 friends you would like to share a
pizza with. One pizza will be on us! If you happen to talk about Bitcoin, even better!”.

gave all invalid emails under the ‘Ask’ condition, and 2.5% under the ‘Ask + Incentive’
condition (see Figure 1a). Within the full sample, 6% of students gave all invalid emails
under the ‘Ask’ condition.9 Figures 1b, 1c and 1d suggests that there is very little variation
in how the incentive affects students with high versus low preference for privacy from the
public, intermediary, or government. Instead it appears that whatever the stated privacy
preference is, students share their friends’ data when given a small incentive.
       Table 2 uses Ordinary Least Squares regressions at the student-answer level to test ro-
bustness to the inclusion of additional controls and interactions. Only the 1,543 students
that were exposed to both the incentivized and the non-incentivized question about the
emails of their friends appear in this sample (two rows for each student, i.e. one row for
each answer). All columns use robust standard errors clustered at the student level. The
incentivized condition has a large, negative effect on the probability that students will pro-
tect the privacy of their friends relative to their behavior in the non-incentivized condition.
In Column (1), the coefficient estimate of -0.0285 for ‘Ask + Incentive’ represents a 54%
decrease in the probability of all invalid emails over the baseline. In Appendix Table A-1 we
test the robustness of this result to a number of alternative explanations. For example, one
may worry that the effect is driven by students who do not value the contacts of their friends
yet because they are only three months into the program, but we do not find heterogeneous
effects by cohort. Differences in gender, expectations about the price of Bitcoin, and tech-
nology preferences (e.g. digital wallets, browsers etc.) also do not have a meaningful effect
on the impact of the incentive.
       The main result is also stable when we add in Table 2 interactions between the main effect
(‘Ask + Incentive’) and the students’ stated preferences for privacy across different audiences:
   9
    When we explore heterogeneous effects by gender, year of study, digital wallet selected, expectations
about Bitcoin, coding skills and technology preferences such as operating system or browser used, we find
no significant differences in how these subgroups respond to the incentivized regime in the raw data. In all
cases, when the request is made together with the pizza incentive, students are significantly less likely to
protect the privacy of their friends.



                                                     9
Privacy from peers (Column 2), from an intermediary (Column 3), and from the government
(Column 4). In all cases, consistent with the raw data evidence from Figures 1a to 1d, the
main effect is qualitatively unchanged and the interactions are insignificant, suggesting that
privacy-sensitive individuals do not respond differently to the incentive compared to other
individuals. Ex ante stated preferences about privacy, at least in this setting, do not seem
to separate students in terms of how they will respond to our two conditions.
   The absence of heterogeneous effects on these privacy dimensions is somewhat puzzling.
One interpretation is that this particular demographic is comfortable with sharing informa-
tion because it already enjoys limited digital privacy, and therefore incurs limited costs with
additional disclosure. To further explore this possibility, Columns (5) to (7) of Table 2 use
the same approach as the previous columns, but rely on our survey measures of trust in
different institutions for the provision of financial services which, as before, are split into
high versus low groupings. The coefficient for the interaction term for high trust in startups
and retailers is positive, although in both cases non-significant. A look at the raw data for
the subsample exposed to both regimes suggests that the sign is driven by the fact that these
students are somewhat less likely to protect their friends’ emails in the first place. Whereas
students with low trust in startups on average deliver invalid emails in 5.7% of the cases
in the non-incentivized regime, their high trust peers do so in 4% of the cases (1.7% differ-
ence, p = 0.1792). Similarly, students who trust retailers only protect the emails of their
friends in 3.9% of the cases, compared to 6.4% for the rest of the students (2.5% difference,
p = 0.0273).
   The results of this section highlight how small incentives such as a pizza can have a large
effect on decisions about privacy. While this first part of the analysis focused on the decision
to protect the privacy of one’s friends, the next two sections will directly focus on choices
that affect the focal individual, and quantify how small frictions and information can shift
individuals away from their stated privacy goals.

3.2    Small Costs

During signup, students were presented with four Bitcoin wallets, randomly ordered on the
page. The randomized order in which digital wallets were presented to the students allows
us to explore if introducing small frictions in a sign up flow can change long-term privacy
outcomes. For example, if undue haste or inattention induce students to default to the first
listed option and ignore the privacy features of each wallet, then the ranking should have a
meaningful effect on the wallet students end up using and the data they end up disclosing.
   Whereas open-source Bitcoin wallets like Electrum offer a high degree of privacy from the
government and do not require an intermediary to be used, they also record all transactions
on the Bitcoin public ledger using pseudonyms (Bitcoin addresses). Though it is in theory
possible to make it more difficult to tie addresses to entities, in practice such efforts can
be undermined: For example, Athey et al. (2016) use different heuristics and public data
sources to map pseudonyms to individual entities, and track individual transaction patterns
over time such as trading and speculation, international money transfer, and gambling.
   Bank-like wallets, instead, connect to traditional bank accounts and credit cards, offer
a mobile app, can easily convert Bitcoin to and from government-issued money, and may
provide additional privacy to their users from the public because of the way they pool
transactions within their network without recording each one of them on the public ledger.
At the same time, with bank-like wallets users need to be comfortable sharing all their
transaction data and identity information with a commercial intermediary, and possibly the
government since these intermediaries need to comply with Anti-Money Laundering (AML)
and Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations like other financial institutions.
   Students’ wallet choices therefore involve a trade-off in terms of who may have easier
access to their financial transaction data in the future.The vast majority of participants
(71%) selected a bank-like wallet and only 9% selected a wallet that is more difficult for the



                                             11
government to track because it does not rely on an intermediary.10
      Choices were strongly affected by the random ordering of wallets: When a bank-like
wallet was listed first, 78% of students selected it (as opposed to only 65% when it was listed
2nd or lower); when the open-source Electrum wallet was listed first, 12% of students chose
it, compared to only 8% when it was not. Small frictions, such as those generated by the
ranking of options on a web page, generated large differences in the technology adopted.
      Table 3 reports in regression format the effect of wallet ordering on technology choices.
Columns (1) to (3) use an indicator equal to one if the focal student selected a wallet that
does not record all transactions to the public Bitcoin blockchain. Similarly, in Column
(4) to (6) the dependent variable is equal to one if the chosen wallet does not given an
intermediary access to transaction data, and in Column (7) to (9) it is equal to one in cases
where students selected an open source wallet that is harder to track for the government.
In each OLS regression the key explanatory variable, ‘Best Not 1st’, is a binary indicator
equal to one if none of the wallets that would maximize privacy along the focal dimension
is listed first. Specifically, the indicator ‘Best Not 1st’ is equal to one when additional costs
are introduced in the selection of the optimal wallet for the specific dimension of privacy
captured by the dependent variable.
      The results highlight how the costs introduced by the random order of wallets shape
student choices: In Column (1), when wallets that would maximize privacy from the public
are not listed first, students are 13% less likely to select them, which corresponds to a 16.7%
decrease relative to the baseline. Adding an interaction between the main effect and the
participants’ stated preferences for privacy from peers, similar to what we saw in Table 2,
has little effect on privacy choices when small frictions in search costs are introduced.
      One explanation for the sizable shifts in privacy outcomes we observe is that they are
the result of participants selecting wallets under limited information. To investigate this, we

compare the baseline condition to a situation where participants had far more information
for making their choices, and see whether such information can compensate for the ranking
effects.
    A screenshot of the randomized treatment we rely on for this part of the analysis is
presented in Figure A-4: Whereas 50% of the sample only saw the names, logos and short
descriptions of the four randomly sorted wallets (see Figures A-3a and A-3b for two exam-
ples), the remaining 50% received additional information about key privacy, security and
convenience trade-offs. In particular, under the ‘Increased Transparency’ ballot screen (Fig-
ure A-4), students received information about the wallets’ strengths and weaknesses in terms
of privacy from the public and an intermediary (Column 2), data security (Column 3), data
recovery (Column 4), ability to convert bitcoin to and from US dollars (Column 5), and
privacy from the government (Column 6).
    Column (3) of Table 3 introduces the ‘Increased Transparency’ randomization and inter-
acts it with the ordering of wallets on a student’s screen. Relative to the baseline case where
the best wallet was listed first and no additional information was provided, as before, a lower
ranking induces a substantial drop in the likelihood that the participant will maximize pri-
vacy along the focal dimension. If we just look at point estimates, these results suggest that
while additional transparency can dilute a small amount of the effect of navigation costs, it
does not in any way eradicate them.
    In Column (4), when we look at maximizing privacy from an intermediary, the reduction
in the probability of selecting an optimal wallet is similar (13.2%), but this time maps to a
larger relative effect, as the probability of making this type of choice is otherwise only 28.6%.
When a wallet that optimizes privacy from an intermediary is not listed first, we observe a
46% decrease relative to the baseline. As before in Column (5), controlling for the students’
stated preferences for privacy from an intermediary and interacting it with the main effect of
the best wallet not being featured first has no effect. Similarly, when we add an interaction


                                               13
between the presence of increased transparency and the ordering of wallets, the importance
of navigation costs persists.
   Comparable effects are observed in Column (7), where a 3.8% reduction in the probability
of selecting the wallet that maximizes privacy from the government corresponds to a 31.6%
change over the case where such a wallet is listed first. Once more, controlling for stated
preferences for privacy from the government in Column (8) reinforces our main finding. Last,
in Column (6) we again show that even with increased transparency, navigation costs still
shape decision making.
   Taken together, results from Table 3 support the idea that across three different privacy
dimensions, the ordering of wallets on the sign up page, by introducing minor, additional
costs for the wallets not ranked first, had a large effect on the technology ultimately adopted
by the students. Even in an environment where students could maximize privacy in a way
that was consistent with their stated preferences, the ordering – potentially combined with
inattention or undue haste – seemed to drive many of the participants’ decisions. Across
all three dimensions, students that had high taste for privacy on the focal dimension be-
have no differently than others. Moreover, providing additional information only partially
counteracts the effect of small frictions on digital privacy choices.


3.3    Small Talk

In this last section, we study the impact of a small information treatment that explicitly
focused on privacy-protecting behavior. Under the ‘Encryption Randomization’ condition
(Figure A-5), when shown details about PGP technology, 50% of the sample was provided
with extra information on how PGP allows for secure communication between a sender
and a receiver, and reduces the ability of a third-party to intercept it. In particular, the
randomization focused on how PGP can help individuals “keep the prying eyes of everyone
from governments to Internet service providers [...] from seeing the content of messages.”

                                               14
Whereas 55% of participants initially tried this additional step of adding PGP encryption,
only 49% of those who tried succeeded, with the others falling back to the easier flow without
encryption. This is consistent with many students caring about privacy and security, but
then falling back to the most convenient options when additional effort is required, consistent
with Section 3.2.
   Though PGP encryption technology is widely used in contexts where security and privacy
are paramount, in our setting the technology did not provide the students with any additional
protection with respect to their future Bitcoin transactions. These would be still exposed
to intermediaries, governments or the public depending on the digital wallet selected by the
students. By using PGP to encrypt and sign their wallet address before communicating it to
us, students could make sure that if a malevolent actor had intercepted the communication
and replaced their address with a different one (e.g. to divert the funds), then the PGP
signature would not have matched the student’s public PGP key, allowing us to identify the
attack. Therefore, PGP was only used to secure the communication of the address to us for
the initial distribution of bitcoin. Nevertheless, students may have interpreted the additional
information about PGP as relevant for the privacy of all their future bitcoin transactions,
but in this setting it was not.
   Table 4 estimates the effect of the ‘Encryption Randomization’ on the likelihood of es-
caping further surveillance by the public, the intermediary or the government. All columns
report OLS regressions, and exclude students who abandon Bitcoin, as the privacy outcomes
studied here are not relevant for non-adopters. In Columns (1) and (2), the dependent vari-
able is equal to one if the students used a privacy-enhancing mixing service to increase the
anonymity of their bitcoin transactions. Mixing services allow users to pool their transac-
tions (multiple inputs and outputs) to make it substantially more difficult for the public
to follow the digital trail recorded on the public Bitcoin blockchain. Users may use such a
service if they are worried about the public tracking their spending or trading patterns, or


                                              15
quantifying their overall bitcoin assets. Since not all users may recognize the advantages
of using a mixing service to protect their privacy nor may know exactly how to use it, the
baseline is very low: Only 2.3% of students used such a service when not exposed to the
‘Encryption Randomization.’ The percentage goes further down because of the information
treatment, which corresponds to a 1% reduction in use, and a 45% decay relative to the
baseline. Results are noisy, possibly also because we may not be able to capture some of
the most sophisticated methods of transaction mixing or the use of less popular services for
doing so. Whereas the 1% reduction in use may seem small, it is important to remember
that overall activity with Bitcoin is also low, at 13.1%. In Column (2), when we interact
the randomization with the students’ stated privacy preferences, results are qualitatively
unchanged as in the previous tables (the main effect for the randomization is insignificant
because of the smaller sample size, but comparable in size and standard error to the one in
Column 1).
   Columns (3) to (6) of Table 4 further limit the sample to ‘Bank-Like’ wallets only, as for
these wallets we can observe the students’ decisions to disclose (or not) additional information
that may make it easier for the intermediary or the government to track them. The dependent
variable in Columns (3) and (4) is equal to one if the students did not reveal their mobile
phone number or address to the commercial intermediary, and zero otherwise. The effect
of the randomization in Column (3) is negative but small, noisy and insignificant, possibly
because of endogenous sorting into the wallet type, that is, students who selected a bank-
like wallet are already less worried about corporate surveillance to begin with. Adding the
privacy preferences does not qualitatively change this finding (Column 4). Last, Columns
(5) and (6) look at the students’ propensity to not link their Bitcoin wallet to a traditional
bank account, making it more difficult for the government to tie their bitcoin transactions to
their government-issued-currency ones. Consistent with the previous results, the encryption
randomization – potentially because it gave the students a perception of protection from


                                              16
initial interception – made it 3.8% less likely that the student would later try to escape
surveillance from the government. When we interact the main effect with the students
privacy preferences, results are consistent with privacy-sensitive students reacting less to the
randomization, although estimates are very noisy.
    Overall, while only suggestive because of the smaller sample size, taken together the
results of this section highlight potential unexpected consequences of providing additional
information on privacy protecting behavior. In our context, the discussion of how PGP
technology can help consumers avoid initial interception - although irrelevant with respect
to the privacy of future bitcoin transactions - seems to have increased disclosure by our
participants towards the public, the intermediary and the government.



4     Conclusions

The privacy policy of both the US and OECD has focused on the idea that with enough
transparency and enough choice consumers would make better privacy decisions. We explore
consumers’ attitude and revealed preferences towards digital privacy in the context of a large-
scale experiment involving all MIT undergraduate students. We take advantage of the nature
of the underlying technology (Bitcoin) to explore how this is moderated by preferences for
privacy from a commercial firm, the government or the public.
    Our results highlight a digital privacy paradox: Consumers say they care about privacy,
but at multiple points in the process end up making choices that are inconsistent with their
stated preferences.
    The implications of our findings for policy are nuanced. Our finding that small incentives,
costs or misdirection can lead people to safeguard their data less can have two interpretations.
On the one hand it might lead policy makers to question the value of stated preferences for
privacy when determining privacy policy. On the other hand, it might suggest the need for


                                              17
more extensive privacy protections, from the standpoint that people need to be protected
from their willingness to share data in exchange for relatively small monetary incentives.
   Moreover, whenever privacy requires additional effort or comes at the cost of a less
smooth user experience, participants are quick to abandon technology that would offer them
greater protection. This suggests that privacy policy and regulation has to be careful about
regulations that inadvertently lead consumers to be faced with additional effort or a less
smooth experience in order to make a privacy-protective choice.

     Notes: The dependent variable in all columns is equal to one if the focal student only provided invalid entries when asked about the emails of her friends (either in the

     randomly exposed both to the non-incentivized condition (‘Ask’), and the incentivized one (‘Ask + Incentive’). All columns show OLS regressions with robust
     standard errors clustered at the student level. Student-level variables capturing preferences for privacy and trust in different types of institutions are based on survey
     questions administered during registration. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1

     to access transaction data. In Columns (7) to (9), it is equal to one if the student selected Electrum, a wallet that is more difficult for the Government to track relative
     to the other featured ones. The key explanatory variable, ‘Best Wallet Not 1st’, is a binary indicator equal to one if none of the wallets that would maximize privacy
     on the focal dimension captured by the dependent variable is listed first on the wallet selection page. ‘High Stated Preference for Privacy’ is a dummy equal to one if
     the participant has high stated preference for privacy on the focal dimension (i.e. privacy from the public in Columns 1 to 3, from an intermediary in Columns 4 to 6,
     from the government in Columns 7 to 9). ‘Increased Transparency’ refers to the randomized condition (50% of the sample) in which the list of wallets was shown along
     with key privacy, security and convenience trade-offs. All columns use OLS regressions with robust standard errors. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1

     Notes: The dependent variable in Columns (1) and (2) is equal to one if the focal students used a Bitcoin transaction mixing service to protect their privacy on the
     public Bitcoin blockchain. In Column (3) and (4), it is a binary indicator equal to one if they did not reveal their phone number or street address to the intermediary
     managing their digital wallet in the cloud. In Column (5) and (6), it is equal to one if the students did not connect their digital wallet to a traditional bank account,
     making it harder for the government to link their Bitcoin transactions to their government-issued-currency transactions. The ‘Encryption Randomization’, presented
     in Appendix Figure A1, was randomly shown to 50% of the sample. ‘High Stated Preference for Privacy’ is a dummy equal to one if the participant has high stated
     preference for privacy on the focal dimension (i.e. privacy from the public in Columns 1 and 2, from an intermediary in Columns 3 and 4, from the government in
     Columns 5 and 6). All columns use OLS regressions with robust standard errors. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1

Notes: The dependent variable in all columns is equal to one if the focal student only provided invalid entries when asked
about the emails of her friends (either in the non-incentivized or in the incentivized condition). The sample only includes the
1,543 students (50% of participants, two observations per individual) that were randomly exposed both to the
non-incentivized condition (‘Ask’), and the incentivized one (‘Ask + Incentive’). All columns show OLS regressions with
robust standard errors clustered at the student level. Student information (Year, Male) is provided by the MIT Office of the
Provost, Institutional Research. Variables about the students’ coding ability (Top Coder) and expectations about the future
price of Bitcoin (Expected Price Decay) are collected through the registration survey. ‘Bank-Like wallet’ is equal to one if the
students selected a digital wallet provided by a financial intermediary. ‘Open Source Browser’ is equal to one if the student
signed up for the study using an open-source browser. Student-level variables capturing preferences for privacy and trust in
different types of institutions are based on survey questions administered during registration. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1
