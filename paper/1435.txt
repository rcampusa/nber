             On the Theory of Optimal   Taxation in a Growing     Economy



                                      ABS TRACT



      This   paper considers the   following    question: Would a "golden rule"

capital accumulation policy of equating the marginal         product   of capital

to the rate of growth of population be appropriate in a mixed economy in

which the government does not have direct control over resource alloca-

tion but can use distortionary taxes to obtain resources for augmenting

the private capital stock?

      The   key result derived here   is that   the   golden rule level of

capital   intensity remains optimal. if the tax structure that prevails at
the equilibrium does not alter the individual labor supply. This is true
even if the constancy of labor supply represents a balancing of income
effects and substitution effects of a distortionary tax. In contrast, if
the form of the tax and the nature of the utility function imply that labor

supply is distorted, the optimal capital intensity will in general not

correspond to the golden rule level.

     In a centrally controlled economy, a government that wanted to
maximize the steady state value of the utility of a representative
individual would divide national resources between consumption and

capital accumulation to equate the marginal product of capital to
the rate of growth of population (Phelps, 1961). Would such a
"golden rule" capital accumulation policy be appropriate in a mixed
economy in which the government does not have direct control over
resource allocation but can use taxes to obtain resources for

augmenting the private capital stock? Surprisingly, this

fundamental question in the theory of optimal taxation has not
previously been addressedJ

     The present paper shows that the golden rule of the centrally

controlled economy may or may not be appropriate in a mixed economy
and that whether it is or not depends on the behavior of labor

supply and on the nature of the available tax. The key result is

Krugman and Lawrence Lindsey.
  'Diamond (1963) showed that government debt imposes a burden on
future generations wherever the golden rule conditions does not hold
but he did not go on to examine the question of optimal tax policy.
Barro's (1979) discussions of optimal debt assumes explicitly that
changes in government capital accumulation would be completely offset
by induced changes in private capital accumulation; I shall ignore such
induced intergenerational transfers in the present study. Atkinson and
Sandmo (1980), Ring (1980) and others discuss how the optimal mix of
consumption and income taxes depends on whether the economy is at the
golden rule point but do not consider whether it is optimal to use a
distortionary tax to achieve the golden rule level of capital intensity.

that the golden rule level of capital intensity remains optimal if
the tax structure that prevails at the equilibrium does not alter
the individual labor supply. The paper demonstrates that this

condition is satisfied for all individual utility functions if

the government taxes only to affect aggregate capital intensity.

More generally, however, if the government must raise tax revenue to

finance government spending, the golden rule condition is not
optimal unless either the labor supply is exogenously fixed or the

combination of the tax structure and the utility function keeps the

individually chosen labor supply unchanged.

     The basic framework of this paper is an overlapping

generations model of steady state growth. Individuals work in the
first period of their lives and are retired in the second period.
The government can levy a tax on their labor income and use the

proceeds to augment private capital accumulation.2 The individuals
divide their after—tax earnings between first period consumption and

saving for second period consumption, choosing in a way that
maximizes their lifetime utility. The government's problem is to

set a tax rate that maximizes steady state utility subject to the

government's budget constraint, the capital accumulation relation,

and the behavior implied by individual utility maximization.
     Section 1 begins the paper with an analysis of the command
economy. This provides a framework for describing the technical

assumptions and derives the optimum conditions when the government
has direct control over all resources. The second section then

    2This could take the form of either government investment or
lending by the government to private firms. It is the opposite of
government debt creation.

 examines a mixed economy with individual saving decisions but a
 fixed labor supply.  In Section 3 the assumption of a fixed labor
 supply is dropped and it is shown that the golden rule level of

capital intensity remains optimal unless the tax structure is
constrained to distort labor supply in equilibrium.    The fourth
section then abandons the assumption of a log—linear utility

function that was used in Sections 2 and 3 and derives the

optimality of golden rule capital intensity without any restriction

on the individual utility function. It is clear that this general
result depends on the absence of any government spending. The fifth

section therefore extends the analysis to an economy in which taxes

must also finance government spending. In this context, golden rule
capital intensity is optimal only if the taxes required to finance

government spending would not alter the supply of labor.
1. The Command Economy

     Consider an economy of identical individuals each of whom lives
for two periods. At tine t there are Nt young individuals

("workers') and Nt(l+n)l older individuals ("retirees"), reflecting

the fact that the population grows at rate n. Each worker supplies
an amount of labor, £ $ and enjoys leisure 1—9,; retirees supply no

labor. The total capital stock is K; the capital per unit of labor
will be denoted k = K/N

     Production is governed by a constant return to scale
technology. Output per unit of labor is f(k), output per worker is

£f and the narginal product of capital is f'

     In steady state growth the rate of increase of the capital
stock must equal the rate of increase of the population:
                                 —4—
It/K =   n.
          This implies that capital accumulation per worker,
k/N = nK/N = nki. The resources available for consumption
                                                             by
workers and retirees are equal to the difference between
                                                           output per
worker and capital accumulation per worker:

                        c2
 (1)              c1 + ___     = jf— nk2.
                        1 +n



where c1 is the consumption per worker and C2 is the consumption per
retiree. The l+n term reflects the fact that there are 1+n times as
many workers as retirees.

       If the utility of a representative individual is written

U(c1, c2, 1—2.), the government's problem is to choose c1, C2 and

to maximize this utility subject to the constraint of equation 1.

Alternatively, using that constraint to substitute for C2 restates

the government's problem as maximizing U(c1, (l+n)(if-n]cQ-c1), 1—i)
with respect to c1, 9. and k. The first order condition with respect
to k is

(2)                   t32L(1+n)(f'_n) = 0,



which implies that capital accumulation should be extended until the
golden rule intensity (f'=n) is achieved.
       The derivative with respect to c1 implies


(3)                  U1 —              =   0,
                             (l+n)U2


indicating that the marginal rate of substitution between first and
                                        —5—
    second period Consumption should equal 1+n.           This is Samuelson's
    (1958) famous biological interest rate for optimal intertemporal
    allocation of consumption. When the marginal product of capital
 equals the population growth rate this is equivalent to equating the
marginal rate of substitution to 1+f'

           The derivative with respect to the individual labor supply
imp 1 i e s


    (4)    (1+n)(f—nk)1J2 — U3 =   0,
indicating that the marginal value of leisure most equal the
increased utility of consumption that is possible when leisure is
reduced by one unit. Mote that this is not the
                                                               increased output (f)
but the increase in output minus the increased capital accumulation

required to keep the capital per unit of labor unchanged (nk). This
is multiplied by 1+n because, since the older generation is smaller
by a factor of l+n, the amount available for consumption per retiree
is greater by a factor of l+n.

           Examining the special case of the log-linear utility function

provides explicit solutions that are of interest in themselves and
also useful for comparison with the results of sections 2 and 3.                 If
u =       a Zn c1 + (1—a) Zn c2 +       Zn   (1—fl, or, equivalently, u = a Zn
+    (1-   a )Ln[Zf—nkZ—(1—n)c1] +      Zn   (1-fl, we obtain directly that £ =
(1+p)—l, c1 =      a (f—nk)/(1+n) (l+p)      and c2 = c1(1—   a )(l+n)/a   The
golden rule condition follows from the derivative of u with respect
to k as(l-a)(f'-n)Z/(Zf_njçE_(1+)c1) 0. Note that, in taking this
derivative, c1 and £ can be taken as constants since the government
sets them independently.

2. A Mixed Economy with Fixed Labor Supply

      In a mixed economy the government does not have direct control

over individual consumption and labor supply but can only affect the
allocation of resources through the tax system. I shall assume that
the available tax is a linear tax on the labor income of workers.

If the wage rate is w per unit of labor, the tax collected per
worker may be written (l—&)w+t                      Note that if 'r > O,'r is a
lump-sum tax while if t < 0, t represents an exclusion of —                 t 1(1— 0
and makes the tax progressive. Similarly, 1— 0 is the marginal rate
of tax and 0 > 1 implies that the government subsidizes wages.

      Each young individual works a fixed amount, Z               ,   and therefore
has after—tax income of e w £ —        t   .   If   first period consumption is c1,
savings are owz—T—ci, and second period consumption is
(5) c2 = (ow'   —   t—
      The total stock of privately—owned capital (Kg) is equal to the

savings done by the young of the previous generation:
(6) K = (ow     — -r —
                         c1)N(1+nY'-.
The growth of the capital stock is therefore
(7)     =   ( en— r—c1)nN(l+nY-
since N = nN.   In steady state equilibrium, the privately—owned
capital grows at the rate of population growth,                        = n or,

substituting into 7 and writing k =
                                                    K/N9.

(8)
                                  2.




In steady state the private capital stock will have to be a constant
fraction of the total capital stock. Denoting that fraction by
                                       —7—
 (i-y ) so that k = (1—y )k, equation 8 can be rewritten as

 (9)   (l—y )xt= (0 w—r—c1)(1+n)l.
     The growth of the government—owned capital stock (Kg) is equal
to the sum of the return on the existing
                                         government capital (Kgf')
and the tax collections [(l—0)wZ+ TIN:3
 (10) kg =   Kgf'      + [(l—S)wZ+t IN.
Since Kg/Kg = n is a condition of steady state equilibrium, we
obtain
                               N
(11) n =     f'       + [(1—s )wt+r]   —,
                                          Kg
or, writing k = Kg/N

(12) (n—f')ykt= (l—8)wi+r
Note that if f' > n, a positive level of government—owned capital

implies that taxes are negative or, alternatively, that taxes are
needed only if there is a government debt, i.e., if K9<o. This
reflects the fact that the return on the government's
                                                               capital (Kgf'
exceeds the amount that is required to maintain a constant ratio of

government capital per worker (nKg) .          Of course, with a positive
level of government spending, the optimal level of taxes and

government capital may both be positive.
       Combining equations 9 and 12 eliminates the capital division
constant ( y      )   and defines the capital accumulation constraint:

(13) —[(1—0)wL+t] = (f'—n)[ki—(0wt—'r1-c1)(l+nyl]
The term in square brackets on the right hand side of the

equation is the government capital stock per worker, that is, the


        assume here that there is no government spending.
                                    —8—
difference between the equilibrium capital stock per worker and the

private saving per worker. This government capital stock earns a
return at rate V but requires investment at rate n to maintain

itself. Thus the right hand side is the governments excess capital
income. The left hand side is the value of those transfers ex-
pressed as negative tax revenue.

       The individual selects c1 to maximize utility or, using
equation 5,



(14)              u(c11c',) =   u[c1,   (   6wZ—t    —
                                                         c1)(l+f')]

Knowing that c1 will be selected in this way, the government
selects U to maximize this same utility function subject to the

capital accumulation constraint of equation 13. Stating the problem
in this way implicitly takes t          as   a fixed progressivity parameter of
the tax system. Alternatively, U and t               can   be selected simul-
taneously subject to the capital accumulation constraint. With the
supply of labor assumed constant, there is no difference between
these two definitions of the problem since any combination of U and
T   that   yields a given revenue has the same effect on economic
activity.

       To derive specific results requires an explicit parameteri—
zation of the utility function. The log—linear utility function

adopted in the previous section implies that the individual chooses
c1 to maximize



(15)           u = in    c1 +   (1-a)       Zn [(   UwL—t—c1)(l+f')J
                                              —9—
The individual's chosen value of c is thus
 (16)

The government's problem is therefore to choose e and t                      to   maximize


(17)       u =   athta(ewL—t )] + (l—                    )m [(1—a )(Ow-T )]
                   a    )   tn (1+f'   )

or
(18)              u =       0          (Owt—t)      +    (1-a)j   (1+f)
where 0    is   a constant.

        The maximization of u is subject to the capital accumulation

constraint (equation 13) that establishes the link between the tax

parameters and capital intensity and therefore between the tax
parameter and w and f' of equation 18. Equation 13 can be rewritten
in the form
                                                 w 2+ (f'—n)k Z
(19)             OwL—t =               -_______________________
                                                    a )(1+n)

  The marginal productivity conditions imply that the wage rate per
per unit of labor is w = f—kf' . The numerator of equation 19 can

therefore be rewritten as (f—kf')t +                     (f'-n)kj = (f-nk)   and equation
19 becomes
                                                  (f-nk)
(20)               @wL—t = _____________________
                                           1+(f'-n)(l—   cz)(1+nY1
Note that, with fixed £ ,                  the expression Ow t—t is a function of k
only. What matters in the utility function of equation 18 is not
the specific values of e and r but the combination OwR.—t and
equation 20 establishes that this can be written as a function of k

only.

        Substituting 20 into 18 gives the final form of the
government's maximization:
                                   — 10 —


                               (f—nk)
(21)      u =    + Zn                              +   (i—ct )m (l+f').
                         l+(f'_n)(l_ct )(l+n)
Although       the government does not control Ic directly, the policy

problem can be solved by obtaining the value of k that maximizes
equation 21 and then using 20 and the condition w =             f—kf'   to find
values of 0 and r that are consistent with that value of Ic.

        Setting the derivative of u with respect to k equal to zero
yields:

              f'—n            (1— a) (l+n)f"                (1— a )f"
(22)                 —                                  +               = 0.
          (f—nk)           l+(f'—n)(l—a )(l+nY4             l+f'

It is immediately clear that this is satisfied at f'n. This
establishes that in this case the golden rule level of capital

intensity remains appropriate even though the government does not
have direct control over resources but can influence the capital

accumulation process only by a tax on wage income.
        Two implications of this   result are of particular interest.
Since    f'=n at the optimum, it    follows from equation 14 that the
worker will allocate his net wage income between current consumption

and future consumption until u1 =       (l+n)u2.       This was the first order
condition in the command economy for the optimal allocation of

consumption between workers and retirees. Thus if the government
establishes the correct macroeconomic level of capital intensity,

the individuals will independently and automatically establish the
correct allocation of income between present and future and
therefore between young and old.
                                   — 11 —

      The second implication of f'=n follows directly from
                                                           equation
13. At the optimum, the government would collect no tax and make no
transfers: (1—0 )wL + T =0. The government's capital stock is
then self—sustaining since the earnings on that capital are then
just sufficient to finance the growth of the government's capital
stock at rate n: Kgf' =
                         nKg
                             =
                               (g/Kg)Kg = kg. This striking result
should not be misunderstood. it should first be reiterated that in

this economy there are no government services to be financed7 the
condition (1— 0 )w £ + t = 0 implies only that there should be no taxes

to finance government capital accumulation and no distribution of
the earnings of that capital. It should also be emphasized that
this is only a condition of the steady state optimum. To reach this
optimum, the government must accumulate its capital stock through a
period of positive taxation.4

3. A Mixed Economy with Variable Labor Supply

      The analysis of the previous section will now be extended by
assuming that both the government and the individual maximizes


(23) u =   aj c1 + (1— a) nc2 + pin (1—i).
As before c2 = ( OWL— r—c1)(l+f'). The individual's optimization

problem again yields


    4This assumes that, in the absence of government capital
accumulation, the level of capital intensity would be less than the
golden rule level, it is of course possible that the private
equilibrium will involve excessive capital accumulation (f' < n) and
that the optimal government cpaitla stock is negative, i.e., a
government debt . But for plausible paramete± values the private
equilibrium will imply f' > n. A sufficient but not necessary
condition for this is that k > f at the purely private equilibrium.

The government's problem is to maximize 26 subject to the capital
accumulation constraint of equation 13.

       Note first that if the available tax is restricted to a

proportional tax on labor income, i.e., if t = 0, equation 26

reduces to equation 18 of the previous section. Since the capital

accumulation constraint is unchanged, the optimum condition is again
f'=n. The crucial reason for this identical result with endogenous
labor supply is found in equation 25. With t =0, £ = l/(1+ç3) and is
independent of the proportional tax rate 0 .           Thus, in this case the
variable labor supply is irrelevant and the individual always choose

the optimal labor supply.5 Of course, this insensitivity of the
labor supply to a proportional tax is a property of the log—linear
utility function.

       In an alternative case in which the government is constrained
to collect a lump sum tax (    t >0),       or to make a lump sum transfer to

everyone (   1<0),   the first order condition for maximizing u


   5Note that L= l/(l+ç3) is the optinum chosen in the command
economy.
                                   — 13 —
 in   equation 26 with respect to k does not yield f'n. If the tax
system must distort the supply of labor, the golden rule is no
longer an optimum condition.

       A more general and more interesting constraint is to require
that any tax revenue that is raised be raised in a particular

non—proportional way, e.g., a progressivity requirement that sets
the ratio of —     to (1— 0)w.6 This case is interesting because, as
noted in Section 2, when f'n there is no need for any positive or
negative tax revenue; the income that the government earns on its

capital is just sufficient to finance the required steady state

accumulation of government capital. But if no tax revenue or
transfer is needed, the tax parameter values r= (1—0 )     =0   does not
violate any progressivity requirement. So reaching a steady state
equilibrium with the first best allocation of resources is not

inconsistent with a requirement that any tax must be collected (or
transfer made) in a progressive way.

4. Generalizing the Results

       Although the specific results derived in Sections 2 and 3

reflected the assumption of a log—linear utility function and a
linear wage tax, the analysis suggests that the basic conclusions
can be extended to a more general specification of the problem. It
is clear from the derivation of equation 13 that this capital

accumulation constraint can be written more generally as


(27) —T =   (f'—n)[kZ   —   (w £—T—c1)(l+n)1]




    6Progressivity as such is of no interest if all individuals are
identical, but the current analysis can be extended directly to the
case in which there is a distribution of wage rates.
                                  — 14 —
 where T is the tax collected from the workers and can be any
 function of w,   2. and c1. The significant feature of equation 27 is
 that at the golden rule level of capital intensity T is zero. Thus,

if the government can follow a tax and accumulation policy that

eventually leads to a capital intensity at which f'n, it is no
longer necessary to levy any tax. The reason for this is, as noted
is Section 2, that at f'=n the earnings of the government's capital

stock are just enough to finance its steady state rate of growth.
       With T=O and f'=n, the worker's problem is to maximize


(28)              u =   u[c1, (wi — c1)(1-I-n), 1—i].


This has exactly the sane first order conditions with respect to c1
as in the command economy: u1 = u2(1+n). The first order condition

with respect to Z is u3 =     (l+n)wu2.    Substituting w=f-kf' for w and
rewriting this as w =    f-nk,   we obtain u3 =   (l+n)(f'—nk)u2,   the same
first order condition as equation 4 in the command econony.

       Thus since no capital accumulation tax need actually be

collected at the optimum, any tax system that can move the capital
stock over time to the golden rule level of capital intensity can

thereby achieve a first—best optimum for the economy with any
utility function.

5. Government Spending and Optimal Capital Intensity
       Of course, taxes may also be needed in eguilbrium to finance

government outlays. If such taxes alter the supply of labor, it
will not generally be optimal to achieve a golden rule level of

capital intensity. But if the supply of labor is exogenously fixed
                                            — 15 —

 (as in Section 2) or if the utility function and the tax structure
 imply that individuals choose an unchanging level of labor
                                                                                   supply,
 the optimality of the golden rule capital intensity may persist.
      Consider first the case of fixed labor supply and a log—linear

utility function. If government spending does not enter the
individual utility function or enters in an additively separable
way, the individual's first order conditions will remain
                                                                              unchanged
and the government's problem will, as in equation 18, be to maximize


(29) u =    •+     Zn( OwL —-r) + (1—ct) Ln(l+f').


The need to finance government spending of g per worker changes the

government's capital stock accumulation equation to



(30) kg =   x9f'   +   [(l       0 )w £ +   t — 9JN


or, in steady state equilibrium,


(31) (n—f') k £ = (1—0 )wz +                    t— g.

The private capital accumulation condition remains unchanged in the
form of equation 9. Combining that condition with equation 31
implies the overall capital accumulation condition


(32) g =   (f'—n)[kz    —    (   QW £ —     t   -c1)(1+nY1J   +   [(1—0   )w £ +   rJ

The first right hand side term in square brackets is the

government's equilibrium capital stock per worker, i.e., the
                                          — 16 —
 difference   between the equilibrium capital stock per worker and the
equilibrium private capital per worker.                  Multiplying this by f—n
gives the government's capital income in excess of the amount that
it needs to maintain the capital stock. The second right hand side

term is square brackets in the government's tax revenue per worker.

Thus the right hand side gives the government's total net receipts
per worker that finances the government spending of g per worker.

For g>0, we can now have f'>n and positive tax revenue.

       Equation 32 can be solved to yield


                                              £ (f—nk)—g
(33)            9wj —T         =       _____________________
                                        1+(1—a )(f'—n)(1+n)1

using also w =      f-kf'     and c1 = a     (   OwZ—t   ).      Substituting    this
expression into 29 gives the government's maximand:



                        r          (f-nk)   - q
(34) u = 4, +      Zn    ___________________                   ÷ (1—a)Zn (l+f').
                        L
                          l+(l- a ) (f'-n)
                                                 (l+n)lJ
The derivative of u with respect to k gives the first order
condition


         £ (f—n)             (1— a )   (1+n)-f"                   (l—a)f'
(35) —
       £ (f—nk)—g
                    —
                                                           +                =0
                            1+(1—a) (f'—n) (1+n'                  1+f'


This is satisfied for f'n, showing that, with a fixed labor supply,
the introduction of government spending has no effect or optimal
capital intensity.
                                    — 17 —
       Two features of this result deserve comment.
                                                                First, although
the conclusion was derived for a linear wage tax, the same analysis

carries through for any tax that is a function of the wage income.

Second, it follows directly from equation 32 that, with f'=n,

government spending and taxes are equal. Any permanent increase in
government spending should therefore be financed by an equal
increase in taxes.

       Section 3 showed that, in the more general case of a variable

labor supply, the golden rule level of capital intensity will remain
optimal if the tax does not alter the supply of labor.                 This
optimality property persists if the tax is used to finance

government outlays. Introducing government outlays alters the
capital accumulation constraint but not the individual's

optimization problem. As before (equation 26), the government's
maximand can be written


(36) u =    + (l-i-p) zn( Owt —T      )   +   (l—a)n   (li-f') —p   n Ow.
If the tax is proportional (so that I           = 0), the individual's
optimization implies Z =      l/(l+p)     and 36 can be rewritten as


(37) u =    +   n Ow   +   (1—a) jn(1+f').


In place of equation 33, the capital accumulation constraint implies


(38)              9w =         [          f—nk-g(l+p)
                               I
                                   14(1— a)(f'—n)(l+n)1
                                  — 18 —

 Substituting   this into 37 gives

 (39)    u =+    Zn
                        f—nk —
                                 g(l+p)    1
                                            J   + (1—ct)   £n(1÷f').
                                 V—n) (1+n)'J


A comparison of equations 39 and 34 shows immediately that the first
order condition will again be f'=n. Thus, even with a variable
labor supply and a positive amount of government spending to be

financed, optimal government policy requires establishing the golden
rule level of capital intensity if the available tax does not alter
the actual supply of labor.

        The significance of this result follows from the empirical

finding that the uncompensated labor supply elasticity is quite
small7 and therefore that a proportional tax has little effect on

labor supply.8 If this is a valid approximation, it indicates that

the implications of the fixed labor supply case remain relevant in

considering the implications of optimal taxation and capital
accumulation.

chapter 2. Rosen (1976) shows that the labor supply elasticity of
married women is substantially greater than that of married men.
     8flausman's (1981) analysis shows that the actual progressive
income tax has significant labor supply effects even though a
