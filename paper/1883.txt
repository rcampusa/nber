            Labor Market Segmentation and the Union Wage Premium




                                  ABSTRACT


Studies of the earnings of union workers have consistently shown that they earn
considerably more than nonunion workers. This paper considers whether part of
this observed union/nonunion differential is due to unions organizing high paying
primary sector jobs. We extend our earlier work on the dual labor market in which
we used an unknown regime switching regression to identify two labor market sec-
tors -- a high wage primary sector and a low wage secondary sector. Here we es-
timate a model where worker's wages are determined by one of three wage equations:
a union wage equation, a nonunion primary equation or a nonunion secondary
equation.   If individuals are in the union sector their sector is treated as
known. If they are not then their sector is treated as unknown. Parameter es-
timates for this model suggest that union/nonunion differences are very large for
average workers even when comparing union and nonunion primary workers.

We continue to find distinct primary and secondary sectors with wage equations
similar to those that would be expected from the dual market perspective. Since
it appears that union workers may be receiving large wage premiums it seems likely
that there is non-price rationing of union jobs.     If there is, our finding in
previous papers of non-price rationing of primary sector jobs may have been due
only to the rationing of union jobs. We test for the existence of non-price ra-
tioning of nonunion primary sector employment in this three sector model and
continue to find evidence that at least black workers find it difficult to secure
primary sector employment.

I. INTRODUCTION




       There are many studies which demonstrate that workers in union   jobs earn more
than   apparently equivalent workers in nonunion jobs (Ashenfelter, 1978; Mellow,

1981; Welch, 1980; Pencavel, 1970; Kahn, 1977; Schmidt, 1978; Farber, 1980; Leigh,

1981; Podgursky, 1980; Duncan and Stafford, 1980; Duncan and Leigh, 1980; Lee,

1978; Oaxaca, 1975). Many have argued that unions are not responsible for these

higher wages, but instead unions form in jobs in which high quality workers are

employed, that is, unions organize high wage jobs. One response to this argument

is to develop models in which union status is endogenous and the unobserved fac-

tors determining union status are allowed to be correlated with unobserved worker

attributes which affect wages (Duncan and Leigh, 1980; Lee, 1978; Pencavel, 1970;

Kahn, 1977; Schmidt, 1978; Farber, 1979; Leigh, 1981; Duncan and Stafford, 1980).

When union status is treated as endogenous, statistical analysis continues to

indicate the existence of a union/nonunion wage differential. However, dual labor

market theory (Doeringer and Piore, 1971) and a number of recent mainstream the-

ories suggest that there is non-price rationing of high wage jobs (Calvo, 1979;

Weiss, 1980; Stoft, 1982; Shapiro and Stiglitz, 1984; Bowles, 1985; Dickens,

1985).     In this case, it is necessary to control not for the unobserved charac-

teristics of the worker, but for the type of job a worker is in. This paper de-

velops an approach which allows us to compare the wages received by workers in

high wage primary sector nonunion jobs with the wages received by equivalent

workers in union jobs. We continue to find that workers in union jobs receive a

large wage premium.

       Unless high union wages compensate union workers for undesirable job char-

acteristics, there must be non-price rationing of union jobs; Abowd and Farber



                                                                                     1
 (1982) and Farber (1983) provide evidence which supports the existence of ra-

tioning.     It is possible that the rationing of high wage jobs which we observe

in two previous papers (Dickens and Lang 1985a&b) is only the rationing of union

jobs. Although the numeric importance of unions has declined in the U.S. economy,

union workers continue to make up almost one-fifth of the civilian labor force

and are more important among the full-time adult male workers who comprised our

samples in our earlier studies. This paper extends our earlier work on testing

for non-price rationing of high wage (primary) market jobs to a model in which

there are three sectors of the labor force -- a union sector, and a nonunion sector

consisting of two parts, a primary sector and a secondary sector. The definitions

of the primary and secondary sectors are drawn from the literature on dual labor

markets and are discussed in greater detail in our earlier work. In essence the

primary sector consists of high wage jobs in which there are substantial returns

to human capital variables (education and experience) while the secondary sector

consists of low wage jobs in which there is little or no return to these variables.

    We estimate wage equations for each sector and treat the sector of employment

as endogenous. Thus we use an endogenous switching model. The innovation con-

sists of developing a model in which it is known if individuals are in one of the

regimes (the union sector), but if they are not in that sector, it is not known

in which of the two remaining regimes --   the   primary and secondary sectors --   they
are employed.    We estimate this system of equations using maximum likelihood.

As in our previous work, the results provide support for the existence of two

distinct   types of nonunion employment and for the existence of non-price rationing
of primary jobs.




                                                                                      2
II. THE MODEL




     Workers may be employed in either the union or nonunion sectors.     If they

are employed in the union sector, they receive a wage w. which is determined

according to the following relation



 (1) in w .      =X B + e
           U].     i U   11].




where X. is a vector of observed individual characteristics, UB is a conformable
       1.


vector of parameters and a. represents unobserved factors affecting the wage.

Workers who are not employed in union jobs may be in either of two other sectors.

We specify separate wage equations for these two sectors:



 (2) lnw .=X.B +e
           1        ip     p1.




 (3) mw51.=X.B
            15 +e 5].

where   the variables are defined analogously to those in equation (1).

    In order to conform to the dual labor market view, wages in the primary sector

should generally be higher than in the secondary sector and the return to educa-

tion and experience should be higher in the primary sector.

        Even if we were able to identify directly which nonunion workers were in

primary jobs rather than in secondary jobs, equations (1) -   (3) could not be es-
timated consistently by ordinary least squares since sector of employment may not

be exogenous. If workers were free to choose in which sector they were employed,

we would expect to find that workers with unusually high wages in union jobs would



                                                                                 3
 be more likely to be employed in those jobs and similarly for primary and sec-

 ondary sector jobs. Consequently,



  (4)       E(e.j employed in sector j)           0



and the errors in each equation (the e..s) are likely to be correlated with the

explanatory variables. This is a standard sample selection problem of the type

discussed in Heckman (1976, 1979), Lee, Maddala and Trost (1980) and Griliches,

Hall and Ilausman (1978). Solutions to this problem are well known and can be based

on either two-stage estimators as in the first three of these papers or on maximum

likelihood techniques as in the last of these papers. In either case, one begins

by specifying equations which determine the underlying tendency to be in each

sector

         This mechanism may be given a choice theoretic interpretation. If individuals

     are free to choose their sector of employment, they will choose the sector which

     gives them the highest utility. Under a set of somewhat restrictive conditions,

     we can test the assumption of free choice by comparing the parameters of the wage

     equations with those of the switching equations (5-7). The proof is provided in

     Dickens and Lang (1985a) and is not repeated here; we limit ourselves to outlining

     the assumptions and conclusions.

          We begin by assuming that individuals are wealth maximizers, i.e. that they

     are indifferent with respect to their sector of employment, and that they have

     perfect information regarding lifetime earnings in all sectors.    It is then pos-

     sible to place precise restrictions on the relation between parameters in the wage

     equations and the switching equations under either of two extreme assumptions:

     the return to experience in a sector is worth more in that sector than in any other

     sector and, as Lang and Ruud (1986) find, that individual discount rates are in-

     dependent of the Xs or, alternatively, that in each sector the wage depends only

     on total experience and not on the sector in which that experience was acquired.

     In the first case, individuals will make once and for all decisions regarding

     their sector of employment and will remain in that sector throughout their work

     lives.   In the second case, workers, choose employment in whichever sector they

     receive the highest wage at that moment. It is possible to show in the first case,

     approximating the lengths of people's working lives as infinity, that the Cs all

     equal the Bs except for the experience term (for which C should equal zero) and

     for the constant term.   In the second case, all of the Cs (including experience

     and constant terms) should equal the Bs.

         It is therefore possible to test the free choice hypothesis by testing these

     cross-equation restrictions, Of course, the assumption that individuals do not
I-

     care about their sector of employment is restrictive.     In particular, we would



                                                                                      5
expect that people care not only about their wages but also about their working

conditions. For example, if all workers prefer primary sector employment to em-

ployment in the other sectors, the constant term in C will be greater than it

otherwise would be. The C and B coefficients for schooling may diverge if more

educated workers value primary sector employment more than less educated workers

do. Thus, we would expect some divergence between the two sets of coefficients.

However, we can check whether the divergence is compatible with other evidence

on tastes for the nonpecuniary aspects of employment in the sectors.

    Whether individuals are free to choose their sector of employment or whether

there is some form of nonprice rationing mechanism, estimation proceeds in much

the same way.   If the individual's sector of employment were known, the system

of equations (1) -   (3),   (5) -   (7),   could be estimated by a straight-forward ex-

tension of the techniques developed in the papers cited above. However, in the

present case, estimation is further complicated by the absence of direct infor-

mation on whether workers are employed in the primary or secondary sector if they

are not employed in a union job. Estimation of switching models with unknown

regimes is discussed in Goldfeld and Quandt (1976).         Dickens and Lang (1985a&b)

develop and estimate an endogenous switching model with unknown regimes.

      The model developed here combines elements of switching models with known

and unknown regimes. The likelihood for individuals who are in the union sector

is the likelihood for workers in a particular sector for a model with three known

regimes. The likelihood for the primary and secondary sectors consists of two

elements of the likelihood for an endogenous switching model with three unknown

regimes. The next section develops the likelihood function formally.

IV. DATA, ESTIMATION AND HYPOTHESIS TESTING.




     The model was estimated using data from the January 1983 wave of the Current

Population Survey. The sample was restricted to employed male heads of households

who had worked more than 1000 hours during the previous year in the private sec-

tor, who were over 20 years of age and wider 65 and who earned more than the

minimum wage. The sample was further restricted to those for whom information

on all the following attributes was available: either the person's wage, or if

that was not available his normal weekly earnings and his normal weekly hours of

work, age, years of education, race, marital status, and whether or not he lived

in an SMSA. This left us with a sample of 4392. For the purpose of estimation

we constructed people's wages as being equal to their reported hourly wage if that

was available. If not, it was set equal to their normal weekly earnings divided

by their normal weekly hours of work. The standard measure of job experience was

constructed for each person in the sample as his age minus years of schooling

minus six. Dummy variables were constructed and set equal to one for those who

were white, those who had never been married and those who lived in an SMSA.

     Not all the parameters of the model are identifiable. Three of the elements

of the variance covariance matrix cannot be identified in cross-section data --


                                                                                9
s, s, and          since we never observe individuals who are simultaneously in

two sectors. In addition, only two of the C vectors can be independently iden-

tified so we normalize C0. In the absence of any other restrictions on the Cs

and Ss it is impossible to identify all the parameters of the switching equations.

Consequently we normalize     and      to equal 1.

    As explained above, the hypothesis of free choice between the sectors implies

a constraint on the values of the Cs. With C constrained to zero, free choice
                                               5

between the primary and secondary sector implies that certain elements of

C=B-B. However, this test would only be meaningful if tastes for primary

versus secondary employment did not depend on people's observed characteristics.

In fact, we would expect that they would. The difference can be thought of as

the compensating differential necessary to make the average worker of a particular

type indifferent between primary and secondary sector employment. In general it

is difficult to know a priori how the Cs might differ from B-B, but an exception

to this is the dummy variable for race. Previous studies provide evidence that

blacks prefer more stable employment (Viscusi, 1979) and have greater demand for

occupational safety (Kahn, 1983). These are characteristics which are commonly

associated with primary employment so we would expect blacks to have a preference

for primary employment. Thus we would expect that the element of C corresponding

to the coefficient of white would be less than or equal to B -B .      We   would also
                                                               ps
expect that those with more education would be more likely to prefer primary em-

ployment and thus we would expect the relevant element of C         B-B.

     The test of these two hypothesis is less than straight-forward because of

the identification problems discussed above.       In general, any one equality con-

straint on a parameter of a switching equation constitutes only a renormalization

of the likelihood function since it is then possible to remove the normalization

of the variance.   Further, it is possible that one or both of the inequality



                                                                                    10
constraints would not be binding.   In our two previous papers the C associated

with education was estimated to be less than the difference between B and B and
                                                                     p     s
the C associated with white was greater than the relevant difference when the

variance of the switching equation was normalized to equal 1. Either of the free

choice constraints could have been reconciled with the estimated values for the

Cs and Bs by renormalizing, but not both at the same time. To test the joint

hypothesis that more educated workers and blacks should have a non-negative com-

pensating difference for taking secondary employment we imposed both the equality

constraints, set the variance free, and constructed a likelihood ratio test with

one degree of freedom. The natural interpretation is that one constraint con-

stitutes a renormalization and the second a real constraint.

     The situation may also arise in which renormalizing the switching equation

to make an estimated C consistent with the values for the Bs would be impossible

since it would require the standard deviation of the conditional switching

equation error to be negative. Thus it is sometimes possible to test a single

constraint if the values for the Bs together with the free choice equality con-

straint imply that the corresponding C has the wrong sign. For example, below

we find that the C for the white dummy is positive while B-B is negative. There

is no renormalization which can make the observed coefficients consistent with

the joint hypothesis of free choice and that blacks prefer primary sector em-

ployment.   If we can reject the joint hypothesis that either B-B0 or          for

     The likelihood function was written in FORTRAN. The Berndt, Hall, Hall and

Hausman (1974) algorithm was used to find the maximum. We used the implementation

of this algorithm in Paul Ruud's GNOME program. We estimated the unconstrained

model using both analytic and numeric derivatives. Due to problems with the ac-

curacy of the approximation to the bivariate integral at extreme values we found

that the maximization algorithm was better behaved when we used numeric deriva-

tives. We also encountered several local maximums in estimating the model, though

none were qualitatively different.   The coefficient values reported below were

those associated with the maximum with the highest likelihood value. For starting

values we used coefficient estimates for the primary and secondary sector wage

equations and C derived from our previous paper (Dickens and Lang l985b) and with

coefficients for C -C derived from a standard probit on union membership and
                   up
coefficients for the union wage equation taken from OLS estimates using a union

only sample. We obtained qualitatively similar results when we started with the

same values for the primary and secondary sector wage equations and switching

equation but used the primary sector coefficients for the union sector wage

equation.




V. RESULTS




The first two columns in table 1 present OLS estimates of log wage equations for

union and nonunion workers. Except for the slightly higher coefficient on white

in the union equation these results are very similar to those obtained by others




                                                                              12
in past studies.   In general personal characteristics have a smaller effect on

union than nonunion wages.

     Turning to the switching model we began by estimating the full system with

experience and experience squared excluded from the equations measuring underly-

ing tendency to be in the primary and secondary sectors. As discussed in section

III, this specification will be appropriate if individuals are free to choose

between primary and secondary employment and if there is "sector-specific" human

capital. We then estimated the full system without these two constraints. Both

the likelihood ratio test and the Wald test reject the constraints at the .01

level. We therefore limit ourselves to discussion of the unrestricted estimates.

      As in our previous work, there is evidence of two distinct sectors in the

nonunion labor market (see Table I). In the primary sector, there is a substan-

tial return to education (6%) and to experience in a worker's early years.     In

the secondary sector, there are returns to both schooling and experience, but the

estimated return to schooling is less than half that received by primary workers,

and the returns to experience start out being less than half those received by

primary workers and peak slightly earlier. The results are therefore supportive

of the dual labor market typology although the two sectors are less distinct than

those observed in our previous studies. It appears that removing union jobs from

the analysis makes it more difficult to isolate the two sectors among nonunion

workers.

      We also confirm our earlier findings that there is non-price rationing of

employment in the primary sector.    If we were to interpret the coefficients of

the primary/secondary sector switching equation as the difference between the wage

parameters plus a compensating differential for secondary employment, our point

estimates would indicate that the desire to be in the primary sector increases

with education and   is   higher for whites than for blacks. This second finding



                                                                               13
contradicts empirical evidence presented above that blacks have stronger prefer-

ences for several characteristics of primary employment. Using the test described

above, we can easily reject the hypothesis that either the C is negative or that

B-B is positive. The Wald test takes a minimum value of 11.87 in the space of

the compound null hypothesis when B-B is 0 and C is set to .598.        The .01

critical value for the Wald statistic with two degrees of freedom is 9.21. Thus

we can reject the hypothesis that blacks preferences for primary employment are

greater than or equal to whites. Since we also wish to test the hypothesis that

more educated workers prefer primary sector employment and since in this case the

values of C and B-B are in the space of the null hypothesis a conservative test

of the two compound null hypotheses is to use the Wald value computed above and

to compare it to the critical value for four degrees of freedom. In this case

the test is no longer significant at the .01 level, but it is at the .05 level

(critical value of 9.488).

      Further evidence for the existence of non-price rationing of primary jobs

is provided by comparison of the wages individuals receive in the primary and

secondary sectors. An individual with the average characteristics of a nonunion

worker would receive $11.47 per hour in the primary sector but only $6.98 in the

secondary sector. Moreover, the expected wage in the primary sector is greater

for virtually all categories of workers.   For example, a white with no labor

market experience who had never married and lived outside an SMSA would receive

a higher wage in the primary sector if he had at least seven years of education.

Workers with labor market experience or those who have been married, live in an

SMSA or who are black receive even higher wages in the primary sector relative

to the secondary sector. We would expect that most workers would prefer primary

employment. Unless the marginal worker's preferences are very different from the

average worker's or those who are in secondary employment all would receive very



                                                                              14
low primary wages, our results indicate that people are not free to choose between

the sectors.

      Although primary workers generally earn considerably more than secondary

workers, we continue to find evidence of a union/primary sector wage differential.

The average person in our sample would earn $14.26 in a union job but only $11.32

in a primary job, a difference of 26%. Since secondary wages are even lower than

those in the primary sector our estimate of the union/nonunion difference is among

the higher estimates found in the literature (Freeman and Medoff, 1981).

      Our union wage equation also differs from those obtained by most previous

researchers. The return to schooling in the union sector is not only higher than

in the secondary sector, it is even higher than in the primary sector. In contrast

to the work cited in Freeman and Medoff (1981), we find no evidence to support

the view that unions reduce the return to schooling and thus reduce the variance

of earnings among workers with the same amount of labor market experience.      It

is interesting that although our results differ notably from the "standard"

finding in the literature, they are consistent with evidence on the union status

of workers. Farber (1983) finds no evidence that the desire for a union job or

the probability of being selected from the queue for union jobs is related to

education. Using dummy variables for several categories of educational attainment

Farber's point estimates suggest that the most educated workers are more likely

than others to desire a union job and less likely to be selected from the queue

although neither coefficient is statistically significant and there is not a

monotonic relation between education and these probabilities.              If the
union/nonunion wage differential decreased with education, we would expect more

educated workers to be less likely to choose to enter the queue for union jobs.

    The similarity between Farber's and our findings and their divergence from

those of other researchers may reflect the more complicated sector selection



                                                                                15
models we use. Farber explicitly models both the choice to enter the union queue

and the selection of workers from that queue. If the highest productivity workers

tend not to enter the queue and the lowest productivity workers are not chosen

from the queue, a single selection equation may not provide a good approximation

to the "true" model.    Although our model does not explicitly represent this se-

lection process, the presence of two selection equations allows the highest pro-

ductivity workers to be assigned to the primary sector and the lowest productivity

workers to be assigned to the secondary sector and thus our selection process may

be similar to the one in Farber's work. Analysis of our data indicates that the

average worker in the primary sector has more "human capital" than the average

worker in the union sector since the average nonunion worker has more education

than the average union worker and the model indicates that more educated workers

are most likely to be in the primary sector.

     In contrast to our results for education, our estimates do confirm previous

work which suggests that the return to experience is higher in the nonunion sector

than in the union sector. The estimated return to experience in the union sector

is about half the return in the primary sector and similar to the return obtained

in the secondary sector. As can be seen in figures 1 and 2, wages peak at ap-

proximately the same time in all thvee sectors. Maximum earnings are estimated

to be at 32 years of experience in the primary sector, 31 years in the union sector

and 29 in the secondary sector.

    Our results for experience might be taken as evidence in support of the "wage

standardization" hypothesis that unions reduce within union skill differentials.

However, our results for schooling contradict that hypothesis. Consequently they

suggest that the less steep lifetimes earnings profile in union jobs should be

attributed to some other factor. One possibility is that unionized firms nego-

tiate for less steeply sloped wage profiles.     If upward sloping wage-earnings



                                                                                16
 profiles are paid, at least in part, to solve problems of effort
                                                                      elicitation,

 quitting, or worker quality (Lazear 1981) then the payment of a union wage premium

 provides similar incentives and thus lessens the need for the age-earnings pro-

 file. (Lang, 1984).

     The final results of interest are those concerning race. In the OLS results

the coefficient on the dummy variable for race is roughly equal for the union and

nonunion samples. With our three sector model the black-white wage differential

varies considerably across sectors. Whites earn over 25% more than blacks in the

union sector and about 16% more in the secondary sector. In the primary sector

the difference is small and statistically insignificant.     In contrast to these

results, the coefficient on the race dummy is small and insignificant in the

switching equation for the union/secondary sector choice and blacks are more

likely to be in the union sector relative to the primary sector. As noted
                                                                            above,
it seems to be more difficult for blacks to obtain primary sector employment than

for whites. Interpreting these results literally it would seem that there is wage

discrimination against blacks in the union and secondary sectors, and hiring

discrimination in the primary sector. However, these results are not entirely

consistent with our past work.

      In our first study (Dickens and Lang 1985a) we found no evidence of wage

discrimination in the primary market and weak evidence that blacks received higher

wages than whites in the secondary market. In our second paper (Dickens and Lang

1985b) we found blacks earning statistically significantly lower wages in the

primary sector and higher wages in the secondary sector. Since the coefficient

estimates in the first paper were imprecise the results, though different, are

easily reconciled. The results for the current study with respect to race in the

union and nonunion primary sector may also be consistent with our previous

findings. Though we find no evidence of significant wage discrimination in the




                                                                               17
nonunion primary sector in this study, the two previous studies confounded union

and nonunion primary so their finding of significant wage discrimination could

have been due to the discrimination in the union sector    However, the finding

here of significant wage discrimination against blacks in the secondary sector

is not consistent with past studies.




VI. CONCLUSIONS




    Our results indicate that the union/nonunion differential cannot be ascribed

to the tendency of unions to organize high wage primary jobs. Most workers would

earn more in the union sector than they do in the primary sector of the nonunion

labor market. Thus, our results are consistent with observations that there is

non-price rationing of union jobs.

    The results presented here also provide support for our earlier findings that

there are two distinct sectors of the labor market, a high wage primary sector

with substantial returns to education and experience and a low wage secondary

sector with little or no return to education and experience. Evidently our pre-

vious findings were not due to our failure to distinguish between primary and

union jobs. Even when we take account of the existence of a union sector, there

are still two sectors with these distinct characteristics in the nonunion part

of the labor market.                                                    I




      Moreover our evidence continues to suggest the existence of non-price ra-

tioning of primary jobs in the nonunion sector. The rationing of primary jobs

which we found in our earlier work cannot be ascribed to the confounding of the


                                                                              18
primary and union sectors and to the rationing of union jobs. The higher wages

paid in the union sector indicate that there is probably rationing of union jobs

and that the typical worker would prefer a union job to a primary job. However,

if unable to obtain a union job, he would prefer a primary job to a secondary job.
