How Redeployable are Patent Assets? Evidence from Failed Startups

                                          ABSTRACT

Entrepreneurial firms are important sources of patented inventions. Yet little is known about what
happens to patents “released” to the market when startups fail. This study provides a first look at
the frequency and speed with which patents originating from failed startups are redeployed to
new owners, and whether the value of patents is tied to the original venture and team. The
evidence is based on 1,766 U.S. patents issued to 285 venture capital-backed startups that disband
between 1988 and 2008 in three innovation-intensive sectors: medical devices, semiconductors,
and software. At odds with the view that the resale market for patented inventions is illiquid, we
find that most patents from these startups are sold, are sold quickly, and remain “alive” through
renewal fee payment long after the startups are shuttered. The patents tend to be purchased by
other operating companies in the same sector and retain value beyond the original venture and
team. We do find, however, that the patents and people sometimes move jointly to a new
organization following the dissolution of the original venture, and explore the conditions under
which such co-movement is more likely. The study provides new evidence on a phenomenon—of
active markets for buying and selling patents—underexplored in the literature and consequential
for both entrepreneurial and established firms.

circumstances of time and place” – Hayek (1945: 524)


1. Introduction

   Entrepreneurial firms are important sources of new technologies and patented inventions.

Kortum and Lerner (2000) show, for example, that venture capital-backed startups produce three

times more patents per investment dollar than established corporations. Although some startups are

spectacular successes, many fail in their commercial pursuits and are disbanded (Arora and

Nandkumar 2011; Hall and Woodward 2010). To illustrate, Kerr, Nanda, and Rhodes-Kropf (2014)

report that 55 percent of all startups that received venture capital (VC) between 1985 and 2009 were

terminated at a loss. While prior studies show that disbanded startups are important sources of

human capital and learning spillovers for others (Knott and Posen 2005; Hoetker and Agarwal

2007; Kacperczyk and Marx 2017), little is known about the frequency and speed with which the

legal rights to their patented inventions are redeployed to new owners.

   It is widely assumed, often implicitly, that the resale market for patents is inconsequential for

failed startups and innovative activity that follows in their wake. Relative to tangible assets such as

real estate and equipment, patent rights are notoriously challenging to value and sell (Arora et al.

2004; Lemley and Shapiro 2005; Gans and Stern 2010). Even if the inventions cover technologies

that are viable on the market, follow-on use and development can be impaired without access to the

original organization and private knowledge of the team (Nelson and Winter 1982; Hoetker and

Agarwal 2007). In the extreme, patent assets could be non-redeployable in the classic sense of

Williamson (1988): rendered worthless to third parties when startups fail and teams disband. In this

scenario, the rights should either lapse into the public domain post-exit—potentially removing legal




                                              2
barriers to others for follow-on use—or remain tied to the human capital through asset purchase or

co-movement to a new organization.

    Anecdotal evidence suggests, however, that patents sometimes retain value for reasons

imperfectly tied to the original project and team. In 2005, for example, Commerce One, a software

startup with patents covering protocols used in electronic commerce, sold its patents at bankruptcy

for $15.5 million to JGR Acquisitions, a Texas-based company acting on behalf of Novell

Corporation. Novell, an established firm in the industry, reportedly purchased the patents for

defensive reasons to reduce the risk and disruption of potential lawsuits had others purchased the

rights and enforced them (Markoff 2005). More recently, LinkedIn, the social networking company,

purchased 900 patents to strengthen and diversify its portfolio of legal rights. Doing so enabled

LinkedIn to rapidly expand its portfolio size from only 36 patents in 2012 to almost 2,000 by mid-

2016, reportedly bolstering its bargaining position with other corporate patent owners (Harrington

et al. 2017).1 Although these anecdotes raise the possibility that the market for buying and selling

patents is potentially consequential both for failed ventures and surviving companies, empirical

evidence remains limited.

    This study sheds new light on the market for patented inventions by exploring what happens to

patents “released” to the market when startups fail. Do the assets tend to retain value beyond the

original venture and team? If so, which patents sell, how quickly, and who buys them?

    To investigate these questions, we track 1,766 U.S. patents originating from 285 venture capital-

backed startups that disband between 1988 and 2008 in three innovation-oriented sectors: medical


1
  According to Harrington et al. (2017), LinkedIn purchased the patents in small bundles (or “packages”) from patent
brokers and directly from owners. After reviewing 800 packages with 25,000 patents, the company bought 900 patents
in 13 deals. When purchasing, LinkedIn reportedly prioritized patents likely to be infringed by 11 corporations viewed
as “high risk” in extracting licensing fees from the company or restricting its freedom to operate in the industry. The
case study did not mention a need for access to the original inventors or team in capturing value from the purchase. For
additional discussion on the strategic value of patent portfolios for use in licensing negotiations and litigation
settlement, see Grindley and Teece (1997), Cohen et al. (2000), Hall and Ziedonis (2001), Somaya (2003) and Galasso
et al. (2013).

                                                     3
devices, semiconductors, and computer software. VC-backed companies tend to rely on patents to

protect their inventions (Kortum and Lerner 2000; Graham et al. 2010) yet, as suggested earlier,

they often fail in their commercialization attempts and cease operations (e.g., Hoetker and Agarwal

2007; Kerr et al. 2014). Selecting companies from the life sciences (medical devices) and

information technology-related sectors (semiconductors, software) provides different vantage points

for viewing patterns in the data. The sample is drawn from all VC-backed companies founded in

these three sectors between 1987 and 1999, thus providing a decade-long period for observing

dissolutions and patent sales if any. The failed startups in our sample raised $6.4 billion in equity

financing pre-exit, averaging $22.4 million per company.

    Hand-compiling and integrating multiple strands of data, we observe rich characteristics of the

startups and their patents, which patents they sell when, as well as characteristics of the buyers. We

also track environmental conditions in the broader resale market for patents using a “patent market

liquidity” measure introduced in Hochberg et al. (2017) based on the thickness of patent trading

activity in invention classes relevant for each company’s portfolio of patents. As Gans and Stern

(2010) discuss, thicker trading in the market should reduce search costs for both buyers and sellers,

potentially increasing the likelihood of sale and accelerating the redeployment process. Similar to

earlier work by Lamoureux and Sokoloff (2001, 2003) and Serrano (2010), we identify patent sales

through transactions recorded in the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) Patent Assignment

dataset.2 Finally, to capture the degree to which the value of patents originating from these firms

remains tied to the human capital post-exit, we use LinkedIn profiles and patent records to discern if




2
  The scarcity of prior empirical research on patent sales could be due to the inherent “messiness” of the USTPO Patent
Assignment records (e.g., see Serrano 2010). In 2015, the USPTO released the data in a format more amendable for
large-scale study, thus opening up new opportunities for research. Graham et al. (2015) provide a useful overview of the
data.

                                                     4
one or more of the inventors acquires the patents or moves as an employee to the purchasing

organization.

    To establish minimum thresholds in redeployment value, we follow convention in the

innovation economics literature and determine whether maintenance fees are paid to keep the rights

legally active (Pakes 1986; Schankerman and Pakes 1986).3 Unfortunately, we lack direct evidence

on the expected value at purchase since prices paid to acquire patents are typically treated as

confidential information by transacting parties (Hagiu and Yoffie 2013). If patents are purchased at

“fire sale” prices, however, the initial purchases could be followed by subsequent failure to pay the

escalating fees later required to maintain the right. Finally, to deepen our understanding of the

phenomenon and reflect upon the broader implications of our findings, we conducted 22

exploratory interviews, most of which were with intermediaries who service the patent resale

market (i.e., as brokers, consultants, or attorneys) or supply capital to entrepreneurial firms as equity

investors or lenders.4

    The quantitative patterns revealed in our data are quite striking. Of the 1,766 patents issued to

companies in our sample, almost 70% are sold. This share is highest for startups in the

semiconductor devices sector, where 87% of the patented inventions are sold post-exit, followed by

the software (74%) and medical devices (61%) sectors. The patents tend to sell quickly, within a

year of the company’s dissolution. In all sectors, the most common buyer is an operating company




3
  To keep a U.S. patent in force, the owner is required to pay maintenance fees of increasing amounts over the lifespan
of the patent. For large entities, the current fee structure is $1,600 (due 3.5 years after the patent issues), $3,600 after 7.5
years, and $7,400 after 11.5 years as listed on the USPTO.gov website. Smaller entities pay reduced rates. Unless term
extensions are granted for regulatory or procedural reasons, the maximum lifespan of a U.S. patent is twenty years from
the filing date of the application.
4
  The interviews were semi-structured, conducted in person or by phone, and lasted one hour on average. Most of the
interviews were conducted between 2014 and 2017. As reported in more systematic qualitative studies on patent
markets (Benassi and Di Minin 2009; Brassell and King 2013; Hagiu and Yoffie 2013), many brokers and consultants
we met had previously been employed in R&D, business development, or legal functions within large corporations.

                                                        5
in the same industry. Buyers typically keep the patents in force through 2014 or term expiration,

which is suggestive of longer-term redeployment value.

      Although many patent rights remain alive long after the startups shut down, they rarely follow

the original inventors. Out of 1,203 patents that sell, less than 3% (31 patents) are purchased by one

or more of the original inventors, ranging from 4% in medical devices to less than 1% in software.

Among inventors with employment histories on LinkedIn, only 13% are subsequently employed by

the organization that purchases the patents. This co-mobility percentage is slightly higher but still

low, at 20%, as evidenced by name searches in patent invention records. These statistics suggest

that, conditional on observing evidence of post-exit mobility, roughly 80% to 87% of the inventors

in our sample move to organizations other than the entity that purchases the patents.

      In summary, we find frequent and rapid sales of patent assets from failed startups to new owners

and that the rights tend to remain alive long after the original venture is shuttered. We also find,

however, that these patterns are not absolute. Some patents do not sell, some sell but not quickly,

and some travel with the original inventors to a new organization. In a final set of analyses, we

therefore explore sources of heterogeneity within the sample that might affect these outcome

variables.

      This study contributes to three streams of research that span the fields of strategic management

and economics. A longstanding literature recognizes that patent rights are strategic assets for firms,

whether as “isolating mechanisms” and “shields” against potential imitators (Rumelt 1984; Hall

1992; Teece 1986), as “bargaining chips” in negotiations with rivals (Teece and Grindley 1998;

Cohen et al. 2000; Somaya 2003), or as quality signals that help secure funds from external resource

providers (Hsu and Ziedonis 2013; Conti et al. 2013; Haeussler et al. 2014).5 Within strategic

management, our study adds to a growing call for empirical research on resource-based theory that


5
    We use the terms “assets” and “resources” synonymously throughout the paper.

                                                     6
moves beyond whether intangible assets such as patents are valuable toward a deeper understanding

of why and how such assets confer value in product markets, strategic factor markets, or both (Priem

and Butler 2001; Leiblein 2011). If patent assets are redeployable through factor markets in the

event of failure, it could stimulate investments in unproven technologies earlier in the life cycle and

potentially enable entrepreneurial firms to access debt sources of financing (de Rassenfosse and

Fischer 2016; Hochberg et al. 2017). More broadly and consistent with resource-based theory

(Barney 1986; Barney and Arikan 2001), inefficiencies and frictions in the market to acquire patent

assets provide an opportune environment for strategic gain. The evidence in our study underscores

the importance of future research on how established firms tap into this understudied factor market

for intangible assets and the tradeoffs they face when doing so.

    Relatedly, we contribute to a more targeted literature on asset redeployment. An extensive

literature in economics examines the efficiency and speed with which tangible assets such as

aircraft and equipment are redeployed to other entities when companies fail (e.g., Benmelech and

Bergman 2008; Ramey and Shapiro 2001; Gavazza 2011). Far less is known about the conditions

that affect the redeployability of intangible assets like patents. Within strategic management, a

separate body of work examines factors that affect the redeployment of tangible and intangible

assets within organizational boundaries (e.g., Anand and Singh 1997; Helfat and Eisenhart 2004;

Lieberman et al. 2017). If, as our evidence suggests, established firms actively buy and sell patents

through the secondary market, it could have important implications for the scale and scope of

internal projects.

    Finally, we contribute to a growing literature on markets for technology (e.g., Teece 1986;

Arora et al. 2004; Gans and Stern 2010). It is well established in this literature that patent rights can

facilitate the licensing and exchange of technological knowledge (e.g., Arora 1995; Gans et al.

2002, 2008; Agrawal et al. 2015). As discussed more fully in the section that follows, far less is


                                              7
known about the buying and selling of patent rights as standalone assets. We bring new evidence to

bear on this understudied exchange arena.


2. The Market for Patents: Background and Related Evidence

    Although patents are widely used to measure the innovative capabilities of firms and to trace

knowledge flows beyond their borders, they also are strategic assets that can be bought, sold, and

traded.6 A patent, if valid, confers a legal right to exclude others from making, using, or selling an

invention for a limited period of time. Patent rights are often exchanged through technology licenses

and transferred to new owners through corporate takeover markets (e.g., see Arora et al. 2004;

Agrawal et al. 2015). Although less well studied, growing evidence suggests that patent rights also

are redeployed through factor markets as standalone assets.

    Patent sales can arise for many reasons. As Kerr et al. (2014) describe, it is often impossible for

managers and investors to predict in advance whether a particular technology or new idea will be

successful. This inherent uncertainty in the process of innovation naturally gives rise to failed

attempts and abandoned projects. Even firms with promising projects can fail to survive the

competition and be driven out of business (e.g., see Hoetker and Agarwal 2007; Wasserman 2012),

potentially releasing patents at liquidation.7 When the communications company Nortel went

bankrupt in 2011, for example, the company recouped $4.5 billion through the sale of 6,000 patents

(Hagiu and Yoffie 2013). Ma, Tong, and Wang (2017) further document that public US companies




6
  Hall et al. (2001), Murray and O’Mahony (2007) and Somaya (2012) review uses of patent-based statistics in
innovation economics, organization studies, and strategic management. Prior research on the strategic value and use of
patent assets includes Grindley and Teece (1998), Cohen et al. (2000), Hall and Ziedonis (2001), Shapiro (2001),
Somaya (2003) and Graham et al. (2010). Several recent studies, which we draw upon in this section, provide in-depth
coverage of patent markets and frictions within them. See especially Gans and Stern (2010), Lamoreaux et al. (2013),
Hagiu and Yoffie (2013) and government reports by Brassell and King (2013) and the USFTC (2011, 2016).
7
  In a recent CB Insights survey, for example, founders of failed startups commonly attributed the source of failure to
non-technological factors such as poor market timing and negative team dynamics (Griffith 2014).

                                                     8
in Chapter 11 proceedings often divest portions of their patent portfolios during the reorganization

process.

    A similar dynamic can result in “mismatches” between the original inventors and those best

positioned to create and capture future value from patent rights and the inventions that they cover

(Gans and Stern 2010; Akcigit et al. 2016). Lamoreaux and Sokoloff (2001, 2003) show, for

example, that independent inventors in the nineteenth century often sold their patents to

downstream companies better positioned to develop, market, and distribute products based on those

inventions. The authors conclude that the ability to sell patents helped give rise to a class of

specialized inventors, thus facilitating division of labor in early technology markets. In the first

systematic analysis of modern markets for U.S. patents, Serrano (2006, 2010) documents that

13.5% of all U.S. patents issued between 1980 and 2001 changed owners, with higher rates for

inventions produced by individuals and smaller firms. More recently, Akcigit et al. (2016) report

that 20% of all U.S. patents issued between 1976 and 2006 transact through the secondary patent

market, often to companies that own patent rights in related areas. In combination, this evidence

suggests that patent sales are often driven by relative advantages in commercialization and other

downstream activities.8

    More controversial from a policy perspective, patent sales can also arise due to relative

advantages in patent enforcement (Galasso et al. 2013; Hagiu and Yoffie 2013). As is well known,

patent value is highly skewed and difficult to discern absent an uncertain and costly enforcement

process (Harhoff et al. 1999; Lemley and Shapiro 2005). Bundling patents in larger portfolios of

rights can reduce this valuation challenge and make it easier for firms to settle legal conflicts out-of-

court (Teece and Grindley 1998; Somaya 2003; Lanjouw and Schankerman 2004; Galasso et al.



8
 Adding further credence to this view, a recent working paper by Kuhn (2017) finds that unexpected shocks that
expand the scope of protection conferred by a patent increase the likelihood of future sale, especially for smaller firms.

                                                      9
2013). As illustrated by examples in the introduction, patent purchases can similarly serve as a form

of self-insurance: acquiring the rights ensures that others will not own them. These strategic

motives for portfolio-based trading and self-insurance are particularly prevalent in information

technology (IT)-related sectors due in part to the wide array of rights typically embedded in IT

products (e.g., see Cohen et al. 2000; Shapiro 2001; Ziedonis 2004).

   Despite recent evidence that many patents change owners, the market for buying and selling

patents is widely cast as friction-filled and inefficient. Patent rights are awarded for “non-obvious”

and “novel” inventions. This uniqueness makes it inherently difficult to value patents and find

comparable transactions. Patents also confer an exclusionary rather than an affirmatory right. In

essence, they simply provide a right to sue others. This nature of the right means that value capture

is intrinsically tied to the credibility of threats to exclude others through legal action (Lanjouw and

Schankerman 2004; Lemley and Shapiro 2005). It also means that costly-to-discern details about

the patents (e.g., the omission of prior art, poorly worded claims) can alter expectations of

successful enforcement and thus value. As one broker we interviewed put it, “when you hire

someone to inspect a house, you might learn things that shift the asking price by thousands of

dollars. When you perform due diligence on a patent, it can shift the asking price from millions of

dollars to zero.” Except in isolated instances where patents are sold at open auction or the

information is voluntarily made public, prices paid to acquire patents are not systematically reported

(Teece 1998; Hagiu and Yoffie 2013), thus amplifying the valuation challenge.

   Added complexities arise due to the specificity of patent assets. As suggested earlier, even

though patent documents codify information about the inventions, downstream commercialization

and use can be impaired without access to the private (or “tacit”) knowledge embedded in the

human capital of the inventive team (Nelson and Winter 1982; Teece 1998; Hoetker and Agarwal

2007). If value capture is strongly tied to human capital (i.e., if the assets are “human capital


                                             10
specific”), patent rights may have limited value as standalone assets if separated from the

originating team. Similarly, if value capture is tied to specific complementary assets and larger

patent bundles owned by others (Gans and Stern 2010; Hagiu and Yoffie 2013), the resale market

could be thinly traded.

   Relative to the broader market for new technologies and ideas, patent markets are less prone to

failure due to the classic Arrow Paradox problem, where sellers fail to reveal information due to

risks of expropriation (e.g., see Teece 1986; Arora 1995). By definition, the assets offered for sale

are all patent-protected. Prior studies suggest, however, that disclosure challenges continue to

plague the secondary patent market, albeit in a different form. As Benassi and Di Minin (2009)

report, established firms prefer to “close deals in the dark” so that inventors do not ask for

“unrealistic compensation” for their patents (pp 78-79). Hagiu and Yoffie (2013) similarly report

that the widespread use of third parties to broker patent transactions is partly due to this strategic

concern among deep-pocketed buyers. In our interviews and unprompted, an executive at a large

corporation underscored the importance of this point, while noting an additional value of anonymity

as a potential buyer: “When we look to buy patents, we’re often searching for rights that help us

protect new products under development. We reveal our buying priorities to a few brokers that we

trust, and they find and screen patents on our behalf.” As noted in Benassi and Di Minin (2009) and

Hagiu and Yoffie (2013) and much like real estate brokers, patent brokers are paid a commission on

the deal.

   Before turning to our empirics, it is important to acknowledge a recent shift in the structure of

U.S. patent markets and to discuss insights from our interviews that have received less systematic

coverage in the strategic management and innovation economics literatures. The structural shift is

well described by Hagiu and Yoffie (2013). Although buying and selling activity in patent markets

remains largely intermediated through a fragmented array of brokers, the past few decades have


                                              11
given rise to large “aggregators” and “non-practicing entities” (NPEs) that buy and bundle patents

on behalf of others but do not otherwise compete in product markets.9 Intellectual Ventures is a

prominent example. Founded by former executives from Microsoft Corporation, Intellectual

Ventures (IV) spent over $2 billion between 2000 and 2012 to amass one of the world’s largest

portfolios of 35,000 patents, primarily covering software, semiconductor and mobile computing

inventions (Hagiu and Yoffie 2013). As Hagiu and Yoffie (2013: 60) note, “[b]ecause of its size,

Intellectual Ventures can single-handedly create liquidity in the market.” Due to ongoing policy

concern about patent sales to NPEs (USFTC 2011, 2016; US White House 2013), we investigate

whether the buyers of patents originating from failed startups in our sample are NPEs or operating

companies.10

     Finally, qualitative insights from our interviews resonate with key points in Gans and Stern

(2010) and Hagiu and Yoffie (2013) that: (a) trading frictions in the patent resale market are alive

and real, (b) brokers play an important role as intermediaries in this market, and (c) anonymous

“eBay”-type platforms for patent sales have largely failed to gain traction. In addition, we were

struck by an apparent maturation in the market and the wide range of organizational and

institutional innovations that seem to facilitate the redeployment of patent rights from failed startups

to new owners. First, as documented in recent studies by de Rassenfosse and Fischer (2016) and

Hochberg et al. (2017), many VC-backed startups pledge their patents as collateral to secure

financial resources from lenders. In the event that the startups fail, the lenders have strong

incentives to liquidate the assets to minimize their losses. Relatedly, a support tier of financial

10
   The main policy concern is that NPEs that threaten to enforce their patents (also referred to as “patent assertion
entities”) can extract “excessive” rents through litigation and holdup, thus potentially imposing an ex post tax on
innovation. This concern is weighed against the possibility that these entities increase liquidity in the resale market for
patents, which could enable innovation-oriented companies to recoup more returns from failed projects and stimulate ex
ante investment incentives. Some NPEs such as United Patents and RPX serve a “clearinghouse” role and do not
enforce their patents. See Hagiu and Yoffie (2013) and USFTC (2016) for more in-depth discussion.

                                                     12
intermediaries has emerged that helps mitigate the “ex ante valuation” problem for lenders, with

some companies agreeing to purchase patents for an agreed-upon price should a creditor default on

the loan (Brassell and King 2013). de Rassenfosse and Fischer (2016) provide survey evidence that

lenders to growth-oriented startups (i.e., “venture lenders”) consider the “salability” of patents when

deciding to supply funding. In other recent work and consistent with observations in Hagiu and

Yoffie (2013), Hochberg et al. (2017) document that trading activity in the market for U.S. patents

has intensified during the decade of the 2000s, particularly for IT-related inventions. The authors

further suggest that greater liquidity in the market stimulates lending to VC-backed companies, thus

providing indirect evidence that expectations of patent sales “matter” to these external capital

providers. Direct evidence on whether patents are redeployable as standalone assets in the worst-

case-scenario that startups fail remains lacking, an empirical gap that we seek to help fill.


3. Sample, Data Sources, and Main Variables

    What happens to patents “released” to the market when startups fail? Do the patents tend to

retain value beyond the original venture and team? If so, which patents sell, how quickly, and who

buys them? This section describes the data that we compile to inform these questions. Section 4

reports descriptive patterns that emerge from these data. In Section 5, we probe more deeply into

underlying sources of variation by analyzing the likelihood and speed of sale in a regression

framework.

3.1.   Sample Construction and Data Sources

    Although our research questions are straightforward, answering them requires the compilation

and integration of disparate strands of data on (a) failed startups, (b) their patents, (c) whether and

when those patents are sold, (d) the identities and characteristics of the purchasing organizations, (e)

whether the new owners keep the rights “alive” through payment of maintenance fees, and (f)

whether one or more of the original inventors travel with the patents post-exit through asset

                                              13
purchase or co-movement to the purchasing organization. Guided by findings in prior research, we

also compile information about patent-, firm-, and environmental-level factors that could affect the

baseline likelihood or speed of sale. Table A-1 in the Appendix provides an overview of our main

variables and data sources.

   To identify disbanded startups at risk of selling patents, we start with the population of U.S.

venture-capital backed startups reported in the Dow Jones’ VentureSource database in three

innovation-intensive sectors: medical devices, semiconductor devices, and software. We then select

startups founded from 1987, the first year that VentureSource reports data comprehensively, to

1999. This cohort includes firms at risk of being affected by the collapse of the technology bubble

in 2000 and allows a sufficiently long window to (a) identify companies that disband and (b) to

trace subsequent sales and renewals of their patented inventions if any. To obtain more precise

information on companies that go out of business and when they do so, we supplement the

VentureSource data with information from Sand Hill Econometrics (Hall and Woodward 2010). We

track the financing and patenting activities of each company through the year of dissolution or

2008, our last year of reliable exit-status data. To link startups to patents, we search the Delphion

database for U.S. patents assigned all current and former names of each company as listed in

VentureSource.

    In total, we identify 285 VC-backed startups that go out of business by 2008 and own patents

potentially “releasable” to the secondary market. The disbanded ventures include 116 medical

device companies, 128 software companies, and 41 semiconductor companies. In combination, the

companies own 1,766 patents in the year of exit. The average portfolio size is 6.2 patents.

3.2.   Main Variables

    Determining which patents sell when and who buys them is challenging, as is discerning

whether the patents and the original inventors travel together post-exit. Below, we elaborate on the


                                             14
information we compile about patent sales and renewals, buyer characteristics, and co-movement by

patents and the original inventors.

3.2.a. On whether and when a patent is sold

   To identify whether and when a patent is sold, we use patent ownership records in USPTO

Patent Assignment Database. For each assignment record, we obtain the patent or patent numbers

involved, the name of the seller (assignor), the name of the buyer (assignee), the type of transaction

(conveyance), the date at which the private agreement between the parties was signed (execute

date), and the date at which the transaction was recorded at the patent office (recorded date). The

dataset covers the period 1983-2011.

   As discussed in Serrano (2010) and Graham et al. (2015), USPTO patent assignments not only

record patent sales but also include a wide array of unrelated transactions such as initial assignments

of rights from inventors to their employers, corrections to previous assignments, the pledging of

patents as collateral to secure loans, negative pledge agreements, and so forth. To track patent sales,

we manually inspect each patent transaction record for the 1,766 patents in our sample and

conservatively drop all assignments that appear not to be associated with an actual change in patent

ownership made by the startup and subsequent patent owners. To elaborate, we drop assignments

recorded at the patent application date, corrections, pledges of patents as collateral, and negative

pledges. We also drop instances where the first assignment is of an unassigned patent since these

transactions typically involve simple transfers of rights from inventors to the companies that

employ them. We use information contained in the clean records to construct two variables:

      Patent Salej: a dummy variable equal to one if a patent is sold at least once after the startup
       goes out of business.
      Speed of Salej: conditional on a patent being sold, the number of years between when the
       startup goes out of business and when the patent is first sold as indicated by the “execute
       date” listed in the assignment record.




                                             15
3.2.b. On buyer characteristics

     For each patent sale transaction, we retrieve the name of buyer from the USPTO assignment

records. Unfortunately, the names recorded in the USPTO patent assignment records are not

standardized and do link to sources with more systematic business or economic data. To start, we

therefore first standardize the names of all patent buyers using the names of firms that the USPTO

assigns to entities to which patents are granted and the name of inventors reported in granted

patents. These data enable us to identify purchases of patents by inventors originally affiliated with

the failed startup (i.e., “inventor-purchases”). For buyers other than the original inventors, we

standardize their names and manually search for information about them using a wide range of

online sources and business directories.11 Postal addresses listed for buyers in the USPTO

assignment records facilitate this task. We use the information retrieved from these searches to

categorize whether a buyer is an operating company, a “non-practicing entity” (NPE) or “patent

assertion entity” (PAE), or another entity (e.g., a university or an individual not listed as an inventor

on patents issued to the failed startup). We categorize an operating company as being in the same

sector of the startup based on industry information from business directories, including SIC

classifications when they are available.

     Triangulating data from these multiple sources, we successfully match all patent buyers to

industries, NPE-PAE, other, or inventors of patents issued to the failed venture. Setting aside non-

operating companies (i.e., NPE, PAE, universities, and individuals), 92 percent of the patent buyers

match to entities with USPTO assignee identifiers. For each patent sold, we use these data to

construct several buyer-related variables, including:


11
  For each unique patent buyer, we conduct manual name searches on Google, Bloomberg.com, Yahoo.com,
Manta.com, Hoovers, SICcode.com, Zoominfo.com, and Plainsite.org. PAEs often purchase patents through LLCs and
subsidiaries. To categorize PAE purchases, we primarily rely on Plainsite.org, which maps LLC and subsidiary names
to PAE organizations. If a buying entity is not categorized as a PAE on Plainsite.org but has an SIC code of 6794
(“patent owners and lessors”), we categorize the buyer as a non-practicing entity.

                                                  16
        Inventor-purchasej: an indicator set to one if the patent buyer is an inventor (or company
         with ownership ties to the inventors) of one or more patents issued to the failed venture.
        Same Sectorj: an indicator set to one if the patent buyer is an operating company that
         primarily competes in the same sector as the startup.
        NPE-purchasej: an indicator set to one if the patent buyer is either a “non-practicing entity”
         (NPE) or a “patent assertion entity” (PAE).

3.2.c. On co-movement by patents and inventors to a new organization

     To investigate whether patents that sell move jointly with the original inventors to the

organization that purchases the patents, we use both LinkedIn profiles and patent data. To do so, we

first search for LinkedIn profiles using the inventor’s name and/or the name of the failed startup.12

Using a matching protocol available upon request, we are able to match 60 percent of the

individuals listed as inventors of patents at failed startups in our sample to LinkedIn profiles and

employment histories. We use these data to determine whether, after the startup fails, one or more

of the original inventors is subsequently employed by the entity that buys the patents. Equally

important, the employment histories enable us to observe instances where the inventors move to

entities that do not purchase the patents.

     Using an alternative approach employed in prior studies (e.g., Marx et al. 2009; Palomeras and

Melero 2010), we also trace employment mobility using the inventor names reported in patent

records. A critical concern of this approach is that the inventors in the focal patent may not patent

again following the year the startup goes out of business even if other companies, including

patenting companies, employ them (Ge et al. 2016; Frake 2017). Indeed, we find that it is quite

common for inventors in our sample to stop patenting after the original venture disbands even

though they continue working in the industry at other operating companies. A related concern is

whether the potential future employers, including the patent’s buyers, are patenting companies since


12
  LinkedIn.com is a business and employment-oriented social network service that presents self-reported employment
and education profiles of individuals. As of 2017, LinkedIn had 500 million members in 200 countries. Interestingly,
through triangulation with media stories and resumes posted elsewhere, we were able to identify employment profiles
for individual inventors that opted not to reveal the name of the failed venture on his/her LinkedIn profile.

                                                   17
we cannot match the inventors to patents unless their future employers patent their inventions.

These two possibilities are false negatives. There is also the possibility of false positives in that

patent buyers could be granted “continuation” patents, which would list inventors on the original

patent even if they are employed elsewhere.

   Through use of patent records, we observe patenting activity for 40 percent of the inventors in

years following the startup’s failure. This patent-based “employment mobility” rate is higher than

that reported in prior studies (e.g., Palomeras and Melero 2010)). This fact is not surprising since

inventors are more likely to seek a new job when the original venture is out of business and the

hiring firm can potentially draw upon the knowledge of the patented invention without competing

directly with the startup company that originally developed the idea (Fosfuri Motta and Ronde

2001). The legal rights to exclude others from use of such inventions may, of course, remain alive

as we explore in this study.

   In combination, the LinkedIn and patent data provide different vantage points for viewing co-

movement by patents and the original inventors following a startup’s dissolution. Consistent with

recent evidence reported in Frake (2017), we find that many inventors in our sample do not produce

patented inventions at their future employers once the original venture disband. We therefore base

our primary co-mobility measure on evidence gleaned from LinkedIn data as follows:

      Co-mobilityj: an indicator equal to one if the patent buyer eventually employs one or more
       of the inventors in the focal patent after the startup goes out of business as measured by
       LinkedIn employment profiles. The measure is conditioned on patent sales in which at least
       one of the inventors is matched to an employer after the startup goes out of business.

3.2.d. On whether patents that are sold are later renewed

   Finally, a key question for our analysis is not just whether patents are sold but whether they are

“kept alive” by the new owners through payment of maintenance fees. This information provides an

indication that a minimum threshold of redeployment value has been met. It also is important when

considering the broader implications of our findings. If the patent rights are sold and kept legally

                                              18
alive and enforceable, the implications for follow-on use are quite different than if such rights are

sold yet soon enter the public domain through failure by the new owners to pay the fees required for

renewal. Following convention in the literature (Pakes 1986; Schankerman and Pakes 1986), we use

renewal fee data from the USPTO to construct the following measure:

          Renewed Patentj: is a dummy equal to one if renewal fees are paid to maintain the patent
           right at required intervals through 2014 or the expiration of the patent.

3.3.       Other Factors that Could Affect the Likelihood or Speed of Sale

     In our descriptive and econometric analyses, we explore how the likelihood and speed of sale

co-varies with observable characteristics of the firms, their inventions, and environmental

conditions in the broader resale market for patents. We summarize the main additional variables of

interest and rationale for including them below.

     As reported in Appendix Table A-1, the VentureSource data reveal numerous firm-level

characteristics, including the Sector, Founding Year, Exit Year, and Equity Funds Raised Pre-Exit.

We supplement these data with information on whether (a) the startup has used one or more of its

patents as collateral to secure funds from a venture lender pre-exit, and (b) whether the startup is

financed by a top-tier VC. The presence of venture lenders or top-tier VCs could be an indicator of

companies that are higher quality and/or have higher-quality patents that secure the funding. An

equally plausible explanation, which we are unable to tease apart, is that venture lenders and/or top-

tier VCs play a role that facilitates the sale of patents when startups fail.

     To identify whether a startup pledges its patents as collateral pre-exit, we examine whether any

patents awarded to the firm are used in security interest agreements recorded the USPTO Patent

Assignment database prior to the startup’s failure. Specifically, Had Patent Backed Loani is set to

one if one or more of the startup’s patents are used to secure a loan prior to the year of exit.13


13
 Venture lenders have strong incentives to record with the USPTO secured interests in patents they accept as collateral
when lending (Hochberg et al. 2017).

                                                    19
Separately, to identify companies backed by top-tier VCs, we match investor names in

VentureSource to reputation scores computed by Lee, Pollock, and Jin (“LPJ” 2011). Computed

annually for VCs active from 1990 through 2010, the LPJ scores range from zero, for fringe/new

investors, to a maximum of 100, with a median value of 5.7 out of 100. Consistent with Gompers et

al. (2010) and given high skew in VC reputation and skill levels, Has Top-Tier VCi is set to one if a

startup is financed by one or more VCs in the top 25th percentile of the annual LPJ score

distribution.

     Environment and portfolio-level factors also could affect the ability to redeploy patents

originating from failed companies to other users and uses. The incomplete contracting literature

suggests that asset reallocation through secondary markets hinges both on the number of potential

buyers and the costs associated with finding them. When buyers are few and/or costly to locate,

trading frictions can reduce the gains anticipated from the exchange and lower asset prices (e.g.,

Gavazza 2011). In thicker markets, however, matching between sellers and buyers is assumed to be

more efficient, thus increasing the value likely to be retained in the event of an exchange.14 Guided

by these insights, we use a Patent Market Liquidity measure introduced in Hochberg et al. (2017) to

track whether thicker trading in the secondary market for patents increases the likelihood of sale or

accelerates the redeployment process. Compiled from annual buying and selling activity in

invention classes relevant for a given firm’s portfolio of patent, the measure represents the

combined probability (averaged across invention classes and issue years) that a patent in startup i’s

portfolio will be sold in the year t.

     Even with favorable trading conditions, some patents and portfolios could be easier to sell than

others. If a startup’s patents are extensively cited by outside parties in follow-on inventions relative


14
  Benmelech and Bergman (2008, 2009) and Gavazza (2011) document that thicker trading (increased “liquidity”) in
the secondary market for tangible assets correlates with higher resale values. Gans and Stern (2010) map insights from
economic theory on market thickness to transactions in technology-related markets.

                                                    20
to citations made by follow-on patents by the same startup (i.e., the share of self-cites is relatively

low), recent studies suggest that the patents should be more redeployable in outside use. Put

differently, portfolios of patents with a high share of self-cites are more likely to be “firm-specific”

and thus more difficult to redeploy if the original venture fails. Consistent with Hochberg et al.

(2017), we proxy the Firm-specificity of Patent Assets based on the share of citations a startup’s

patents receives within three years from follow-on patents issued to the focal company (i.e., the

share of “self-cites”).15

     Finally, at the patent level, Serrano (2010) reports that patents that are more highly cited in other

patented inventions are more likely to be sold, a finding that likely correlates the value or economic

importance of the specific invention as documented in Hall et al. (2001) and elsewhere. Serrano

(2010) further shows that the baseline likelihood of sale declines as patents age, suggesting that the

assets depreciate over their life cycles. This latter finding is also intuitive since the legal rights are

finite and typically last a maximum of twenty years. Separately, Hoetker and Agarwal (2007) show

that more “original” patents (i.e., patents that span more technology classes) are more likely to be

built upon in other patented inventions after companies fail. Although the authors do not examine

the sales of patents post-failure, this patent-level characteristic could be indicative of inventions

with a wider range of market applications that in turn are more likely to sell. We therefore construct

a comparable measure of Patent Originality based on invention classes reported in the patent data as

in Hall et al. (2001).


4. Descriptive Patterns




15
  The measure is similar in spirit to an internal-focus proxy used in Hoetker and Agarwal (2007)’s study of failed disk
drive companies: the authors report a steeper decline in follow-on citations (invention use) following exits of companies
with high self-citation shares in the pre-exit period. Marx et al. (2009) use a similar citations-based measure to gauge
the firm-specificity of skills among employee-inventors. More recently, Hochberg et al. (2017) find that when the share
of self-citations to a startup’s patent portfolio is high, the company is less likely to attract debt sources of financing.

                                                     21
   This section summarizes the descriptive evidence revealed in our data that informs our primary

research questions. In Section 5, we explore patent-, firm-, and environmental-level factors that

could underpin these statistics.

4.1. Do the patents sell?

   To start, Table 1 Panel A reports observable characteristics of the 285 failed startups in our

sample that do (n=191) and do not (n=94) sell one or more of their patents after the ventures fail

and are disbanded. Although the ventures are comparable in age at the time of exit, those that

succeed in selling patents post-exit look “higher quality” on multiple dimensions, which is not

surprising. To elaborate, Table 1 Panel A shows that on average and relative to failed startups that

do not sell patents, failed startups that sell patents post-failure raise more money prior to

dissolution, have larger and more highly cited patent portfolios at exit, are more likely to be backed

by top-tier VCs, and are more likely to have secured loans with their patents.

   Panel B of Table 1 compares average characteristics of patents that do (n=1,203) and do not

(n=563) sell after startups in our sample fail and are disbanded. On average, patents that sell tend to

be more highly cited, more original, younger, and less firm-specific that patents that do not sell.

Again, these descriptive statistics are intuitive and accord with evidence reported in recent studies

on the salability of patents and their use in lending (e.g., Serrano 2010; Hochberg et al. 2017). More

strikingly, Panel B of Table 1 further reveals that 81% of all patent sold are renewed to their

maximum legal length of protection or the end of our sample period.

   Table 2 takes a closer look at patent sales post-exit overall and by sector. Of the 1,766 patents in

our sample, Panel A shows that 68 percent (1,203 patents) are sold to new owners after the startup

exits. The proportion sold is highest in semiconductors (87 percent), followed by 74 percent in

software and 61 percent in medical devices. Panel A further suggests that, conditional on being

sold, most patents originating from failed startups in our sample are kept alive long after the


                                              22
original venture is shuttered. Overall, the share of patents sold that are renewed to the maximum

length of legal protection during our sample period is 81 percent. This share is high across all three

sectors, ranging from 90% in semiconductors and software to 74% in medical devices.

   Panel B of Table 2 shows that more than two-thirds of failed startups in our sample (67%) sell

one or more of their patents post-failure. This share ranges from 80% for failed semiconductor

ventures to 66% and 64% for failed companies in the medical device and software sectors

respectively. When failed startups sell at least one patent, Panel B of Table 2 further reveals that the

patents are typically sold in “bulk” within the same year but potentially to more than one buyer. On

average, 95 percent of the patents sold transact during the first year of sale with limited variance

across the sectors.

4.2. Do the patents sell quickly?

   Another important factor when assessing the redeployability of patent assets is how quickly the

rights are sold and transferred to new owners. In principle, lenders and investors must weigh the

benefits of finding a potential buyer against the costs of searching and negotiating with such a

buyer. Even if there is potential value, there are frictions that could potentially complicate the quick

redeployment of the patent assets to the firms with the highest value. Patent assets could be sector

specific when the best match for the patents are companies operating in the same sector of the

failing firm. Patent assets could also be firm specific when redeployment value depends on having

access to the human capital of the inventors in the patent. Moreover, thin markets and costly search

can make it hard to find in a timely manner the buyer that best matches the characteristics of the

patents of the failed startup. At the same time, patent assets deteriorate rapidly and retaining the

teams of patent inventors from disbanding to facilitate redeployment can be costly. The sale and

redeployment of displaced patent assets, therefore, faces a trade-off between the potential benefits




                                             23
of finding a buyer that matches the characteristics of the patent against the costs, which not only

include asset depreciation but may also require retaining key employees to facilitate redeployment.

    In our sample, patents are sold quickly after the startup goes out of business. Figure 1A shows

that the number of patents directly sold by startups substantially decreases following the startup’s

failure year, indicating that most patents are transferred immediately after the startup fails. In

particular, of the 1,203 patents sold, 779 are transferred during the same year the startup goes out of

business and 218 additional patents are sold by the end of the first year after exit. In total, 83

percent of the patents are sold within a year after the companies are disbanded.

    A similar pattern emerges when we look at startups instead of patents. In Figure 1B, we show

that most startups sell their first patent immediately after going out of business and the number of

startups selling their first patent declines significantly in the years thereafter. Of the 191 startups

that go out of business in our sample and sell a patent, 115 companies sell their first patent (or

bundle of patents) in the year they fail, and 40 additional startups sell their first patent the first year

after they are disbanded. These statistics imply that 81 percent of the startups in our sample that

eventually sell patents do so within a year after they go out of business.

    In sum, this evidence suggests that most patents from failed startups in our sample are sold, are

sold within a year after the companies disband, and are kept alive and legally in force by the new

owners.

4.2. Who buys the patents?

    4.2.a. Patent sales by entity type and industry sector

    Which types of entities tend to purchase patents from failed startups? The first Panel in Table 3

sheds light on this question and reports buyer characteristics based on each patent sold within our

sample. As Panel A shows, the overwhelming majority of patents (89% overall) are purchased by

operating companies, followed by NPEs (9.6%), and individuals that have no ties to NPEs (1.8%).


                                               24
Consistent with prior evidence that NPE/PAE purchases are more common in IT-related sectors

(e.g., USFTC 2011, 2016), we find that NPE/PAEs purchase around 20% of all patents sold by

failed ventures in semiconductors and software but only 3% of patents originating from failed

medical device companies.

    Panel B of Table 3 shows the distribution of patent buyers by the sector of the startup. Again,

operating companies remain the most common buyer of patents originating from failed startups

across all sectors. Consistent with the evidence reported in Panel A, the sector-level analysis

similarly shows reveals that NPE/PAEs purchase a smaller share of patents originating from failed

medical devices ventures (3.0%) than is true for patents originating from failed software (17%) and

semiconductor device (18%) startups.

    In summary, Table 3 shows that most patents from failed startups in our sample are purchased

by operating companies in the same sector. As a share of patents sold, NPE/PAE are more active

purchasers of patents from failed ventures in the two IT sectors represented in our sample

(semiconductor devices and software) relative to the non-IT sector of medical devices. Even within

IT, however, the overwhelming majoring of patents are sold to operating companies in the same

sector.

    4.2.b. Patent sales to inventors and co-mobility of patents and inventors

    Measuring whether patent assets are tied to the human capital of the inventors is challenging.

We need information on whether patent buyers have access to the human capital of the patent

inventors in the focal patent. To infer this, we consider whether (i) patent inventors reallocate to

work for the patent buyer after the startup fails; or alternatively, (ii) the buyer is a patent inventor or

a company with ownership ties to the inventors in the focal patent.

    Table 4 reports the share of patents and startups that sell a patent to one or more of the original

inventors overall and by sector. The table shows that the vast majority of patents are sold to other


                                              25
entities. The proportion of patents sold to an original inventor in the focal patent is 2.6 percent, or

31 out of 1201 patents sold. Moreover, only 5.8 percent of the startups sell patents to an original

inventor, representing 11 out of 191 startups. Medical devices companies developed by startups

often have strong ties with the medical doctors that may have been involved in the design of the

medical equipment (Chatterji and Fabrizio 2014). Even there, only 10.5 percent of the startups (8 in

total) sell at least one patent to one or more of the original inventors, accounting for only 3.95

percent of the patents sold in the sector. In the other two sectors, sales to the original inventors are

even rarer events. The share of startups that sell the patent ownership rights to an original inventor

post-exit is 2.4% in Software and 3% in Semiconductors, representing only 0.7 and 1.2 percent of

patent sales in these sectors, respectively.

   Table 5 examines whether the patents and inventors from the original venture move jointly to a

new organization post-exit based on employment histories inferred from the LinkedIn (Panel A) and

patent database (Panel B) searches. In Panel A, 12.9 percent of the patents co-move with at least

one inventor to the purchaser of the patent as evidenced by LinkedIn employment profiles. This co-

movement percentage ranges from 17.8% in software to 11.8% and 8.9% in medical devices and

semiconductors respectively. As Panel B in Table 5 reveals, these co-movement rates are higher

when measured with patent data alone but reveal a similar pattern across the sectors.


5. Multivariate analysis

   The descriptive patterns in Section 4 reveal that most patents from failed startups in our sample

are sold, are sold quickly, and retain value beyond the original venture and team. It is equally true,

however, that some patents in the sample are not sold, are sold slowly, and remain tied to the

original inventors following the dissolution of the original venture.

   In this section we therefore probe more deeply into the underlying sources of variation in the

data by analyzing the likelihood and speed of sale and the co-mobility of patents and inventors in a

                                               26
regression framework. To summarize from before, the three dependent variables in our analysis are

defined as follows:

        Patent Salej: an indicator equal to one if a patent is sold at least once after the startup goes
         out of business.
        Speed of Salej: conditional on a patent being sold, the number of years between when the
         startup goes out of business and when the patent is first sold.
        Co-mobilityj: an indicator equal to one if the patent buyer eventually employs one or more
         of the inventors in the focal patent after the startup goes out of business as measured by
         LinkedIn employment profiles.16

     The first and third dependent variables are binary measures equal to 1 or zero whereas the Speed

of sale is a count (in years).

     As discussed in Section 3, numerous characteristics of the firms, their patent portfolios and

inventions, and environmental factors at the time of exit could affect the likelihood and speed with

which patent assets from failed startups are redeployed to new owners. At the patent level, we rely

on the patent number of patent citations received, the originality of the patent, and the age of the

patent as of the year the startup goes out of business. At the firm level, we examine the presence of

venture lenders—whether the startup has used one or more of its patents as collateral to secure

funds from a venture lender pre-exit, and top-tier VCs—whether the startup is financed by a top-tier

venture capitalist. As in Hochberg et al. (2017), we also compute whether a startup’s portfolio of

patents is “firm-specific” as evidenced by a high share of self-citations to the inventions in future

patents. Finally, the variable Patent market liquidity captures the environmental conditions in the

broader patent market relevant for the firm’s inventions. In the regressions and to control for

technology- or cohort-specific effects, we include fixed effects for the aggregate technology class

corresponding to the NBER patent categories defined by Hall et al. (2001), the startup’s founding

  This variable is defined for each patent sold in which at least one of the inventors is matched to an employer through
LinkedIn employment profiles after the startup goes out of business.

year, the startup’s sector, and the year the startup went out of business. Table 6 reports summary

statistics for variables included in these regressions.

       Tables 7-9 present the results of the likelihood that a patent sells, the speed of sale, and the co-

mobility of patents and inventors, respectively. In all tables, Column 1 includes patent-level

covariates. Column 2 adds the variables Patent Market Liquidity and Firm-specificity of Patent

Assets. Columns 3 and 4 introduce the two intermediary-related variables, Has Top-tier VC variable

and Had Patent-backed Loan sequentially in turn. All columns include controls for patent

technology class, founding year, sector, and exit year.

5.1. Patent Sale

       Table 7 presents OLS estimates of the likelihood that a patent is sold after a startup goes out of

business.17 Column 1 shows that patents that are more highly cited and more original are more

likely to be sold, which is not surprising. We also find that the coefficient of patent age is negative

and significant, indicating that patented inventions that are older are less likely to be sold than

patents with similar characteristics but issued more recently to the startup. In line with Serrano

(2010), this latter evidence suggests that patent value depreciates over time as the rights draw near

to their maximum lifespans.

       Column 2 of Table 7 adds two variables to capture the broader liquidity of the patent market for

the inventions of the startup and the extent to which their portfolios of patent inventions are

redeployable to alternative uses and buyers. We find that the coefficient of the variable Patent

Market Liquidity is positive and significant, suggesting that the likelihood that a patent sells is

positively associated with the broader liquidity of the patent market for the inventions of the startup

as of the exit year. To interpret, a one-percentage point increase in patent market liquidity boosts the

likelihood that a patent is sold by 5.9 percentage points. In contrast, the estimated coefficient of


17
     In robustness tests, we obtain similar results using a Probit model.

                                                        28
Firm-specificity of Patent Assets is negative and significant: the patents of startups with firm-

specific patent assets have a lower likelihood of being sold on average than the patents of startups

that are more redeployable to alternative uses even controlling for other sector, technology class,

and entry/exit cohort-related factors. To elaborate, Column 2 of Table 7 suggests that a one standard

deviation increase in the Firm-specificity of Patent Assets decreases by 2.5 percentage points the

likelihood that a patent is sold.

    Next, we examine the past presence of top-tier VC investors and venture lenders in the

likelihood of a patent selling after a startup goes out of business. To do this, Column 3 and 4 add the

variables Had Top-tier VC and Had a Patent-backed Loan, respectively. We find that the likelihood

that a patent is sold is positively correlated with Had Top-tier VC, suggesting that the presence of a

top-tier VC investor, whether in early or later round, is positively associated with the likelihood that

a patent is sold. In particular, backing from a top-tier investor is associated with an increase of at

least 5.9 percentage points in the likelihood that a patent is sold. The coefficient of Had Patent-

backed Loan is also positive, significant, and of comparable magnitude to that of Has Top-Tier VC.

Indeed, having had a patent-backed loan is associated with an increase of 6.7 percentage points in

the likelihood of patent selling. The presence of venture lenders or top-tier VCs could be an

indicator of companies that are higher quality and/or have higher-quality patents that secure the

funding. An equally plausible explanation, which we are unable to tease apart, is that venture

lenders and/or top-tier VCs play a role that facilitates patent sales when startups fail.

    In combination, these results are consistent with the view that thicker trading activity in the

resale market for patents increases the likelihood that patents from failed startups will be redeployed

to new owners. This evidence further suggests that patents that are more extensively cited by

external parties are more likely to be redeployed to new owners in the worst-case-scenario that




                                              29
startups fail. Finally, startups with financial backing from top-tier venture capitalists and/or venture

lenders have a higher baseline likelihood of selling patents when they fail.

5.2. Speed of Patent Sale.

    Another important factor when assessing markets for buying and selling patents is how quickly

patents are actually sold. In Table 8, we present the results of a duration analysis (Cox proportional

hazard model) of the speed at which patents are sold after the startup goes out of business. The table

follows the same format as of Table 7. Column 1 shows the results of regressing the number of

years from the year the startup fails until a patent is sold on the number of patent citations received,

patent originality, and patent age as of exit. Column 2 adds the variables patent market liquidity and

firm-specificity of patent assets. Columns 3 and 4 add the dummy variables indicating the presence

of top-tier investors and whether the startup has had a patent-backed loan. We find that highly cited

and more original patents sell quickly as seen by the hazard of trade in Column 4. In contrast, the

estimated coefficient of patent age does not have a discernable effect on how quickly a patent sells.

    Consistent with the view that a more liquid patent market should facilitate finding buyers, we

find that patent market liquidity is positively associated with the speed of sale. To interpret, the

estimates suggest that a one-percentage point increase in Patent Market Liquidity raises the hazard

of trade by 11%. Table 8 further shows that presence of top-tier investors and venture lenders is

positively associated with the speed at which patents sell. To elaborate, having top-tier investors or

a patent-backed loan increases the hazard of trade by 26.3% and 18.2%, respectively. As in Table 7,

this positive “intermediary effect” remains large and significant even after we include controls for

technology classes and patent-level characteristics, sector and cohort effects, and characteristics of

the startups portfolio of patents (i.e., the share of self-cites and the thickness of trading in the

secondary patent market related to the portfolio of patents).




                                               30
5.3. Co-movement of patents and inventors

       To examine the possible factors that shape whether patent inventors relocate to work for patent

buyers following the sale of patents, Table 9 presents OLS estimates of the likelihood that an

inventor in a patent relocates to work for a patent buyer after a startup goes out of business.18 The

table follows the same format as Tables 7 and 8. The estimated coefficients indicate that whether a

patent is highly cited overall (i.e., valuable in general) fails to have a discernible effect on whether

the inventions and people travel together in patent transactions. We do, however, find that co-

movement is much higher for more original inventions even after controlling for other factors.

       In Column 2 of Table 9, we examine whether co-movement of patents and inventors in patent

transactions is more likely when the patents released to the market are more specific to the failed

firm or when the broader patent market is more liquid. The estimated coefficient of firm-specificity

is positive and significant, suggesting that having access to original inventors is particularly

important for buyers when the patent assets are specific to the failed startup. To illustrate, a one

standard deviation increase in the firm-specificity of patent assets is associated with a 5.5

percentage point increases in the likelihood that a patent buyer hires an inventor, as compared to the

unconditional mean of 12.9. The coefficient of patent market liquidity is negative and of sizable

magnitude but is not statistically significant at conventional levels.

       In combination, the evidence in Columns 1 and 2 of Table 9 suggest that more original patents

and patents that are more “specific” to the original venture are more likely to travel with the original

inventive team to a new organization when startups fail.

       Columns 3 and 4 of Table 9 explore whether the presence of top-tier investors and venture

lenders is salient for the co-movement of patents and inventors in patent transaction. The estimated

coefficient of Has top-tier investors is positive, significant, and sizable in magnitude. To illustrate,


18
     In robustness tests, we obtain similar results using a Probit model.

                                                        31
having a top-tier investor is positively associated with 8.1 percentage point increase in the

likelihood of co-mobility of patents and inventors in patent transactions. In contrast, the coefficient

of Had a patent-backed loan is negative and significant, suggesting that the presence of venture

lenders is negatively associated with co-movement. The presence of top-tier investors could

facilitate inventor mobility since their presence, including additional financial support, could

potentially prevent the immediate disbanding of the key inventors while the investors search for

potential buyers for the patent assets. An alternative explanation, which we cannot separately

identify, is that top-tier VCs could be an indicator of companies that attract higher “quality”

inventors. Venture lenders, unlike equity investors, focus their effort primarily on the sale of the

assets to cover their outstanding loans rather than maximizing the upside value of the assets, which

could involve matching both patents and inventors to potential buyers. Venture lenders could also

choose to lend to startups with patents that are more “saleable” to outsiders in the event of failure,

which could reduce the baseline likelihood that the patents and people travel together to a new

organization in the worst-case-scenario that the startup fails.


6. Discussion and Conclusion

   The process of innovation naturally gives rise to failed attempts and abandoned projects. Prior

studies show that disbanded ventures are important sources of human capital and learning spillovers

for others (Knott and Posen 2005; Hoetker and Agarwal 2007; Kacperczyk and Marx 2017). This

study documents that failed startups also “release” legal rights to patented inventions that are often

redeployed to new owners. Based on 1,766 U.S. patents awarded to 285 VC-backed companies that

go out of business, we find that most patents originating from these companies are sold, are sold

quickly, and are kept alive by the new owners long after the original company is shuttered. The

assets tend to retain value beyond the original project and human capital of the team, and to be



                                             32
purchased by another operating company in the same sector. These findings suggest that patent

rights are far more redeployable as standalone assets than is widely assumed in the literature.

   At the environmental level, we find that the likelihood and speed of sale is higher when the

resale market for patent assets is more liquid. While prior studies in economics document this effect

for tangible assets (e.g., Gavazza), our findings show that trading thickness in the secondary patent

market is also salient for patent sales when startups fail. These findings add to recent evidence that

the market for buying and selling patents is surprisingly active (e.g., Serrano 2010; Hagiu and

Yoffie 2013; Akcigit et al. 2016) and is consequential for the financing of entrepreneurial firms

(Hochberg et al. 2017).

   Our evidence further reveals that the likelihood and speed of sale depend on patent-level

characteristics and the presence of top-tier VCs and venture lenders. Although this latter effect

could be driven by the selection by top-tier VCs and venture lenders of higher quality companies

with more “sellable” patents, our qualitative evidence suggests that these intermediaries play a far

more active role. Despite a large body of evidence in strategic management and economics on the

services that financial intermediaries provide young companies on the road to success (e.g., Hsu

2004, 2006; Hellmann and Puri 2002), much less is known about the roles that these intermediaries

play in less favorable conditions and the corresponding implications for entrepreneurs and their

intangible assets. We hope that our study stimulates future research on these important topics.

   Finally, we show that even though most patents from failed startups in our sample become

unbundled from the human capital of the original inventive team post-exit, some patents and people

move jointly to a new organization. Within our sample, the likelihood of co-mobility is higher for

more original patents and inventions that are primarily cited by other inventions of the failed

venture (i.e., patents with a high share of self-citations). Consistent with Hoetker and Agarwal

(2007), this evidence could suggest that buyers find it particularly difficult to capture value from


                                             33
original inventions specific to the failed company absent access to the private knowledge of the

team. Our findings further suggest that the likelihood of co-movement by the people and patents is

higher for failed companies with top-tier VCs but lower for those that use their patent rights to

secure loans earlier in their life cycles. Future research could investigate the trade-offs individuals

and entrepreneurs face when assigning patent control rights to lenders and how such trade-offs

shape both the mode of exit and the potential separation of patent rights from the inventors in the

event of failure.

    If patents are redeployable to others when startups fail, as our evidence suggests, it could

simultaneously stimulate investments in experimental projects earlier in the entrepreneurial life

cycle and (in the event that the company fails) unleash assets that others can use for follow-on

development or strategic gain. The market for patents is friction-filled and non-transparent, thus

providing potential buyers an opportune environment for strategic gain. Future research on the

choices and trade-offs buyers face when transacting in the secondary patent market is needed both

overall and relative to other transfer channels. Future studies could also investigate the implications

of patent-market transactions on the scale and scope of internal projects. If established firms are

able to self-insure against legal risk by purchasing patents on their own or in combination with

others, for example, the need to allocate internal R&D activity toward “defensive” patenting could

be reduced. Similarly, firms with complementary bundles of IP or other downstream assets may be

able to reinforce their sources of advantage through purchasing exclusionary rights through the

patent resale market. We hope that the empirical evidence in this study ignites new research on this

underexplored exchange arena.

 Main Variables
 PATENT SALEj                 Indicator set to 1 if a patent is involved at least once in a change of           USPTO Assignments
                              ownership after the startup goes out of business                                  Data
 SPEED OF SALEj               Conditional on a patent being sold, number of years between when the              USPTO Assignments

                              competes in the same sector as the startup.                                       Google Searches
 RENEWED PATENTj              Indicator set to 1 if renewal fees are paid to maintain the patent right at       USPTO Maintenance
                              required intervals through 2014 or the expiration of the patent                   Fees Data
 Other Variables
 Patent Age at Startup        Number of years between when the patent is applied for and when the               USPTO
 Exitj                        startup goes out of business
 Patent Citations             Number of citations each patent receives 3-years post-grant                       USPTO
 Receivedj
 Patent Originalityj          Corresponds to the Originality measure in Hall et al. (2001). By counting         USPTO
                              the number of citations a patent makes within each of the 3-digit patent
                              classes, it is a proxy for the degree to which the patent draws upon a wide
                              range of technology areas. In the few instances where no patents are cited,
                              the variable is set to zero.
 Has Top-Tier VCi             1 if the startup is backed by a VC in the top 25% of the annual LJP               LPJ2011
                              reputation score distribution.
 Had a Patent Backed          1 if one or more of the startup’s patents are used to secure a loan prior to      USPTO Assignment
 Loani                        the exit year (Hochberg et al. 2017)                                              Data
 Patent Market                Based on the Patent Market Liquidity measure in Hochberg et al. (2017).           USPTO Reportsa;
 Liquidityi                   Startup i’s combined probability (averaged across patents in its portfolio as     Graham and
                              of year t) that patents issued in the prior 8 years in its sector are traded by   Vishnubhakat (2013)b;
                              the exit year                                                                     RPX Corp
 Firm-Specificityi            Proxy for degree to which the value of startup i’s patents are “firm-             USPTO
                              specific”; measured as the share of patents citing startup i’s patents within
                              three years that are made by the focal startup (i.e., are “self-cites”). In the
                              few instances where no patents within a startup’s portfolio are cited within
                              three years, we set the variable to zero.
 Patent Portfolio Size        Cumulative number of successful U.S. patent applications of startup i by          Delphion; USPTO
 (citation weighted)i         the year the startup goes out of business, weighted by the number of
                              citations each patent receives 3-years post-grant
 Equity Funds Raised          Millions of equity US$ raised in startup i’s by the year that the startup goes    VentureSource
 Pre-Exiti                    out of business
 Founding Yeari               Year startup i was founded (1987-1999)                                            VentureSource
 Sectori                      Startup i’s primary sector: medical devices, semiconductor devices, or            VentureSource
