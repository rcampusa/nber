                     TWO TOOLS FOR ANALYZING UNEMPLOYMENT


                                   ABSTRACT

     This paper shows how one can interpret the joint movements of wages,
unemployment and vacancies in the Phillips and Beveridge spaces to learn about
the origins of the movements in unemployment. The view of the labor market
underlying the conceptual framework emphasizes flows, matching, and Nash
bargaining determination of wages. The approach is used to analyze the
movements in unemployment in the US, in the UK and in Germany over the last
twenty years.
