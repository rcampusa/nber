                   THE JAPANESE TAX REFORM AND THE EFFECTIVE
                 RATE OF TAX ON JAPANESE CORPORATE INVESTNENTS

                                     ABSTRACT

    Japan is in the midst of reforming ita national level individual and
corporation income    tax systems.   Last year it abandoned its large system of

tax free savings accounts and lowered individual marginal tax rates.         A

much more radical proposal is currently heing advocated by the government

and is well along the way towards passage in the Diet.        The new proposal

would significantly lower the statutory rate for the corporation income

tax, lower individual rates further and increase the tax thresholds, tax

                                                and introduce a type of
capital gains on securities for the first time,

value added tax.     As a package, this would be the most important change in

the Japanese tax system since 1950.

     This paper presents a brief summary of the Japanese income tax system

and the changes in it that have been enacted or proposed.        It also

discusses and evaluates the pressures for reform, both domestic and

international.     Finally, the paper looks at how the taxation of capital

income in Japan has changed since 1980 and how it compares to the U.S.

taxation of capital income after our 1986 tax reform.         One major finding of

the paper is that the effective marginal tax rate on corporate capital

income in Japan has increased sharply since 1980 from roughly five percent

to about 32 percent.     This change, which still leaves the marginal taxation

on corporate investments somewhat lower in Japan than in the U.S., is due

to both changes in the Japanese tax code and the virtual elimination of

1.   Introduction




     Japan is in the midst of reforming its national level individual and

corporation income tax systems.     Last year it abandoned its large system of

tax free savings accounts and lowered individual marginal cax rates.      A

much more radical proposal is currently being advocated by the government

and is well along the way towards passage in the Diet.     The new proposal

would significantly lower the statutory rate for the corporation income

tax, lower individual rates further and increase the tax thresholds, tax

                                                              a type of
capital gains on securities for the first time, and introduce

value added tax.     As a package, this would be the most important change in

the Japanese tax system since 1950.

     This paper presents a brief summary of the Japanese income tax system

and the changes in it that have been enacted or proposed.     It also

discusses   and evaluates the pressures for reform, both domestic and

international.      The U.S. Tax Reform Act of 1986, with its low marginal tax

rates, is among the forces for change in Japan.     Finally, the paper looks

at how the taxation of capital income in Japan has changed since 1980 and

how it compares to the U.S. taxation of capital income after our 1986 tax

reform.

                                                               if only
     Developments in the Japanese economy are worth monitoring

because it is the second largest economy in the world and its economic

performance   is widely admired.    It has achieved high economic growth rates,

 a recently stable price level, a trade surplus, and a high level of

national saving and investment.      In previous work (Shoven and Tmchibanaki,

                                                                     the
 1988) I found that in 1980 Japan had a much lower tax wedge between


                                          1
return on investments and the return enjoyed by investors than in the U.S..

That is, in Japan the government took a smaller fraction and the investor a

larger fraction of the return on a new marginal investment.      One question

that this paper addresses is whether that lower level of effective taxation

on incremental capital income still persists in Japan in 1988 and will

continua to do so if the proposed tax reforms are enacted.




2.   The Japanese Tax System



     Japan and the U.S. have the lowest overall tax burden as a percent of
GDP of the major OECD countries listed in Table 1.      Japan's figure (28.0

percent)   is slightly lower than that for the U.S.   Japan also generates
far lass revenue as a fraction of GDP from the household level income tax

than does the U.S.    In fact, Japan's revenue from the individual income tax

is less than any of the countries except France.      Its reliance on sales and

consumption taxes is the lowest among the eleven countries.     In contrast,

its corporation income tax raises the highest fraction of CD? (well over

twice the comparable U.S. figure).    It is this heavy use of the corporation

tax which made my previous result of light taxation of income from new

Japanese capital investments surprising.

     As in the U.S., there are three levels of taxation in Japan: the

national level, the prefecture (state) level, and the municipal level.       If

we exclude the social security payroll contributions, the individual income

tax raised 40.5 percent of the revenue at the national level, whereas the

corporation tax raised 30.6 percent.     Of the remaining 28.9 percent1 liquor

taxes accounted for 4.8 percent, gasoline taxes 3.8 percent, and the

inheritance and gift tax 2.7 percent.     The final 15.6 percent of revenues

were mainly raised by a wide variety of excise taxes.      Corporate    and

individual income is subject to taxation at both the prefecture and

municipal levels (primarily according to the "inhabitants tax").         These

local governments also raise revenues through property taxes, automobile

taxes, an enterprise   tax,   and a wide array of excise taxes.

    The first thing to note about the national level individual        income tax

is that the individual is the taxable entity rather than the household as

in the U.S.   For the average single earner household,    this difference     is

not very important.    In fact, the tax of most wage earners is automatically

calculated through a sophisticated withholding mechanism.         Most individuals

whose income is predominately wages do not even have to fill out a tax

return.   However, the individual basis of taxation     does open up the

possibility of income splitting for the self employed small businessman and

those with significant sources of capital income.

    The marginal tax rate structures for the national level individual

income tax are shown in Table 2 for 1986, for 1987 (after the September

1987 tax revisions), and for the 1988 proposal of the Ministry of Finance.

In 1986 there were 15 rate brackets with marginal rates ranging from 10.5

to 70 percent; in 1987 these were replaced with 12 brackets ranging from

10.5 percent to 60 percent; the proposal now under consideration would

replace these with five brackets with marginal tax rates from 10.0 to 50

percent.   The number of rate hrackets for the inhabitants tax (local income

tax) is proposed to be reduced from fourteen (with rates ranging from 4.5

percent to 18 percent) to four (with rates ranging from S to 15 percent).

The top combined rate was 88 percent in 1986 and would be 65 percent under

the current proposal.

    The puzzle of why the marginal rates for the individual income tax are

relativelyhigh and revenues relatively low is partially answered by the

generous levels of the tax thresholds (the level of income below which no

tax is paid).   Table 3 shows that the threshold level of wage and salary

income for a one earner family of four will have increased by almost 36

percent in two years if the latest proposals   are adopted.   The proposed tax

threshold for a family of four is 3,198,000 yen or $26,000 at the current

exchange rate (123 yen/dollar), more than twice the tax threshold in the
U.S. for a family of the same composition (the sun of the U.S. system's

standard deduction and personal exemptions for a family of four was $8,300

in 1986 and $12,800 in 1988).     Note that the average annual wage income in

Japan is roughly 4 million yen.     It appears that the Japanese have used

their relatively    low reliance on individual income tax sources to increase

the progressivity   of their tax system rather than to enjoy the efficiency

that could have come from lower marginal rates.    This feature of relatively

high income thresholds is long standing and was one of the primary reasons

why Pechman and Kaizuken (1976) found that only 33 percent of Japanese

national income was reported as taxable income in 1970, compared with 59

percent for the U.S. at that time.    Despite the high top rates, note that

Tables 2 and 3 together imply that under the new proposal a worker with a

family of four would remain in the 10 percent national income tax bracket

until hia earninga reach 7,162,650 yen or $58,233.       Thia income level

(where the Japanese rate will jump from 10 to 20 percent) is at least

twenty percent higher than the income level for a family of four where the

U.S. rate jumps from 15 to 28 percent.        About 90 percent of all workers in

Japan will face the lowest marginal rate and many will remain in the lowest

tax bracket for their entire planning horizon.       This last feature

effectivelyeliminates the problem of timing income so as to minimize

taxes.

    In principle, the Japanese individual income tax system applies to

aggregate income (such as interest income, dividend income, rents, business

income, wages, retirement income, timber income, capital gains, etc.).            In

practice, many of these income sources are eligible for special treatment.

Retirement income and timber income are always taxed separately, and

interest, dividends, and capital gains are often taxed separately        at the

taxpayer's   option.

    The treatment of interest income has been amongst the most generous of

these special treatments.     Until the September 1987 tax reforms, there were

two special features of the law favoring interest income.       First, Japanese

taxpayers wera allowed to have four types of tax free savings plans

offering tax free interest.      The types of tsx free interest were




     i. Interest accruing from postal savings when the principal does not

         exceed 3 million yen.




                                          8
    ii.    Interest income or distribution of profits from deposits, bonds,

           and debentures, open-end bond investment trusts, or specific stock

           investment trusts if the amount of principal in total does not

           exceed 3 million yen.   This provision   is called the "Small Saving

           Tax Exemption" ("Maruyu" in common Japanese).




   iii. Interest on central-government     and local-government bonds, not

           exceeding 3 million yen in total face value.



    iv. Interest income or distribution of profits received in accounts

           set up for the formation of employees' assets, particularly for

           housing and pensions.   Various forms of monetary assets are

           eligible for this exemption.   It requires, however, that the

           employees commit to savings contracts that are withheld from

           their wages and that the total amount of principal does not

           exceed 5 million yen.




    Summing up these four items, an individual could have had up to 14

million yen ($113,821) in nontaxable forms.         If the household had several

members,    the amount of nontsxsble savings could be increased accordingly.

A family of four could have legally held over $455,000 in tax free saving

vehicles.     Further, there was widespread evidence of abuse of this system,

with accounts being held in fictitious names.        Nsgono (1988) estimates that

over 70 percent of all personal saving took advsntsge of these tax exempt

vehicles with 13.5 trillion yen ($110 billion) escaping the tax base.




                                          9
    The tax exempt saving system was abolished in the 1987 reform except

for those deemed truly to need social assistance       (the elderly, single

parent families, and the handicapped).        It has been replaced with a flat

tax on all interest income (withheld at source) of 20 percent, with 15

percent collected for the national government and 5 percent for local
taxes.

    The second tax advantage offered on interest income is separate

taxation.     Even before 1987, interest received on savings deposits and

similar accounts (other than tax exempt ones) waa subject to a separate 20

percent withholding tax at source and then could be excluded from taxable

income in filing a return.     For other forms of interest income (bond

interest, etc.) the taxpayer could aggregate it with taxable income or pay

a separate tax of 35 percent.     None of interest income was subject to the

marginal rates ranging up to 70 percent shown in the rate schedule.         This

separate taxation option will remain available if the present reform

package is adopted.

    The taxpayer also has the option of sepsrste taxation of dividend

income.     Again, this effectively shields the dividend recipient      from the

highest marginal tax rates in Table 2.        For dividends the marginal rate for

the optional separate taxation is 35 percent as long as the recipient owns

less than five percent of the outstanding equity and as long as the amount

of dividends received from that corporation is less than 500,000 yen

(roughly $4,000).     Rich investors can avoid these limits through

diversification.     However, separate taxation is unavailable on the

dividends of closely held corporations.        For small dividends,   there is even

a better treatment.     If an individual receives a dividend of less than


                                         10
                                                           then he may
100,000 yen ($800) from a company (excluding mutual funds)

elect seperate taxation at the marginal rate of 20 percent.

    In addition to the advantages of separate taxation, dividends are
                                level due to another feature of the
lightly taxed at the individual

individual tax law.   For taxpayers with ordinary taxable income of less

than 10 million yen ($81,300), a tax credit amounting to ten percent of

dividends received is allowed.   For those with higher taxable incomes, the

credit is reduced, although it always exceeds five percent.   The basic ten


percent credit means that the maximum marginal rate of national level

taxation of dividends (which occurs under separate taxation) is effectively

25 percent (10 percent for small dividends).
                                                                 the
    Capital gains on securities are not taxed in Japan, although

current proposal would change this.   It would give taxpayers the option of

paying a tax equal to one percent of the value of the stock transaction or

to pay a separate tax on the actual gain at the rate of twenty percent.

The one percent of sales value option implies that capital gains on

securities will still be very lightly taxed in Japan relative to their

current treatment in the U.S. (fully taxable at ordinary rates upon
                                                                           in
realization).   Capital gains on land and buildings are taxed separately

Japan with the terms depending on the holding period.

    Before the 198] tax reform, corporate capital return was extremely

                                       11
all interest income will be separately taxed at a 20 percent rate.

However, capital gains will still be lightly taxed and dividenda will still

be eligible for a tax credit and optional separate taxation with a 35

percent rate.

    The general outline of the corporate income tax in
                                                       Japan is not
terribly different from the United States.    As in our country, the tax base

is corporate profits or the excess of gross revenue over total costs.

Included in costs are the interest payments on debt obligations (both bonds

end bsnk loans).     In other words, interest expenses are deductible as in

the United States.    The corporate tax is
                                           approximately a flat rate system

(also as in the United States) with slightly lower rates applying to
                                                                     only

very small corporations.
    The Japanese corporation income tax differs from the kserican one in

its treatment of dividends paid and inter-corporate   dividends.   The current

Japanese tax system attempts to partially offset the double taxation of

corporate equity income by taxing dividends paid at a lower rate than

retained earnings.    The current national rates are 42 percent for retained

earnings and 32 percent for dividends paid (reduced in 1987 from 43.3 and

33.3 percent, respectively).    The effective rates including local taxes are

approximately 55 and 45 percent respectively.    The Ministry of Finance

estimates the overall marginal corporate tax rate on
                                                     equity income as 51.55
percent in 1988 (down from 52.92 percent in 1986).    This compares to their
estimate of the U.S. rate (including state corporation income
                                                              taxes) of

40.34 percent.

    The current reform proposal would phase out this
                                                     separate treatment of

dividends and returned earnings.    It proposes that the national corporation


                                       12
income tax rate be set at 37.5 percent for 1990 and beyond.        While this is

                                                                 the
only slightly higher than the U.S. corporate rate of 34 percent,

difference widens when you take state and local level taxation into

account.   The Ministry of Finance estimates that the total Japanese

corporate rate would be 49.99 percent under their proposals compared to the

U.S. figure of 40.34 percent.

    Unlike the U.S. tax system, the Japanese corporation income tax has

always exempted intercorporate dividend income from the tax base, thus

avoiding double taxation.    However, the new proposal adopts the U.S.

practice of partial taxation of dividends received by a corporation.             It

proposes including 10 percent of corporate dividends received in the

corporate tax hase in 1989, with 20 percent (the U.S. figure) inclusion in

1990 and thereafter.

    The Japanese tax system permits several types of tax-free reserves

which serve to reduce reported corporate earnings and therefore taxes.

These reserves include the    (1) reserve for   bad debts,   (2) reserve   for

returned goods, (3) reserve for employee bonus payments,        (4) reserve for

retirement allowances,    (5) reserve for repairs and product guarantees,         (6)

reserve for overseas market development for small and medium-sized

corporations, etc.     In 1986 the reserve fund for price fluctuation was
             1
abolished.

    It is the interaction of the Japanese corporation and individual income

tax which can create very low effective taxation of corporate capital

income.    Given that the corporate statutory rate is relatively high and

     1
        As something of an aside, it might be noted that these reserve
accounts lower corporate earnings and may partially explain the
traditionally high price-earnings ratios on Japanese equity securities.

                                        13
the individual rates on interest relatively low, interest payments are in

effect subsidized.     The cost to a corporation of making a 10 percent

interest payment will be roughly 5 percent even if the new proposed rate

structure is adopted.     On the other hand, the investor will receive 8

percent (after the 20 percent tax).    This net subsidy clearly reduces the

cost of capital. It also is less effective at lower nominal interest rates.



3.     The Pressures for Reform




     The previous section described most of the elements of the enacted and

proposed tax reform.     Those include virtual elimination of the tax free

savings account system except for people in special circumstances,     reducing
the number of brackets and the highest rates for the individual income tax,

raising the individual    income tax's threshold income levels, lowering the

basic rate of the corporation income tax and eliminating the different

treatment of dividends paid and retained earnings, curtailing the use of

corporation reserve accounts, and introducing a tax on intercorporate

dividends.

     There is one additional major component of the proposed tax reform.

That is the introduction of a new consumption-type value added tax.       The

current proposal is for a broad based 3 percent tax with very limited

exemptions.   There would be an exemption for very small enterprises (sales

less than $240,000) and a simplified procedure available to small and

medium-sized firms (sales under $4 million).    A   large member of specific

excise taxes (the commodity tax, the playing-cards     tax, sugar excise tax,

admission tax, travel tax, electricity tax, timber delivery tax, etc.)


                                        14
would be repealed.     The commodity tax currently applies to a number of

luxury goods.   However, in an economy as dynamic as Japan's, many of the

taxed items (e.g. air-conditioners, television sets, refrigerators, etc.)

are no longer appropriately considered luxuries.

    There are a number of separate pressures for Japanese tax reform that

can be identified.     These include compliance problems with the existing tax

system and a widespread feeling that it      is unfair, international   trade

frictions and pressures    encouraging the Japanese to adopt a more pro-

consumption tax system, concern about the international mobility of

factors, particularly capital and entrepreneurs, in the face of a Jmpanese

system with comparatively high marginal tax rates, projections that

government revenues will need to expand significantly to deal with the

rapid growth of the retired population, and concern that corporate tax

revenues would be jeopardized (through transfer pricing and financial

arbitrage) unless the Japanese corporation income tax were roughly

harmonized with the recently changed U.S. tax system.



    a.   Compliance Problems and Fairness Considerations



         Fairness issues are probably the biggest motivator of the Japanese

    reform movement.    The same may well have been true in the U.S.      One

    very important aspect of the Japanese compliance and fairness problem
    is referred to as "10-5-3" or sometimes "9-6-4".      These numbers refer

    to the fact that it is commonly believed that 90-100 percent of the

    income of workers is subject to tax, whereas only 50-60 percent of

    business income (particularly the income of small businesses) is


                                        15
reported, and only 30 to 40 percent of farm income is subject to tax.

This widely perceived inequality has been documented   in the research of

Ishi (1984) and Honma (1984).   The problem is thought to have gotten

worse in the past twenty years (Noguchi, 1988).   The introduction of a

VAT is thought to help this 10-5-3 problem in two ways.    First, the

required record keeping and invoice reporting will improve income

reporting on the income tax.    And, second, the VAT itself will be borne

by all consumers relatively evenly.
    A second aspect of the compliance problem is that there is no

taxpayer identification   scheme (similar to the 13.5. social security

number or taxpayer ID number) in Japan.    This facilitated the abuse of

the Maruyu saving system and adds to the general impression that the

wealthy could conceal income from taxation.    There has been tremendous

political opposition to the introduction of an ID system.     The result

has been increasing use of a withholding at source system (now for

interest income as well as wages and proposed for capital gains).        It

is hoped that the combination of withholding taxes and a VAT will

considerably improve the fairness of the Japanese tax system.



b. The Agins Society



    The Japanese position in Table 1 as the least taxed major OECD

country is largely due to its relatively light social security burden.

Japan has one of the lowest fractions of the populations which is

elderly, but it also is aging faster than any other major economy.        The


upper panel of Table 4 shows that the number of people of working age

                                   16
per elderly person in Japan ia projected to fall from 5.9 in 1985 to

2.3 in 2020.     This ratio is, of course, of utmost importance for pay-

as-you-go national retirement schemes such as those in Japan and the

U.S.     Some of the expenses of Japanese social security coverage are

paid for out of general revenues and the expectation is that the

reliance on general revenues will have to he increased.        The lower

panel of Table 4 shows that while Japan has had the lowest fraction of

elderly in their populationbetween 1950 and 1985, by 2000 their

elderly fraction will be more than 30 percent greater than in the U.S.

and by 2020, they will have the highest fraction of elderly of the five

countries shown.     It is projected that the fraction of the Japanese

population which will be over 65 will be more than twice the fraction

that are currently elderly in either the U.S. or Japan.        The 28 percent

total tax load shown in Table 1 is expected        to rise to about 50

percent, unless the design of the social security system is altered.

The proposed new VAT, which would be introduced with an initial 3

percent rate, is thought to have the potential to be a major future

contributor to the necessary revenues to deal with the aging

population.     If it is to be   so,   of course, it will be necessary to

raise the tax rate markedly.




c.     Labor Supply and the Brain Drain Fear




       Reducing the progreasivity of the individual income tax is an

important and intentional element of the Japanese tax reform.        Noguchi

(1988) reports that high salaried workers whose incomes are roughly 10


                                        17

million yen ($81,300) or more have been    exerting strong political

pressure for relief.    This pressure was increased by the flattening of

the marginal tax rate schedules in both the U.S. and the U.K.

    There has been little opposition to lowering the top marginal

rates.   Due to the possibilities for separate taxation, they are only

applicable to the high salaries of top executives, entertainers,

athletes, etc.   There seems to be concern sbout the labor supply

effects of the high tax rates.    More pointedly, there is concern about

the location decisions of high tech international firms.    Hasegawa

(1988) states that "the burden it (the Japsnese tax system) imposes on

                                                       flow of elite
high-income earnera is undeniably an impediment to the

business personnel into Japan."    He feels that Japanese businesses now

are trying to lure high-caliber foreign talent to Japan, but that they

are finding both traditional labor practices and the tax systems to be

severe handicaps.     Further, he worries about a "brain drain" away from

Japan as executives    find that they can locate facilities abroad with

lower labor costs and more attractive tax environments,




    d.    Financial Arbitrage and Transfer Pricing




    At least as worrisome as a loss of high skilled labor (or an

inability to attract top talent to Japan) is a possible capital outflow

due to Japan's relatively steep corporate tax rate,     With the U.K.

having lowered its statutory corporate rate from 45 to 35 percent in

1986 and with the U.S. having dropped its rate from 46 to 34 percent,




                                    19
     many Japaneae are worried about their international competitive

     poaition with reapect to thia tax.

         The problem of having a high atatutory corporate rate ia not only

     that capital will locate elsewhere, but also that reported domastic

     profits of international companies may be transferred abroad.

     Multinational   companies have a strong incentive to borrow in countries

     with high tax rates in order to lower equity profits there.     Further,

     the use of internal transfer pricing can shift reported profits from

     higher rate countries than those with lower rates.    It is possible that

     high corporate rates thus become counter-productive in terms of

     generating revenue.   This type of argument, and the concerns of

     transfer pricing and international borrowing, have been major

     pressures for lowering corporate rates in Canada as well as in Japan.

         If the current reform is adopted, Japan, the U.S., and the U.K.

     will have very similar rates of corporate taxation at the national

     level.   The rates will range froa 34 to 37.5 percent.    Such a narrow

     range probably stops most accounting practices designed solely for

     relocating profits.



4.   The Effective Rate of Tsxation on Corporate Capital Income




     My earlier work with Tachibanaki (Shoven and Tachibanaki, 1988) found

that the Japanese government got a very small percentage      (4.4%) of the

return on domestically financed incremental investments in 1980, while the

investor (on average) got 95.6 percent of the return.     In this section,

the methodology that gave us that finding is summarized and the results are


                                          20
recalculated for 1985 and for the 1988 proposed reform package.         The new

results differ dramatically from the earlier study.

    The Shoven and Tachibanaki study used the same methodology as King and

Fullerton   (1984).    What is examined   is the total tax wedge   between the

return of an incremental investment and the return realized by the investor

or financier.    The approach takes into account both company level taxation

and personal level taxation.

    In this paper I use exactly the same methodology.        In fact, I use the

"PTAXJAP" software made available by Mervyn King.       Thia software adapts the

King-Fullerton   approach to the Japanese tax system.      The input tax

parameters are those I developed with Tachibanaki, appropriately updated to

1985 and to reflect the reform propoaal.

    As in Shoven-Tachibanaki     (1988) and King-Fullerton   (1984), the tax

wedge and effective tax rate is calculated separately for different types
of assets, financial instruments, industries, and type of investor.         Three

types of assets (machinery, buildings, and inventories), three financial

instruments   (debt,   retained earnings, and new equity iaauea), three

industries (manufacturing, commerce, and other, which is mostly

construction,    transportation, communications,    and utilities), and three

classes of investors (householda, tax-exempt inatitutiona, and insurance

companies) are distinguished.      All told then, there are three

possibilities    in each of four categories, which means that there are 81

different combinations.      All investments, are aasumed to earn a real return

of 10 percent.    The aoftware calculates the net return earned by the

investor for each of the 81 combinations, as well as the total taxes

collected for each.      Features of the tax law that are taken into account


                                           21
include accelerated depreciation, inventory accounting, investment tax

                                                     the corporate    income
credits, the deductibility of interest payments from
                                                         of taxation and
tax, the treatment of capital gains, and the interaction

inflation in the tax system.

    Table S contains the effective tax rate (the tax wedge divided by the

                                     for 1985.   The figures are calculated
gross real return) results for Japan

for three rates of inflation, 0 percent, 5 percent, and 10 percent.     The

                                                                27
figures in each row refer to the average marginal tax wedge for

different combinations of investment flows.   For example, the number for

                                                        This is the average

marginal tax wedge for machinery investments in three different industries,

using three sources of finance, and for three different classes of owners.
                                                              for three
Similarly, the number for debt (-28.6 percent) is the average
                                                             different
types of debt financed assets in three industries with three

classes of owners.   The pattern shown in Table 5 for 1985 is quite similar

to the results in Shoven and Tschibsnski (1988) for 1980.   Both sets of

results show thst the overall effective marginal tax rate was low at 10

percent inflation, but substantially higher at lower rates of inflation.

The main reason for this inflation effect is that the effective tax rate on

debt financed investments declines rapidly as nominal interest rates rise.

In 1985 Japan had a total (national plus local) corporate tax rate of 57

percent for retained earnings.   Given that interest payments were

deductible   from this tax and were very lightly taxed st the individual

level, s net subsidy resulted for debt financed investments.    The effective

tax rate for equity financed investments actually rises with inflation,

primarily due to unindexed depreciation deductions.

    Despite the fact that the pattern of the numbers in Table 5 is similar

to those for 1980, the "beat guess" -effective marginal rate of taxation on

corporate   investments in Japan changed considerably between 1980 and 1985.

Shoven and Tachibanaki (1988) estimated the overall figure to be 4.4

percent in 1980.   However, that result depended on a specification    of the

expected rate of inflation which was taken as the average of the inflation

rates experienced in the 1970a (9 percent).    By 1985, Japan had experienced

several years of 2 percent inflation.    If that is taken as the expected

rate of inflation, the overall tax rate for 1985 is about 26 percent.

    The effective tax rate calculations for the current proposal are shown

in Table 6.   The increased tax on interest income, the reduced corporate

tax rate, the elimination of the differential between retained earnings and

dividends, and the new capital gains tax on profits on securities are all

captured in the model.    The tax reform would slightly increase the

effective corporate tax rate at zero inflation and would make the tax rate

much leas sensitive to inflation.    The large potential subsidy to debt

financed investments is largely eliminated by the reduction   in the

statutory corporate tax rates and by the increase in the taxation of

interest income at the individual level.

    The "best guess" overall effective tax rate for new corporate

investments in Japan after the implementation of the 1988 tax reform

proposals is 31.8 percent.    The reason that this number is chosen from the

bottom row of Table 6 is that there is now a remarkable degree of price

level stability in Japan.    Consumer prices rose 0.6 percent in 1986, 0.1

percent in 1987, and are expected to increase about 0.4 percent in 1988.

     The overall conclusion that I draw from Table S and 6 is that the

effective rate of taxation of new investment in Japan has risen

substantially since 1980.     Most of that increase hss taken place because of

the elimination of inflation.     The tax reform itself would increase the

effective tax rate slightly (at zero percent inflation) and take a major

stride in making the system less sensitive to inflation, should it return.

The tax incentives for debt, while still considerable, would be

substantially     reduced.

     The effective tax rate faced by Japanese investors on domestic

corporate investments remains lower than the effective tax rate faced by

American inveators on U.S. corporate investments.     The difference has

narrowed, however.      At four percent inflation, Fullerton (1987) found that

the 1986 tax reform raised the overall U.S. effective tax rate on new

corporate investment from 29.4 percent to 41.1 percent.      The U.S. tax

reform's main accomplishment     in this area was evening the treatment of

different corporate assets (e.g. plant vs. equipment) by eliminating the

investment tax credit on equipment and by adjusting depreciation lifetimes.

Tables 5 and 6 indicate that the differences across asset type were not

great in Japan even before their reform.      What neither country has

addressed is the substantial difference between the treatnent of owner

occupied housing and corporate capital investments.



5.   Conclusion




     The Japanese tax reform proposals are extremely significant.        The

probable changes in their system are at least ma fundamental as those


                                         26
contained in the U.s. 1986 Tax Reform Act.   The taxation of the formerly

tax free savings accounts,   the introduction of a tax on security capital

gains, and the adoption of a VAT will greatly improve the perceptionof

fairness of the system.   The VAT is likely to he the tax vehicle that will

permit Japan to finance its rapidly growing dependent elderly population.

And, a combination of several elements in the reform and the almost

complete absence of inflation have caused the effective tax rate on

corporate capital income to increase to a point where it is comparable,

although still lower, than the corresponding U.S. figures.    The reforms of

1987 have already reduced the tax system's bias towards debt and made its

effects on investment incentives less dependent on the rate of inflation.
