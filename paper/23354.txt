                                         ABSTRACT

What is the optimal form of firm organization during ‚Äúbad times‚Äù? We present a model of
delegation within the firm to show that the effect is ambiguous. The greater turbulence following
macro shocks may benefit decentralized firms because the value of local information increases
(the ‚Äúlocalist‚Äù view). On the other hand, the need to make tough decisions may favor centralized
firms (the ‚Äúcentralist‚Äù view). Using two large micro datasets on firm decentralization from ten
OECD countries and US administrative data, we find that firms that delegated more power from
the Central Headquarters to local plant managers prior to the Great Recession out-performed their
centralized counterparts in sectors that were hardest hit by the subsequent crisis. Using direct
measures of turbulence based on product churn and stock market volatility, we show that the
localist mechanism dominates. This conclusion is robust to alternative explanations such as
managerial fears of bankruptcy and changing coordination costs. Although delegation is better
suited to some environments than others, countries with more decentralized firms (like the US)
weathered the 2008-09 Great Recession better: these organizational differences account for about
15% of international differences in post-crisis GDP growth.

       What is the optimal form of rm organization during bad times? We present a model of delegation

   within the rm to show that the eect is ambiguous. The greater turbulence following macro shocks may

   benet decentralized rms because the value of local information increases (the localist view). On the

   other hand, the need to make tough decisions may favor centralized rms (the centralist view). Using

   two large micro datasets on rm decentralization from ten OECD countries and US administrative data,

   we nd that rms that delegated more power from the Central Headquarters to local plant managers prior

   to the Great Recession out-performed their centralized counterparts in sectors that were hardest hit by the

   subsequent crisis. Using direct measures of turbulence based on product churn and stock market volatility,

   we show that the localist mechanism dominates. This conclusion is robust to alternative explanations such

   as managerial fears of bankruptcy and changing coordination costs. Although delegation is better suited

   to some environments than others, countries with more decentralized rms (like the US) weathered the

   2008-09 Great Recession better: these organizational dierences account for about 15% of international

   dierences in post-crisis GDP growth.

1      Introduction
What makes rms more resilient to large negative macro shocks? A recent literature has focused on rms'

technological, nancial and governance structures as possible factors aecting their ability to cope with

                                                1
sudden changes in external conditions , but much less is known about the role of rm organization. This

paper focuses on how a specic organizational aspect of a rm:                      the extent to which decision-making is

decentralized down from headquarters to plant managers, aects performance during an economic crisis.

This has particular relevance following the Great Recession of 2009-08, which generated a debate over

how best to organize for recovery and survival. One common argument is that centralized rms were best

equipped to survive the recession because of the importance of cost cutting which, due to conicting interests

within the rm, is best directed from corporate headquarters (the centralist view). An alternative localist

view is that recessions are periods of rapid change, and being decentralized provides rms with the necessary

exibility to respond to turbulent business conditions.
                                                                  2

     To investigate these issues, we created two new panel datasets with explicit measures of decentralization

measured prior to the Great Recession.               One dataset, the World Management Survey (WMS) has rm

level data across ten OECD countries (France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Japan, Poland, Portugal Sweden,

the UK and US). The other dataset, the Management and Organizational Practices Survey (MOPS), is an

establishment level dataset covering U.S. manufacturing plants.
                                                                             3 which we constructed in partnership with

the Census Bureau. We combine these datasets with rm and plant performance data before and after the

2009-08 crisis.

     In order to guide the empirical analysis, we develop a model of rm decision-making building on the

Aghion and Tirole (1997) approach. The model illustrates two countervailing eects of decentralization on

rm performance during a crisis. On the one hand, a crisis is more likely to reduce the level of congruence

between the CEO and the plant managerfor example, tough decisions on closing down projects and laying

o sta will be resisted by local managers.             At the same time, however, a crisis can also increase turbu-

lence/uncertainty, thus making local information more valuable. In this case, a crisis would actually make

decentralization more attractive, since it enables rms to better understand and adapt to the turbulent busi-

ness environment. This result is akin to those emerging from a wide class of models where higher turbulence

and uncertainty increase the value of local knowledge and the benets of decentralization. The net eect of

    1 For   example, see Aghion, Askenazy, Berman, Cette, and Eymard (2012) on technology; Chodorow-Reich (2014) on nancial
structure and Alfaro and Chen (2012) or D'Aurizio, Oliviero and Romano (2015) on governance.
    2 Support   for these starkly dierent views can be found, for example, in reports by the Economist Intelligence Unit.    In
the depths of the Great Recession in June 2009 they wrote in favor of centralization during the crisis:        Firms should be
centralizing their decision-making processes. [...] In a recession investments and other decisions are scrutinized more carefully
by senior management and a greater emphasis is placed on projects that provide benets across the enterprise rather than
individual units.    Yet three months later in August the same publication supported decentralization: Companies have to
deal with dramatically more uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity in the current recession.        Success does not come from
centralization. True exibility arises when those who are closest to customers are empowered to respond to constant shifts in
demand, preferences and attitudes.
    3 We    use the terms establishment and plant interchangeably throughout.




                                                                 2
decentralization on rm performance is thus theoretically ambiguous.

    We then turn to the empirical analysis and nd compelling evidence that, in sectors that were exogenously

hit harder by the crisis, decentralized rms outperformed their centralized rivals in terms of survival chances

as well as in their growth of sales, productivity and prots. We use several measures of the shock, including

changes in trade patterns (exports in an establishment's industry by country cell) and a pre-recession measure

of product durability to measure the shock (durable goods industries suer more in recessions as consumers

can postpone purchases). Our ndings are robust to placebo tests, and a wide range of controls.

    Consistent with our model, we show that our empirical results are driven by the fact that the industries

which had the most severe downturns during the Great Recession also had the largest increase in turbulence.
                                                                                                                              4

To show this, we employ a novel industry level measure of turbulence, the rate of new product additions

and subtractions (product churn), which we built from the US Census of Manufactures ten digit product

data.   As shown in Bernard and Okubo (2015), product churn rises sharply during recessionsin a crisis

establishments both destroy more existing products and also create more new products.
                                                                                                       5 Using this measure

on the US Census sample, we nd that decentralization signicantly protected establishments from the

downturn in industries which had a bad shock, and an increase in product churn. We validate these results

using an alternative measure of turbulence based on the stock market volatility, which is available for the

international WMS sample as well as the US MOPS.

    Alternative explanations of our results based on reduced agency problems, nancial conditions, lower

coordination costs, omitted variables and other factors do not seem so consistent with the data.                       Finally,

although organizational change is slow (we show evidence of large adjustment costs), rms subject to large

negative shocks appear more likely to decentralize.

    Overall, our paper suggests that the internal organization of rms may serve as an important mediating

factor through which macroeconomic shocks aect rm performance and, ultimately, growth.

    Our paper builds on an extensive prior literature. The benets of exploiting local knowledge harks back

to a classic economic debate over economic systems between Lange (1936) and Von Hayek (1945). Lange

argued that a centralized socialist economy would outperform a decentralized market economy, partly because

the central planner could co-ordinate better, for example by setting prices to internalize externalities. By

contrast, Hayek argued that it was impossible to aggregate all the local knowledge of agents, and it was both

more ecient (and just) to allow individuals to make their decentralized choices based on the their local

information. Modern organizational economics builds upon these trade-os                  within   a rm rather than across

   4 Bloom, Floetotto, Jaimovich, Saporta-Eksten and Terry (2016) shows a large variety of datasets that suggest that turbulence
and uncertainty rise in downturns.
   5 Contrary   to Bernard and Okubo (2015), Broda and Weinstein (2010) report a pro-cyclical product churn. However, they
have a a very dierent focuslooking at the net change in the product oering in retail stores (the number of new bar code
products sold less current products no-longer sold)and a dierent time period (1994 and 1999-2003) spanning one mild recession.
In contrast, our measure is gross product churn (new products plus dropped products), is built on manufacturing establishment
production data, and spans 15 years from 1997-2012, exploiting aggregate and industry variation.




                                                               3
the economy as a whole. On the theory side, our paper relates to the literature on decentralization within

the rm (see Gibbons, Matouschek and Roberts, 2013, or Garicano and Rayo, 2016 for recent surveys) and

incomplete contracts (see Gibbons and Roberts, 2013, and Aghion, Bloom and Van Reenen, 2014 for surveys).

In particular, Hart and Moore (2005) analyze the optimal allocation of authority in multi-layer hierarchies.

Dessein (2002) analyzes how the allocation of control can help incorporate the agent's information into

decision-making in a situation where the agent has private information.
                                                                                       6

    Our paper also relates to the existing empirical literature on decentralization and its determinants.

For example, Rajan and Wulf (2006) and Blundell et al.                      (2016) document a movement towards atter

organizations and decentralized rms in the US and UK respectively. Caroli and Van Reenen (2001) and

Bresnahan, Brynjolfsson and Hitt (2002) point at positive correlations between decentralization and both

human capital and information technology. Guadalupe and Wulf (2009) argue that the Canadian-US Free

Trade Agreement (FTA) in 1989 constitutes an exogenous increase in competition for US rms in the

industries where taris were removed and this caused greater delayering and decentralization. Closest to our

analysis is Acemoglu et al. (2007), whose model assumes rms can learn about the outcome of an investment

decision from observing other rms. Hence, in sectors with more heterogeneity/turbulence or where the rm

is closer to the performance frontier (so that learning is more limited) decision-making control should be more

decentralized. In the contract literature, Prendergast (1982) suggested that the puzzle of performance pay

in uncertain and turbulent environments (where higher risk should make the agent less willing to accept a

high-powered contract) could be because of the need to exploit local information more eectively. Similarly,

in the rm boundaries literature, Lafontaine and Slade (2007) also suggest that a similar puzzle over the

lack of a negative impact of turbulence on franchising (vs. direct control), could again be related to the need

to exploit the franchiser's superior local knowledge, which is more important in such environments. None of

these papers, however, look at the interplay between rm decentralization, shocks and turbulence which is

the center of our analysis.
                                 7

    The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the model, Section 3 the data and methodology

and Section 4 establishes our main empirical nding that in times of crisis decentralized rms outperform

their centralized counterparts. Section 5 considers extensions, showing that volatility seems to matter rather

than other mechanisms such as changing levels of congruence and Section 7 concludes.

   6 In   contrast to Aghion and Tirole (1997), there is no information acquisition eort by the agent or the principal, therefore
in Dessein's model the allocation of authority is not so much a tool to motivate the agent (as in Aghion and Tirole) or give a
supplier incentives to make relationship specic investments (as in Grossman and Hart, 1986). A key insight in Dessein (2002)
is that in a world with asymmetric information and contractual incompleteness, the delegation of authority from a Principal to
an Agent is often the best way to elicit the agent's private information.
   7 Bradley   et al (2011) report a positive relationship between rm independencewhich they interpret as a proxy for greater
autonomy in resource allocation decisionsand rm survival during downturns using Swedish data.




                                                                 4
2      A simple model
To guide the empirical analysis of the relationship between rm performance and decentralization during a

crisis, we develop a simple model based upon Aghion and Tirole (1997). The key idea is that there is a trade

o between incentives and local information. Possible misalignment of interests between the CEO and the

plant manager favors centralization. But the plant manager is likely to have better local information than

the CEO, which is a force for decentralization. A negative shock may aect the returns to decentralization

in two, opposite, ways.            First, it may reduce the benets of decentralization, by increasing the possible

misalignment of interests between the CEO and the plant manager. Second, it may increase the benets of

decentralization by increasing the informational asymmetry between the CEO and the plant manager, and

thus the value of local information.




2.1 Basic set up
We consider a one-period model of a rm with one principal (the CEO/central headquarters) and one agent

(the plant manager). The CEO cares about the protability of the business,
                                                                                             8 whereas the plant manager

wants to maximize private benets and is not responsive to monetary incentives.
                                                                                                  9 Taking an uninformed

action involves potentially disastrous outcomes, thus an action will be taken only if at least one of the two

parties is informed. Also, the agent obtains private benets only if the rm remains in business.

     There are       n‚â•3      possible actions (or projects) and at any point in time only two of them are "relevant",

i.e. avoid negative payos to the parties. Among these two actions, one maximizes monetary protability,

one maximizes the agent's private utility. Other actions lead to very negative payos to both parties.

     With        ex ante   probability   Œ± the agent's preferred action (conditional upon the rm remaining in business)
will also be the action that maximizes prots (or monetary eciency); this variable                  Œ±   captures the degree

of congruence between the principal's preferences and the agent's preferences. If preferences coincide, then

the action that maximizes the private utility of the agent also yields monetary utility                  B   to the principal;

if preferences do not coincide, the action that maximizes the agent's private utility yields monetary payo

B‚àík         to the principal.

     Informational assumptions:                 We assume that the principal knows about project payos with prob-

ability     p,   but does not know directly which action the agent actually performed. On the other hand, the

agent is assumed to be perfectly informed about the project payos.

     Turbulence:           Suppose that the principal can obtain an early signal of forthcoming performance, e.g. a

current realization of income, at some cost            C,   and can then possibly decide to re the agent if she believes

    8 For   simplicity, we abstract from the agency problem between the owners of the rm and the CEO. The results just rely on
the plausible assumption that the CEO cares more about the overall prots of the company than the plant manager.
    9 This   is to rule out implementation of a performance pay contract to overcome the principal-agent problem.   Obviously,
we could allow some incentive contracts and so long as these only partially deal with the agency problem, the mechanisms we
describe here would still be at play.




                                                                  5
that the signal is due to the agent's choosing a non-prot maximizing action. In the absence of turbulence,

the signal reveals the bad action choice perfectly. But the higher the degree of turbulence, the more dicult

it is for the principal to infer action choice from performance.

        Thus, suppose that current performance is given by



                                                          y =a+Œµ


where      a ‚àà {a1 , a2 }   denotes the agent's action choice (e.g.        a decision whether or not to introduce a new

       10
product , with          a1 < a2   and   Œµ   is a noise term uniformly distributed on the interval    [‚àíu, u].


2.2 Solving the model
Suppose that the plant manager takes the non-prot maximizing action                    a1   (e.g. a decision which delays the

introduction of a new product). The CEO will infer the action choice from observing the signal realization:



                                                             y =a+Œµ,


if and only if     y ‚àà [a1 ‚àí u, a2 ‚àí u)‚à™ (a1 + u, a2 + u]      and then can correct it if she has control rights, i.e. under

centralization.

        By Bayes' rule the probability of the CEO guessing the action choice is:



                                     P (u) = Pr(y ‚àà [a1 ‚àí u, a2 ‚àí u) ‚à™ (a1 + u, a2 + u]) ,                                   (1)



that is:
                                                                   2(a2 ‚àí a1 )
                                                   P (u) = min{                , 1}.                                         (2)
                                                                  a2 ‚àí a1 + 2u

        The probability of guessing the correct action is clearly declining in the amount of noise parameterized

by   u.   Hence, the probability that the prot-maximizing action will be taken eventually under centralization

(   ‚Ñ¶   ), is equal to:

                                                    ‚Ñ¶(u) = P (u) + (1 ‚àí P (u))Œ±,                                             (3)



where      P   is the probability that the principal acquires the information about projects payos.

    10 Equivalently,   this could be whether to drop an existing product from the portfolio or to make an investment in marketing
or sales that enhances the product's value to the consumer. The key thing is that the decision has to have some irreversibility.




                                                                   6
2.3 Centralization versus decentralization
The   ex ante    CEO's payo under decentralization, is equal to:



                                              Œ†d = Œ±B + (1 ‚àí Œ±)(B ‚àí k)


   The     ex ante    CEO's payo under centralization (i.e.         if the CEO delegates no authority to the plant

manager), is equal to:

                                        Œ†c = ‚Ñ¶(u)B + [1 ‚àí ‚Ñ¶(u)](B ‚àí k) ‚àí C                                        (4)



   The net gain from centralization is then given by:



                                        ‚àÜŒ† = Œ†c ‚àí Œ†d = P (u)(1 ‚àí Œ±)k ‚àí C.                                         (5)




2.4 Two countervailing eects of a bad shock
We think of a bad shock as reducing congruence between the principal and the agent.                  For example, the

negative shock may require cost-cutting such as closing down plants and laying o employees which will

be particularly resisted by middle managers. More formally, to the extent that the principal has invested

wealth in the project whereas the agent is subject to limited liability. In other words, a bad shock is likely

to increase   k.   For a given level of uncertainty   u,   this will make centralization more attractive as:


                                               ‚àÇ‚àÜŒ†
                                                   = P (u)(1 ‚àí Œ±) > 0.                                            (6)
                                                ‚àÇk

   There is, however, also much evidence (summarized in Bloom, Floetotto, Jaimovich, Saporta-Eksten and

Terry, 2016) that negative macro shocks are usually associated with greater turbulence and uncertainty (i.e.

a higher   u).   This makes centralization   less   attractive, since:



                                              ‚àÇ‚àÜŒ†
                                                  = (1 ‚àí Œ±)kP 0 (u) ‚â§ 0                                           (7)
                                               ‚àÇu

   If the level of turbulence does not change after the occurrence of a bad shock, the overall eect of a bad

shock is to make centralization unambiguously more attractive. However, if uncertainty increases with a bad

shock and    k   does not change, the bad shock makes centralization become less attractive. Hence, the impact

of a bad shock is theoretically ambiguous. We will investigate empirically which eect dominates, and then

return to the theory to help inform potential mechanisms.




                                                               7
3     Data Description and Measurement
We start by describing in some detail our decentralization data since this involved an extensive new survey

process. We then describe the accounting and administrative data matched with the survey-based measures

of decentralization and the proxies measuring the severity of the Great Recession. We describe our measures

of turbulence in Section 5 when we discuss theoretical mechanisms. More details on the data are in online

Appendix A.




3.1 Decentralization
Cross-country data: World Management Survey (WMS)                                Our international decentralization data

was collected in the context of the World Management Survey (WMS), a large scale project aimed at

collecting high quality data on management and organizational design across rms around the world. The

survey is conducted through an interview with a plant manager in medium sized manufacturing rms.

    We asked four questions on decentralization from the central headquarters to the local plant manager.

First, we asked how much capital investment a plant manager could undertake without prior authorization

from the corporate headquarters.          This is a continuous variable enumerated in national currency that we

convert into dollars using PPPs.
                                11 We also inquired on where decisions were eectively made in three other

dimensions: (a) the introduction of a new product, (b) sales and marketing decisions and (c) hiring a new

full-time permanent shop oor employee. These more qualitative variables were scaled from a score of 1,

dened as all decisions taken at the corporate headquarters, to a score of 5 dened as complete power (real

authority) of the plant manager.          In Appendix Table A1 we detail the individual questions in the same

order as they appeared in the survey. Since the scaling may vary across all these questions, we standardized

the scores from the four decentralization questions to z-scores by normalizing each question to mean zero

and standard deviation one. We then average across all four z-scores and then z-score the average again to

have our primary measure of overall decentralization. In the same survey we collected a large amount of

additional data to use as controls, including management practice information following the methodology of

Bloom and Van Reenen (2007) and human resource information (e.g. the proportion of the workforce with

college degrees, average hours worked, the gender and age breakdown within the rm).

    We attempt to achieve unbiased survey responses to our questions by taking a range of steps. First, the

survey was conducted by telephone without telling the managers they were being scored on organizational

or management practices.         This enabled scoring to be based on the interviewer's evaluation of the rm's

actual practices, rather than their aspirations, the manager's perceptions or the interviewer's impressions.

To run this blind scoring we used open questions (i.e. To introduce a new product, what agreement would

 11 One   reason that the main regressions control for size is that the value of this question might be mechanically greater for
larger rms and plants.




                                                               8
your plant need from corporate headquarters?), rather than closed questions (e.g. Can you introduce new

products without authority from corporate headquarters?               [yes/no]) (see question in Table A1). Second,

the interviewers did not know anything about the rm's nancial information or performance in advance

of the interview.
                     12 Consequently, the survey tool is double blind - managers do not know they are being

scored and interviewers do not know the performance of the rm. These manufacturing rms (the median

size was 250 employees) are mostly privately held and too small to attract coverage from the business media.

Third, each interviewer ran 85 interviews on average, allowing us to remove interviewer xed eects from

all empirical specications.       This helps to address concerns over inconsistent interpretation of responses.

Fourth, we collected information on the interview process itself (duration, day-of-the-week), on the manager

(seniority, job tenure and location), and on the interviewer (for removing analyst xed eects and subjective

reliability score). These survey metrics are used as noise controls to help reduce residual variation.

    We decided to focus on the manufacturing sector where productivity is easier to measure than in the

non-manufacturing sector. We also focused on medium sized rms, selecting a sampling frame of rms with

between 50 and 5,000 workers. Very small rms have little publicly available data. Very large rms are likely

to be more heterogeneous across plants. We drew a sampling frame from each country to be representative

of medium sized manufacturing rms and then randomly chose the order of which rms to contact.

    Each interview took an average of 48 minutes and the main wave was run in the summer of 2006. We

achieved a 45% response rate, which is very high for company surveys, because (i) the interview did not

discuss rm's nances (we obtained these externally); (ii) we had the written endorsement of many ocial

institutions like the Bundesbank, Treasury and World Bank, and (iii) we hired high quality MBA-type

students. We also ran some follow up surveys in 2009 and 2010 following the same rms sampled in 2006 to

form a panel which we use to look at changes in decentralization.



U.S. Census data: Management and Organizational Practices Survey (MOPS)                                   The 2010 Man-

agement and Organizational Practices Survey (MOPS) was jointly funded by the Census Bureau and the

National Science Foundation as a supplement to the Annual Survey of Manufactures (ASM). The design

was based on the World Management Survey and was mailed to the establishment plant manager (see Bryn-

jolfsson and McElheran 2016 and Bloom, Brynjolfsson, Foster, Jarmin, Saporta-Eksten and Van Reenen,

2016). The survey contained six questions on decentralization with four of these covering the same domain

as WMSplant manager autonomy over (a) capital investments, (b) hiring of full time employees, (c) prod-

uct introduction and (d)        sales and marketingwith two additional question on e) pay increases of at least

10%, and (f ) product pricing decisions. For each question, respondents were asked to choose among three

options capturing where the specic decisions were made: only at this establishment (coded as 3), only at

  12 This   was achieved by selecting medium sized manufacturing rms and by providing only rm names and contact details to
the interviewers (but no nancial details).




                                                              9
headquarters (coded as 1), or both at this establishment and at headquarters (coded as 2). There were

ve choices for the question on autonomy in capital investments, starting with Under $1,000 (coded as 1)

up until  $1 million or more (coded as 5). Each of these six questions was then z-scored, and then averaged,

and then z-scored again.           The survey also included management practice questions and some background

questions on the establishment and respondent.
                                                           13 The respondent was asked about conditions in 2010 and

2005.

    The MOPS survey was sent to all ASM establishments in the ASM mail-out sample.                       Overall, 49,782

MOPS surveys were successfully delivered, and 37,177 responses were received, yielding a response rate of

78%.    The Organization Module of MOPS is only for plants where headquarters is o site - plants with

headquarters on site are told to skip this section - which takes the sample to about 20,000 plants. We further

require the sample to match to the 2006 ASM and 2009 ASM to calculate the main dependent variable

(growth in sales) which brings the sample down to 8,774 plants.
                                                                           14 Table A2 shows how our various samples

are derived from the universe of establishments.




3.2 Accounting data
Cross-country WMS data                   We build rm level measures of sales, employment, capital, prots and

materials using accounting data extracted from Bureau Van Dijk's ORBIS. These are digitized versions of

company accounts covering very large samples (close to the population in most of our countries) of private

and publicly listed rms. In our baseline specications we estimate in three-year (annualized) growth rates.

We are able to build rm level measure of sales growth for at least one year for 1,330 out of the 2,351 rms

with decentralization data in 2006.



U.S. MOPS data             In addition to our decentralization data, we also use data from other Census and non-

Census data sets to create our measures of performance (growth in sales, productivity, and protability).

We use establishment level data on sales, value-added and labor inputs from the ASM to create measures of

growth and labor productivity. As described in more detail in Appendix A, we also combined the plant-level

capital stock data from the Census of Manufactures with investment data from the ASM and applied the

perpetual inventory method to construct annual capital stocks. Finally, we measure plant protability using

prots as a percent of capital stock, with plant-level prots dened as sales less total salaries and wages,

material costs, and rental expenses.

  13 The    full   questionnaire    is   available   on   http://www.census.gov/mcd/mops/how_the_data_are_collected/MP-
10002_16NOV10.pdf.
  14 The   ASM is a stratied randomly sampled rotating 4 year panel, so many plants are not included across panels, which
accounts for over 90% of this drop in sample size




                                                                10
3.3 Measuring the Great Recession
Our baseline measure of the intensity of impact of the Great Recession (SHOCK) at an industry by country

cell level comes from the UN COMTRADE database of world trade. This is an international database of

six-digit product level information on all bilateral imports and exports between any given pairs of countries.

We aggregate COMTRADE                 data from its original six-digit product level to three-digit US SIC-1987 level

using the Pierce and Schott (2010) concordance. We deate the industry and country specic export value

series by a country and year specic CPI from the OECD to measure real exports.
                                                                                                       15

    For the U.S. MOPS data we are able to construct a more detailed SHOCK variable which varies at

the establishment level. Specically, we use pre-recession product level revenue data from the 2006 ASM

to measure each establishment's distribution of sales across 7 digit NAICS products before the onset of the

Great Recession. We then aggregate the Longitudinal Firm Trade Transactions Database (LFTTD), which

contains the universe of import and export transactions for U.S. rms, to the product-year level. By matching

each establishment's pre-recession distribution of sales across products to product level export growth, we

are able to obtain a more precise measure of the intensity of the Great Recession which measures export

growth in the       products   which the establishment produces. All results from the U.S. MOPS data use this

establishment specic formulation of the SHOCK measure.
                                                                            16 The plant-specic shock is advantageous in

that it addresses an important potential bias arising from mismeasurement of the relevant economic shock

for diversied plants. To the extent that diversication of product mix is correlated with decentralization,

using an industry level shock introduces non-random measurement error and may bias the results.                               Our

plant-specic shock built from plant-product data addresses this concern.

    Figure A1 shows the evolution of annualized export growth in the years preceding and during Great

Recession using industry level data for all countries (for a total of 5,641 manufacturing sector by country

cells). Exports were growing by about 13% in 2007 and 9% in 2008, and experienced a dramatic fall (-20%)

in 2009 compared to 2008. Industry sales fell even faster than exports in 2008 and 2009. In the empirical

analysis, we build empirical proxies for the Great Recession by averaging 2007 and 2006 (pre-recession)

and 2009 and 2008 (in-recession) levels and calculate log dierences between the two sub-periods for each

three-digit industry by country cell.
                                             17

    Since recessions typically have a greater impact on reducing the expenditure on durable versus non-

durable goods (e.g. King and Rebelo, 1999), we use as an alternative variable to capture the intensity of

the Great Recession shock the average durability of the goods produced in the industry, drawn from Ramey

  15 We    nd similar results using other measures of the shock (such as industry sales derived from aggregating rm level data in
ORBIS), but trade data is attractive as it has a large external component driven by demand in world markets and is available
at a detailed level for every country and industry in our sample.
  16 All   of the MOPS results are robust to using the same three-digit SIC SHOCK variable which is used in the cross-country
WMS analysis.
  17 We    also run robustness checks using discrete measure of   SHOCK ,   in which we code an industry-country cell to be unity
if exports fell over this period and zero otherwise.




                                                                  11
and Nekarda (2013). As a cross-sectional measure this is simply used at the 4-digit industry level, and is a

continuous measure.
                           18



3.4 Descriptive Statistics
Panel A of Table 1 contains some descriptive statistics from the WMS. The median (average) rm has 250

(574) employees and $67m ($184m) in sales. Firm sales declined by about 6% per year over this time period

(2011-2006). Panel B has the equivalent information from MOPS. Despite being a quite dierent sample, the

values look broadly comparable - MOPS              rms   are a little larger in terms of jobs (423 vs 250 at the median).

MOPS plants shrank by 7% a year, similar to the WMS average. Exports fell in 51% of the industries in

the sample. While the median growth rate of real exports across the whole sample is about -0.4% and -0.8%

in the WMS and MOPS samples, respectively, the data shows considerable variation both within and across

countries.




4         Main results
4.1 Descriptive analysis of the main result
Our main empirical nding is illustrated in Figure 1, in which Panel A refers to the results using the cross

country WMS data, and Panel B uses the US MOPS data. Panel A shows the annualized average three-year

growth rate in sales for all rms included in the WMS decentralization sample computed using data ending

in the years 2011, 2010 and 2009 (hence, averaging across three dierent growth periods: 2011-08, 2010-07

and 2009-06).
                    19 These are all years involving the Great Recession.20 Panel B shows sales growth for all

plants in the MOPS decentralization sample (2009-06 growth rate). We exclude the 2011-08 and 2010-07

periods from the MOPS sample because the recession was over in the US in 2010.
                                                                                                    21

    The sample in Figure 1 Panel A is subdivided in four categories of rms. First, we split rms according to

whether they experienced a drop in exports in an industry by country cell in the main Great Recession years

(the 2008 and 2009 average) compared to the latest pre-recession years (2006 and 2007 average).
                                                                                                                     22 Second,

we split rms by above/below the mean level of decentralization measured before the advent of the Great

Recession. Not surprisingly, all our groupings of rms experienced a drop in average sales and furthermore,

  18 We     also consider a discrete version using a dummy equal to 1 if the durability in the industry is greater than the median
(and zero otherwise).
  19 We     use long dierences to smooth over some of the transitory measurement error.      The results are robust to choosing
alternative methods of long dierencing.
  20 We     also test the robustness of the results to dropping the 2008-2011 period, in which the Recession was starting to taper
o in Europe.
  21 In   Europe (where most of our WMS data is from) the crisis persisted due to the Eurozone currency crisis and scal austerity
policies.
  22 To   be precise we rst divide the value of nominal exports by a country and time specic CPI. We then construct average
real exports in (i) 2009 and 2008 and (ii) 2007 and 2007. We then take the log dierence between these two periods.




                                                                 12
the drop in sales is clearly (and signicantly) larger for rms classied in industries experiencing a negative

export shock (compare the two bars on the right with the two on the left). However, within the group of rms

experiencing a negative shock (those on the right of the gure), the decline in sales was signicantly larger for

rms that were more centralized prior to the recession. In the WMS sample, for rms in an industry-country

pair hit by a greater negative shock, decentralized rms had a 8.2% fall in sales compared to about 11.8% in

the centralized rms, for a dierence of 3.6 percentage points which is signicant at the 5% level (compared

to an insignicant dierence of -0.1% in industries that did not experienced a shock). Panel B of Figure 1

performs the analogous exercise on the MOPS sample of US establishments. The dierence in dierences is

very similar at 3.5 percentage points, also signicant at the 5% level.

    The performance dierential between decentralized and centralized rms appears conned to the crisis

period. Using the same four categories as in Figure 1, Figure 2 plots the dierence in sales growth between

decentralized and centralized rms (or plants), again distinguishing between those which experienced a drop

in exports in an industry by country cell during the Great Recession years, including the years before and

after the Great Recession. As before, the y-axis is the annualized three year growth rate in sales, with the

year 2010, for example, corresponding to the 2010-07 growth rate. In both the WMS sample in Panel A and

the MOPS sample in Panel B, decentralized rms (plants) and centralized rms (plants) have similar sales

growth rates in the pre-recession periods (before 2008), regardless of whether they subsequently experienced

a decline in exports during the Great Recession (to see this, note that the two lines in each panel do not

diverge until 2007). The performance dierentials between decentralized and centralized rms (plants) in

industries hit by the Great Recession start to emerge in 2008, and converge in both datasets after roughly

ve years.
              23

    The basic nding emerging from the raw data is that decentralization was associated with relatively better

performance for rms or establishments facing the toughest environment during the crisis. Moreover, the

improved performance associated with decentralization is unique to the crisis period, as these rms (plants)

did not outperform their peers before the crisis, and temporary, as these rms (plants) do not appear to be

systematically outperforming their centralized counterparts after the crisis.
                                                                                             24

    We now turn to more formal tests of this basic result using alternative measurement strategies and

controls for many other possible confounders.

  23 In   the US MOPS data, although not in the cross-country WMS, centralized plants in 2012 experience a more rapid recovery
in the industries most aected by the Great Recession.
  24 One   might ask why should centralized rms not systematically   outperform   their decentralized counterparts in good times?
One reason related to the model of Section 2 is that although turbulence/uncertainty spikes in deep recessions (albeit to dierent
degrees in dierent industries) it does not so in other times (see Bloom et al, 2016, especially Table 2). A second reason is
that, although the Great Recession is a plausibly unexpected shock to which a rm's optimal decentralization did not reect
pre-recession, industry growth trends were less unusual in the pre-crisis period so rm decentralization had already been chosen
endogenously to reect these trends.




                                                               13
4.2 Baseline regression equation
Our baseline specication is:



              ‚àÜ ln Yijct = Œ±DECi0 + Œ≤(DECi0 ‚àó SHOCKjc ) + Œ≥SHOCKjc + Œ¥xi0 + Œ∏c + œÜj + œÑt + Œµijct                                   (8)



where       ‚àÜ ln Yijct   is the sales growth rate: the three year annualized change in ln(real sales) for rm (or plant)

i   in industry    j   in country   c   in end-year   t.25 DECi0     is rm (or plant)   i's   level of decentralization (measured

in the initial year of 2006 for WMS and 2005 for MOPS);                     SHOCKjk       is our measure of the severity of the

shock of recession in the industry-country cell;             xi0    is a set of controls also measured pre-recession (rm and

plant size, survey noise and the proportion of college-educated employees);                       Œ∏c   are country dummies,   œÜj   are

industry dummies,           œÑt   are year dummies and       Œµicjt   and is an error term.       Standard errors are clustered at

the industry by country level, or just industry level depending on the variables used to proxy for the Great

Recession and the specic sample used.                  When we use export growth as a measure of the shock the key

hypothesis we examine is whether               Œ≤ < 0,     i.e. whether decentralized rms and plants do relatively better

in bad times. When we use product durability as a measure of the magnitude of the shock the equivalent

hypothesis is that        Œ≤ > 0, as the more durable goods industries are expected to have (and do have) the largest
fall in demand.

      Our underlying identication assumption in equation (8) is that in the pre-Great Recession period rms

were in an initial equilibrium where they had adopted their optimal degree of decentralization (                         DECi0       )

based on their current and expected environment.
                                                26 The                     SHOCKjk        associated with the Great Recession

was largely unexpected and, since organizational form is likely subject to large adjustment costs, rms could

not immediately respond by changing to the optimal form of organization (i.e. becoming more decentralized)

in the new environment. Thus,              DECi0      can be considered weakly exogenous in equation (8). We investigate

the adjustment costs assumption by using repeat observations on decentralization for the same rms or

plants over time.          We nd decentralization to be highly persistent over the time in both the WMS                           and

MOPS samples.
             27 We also consider potential violations of these assumptions below (sub-section 4.4), such

as the presence of other unobservables correlated with                    DECi0   that could generate rm-level performance

dierentials in bad times.
    25 As   discussed above, for the long dierences we are using the three overlapping time periods for WMS, but for MOPS we
can only use one of these long dierences, 2009-2006.
    26 Formally, we do not need to assume fully optimizing behavior in the pre-period, only that DEC is weakly exogenous.
                                                                                                     i0
    27 We estimate that the annual AR(1) coecient on decentralization as 0.965 in MOPS and 0.707 in WMS. The true persistence
parameter is likely to lie between these as MOPS estimate is likely to be an over-estimate because of recall bias and the WMS
is likely to be an underestimate because of classical measurement error. See Bloom, Sadun and Van Reenen (2016) for more
structural estimation of adjustment costs in WMS also showing high degrees of persistence of organizational form.




                                                                     14
4.3 Baseline results
Column (1) of Table 2 shows the results from estimating a simple specication including export growth

as our recession shock indicator and a full set of country, year and three-digit industry dummies.                         A one

percent increase in industry exports is associated with a signicant 0.07 percentage point increase in sales

growth. We also nd a positive and weakly signicant association between sales growth and lagged initial

decentralization (in 2006).        A one standard deviation increase in our decentralization index is associated

with a 0.58 percentage point increase in sales growth (e.g. growth increases from say 2.0% a year to 2.6%

a year).
            28 In column (2) we introduce an interaction term between decentralization and the export shock

variable.     The interaction term is negative and signicant (0.042 with a standard error of 0.013), which

indicates that decentralized rms shrank much less than their centralized counterparts when they were hit

by a negative export shock.          Note that the coecient on the linear decentralization term is insignicant

when the interaction term is added to the specication, which indicates that decentralized rms did not

grow signicantly faster or slower in those sectors that had zero export growth.

    The magnitudes of the coecients are non-trivial. Consider a macro shock causing a 1% fall in exports.

The coecients in column (2) of Table 2 suggests that the sales of an average rm (with mean decentralization

score of zero) will shrink three times as much as those of a decentralized rm (with a score one standard

deviation above the mean).
                                  29 Panel A of Figure 3 shows the implied marginal eect of decentralization on

sales growth as a function of export growth.              These plots are obtained using the coecients reported in

column (2) of Table 2. According to these estimates, decentralization has a positive association with sales

growth in all industries experiencing country-industry export growth below 8%. This corresponds to two-

thirds of the WMS         sample in the post recession period, but only 12% of rms in the pre-recession periods

(this is shown in Panel B of Figure 3). In other words, the positive association between decentralization and

rm growth appear to be contingent on the wider demand conditions in the aggregate environment facing

the rm, which in turn may be one of the possible reasons for the heterogeneous levels of decentralization

observed in 2006. It is important to emphasize that we are not claiming that decentralization is always the

optimal form of rm organizationit is very much contingent on the dierent conditions that rms face.
                                                                                                                              30

    The recession shock measure is industry and country specic. Therefore, in column (3) of Table 2 we

include a full set of industry dummies interacted with country dummies, as well as a set of other rm

controls (measured in 2006). The linear export shock is absorbed by the industry by country dummies, but

  28 Note   that the growth rates of both rm sales and industry exports used throughout all regressions are multiplied by 100
(i.e 1% is 1 not 0.01)
  29 Assuming   the eects were causal for illustrative purposes, the average rm will see a drop in sales of 0.062% (the coecient
on export growth) whereas the decentralized rm will see a fall in sales of just 0.020% (0.062 minus 0.042, the coecient on
the interaction).
  30 In other work done using the WMS decentralization    data (Bloom, Sadun and Van Reenen, 2012) we discuss other inuences
on rm decentralization such as scale, human capital, complexity and culture. We exploit one source of this variation (trust)
in an instrumental variable approach discussed below.




                                                                15
we can still identify the interaction of the shock with initial rm decentralization. Even in this demanding

specication, the interaction between decentralization and the shock remains negative and signicant.
                                                                                                                        31

    A possible concern with the estimates is that the         SHOCK        variable uses information dated over the same

period as the dependent variable, which may give raise to an endogeneity bias. Consequently, we test for

the robustness of the main results using as a proxy for the intensity of the Great Recession a measure of

the durability of the products in the four-digit industry calculated prior to the recession. We include a full

set of four-digit industry dummies to absorb the linear eects in column (4).                  Consistent with the earlier

results, the interaction between decentralization and the           SHOCK       is positive (since more durable industries

experienced greater drops in demand during the recession) and signicant.
                                                                                        32

    An alternative exogenous shifter of the shock measure to durability is to construct a Bartik style IV

where we predict the change in exports from an industry-country pair. We constructed this for every HS

six digit commodity in a country by interacting the lagged (i.e., built using 2006/2007 data) export share

of the commodity from country           r   to a partner country    p   with the partner country's growth in imports (of

that commodity) between 2006/07 and 2008/09 from all countries except country                        r.   Summing this across

all partner countries and then aggregating to the three digit industry level gives an IV for the export shock.

The results from using this Bartik IV are very similar to those shown in Table 2.
                                                                                                33

    Columns (5) and (6) of Table 2 repeat the specications of columns (3) and (4) using the MOPS sample.
                                                                                                                             34

Remarkably, although drawn from a distinct dataset, a single country (US) and dierent survey methodology,

the results in this larger sample of plants are extremely similar to the ones reported using the cross country

WMS data. The coecients on the interaction terms are of the same sign, statistically signicant and of a

broadly comparable magnitude.

    The results discussed so far suggest the presence of a positive relationship between rm and establishment

sales growth and decentralization in the industries most aected by the Great Recession.                       In Table 3 we

explore whether this relationship persists even when we examine Total Factor Productivity (TFP), i.e. we

estimate the most general econometric model of Table 2, column (3) but also control for increases in other

inputs such as employment, capital and materials on the right hand side of the equation. As discussed in

the introduction, some have argued that rms need to centralize during crises, so tough cost controls and

eciency-enhancing measures can be driven down throughout the company. This would imply that, although

  31 Other   measures of the demand shock give similar qualitative results to using exports. For example, using industry output
built from aggregating the ORBIS population data in the same way as exports (across the three digit industry by country cell
between the 2009-08 and 2007-06 periods) generates a coecient (standard error) on the interaction term of 0.060 (0.015).
  32 The    specication in column (4) can be regarded as the reduced form of an IV regression where we use durability
as an instrumental variable for the shock.      When we use decentralization*durability to instrument for SHOCK*durability
in an IV specication on the sample in column (3),         we obtain a coecient (standard error)of -0.165 (0.052) on the
decentralization* SHOCK interaction.
  33 For   example, the IV coecient(standard error) on the interaction of export growth and decentralization is -0.065(0.029)
using the Bartik IV. This is similar with the OLS estimate of -0.047(0.018) in column (3) of Table 2. The rst stage is strong
with an F-statistic of 29.5.
  34 Note   that the linear export shock in column (5) is not absorbed by the industry xed eects as the MOPS export shock
varies at the plant level.




                                                               16
decentralized rms (or plants) may fare better on protecting sales revenue during downturns, they will do

worse in terms of productivity.

    Column (1) of Table 3 reports the baseline results for sales growth on the subsample of rms with data on

factor inputs, while column (2) reports the productivity results.
                                                                               35 Decentralization is also signicantly and

positively associated with an increase in TFP during a crisis.
                                                                            36 Column (3) uses the growth of protability

(Earnings Before Interest and Tax divided by the capital stock) as the dependent variable and also nds

a negative coecient on the interaction although it is not signicant at conventional levels.                        Column (4)

investigates whether the positive association also extends to the extensive margin of adjustment, using an

exit regression. The dependent variable is a dummy taking the value of one if the rm exited to bankruptcy

between 2007 and 2011 and zero otherwise (the regression is a Linear Probability Model, and the reported

coecients are multiplied by 100 for readability).                This shows that more decentralized rms also had a

signicantly lower probability of exit in industries that were worse hit by the crisis. Columns (5) though

(7) repeat the analysis using the MOPS data, and again nds a negative and signicant coecient on the

interaction term between decentralization and the shock for sales, productivity and prots growth.
                                                                                                                        37



4.4 Identication and robustness
A concern with the results is that our decentralization interaction is simply picking up longer term trends

or proxying for some unobserved variable. To address these issues we took several steps.



Placebo test in a pre-crisis period                 First, we address the concern that the       Decentralization‚àóSHOCK
interaction may simply be picking up some other time-invariant industry characteristic associated with the

magnitude of the recession and rm decentralization. As shown in Figure 2, the raw data suggest that the

dierentials in performance between decentralized and centralized rms are conned to the Great Recession.

To further probe this result, we examine the relationship between sales growth and the                      Decentralization ‚àó
SHOCK          interaction in a sample including years         preceding    the Great Recession in Table 4.         Finding the

same results in this period would raise the concern that the              SHOCK       dummy captures unobserved industry

heterogeneity unrelated to the Great Recession such that decentralized rms always did better in certain

sectors. Thus, we regard this as a placebo test. We look again at three year dierences in growth but instead

pool across the 3-year dierences 2008-05, 2007-04, 2006-03 and 2005-02 to dene the pre-recession growth

  35 The    sample for the TFP regression is smaller due to missing data on some of the additional inputs needed for the production
functions specication (in many countries revenues are a mandatory item on company accounts, but other inputs such as capital
are not).
  36 The    sum of the unreported coecients on employment, capital and materials growth is about 0.9 suggesting decreasing
returns to scale (and/or market power). Measurement error may also be responsible for attenuating the coecients on factor
inputs towards zero.     Note that if we calculate TFP as a residual using cost shares as weights on the factor inputs and use
this as the dependent variable (dropping the factor shares from the right hand side) are results are similar to those from the
estimated production function.
  37 We    have no exit data for MOPS as the survey was run in 2011 after the Great Recession, with our main results using the
recall question on decentralization in 2005.




                                                                 17
rates (in column (1) labeled (year<=2005), and 2011-08, 2010-07 and 2009-06 (as in the earlier tables) to

dene the post-recession years (column (2)). Column (1) shows that the coecient on                        Decentralization ‚àó
SHOCK       is actually positive, although insignicant, in the years preceding the Great Recession. Column

(2) repeats the results of the specication of Table 2, column (3).                 Column (3) repeats the regression on

the pooled pre-crisis and post-crisis samples of the rst two columns, and includes a full set of interactions

with a dummy indicator taking a value of one for all crisis years (the three year dierences from 2009-06

and later) to estimate a dierences in dierences in dierences               specication. The coecient on the triple

interaction     P OST 2006 ‚àó Decentralization ‚àó SHOCK                interaction is negative and signicant, which implies

that the eect of decentralization in industries hit by the Great Recession is arising entirely from the Great

Recession years. We repeated the same analysis on productivity with very similar results in the last three

columns.



Observable factors correlated with decentralization                       We investigated whether the       Decentralization‚àó
SHOCK       interaction actually reects other rm level characteristics correlated with decentralization exploit-

ing the very rich data we have compiled.
                                                38 Specically in Tables 5 and 6 we augment the baseline specication

of column (3) in Table 2 with interactions terms between the Great Recession indicator and a series of ad-

ditional rm and plant controls. First, we include interactions with human capital of the workers as well as

the overall management quality of the rm (in the WMS measured as in Bloom and Van Reenen, 2007) or

the plant (in the MOPS). To control for the fact that centralization might reect rms in low prot margin

market segments who always do badly in downturns (e.g. because their products are relatively homogeneous)

we include interactions with pre-recession prot margins.                We also tried including measures of scale (size

of the plant and/or the rm), decentralization from the plant manager to production workers, technology

adoption (data-driven decision making), union strength and plant manager characteristics (age, immigrant

status and gender). Throughout these experiments the coecient on our key                      Decentralization ‚àó SHOCK
interaction remained signicant.
                                       39

    In the MOPS data we can implement a particularly tough test. Since we measure decentralization in

multiple plants     within   the same rm, for multi-plant rms we are able to include an interaction between

  38 Ideally, we we would have an instrumental variable for decentralization, but there is no obvious candidate that credibly meets
the exclusion restriction. For example, regional variation in generalized trust in the population around the rm's headquarters
is strongly correlated with decentralization (see Bloom, Sadun and Van Reenen 2012). We found that rms in high trust areas
outperform others in downturnsan interaction between regional trust and our export shock variable is signicantly negative in
the performance regressions of Table 2. This reduced form is consistent with a mechanism whereby trust causes greater rm
decentralization and therefore fosters resilience in bad times.   However, there may also be other mechanisms through which
higher trust helps rms outperform others during downturns, so trust cannot be reliably excluded from the second stage.
  39 Although   the additional variables were usually insignicant, there are exceptions. In Table 5, decentralization from plant
manager to workers exhibits a similar pattern to our main decentralization measure of power between the central headquarters
and plant manager. This suggests that decentralizing decision-making throughout the hierarchy is benecial during times of
crisis. The management interaction is also weakly signicant, although in this case the coecient is positive. In other words,
well managed rms perform relatively better in good times than in bad times.




                                                                18
the Great Recession indicator and average           rm   decentralization.
                                                                             40 This means that the coecient on the

Decentralization ‚àó SHOCK            interaction is identied solely o dierences in decentralization across plants

within the same rm. Remarkably, the results remain signicant even in the presence of the rm level of

decentralization and its interaction with export growth (coecient of -0.023 and standard error of 0.010).

    A further concern is that the       SHOCK       measure could be reecting other industry characteristics rather

than the demand fall.         In Appendix Table A3 we show that our key interaction is robust to including

interactions of decentralization with a number of other industry characteristics such as asset tangibility,

inventories, dependency on external nance and labor costs.



Validity of exports as a shock measure                 We have argued that trade changes are an attractive indicator

of the Great Recession shock, as they are more likely to reect what is happening to demand in world markets

than being a reection of country and industry specic supply factors. Furthermore, we have also shown

above that our results are robust to alternative indicators of the shock such as the industry-specic durability

measure, a Bartik style IV for exports or using industry output instead of exports. As a further check we

estimated our models separately for exporting establishments vs.                non-exporting establishments using the

MOPS data (export data is not an item required in the company accounts data). As expected, the results

are driven by the exporting plants who are most directly exposed to trade shocks.
                                                                                                 41



Asymmetries            We investigated whether a negative shock diered from a positive shock by allowing dierent

coecients on positive than negative shocks (dened either as positive export growth or export growth

above/below the median value). In all cases we found we could not reject symmetry. This is unsurprising

since in the Great Recession period most rms were experiencing various degrees of a negative shock.




4.5 The role of co-ordination costs
When there are large externalities between dierent plants belonging to the same rm, decentralization is

likely to be more costly (Alonso et al, 2008). For example, coordinating prices and product decisions from

the central headquarters is important if the sales of one plant's products cannibalize those of other plants.

This may be less plausible in the case of WMS since these rms are medium sized (typically containing only

two plants and 233 employees). Nonetheless, to examine whether our results may reect the importance of

dierences in coordination in bad times, in Tables 7 and 8 we included interactions with many measurable

characteristics reecting environments where coordination costs should be more important. These included

rm and/or plant size and whether a rm was multi-plant (so more need for coordination) and, if so,

  40 Bloom,   Brynjolfsson, Foster, Jarmin, Patnaik, Saporta-Eksten and Van Reenen (2016) show there is considerable variation
in organization within rms across plants at a point in time.
  41 For   example, using the baseline MOPS specication in Table 2 column (5) we estimate a coecient(standard error) of
-0.036(0.012) on the   Decentralization*SHOCK    variable for the exporters (4,200 observations) and -0.011(0.012) for the non-
exporters. These results are shown in Appendix Table A7.




                                                                19
whether these plants are located in dierent countries or dierent states. Similarly, we looked at whether

a rm was producing goods across multiple sectors (diversication dummy) or whether it was part of a

foreign multinational enterprise. We also considered the degree of outsourcing (a direct question in WMS)

and alternatively as measured by the ratio of intermediate goods inputs to total sales.

    In all cases the main interaction between decentralization and export growth remained signicant, and

in only one of the 16 cases was one of the other interactions signicant at the 5% level.
                                                                                                               42 Although co-

ordination costs matter in general for centralization, they do not seem to account for the better performance

of decentralized rms during downturns.




5     Extensions: Understanding the Mechanism
5.1 Turbulence: Product churn and stock market volatility
Our empirical ndings strongly suggest that decentralization becomes more valuable in bad times.                              The

simple model in Section 2 suggested that one reason for this was that negative shocks may be associated

with greater turbulence (a higher           u ), which increase the benets of local information (see equation (2)).           We

now turn to study whether there is any direct evidence to support this idea.



Product Churn            Our main measure of turbulence is changes in product churn in recession versus non

recession years as a proxy.        Product churn is measured using data from the US Census of Manufactures

(CM). The CM, which is conducted in years ending in 2 and 7, asks manufacturing plants to list the value of

annual shipments by 10-digit product code. Plants receive a list of all the product codes typically produced

in their industry, along with corresponding descriptions of each code. Plants which produce products not

listed on the form are instructed to write in the appropriate product code.
                                                                                           43 We then measure the amount of

product churn at the plant level as the number of products added or dropped between the previous Census

and the current Census, divided by the average number of products produced in both Censuses. That is,

product churn for establishment         i   in year   t   is dened as:



                                                  #Products Added i,t + #Products Dropped i,t
                      Product Churn i,t       =                                               ‚àà [0, 2]                         (9)
                                                     0.5 (# Products i,t + #Products i,t‚àí5 )

Our measure of industry product churn is the average plant level product churn amongst all plants within

an industry (three digit US SIC-1987) which produce at least 3 products. We restrict attention to plants

 42 This is the materials share in column (9) in the WMS regressions of Table 7.   Two other interactions with decentralizationthe
number of plants and the number of manufacturing industries in columns (4) and (8) of the MOPS regressions in Table 8are
signicant at the 10% level.   This could be taken as (weak) evidence that rms with more co-ordination issues with supply
chains, scale or industry diversication do worse during downturns when presumably lack of co-ordination becomes more costly.
 43 The   ASM also has a 10-digit product trailer, but the question is formulated in a way that results in less detailed responses
than the 5-yearly CMF question, so we use the CMF to measure churn.




                                                                   20
with at least 3 products in order to reduce measurement error from product code misreporting.
                                                                                                                   44 Finally,

in order to measure the        change   in product churn by industry during the Great Recession, we calculate the

change in product churn from 2007 to 2012 as industry-level product churn in 2012 minus industry-level

product churn in 2007 (constructed from the 2007 and 2002 Censuses).
                                                                                      45

    Before examining the relationship between sales growth, decentralization and turbulence (as measured by

product churn), we rst examined whether decentralization really was greater in industries where turbulence

was higher. Figure A2 shows that this is indeed the case: plants in the top quintile of product churn industries

had a decentralization index about 0.2 of a standard deviation higher than those in the bottom quintile.

More formally, Table A4 nds a positive and signicant relationship between decentralization (the dependent

variable) and product churn, particularly for decentralization of decisions regarding product introduction

and sales and marketing, as the theory would suggest. Furthermore, we checked whether product churn had

indeed increased more in industries that experienced a larger drop in exports during the Great Recession.

This is also the case in the data, as shown in Figure A3.

    To investigate the empirical validity of the turbulence-based theoretical mechanism, we extend our basic

equation (8) to include both the change in          CHU RN      and also its interaction with decentralization




                   ‚àÜ ln Yij    = Œ±DECi0 + Œ≤(DECi0 ‚àó SHOCKj ) + Œ≥SHOCKj                                                     (10)


                                   +Œ∑‚àÜCHU RNj + ¬µ (DECi0 ‚àó ‚àÜCHU RNj ) + Œ¥xi0 + œÜj + œÑt + Œµij


    where      ‚àÜCHU RNj       is the change in churn in industry      j   (since we estimate this regression model only in

the US MOPS sample we omit the country sub-script). According to the model                    ¬µ>0,     since churn increases

the value of decentralization. Moreover, to the extent that our export shock variable is proxying for rising

turbulence during recessions, we would also expect             Œ≤    to drop in magnitude in equation (10) compared to

equation (8).

    Table 9 shows the results of this exercise.
                                                       46 In column (1) we estimate the specication in column (4)

of Table 2 for the subset of establishments for which an industry level measure of product churn could

be built.      This has similar results to the overall sample, i.e.           the coecient on the interaction       DECi0 ‚àó
SHOCKj          is negative and statistically signicant. Column (2) includes the          DECio ‚àó ‚àÜCHU RNj        interaction

  44 Establishments    which produce the same portfolio of products in consecutive Censuses but misreport a product code in
one year will be incorrectly measured as having switched products. Product code misreporting is particularly problematic for
establishments with 1 or 2 products, for whom a single reporting mistake would result in very high measured product churn.
Our results are robust to using industries with plants with a lower cut-o of 2 or more products or a higher cut-o of 5 or more
products.
  45 Note    that the measure is based on plants who survived between Census years. We also constructed an alternative measure
that included plants which died and entered between Census years in the construction of equation (9). This broader measure
led to similar results.
  46 Since   we are measuring churn 2012-2007 (our Census of Manufactures years) we use as our dependent variable the change
in ln(sales) between 2007 and 2012 which is why the sample is slightly smaller.




                                                               21
instead of the     DECi0 ‚àó SHOCKj           interaction.   In line with the model's prediction, the coecient on the

interaction with changes in product churn is positive and signicant, i.e.                 sales growth appears to have a

positive association with decentralization in industries that experienced a greater increase in turbulence, as

proxied by product churn. Column (3) includes both interactions. The coecient on the interaction between

decentralization and product churn remains positive and signicant, while the coecient on the interaction

between decentralization and growth in industry exports drops by a quarter in magnitude compared to

column (1) and is statistically insignicant. Columns (4) to (6) repeat the same specications, this time using

durability as an alternative industry level proxy for the Great Recession. The coecient on the interaction

between decentralization and product churn is positive and signicant, and its inclusion again reduces the

magnitude of the coecient on the interaction between decentralization and durability to insignicance.



Stock Market volatility              We also use as an alternative proxy for the increase in market turbulence a

measure derived from the uncertainty literature. We measure the standard deviation in monthly rm-level

stock market returns in an industry by year cell over the population of publicly listed rms in each country.

The stock returns measure of uncertainty is the most standard rm-level measure and similar to those used

by Leahy and Whited (1996) for example. In a stochastic volatility model based on Dixit and Pindyck (1994)

the variance of stock returns will be a good predictor of the underlying level of uncertainty. These measures

are then used in changes as an alternative proxy for the increase in turbulence. In the US we pool at the

three digit SIC level as there are about 2,000 publicly listed rms. In the other OECD countries there are

fewer publicly listed rms so we construct the measure at the SIC 2 digit level. An advantage of this measure

is that it is available for the WMS as well as MOPS, but a disadvantage is that it is constructed only from

rms listed on the stock market (in the same industry).

    Table 10 shows the results.         In column (1) we reproduce the specication in column (2) of Table 2.
                                                                                                                              47

In column (2) we use the interaction between decentralization and the change in the standard deviation of

stock market returns instead of our usual interaction. As expected from the theory, the coecient is positive

and signicant suggesting that decentralized rms outperform their centralized counterparts in industries

where stock market volatility has increased by most. In column (3) we include both interactions. The stock

market volatility interaction remains positive and signicant whereas the coecient on the export growth

interaction falls by a third in magnitude and is now only signicant at the 10% level. The next three columns

reproduce the same specications using the MOPS data showing a qualitatively similar pattern.



Summary on Turbulence                  Taking Tables 9 and 10 together, it appears that decentralized rms did

relatively better in industries where turbulence increased.              At least part of the reason why decentralized

  47 The   only dierence is that we are using two-digit dummies instead of three-digit dummies to match the level of aggregation
for the stock market volatility measures.




                                                                22
rms do better in bad times appears to be because the industries worse hit by the Great Recession were also

those where turbulence also increased, consistent with our simple model.




5.2 Types of decentralization
As a related experiment to shed light on the model we looked at the dierent sub-questions which form

the overall decentralization index, as shown in Table 11.                        Since the Great Recession was associated with

a decrease in output demand, we would expect that decentralization capturing managerial discretion over

outputs (sales and new products) would be more important than delegation over inputs (like labor and

capital).     We start in column (1) by showing the baseline result of Table 2, column (3).                              In columns (2)

and (3) we repeat the estimation using as the decentralization index a z-scored average of the two questions

capturing plant manager decentralization for hiring and investment decisions in column (2), and for sales

and marketing and product introduction in column (3). In columns (4) to (6) we repeat the same exercise

for the U.S. MOPS sample.
                                      48

    In both cases, the positive eect of decentralization in a crisis is primarily driven by the output related

questions. This nding provides additional insight on the possible mechanism through which decentralization

may positively aect performance during a downturn, namely the ability to better adapt to more turbulent

demand conditions.
                         49

    One concern with these ndings is the belief that in practice plant managers do not have meaningful

autonomy in decisions regarding sales and marketing and product introduction, and that these decisions

are typically undertaken in the marketing department of rm headquarters. It is worth recalling that while

this may be the case in business-to-consumer rms which sell their goods to households directly or through

retail establishments, it is less obvious in business-to-business rms which sell their manufacturing output

to other rms. The latter scenario encompasses a signicant share of US and EU manufacturing activity.
                                                                                                                                            50

Moreover, our rms are not so largea median of 250 employees in WMS and 423 in MOPS so few of them

are likely to have standalone marketing divisions.




5.3 Do bad times reduce the costs of decentralization?
Our theory suggested that congruence could fall in recessions (the centralist view) leading to an increase

in the value of centralization. Our main result rejected this as decentralized rms performed better in bad

  48 In   the U.S. sample we have 3 questions capturing plant manager decentralization for hiring and investment decisions in
column (5) and 3 capturing plant manager decentralization for sales and marketing and product introduction in column (6).
  49 Consistent   with the previous sub-section Appendix Table A5 shows that the positive interaction between decentralization
and product churn is driven primarily by the sales and marketing and product introduction questions.
  50 According    the   Bureau   of     Economic   Analysis,   over   90   percent   of   US   manufacturing   output   goes   to   the   man-
ufacturing    sector,   which    will    be   primarily   business-to-business    transactions:     https://www.bea.gov/industry/xls/io-
annual/IOMake_Before_Redenitions_1997-2015_Sector.xlsx. This will be similar in Europe, which like the US has a higher-
end manufacturing sector focused more at business consumers (Chinese manufacturing output, in contrast, is more consumer
focused).




                                                                      23
times. There may, however, be alternative rationalizations of these results. Imagine, for example, that bad

times reduce the      costs   of decentralization because the plant manager fears that performing the non-prot

maximizing action might cause the rm to go bankrupt, and this will be                  more   costly to the manager than

CEO, as he will take a larger hit to their income (e.g. through longer unemployment). To test this idea

we examine environments where the rm-specic risk of bankruptcy rose rapidly in the Great Recession.

We constructed several indicators of increased bankruptcy risk.                 In particular, we used the measures of

exogenous increases in exposure to nancial crisis exploited by Chodorow-Reich (2014) such as exposure

to mortgage-backed securities (aected by the sub-prime crisis) and a rm's pre-existing relationship with

Lehman Brothers or similar at-risk banks. These are pre-Great Recession conditions relating to the supply

of nance rather than product demand. We also used more conventional measures such as leverage ratios.

    We found that these measures do predict negative performance in sales and other outcomes (see Ap-

pendix Table A6), as in Chodorow-Reich (2014). However, in no case did including these bankruptcy risk

variables (and their interactions with        SHOCK       or other covariates) materially alter the coecient on the

key interaction of     Decentralization ‚àó SHOCK           when included in equation (8).
                                                                                                51 This led us to conclude

that the crisis was not leading to greater decentralization by fostering greater alignment between the central

headquarters and plant manager.




5.4 Changes in decentralization over time
Recall that our identication assumption is that pre-recession decentralization is weakly exogenous and that

there are some adjustment costs which mean that after the Great Recession shock rms do not immediately

adopt the new optimal (more decentralized) organizational form. A corollary of our theory, however, is that

rms will start moving to a more decentralized form (to the extent that they believe the shock is likely to be

long-lasting). Hence, we should expect to see some increase in decentralization for rms and establishments

more exposed to the shock. Table A8 examines this by using the change in decentralization as a dependent

variable. This is a demanding specication, especially for WMS where the panel element of decentralization

is limited (we have data in 2009 and 2010 for a sub-sample of the 2006 wave). Nevertheless, in both WMS

and MOPS we do see a signicant and positive relationship between the size of the negative shock and

decentralization.
  51 The   coecients on the Lehman Brothers variable cannot be reported due to Census disclosure rules. Note, because of the
need to match our data with the Chodorow-Reich (2014) data our sample size falls to 2,000 observations, so many of our results
are not statistically signicant, but point estimates are similar and unaected by the controls for nancial conditions.




                                                               24
6    Conclusion
When does decentralizing power from the central headquarters to plant managers increase rm growth? We

formalized a simple model where the CEO considers decentralizing product-related decisions to the plant

manager. The increased turbulence that comes with bad times has theoretically ambiguous eects on rm

performance. On the one hand, it may reduce the congruence between the CEO and the plant manager, thus

increasing the benet of centralization. On the other hand, it makes the plant manager's local information

more valuable, and so implies that decentralized rms will perform relatively better in unexpected downturns.

    To empirically investigate these issues we collected new data on a panel of rms in 10 OECD countries

(WMS), and plants in the US (MOPS) and exploited the negative shock of the Great Recession which

reduced demand across industries and countries in heterogeneous ways.       Using our pre-recession data on

decentralization we nd that negative shocks hurt growth in centralized rms and establishments signicantly

more than in their decentralized counterparts. This is true whether we use export shocks which vary at the

industry by country (WMS) or establishment (MOPS) level, or exogenous predictors of these negative shocks

like product durability. Further, as the localist model suggests, this eect is driven by the industries which

experienced a greater increase in the turbulence (as measured by product churn and stock market volatility)

that accompanied the crisis.

    As discussed above, the eects are not trivial in size at the micro level, but we can also perform some

very rough calculations at the macro level (see Appendix B and Table A9 for details).       We estimate how

much of the post crisis dierences in GDP growth performance across countries are related to the dierent

levels of pre-crisis decentralization. Under this view, the fact that the US had relatively more decentralized

(and therefore exible) rms meant that it could weather the global economic storm better than many more

centralized countries. Assuming the nancial crisis was a common cross country negative shock, we can trace

out the implied post shock growth performance depending on each nation's average decentralization. We

calculate that greater decentralization in the US could account for about 15% of the US 's superior GDP

growth post 2012-2007 compared to the other OECD countries in our sample.

    We see our paper as a rst attempt to unravel the relationship between growth and the internal orga-

nization of rms using micro data with observable measures of decentralization. There are many directions

to take the research.   First, we need to look at the ways in which, in the longer-run, rms change their

organizational forms. For example, as the eects of the Great Recession recede, how will the growth eects

and degree of decentralization change? Second, we would like to go deeper into the relation between the debt

structure of companies (and so their bankruptcy risk) and the incentives for rms to change. Finally, it would

be valuable to examine the macro-economic implications of our modeling framework in more detail. Do the

eects we identify matter in terms of thinking about business cycles and how economies and companies can

be resilient to these adverse events?

rm-level change in ln(sales) over 2011-08, 2010-07 and 2009-06. 95% condence interval bands reported. Export Shock is

whether rms were in a country-industry cell that experienced a drop in the average level of exports in 2008 and 2009 (the

main Great Recession years) compared to the average level in 2006 and 2007 (the latest pre-Recession years). Right hand side

bars are industry-country cells were the shock was worst. Firms are split into whether they are decentralized (above the overall

mean of decentralization in 2006) or centralized. Sample size in each bar in Panel A (from left to right) is (1) 695 observation

over 296 rms; (2) 863 obs, 352 rms; (3) 736 obs, 316 rms; (4) 857 obs, 367 rms. Panel B is the same as Panel A except we

just use one 2009-06 long dierence for plant sales growth and decentralization dated in 2005. The sample in Panel B includes

8,774 US plants in 3,147 rms.

A        Data Appendix
A.1 Industry-level variables
Exports

We measure changes in exports in an industry by country cell using the UN COMTRADE database of world trade. This is

an international database of six-digit product level information on all bilateral imports and exports between any given pairs

of countries. We rst aggregate the COMTRADE value of export data (in US dollars)from its original six-digit product level

to three-digit US SIC-1987 level using the Pierce and Schott (2010) concordance. We deate the industry and country specic

export value series by a country and year specic CPI from the World Bank (2010 base year) to measure real exports. The

Export growth variable is dened as the logarithmic change in exports in 2008-09 (the average in a cell across these two Great

Recession years) relative to 2006-07 (the average across the two years immediately prior to the Great Recession).                              The real

export growth variable is winsorized at the 5th and the 95th percentile.




Durability

Data on the average durability of the goods produced in the industry are drawn from Ramey and Nekarda (2013). This is a

continuous cross-sectional measure at the 4-digit industry level.




Bartik Instrument

The Bartik IV for export growth in a country-industry cell is constructed as the change in world import demand (WID) for

commodity    m   in country   r   between time and   t   (2008 and 2009) and       t‚àí1   (2006 and 2007), is dened as:


                                                               X
                                                4zmr,t =            smpr,t‚àí1 ‚àó 4W IDmpr0 ,t
                                                                p

where   smpr,t‚àí1   denotes the share of exports of commodity         m    from country    r   to partner country    p   at time   t ‚àí 1; W IDmpr0 ,t   is

the log change in total imports of commodity         c   in partner country    p   between    t   and   t‚àí1   from all countries   excluding   country

r   (hence the r' sub-script). Consider, for example, the Bartik IV for changes in US exports of anti-ulcer drugs. For a given

partner, like the UK, we calculate the share of all American anti-ulcer drugs exported that were exported to the UK in                           t‚àí1    ,

sdrugs,U K,U S,07‚àí06 , and then multiply this by the change in the imports of anti-ulcer drugs into the UK from every country
(except the US), 4W IDdrugs,U K,U S 0 ,09‚àí08 . This is a prediction of what the demand for US exports to the UK will be

coming from exogenous world demand (rather than US specic factors). We repeat this for every country in the world (not just

the UK) and then sum over all the US partner countries in the world.

      Commodity    m   is measured at the 6-digit level of the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (HS).

Commodity level measures are then mapped into Industry               j   three-digit Standard Industry Classication (SIC) codes using the

Pierce and Schott (2010) concordance.

A.2 World Management Survey (WMS) International Data
Firm-level Accounting Databases

Our sampling frame was based on the Bureau van Dijk (BVD) ORBIS which is composed of the BVD Amadeus dataset for

Europe (France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Poland, Portugal, and the United Kingdom); BVD Icarus for the United States, BVD

Oriana for Japan.   These databases all provide sucient information on companies to conduct a stratied telephone survey

(company name, address, and a size indicator). These databases also typically have accounting information on employment,

sales and assets. Apart from size, we did not insist on having accounting information to form the sampling population, however.

Amadeus are constructed from a range of sources, primarily the National registries of companies (such as Companies House in

the United Kingdom). Icarus is constructed from the Dun & Bradstreet database, which is a private database of over 5 million

U.S. trading locations built up from credit records, business telephone directories, and direct research. Oriana is constructed

from the Teikoku Database in Japan.The full WMS consists of 34 countries but because we need decentralization data in 2006

we are restricted to the 12 countries surveyed in the 2006 wave. Because we wanted to focus on mature economies we dropped

China and India which left us with 10 OECD countries (France, Great Britain, Germany, Greece, Italy, Japan, Poland, Portugal,

Sweden and the US).




The Organizational Survey

In every country the sampling frame for the organization survey was all rms with a manufacturing primary industry code

with between 50 and 5,000 employees on average over the most recent three years of data.           Interviewers were each given a

randomly selected list of rms from the sampling frame. More details are available in Bloom, Sadun and Van Reenen (2012)

where we compare the sampling frame with Census demographic data from each country and show that the sample is broadly

representative of medium sized manufacturing rms.        We also analyzed sample selection - the response rate was 45% and

respondents appear random with respect to company performance, although larger rms where slightly more likely to respond.

We collected a detailed set of information on the interview process itself (number and type of prior contacts before obtaining

the interviews, duration, local time-of-day, date and day-of-the-week), on the manager (gender, seniority, nationality, company

and job tenure, internal and external employment experience, and location), and on the interviewer (we can include individual

analyst xed eects, time-of-day, and subjective reliability score). We used a subset of these noise controls (see text) to help

reduce residual variation.

    In analyzing organizational surveys across countries we also have to be extremely careful to ensure comparability of responses.

One step was the team all operated from two large survey rooms in the London School of Economics. Every interviewer also

had the same initial three days of interview training, which provided three calibration     exercises, where the group would all

score a role-played interview and then discuss scoring together of each question. This continued throughout the survey, with

one calibration exercise every Friday afternoon as part of the weekly group training sessions. Finally, the analysts interviewed

rms in multiple countries since they all spoke their native language plus English, so interviewers were able to interview rms

from their own country plus the UK and US, enabling us to remove interviewer xed eects.

    The construction of the degree of decentralization measures (from Central Headquarters to Plant Manager) is discussed in

some detail in the text. The questions are addressed to the plant manager. We only keep observations where at least two of

the four decentralization questions were answered (and we include a control for the number of non-missing questions in the set

of noise controls). We drop observations where the plant manager is also the CEO (5% of rms). In cases were the Central

Headquarters is on the same site as the plant we interviewed we add a dummy variable to indicate this (one of the noise controls)

to reect potentially greater monitoring. We use the data from the 2006 wave in all cases except when we analyze changes in

decentralization as an outcome where we exploit the fact that we ran another wave in 2009 and 2010 for a sub-sample of rms.




                                                                43
    As a check of potential survey bias and measurement error we performed repeat interviews on 72 rms in 2006, contacting

dierent managers in dierent plants at the same rm, using dierent interviewers.      To the extent that our organizational

measure is truly picking up company-wide practices these two scores should be correlated, while to the extent the measure is

driven by noise the measures should be independent. The correlation of the rst interview against the second interviews was

0.513 (p-value of 0.000), with no obvious (or statistically signicant) relationship between the degree of measurement error and

the decentralization score. That is to say, rms that reported very low or high decentralization scores in one plant appeared to

be genuinely very centralized or decentralized in their other plants, rather than extreme draws of sampling measurement error.




Firm-level variables

Our rm accounting data on sales, employment, capital (xed assets), prots and intermediate inputs came from BVD ORBIS.

Whether the variable is reported depends on the accounting standards in dierent countries.       Sales are deated by a three

digit industry producer price index.   BVD has extensive information on ownership structure, so we can use this to identify

whether the rm was part of a multinational enterprise. We also asked specic questions on the multinational status of the

rm (whether it owned plants aboard and the country where the parent company is headquartered) to be able to distinguish

domestic multinationals from foreign multinationals.

    We collected many other variables through our survey including information on plant size, skills, organization, etc.     as

described in the main text.   We also collected management practices data in the survey.      These were scored following the

methodology of Bloom and Van Reenen (2007), with practices grouped into four areas: operations (three practices), monitor-

ing (ve practices), targets (ve practices), and incentives (ve practices). The shop-oor operations section focuses on the

introduction of lean manufacturing techniques, the documentation of processes improvements, and the rationale behind intro-

ductions of improvements. The monitoring section focuses on the tracking of performance of individuals, reviewing performance,

and consequence management. The targets section examines the type of targets, the realism of the targets, the transparency

of targets, and the range and interconnection of targets. Finally, the incentives section includes promotion criteria, pay and

bonuses, and xing or ring bad performers, where best practice is deemed the approach that gives strong rewards for those

with both ability and eort. Our management measure uses the unweighted average of the z-scores of all 18 dimensions.

    Our basic industry code is the U.S. SIC (1997) three digit levelwhich is our common industry denition in all countries.

We allocate each rm to its main three digit sector (based on sales).




A.3 U.S. Census Bureau Data: MOPS
Sample

Table A2 shows how our sample is derived from the universe of U.S. business establishments. The U.S. Census Bureau data on

decentralization comes from the 2010 Management and Organizational Practices Survey (MOPS), which was a supplement to

the 2010 Annual Survey of Manufactures (ASM). The MOPS survey was sent to all ASM establishments in the ASM mail-out

sample. Overall, 49,782 MOPS surveys were successfully delivered, and 37,177 responses were received, yielding a response rate

of 78%.

    The MOPS contains 36 multiple choice questions, split into 3 modules: management practices (16 questions), organization

(13 questions), and background characteristics (7 questions). Decentralization measures come from the Organization module

of the MOPS. Only establishments with headquarters located o-site are instructed to answer questions in the organization

module.   This reduces the sample to about 20,000 establishments.       We also require matches to the 2006 and 2009 ASM in

order to calculate the growth rates used in the analysis. This reduces the sample size substantially for two reasons. First, all

of the establishments in our sample must have been operating in both 2006 and 2009.        The second reason is related to the




                                                              44
ASM sample design. The ASM is a rotating 5-year panel which samples large establishments with certainty but also includes

a random sample of smaller establishments. The ASM sample is refreshed every ve years, most recently in 2009, thus we lose

establishments which were in the 2009 and 2010 ASM samples and responded to the MOPS, but were not in the 2006 ASM

sample. Finally, we require that respondents answer all 6 of the questions about decentralization (described below) and have

positive value added and imputed capital in 2010. The nal sample contains 8,774 establishments and 3,147 rms.




Decentralization

Our measure of decentralization is constructed from 6 questions on the MOPS (questions 18 through 23), which measure the

allocation of real decision making rights between manufacturing plant managers and their central headquarters. Respondents

are asked whether decisions about hiring, pay increases, product introductions, pricing, and advertising are conducted at the

establishment, headquarters or both, and about the largest capital expenditure plant managers can make without authorization

from headquarters. The survey asks about organizational practices in 2005 and 2010. We use information on decentralization in

2005 in the main analysis because rms may endogenously respond to the crisis in 2010 by changing organizational structures.

    Each of the 6 decentralization questions is normalized on a scale from zero to one, with one being most decentralized and

zero being least decentralized. For example, question 18 reads In 2005 and 2010, where were decisions on hiring permanent

full-time employees made? There are three possible responses: Only at this establishment which is assigned the value one;

Both at this establishment and at headquarters which is assigned a value of one-half; Only at headquarters which is assigned

a value of zero. We then standardize each question to have a mean equal to zero and standard deviation equal to one, take

the mean over all six standardized questions, and then standardize this mean so that it has a mean equal to zero and standard

deviation equal to one.




Exports

Our proxy for the Great Recession is a plant-specic export shock constructed by matching the product les of the 2006 ASM

which disaggregate establishment revenues by product class to the Longitudinal Firm Trade Transactions (LFTTD) data which

contain the universe of export shipments at the rm-product level.      To construct our measure, we rst match the product

categories from LFTTD (ten-digit Harmonized System categories, or HS10) to the 7-digit NAICS product classes contained in

the ASM using the Pierce and Schott (2009) concordance. Next, we aggregate exports to the 7-digit NAICS level and calculate

the change in exports in each product over the Recession, dened as the logarithmic change in exports in 2008-09 (the average

in a cell across these two Great Recession years) relative to 2006-07 (the average across the two years immediately prior to the

Great Recession). Finally, we construct our plant-specic export shock as the weighted average of product export growth in the

crisis, where fore each plant, the weights assigned to each product category is that plant's share of sales revenue in the product

as measured before the crisis in the 2006 ASM.




Product Churn

Product churn is constructed using data come from the US Census Bureau's Census of Manufactures (CM). The CM asks

establishments to list the dollar value of annual shipments by 10-digit product code. Establishments receive a list of all the

product codes typically produced by establishments in their industry, along with corresponding descriptions of each code.

    We start by calculating the total number of 10-digit products by each establishment in a given year, as well as the number

of added products and the number of dropped products for each establishment compared to the previous CM 5 years earlier.

This of course restricts the sample to manufacturing establishments which were alive ve years earlier. We further restrict the

sample by dropping establishments producing fewer than 3 products in both Censuses. Product churn at the establishment




                                                               45
level is measured as the number of products added or dropped between the previous Census and the current Census, divided by

the average number of products produced in both Censuses. That is, product churn for establishment         i   in year   t   is dened as:



                                                         Products Added i,t   + Products Dropped i,t
                             Product Churn i,t       =
                                                          0.5 (#   Products i,t+ # Products i,t‚àí5 )
    Industry product churn in year   t   is the average establishment-level product churn amongst establishments within an industry

(three digit US SIC-1987).   To calculate industry-level change in product churn, we simply subtract product churn in 2007

(constructed from the product data in the 2002 and 2007 Censuses) from product churn in 2012.




ASM variables

Directly from the ASM we obtain material inputs, shipments (deated by a three digit price deator) as our sales measure and

the headcount of employees for labor. Real capital stocks are constructed using the perpetual inventory method, following the

methodology in Bloom, Floetotto, Jaimovich, Saporta-Eksten and Terry (2016). In particular, we combine detailed data on the

book value of assets every 5 years from the CM with annual investment data from the ASM. We rst convert CM capital stocks

from book to market value using BEA xed asset tables. We then deate capital stocks and investment using industry-year

price indices from the NBER-CES Manufacturing Industry Database. Finally, we apply the perpetual inventory method, using

the formula   Kt = (1 ‚àí Œ¥t )Kt‚àí1 + It     .   This procedure is done separately for structures and for equipment.        However, since

the ASM contains investment broken down into investment in equipment and investment in structures, but the CM does not

break down capital stocks into these two components, we must apportion plant capital stocks into each component. We do this

by assigning the share of capital stock to equipment and structures which matches the share of investment in equipment and

structures.




                                                                   46
B      Magnitudes
In Table A9 we consider some simple calculations of cross-country magnitudes.      Our thought experiment is to consider the

Great Recession as a global shock as reected by a fall in trade. We use the US value of the shock from COMTRADE of a

fall in exports of 7.7 percent. This is the empirical dierence between 2009-08 vs. 2007-06 that we use as our industry-country

specic shock measure elsewhere in the paper.

    We take the 2006 average levels of cross-country decentralization by country (column (1) of Table A9) and the empirical

estimates in column (2) of Table 2 to estimate the average annual implied eect of GDP of the shock (column (2) of Table A9).

We express this relative to the US in column (3). For all countries except Sweden there is a negative relative implied eect

because decentralization in the US is greater than every other country except Sweden. Column (4) displays the actual annual

change in GDP growth since the start of the global nancial crisis (from World Bank data) for each of our countries and then

again expresses these relative to the US base in column (5). Every country except Poland (which is still in a strong catch-up

phase of development) experienced a slower growth performance than the US over this period, averaging just over a third of a

percentage point (base of column). Column (6) divides the column (3) into column (5) which is the fraction of relative economic

performance accounted for by decentralization (note that since we are assuming a common shock, none of this dierence is due

to the magnitude of the crisis being worse in some countries than others).

    Overall, column (6) of Table A9 suggests that an average of 15% of the post-crisis growth experience between countries

is accounted for by decentralization. This is non-trivial as mentioned in the text, but it is worth noting that there is a large

degree of heterogeneity between countries underneath this average. Almost all of the dierential growth experience of France

and Japan compared to the US can be accounted for by decentralization (96% and 95% respectively), whereas decentralization

accounts for virtually none of the UK's performance. In particular, as noted above, because Sweden is more decentralized than

the US we should expect it to have outperformed the US, whereas it grew about half a percentage point more slowly. If we

drop Sweden, the importance of decentralization doubles to accounting for almost a third of the dierence (32%). Note that

the contribution is also negative for Poland, because although Poland is more centralized than the US, it grew more quickly

over this time period.

     Question D1: ‚ÄúTo hire a FULL-TIME PERMANENT SHOPFLOOR worker what agreement would your plant need from CHQ (Central Head Quarters)?‚Äù


     Probe until you can accurately score the question‚Äîfor example if they say ‚ÄúIt is my decision, but I need sign-off from corporate HQ.‚Äù ask ‚ÄúHow often would sign-off be given?‚Äù

                                                                                  Score 1                                               Score 3                                           Score 5

     Question D2: ‚ÄúWhat is the largest CAPITAL INVESTMENT your plant could make without prior authorization from CHQ?‚Äù
     Notes: (a) Ignore form-filling
            (b) Please cross check any zero response by asking ‚ÄúWhat about buying a new computer‚Äîwould that be possible?‚Äù and then probe‚Ä¶.

            (c) Challenge any very large numbers (e.g. >$¬ºm in US) by asking ‚ÄúTo confirm your plant could spend $X on a new piece of equipment without prior clearance from CHQ?‚Äù

            (d) Use the national currency and do not omit zeros (i.e. for a U.S. firm twenty thousand dollars would be 20000).

     Question D3: ‚ÄúWhere are decisions taken on new product introductions‚Äîat the plant, at the CHQ or both‚Äù?

     Probe until you can accurately score the question‚Äîfor example if they say ‚ÄúIt is complex, we both play a role,‚Äù ask ‚ÄúCould you talk me through the process for a recent product innovation?‚Äù

                                                                                  Score 1                                               Score 3                                           Score 5

     Question D4: ‚ÄúHow much of sales and marketing is carried out at the plant level (rather than at the CHQ)‚Äù?

     Probe until you can accurately score the question. Also take an average score for sales and marketing if they are taken at different levels.
