   THE IMPACT OF THE MARIEL BOATLIFr ON THE MIAMI LABOR MARKET


                            ABSTRACT


This paper presents an empirical analysis of the effect of the
Mariel Boatlift on the Miami labor market, focusing on the wages
and unemployment rates of less-skilled workers. The Mariel
immigrants increased the population and labor force of the Miami
metropolitan area by 7 percent. Most of the immigrants were
relatively unskilled: as a result, the proportional increase in
labor supply to less-skilled occupations and industries was much
greater. Nevertheless, an analysis of wages of non-Cuban workers
over the 1979-85 period reveals virtually no effect of the Mariel
influx. Likewise, there is no indication that the Boatlift lead to
an increase in the unemployment rates of less-skilled blacks or
other non-Cuban workers. Even among the Cuban population wages and
unemployment rates of earlier immigrants were not substantially
effected by the arrival of the Mariels.

      One of the chief concerns of immigration policy makers is the extent

to which immigrants depress the labor market opportunities of less-skilled

natives. Despite the strong presumption that an influx of immigrants will

reduce native wages, existing empirical studies suggest that the effect is

small.1 There are two leading explanations for this finding. First,

immigrants have on average only slightly lower skill characteristics than

the native population.2   Thus, econometric studies based on the

distribution of the existing stock of immigrants probably Understate the

effect of unskilled immigration on less-skilled natives. Second, the

locational choices of immigrants and natives presumably depend on expected

labor market opportunities. Immigrants tend to move to cities where the

growth in demand for labor can accommodate their supply. Even if new

immigrants cluster in only a few cities (as they do in the US), inter-city

migration of natives will tend to offset the adverse effects of

immigration.

    These considerations illustrate the difficulty of using the correlation

across cities between wages and immigrant densities to measure the effect

of immigration on the labor market opportunities of natives. They also


     1See the survey by Greenwood and McDowell (1986), and studies by
Grossman (1982), Borjas (1987), Lalonde and Topel (1988) and Altonji and
Card (1989).

     2For example, tabulations from the 1980 Census indicate that in 1980
16.3 percent of natives over age 25 had 4 or more years of college and 67.7
percent were high-school graduates. By comparison, 15.8 percent of
immigrants had 4 or more years of college and 53 percent were high school
graduates. See U.S. Department of Commerce Bureau of the Census 1980

underscore the value of a natural experiment that corresponds more closely

to an exogenous increase in the supply of immigrants to a particular labor

market.

     The experiences of the Miami labor market in the aftermath of the

Mariel Boatlift form one such experiment. From May to September 1980, some

125,000 Cuban immigrants arrived in Miami on a flotilla of privately-

chartered boats. Their arrival was the consequence of an unlikely sequence

of events, culminating in Castro's declaration on April 20 1980 that Cubans
                                                                            4
wishing to emigrate to the US were free to leave from the port of Mariel.

The available data suggest that 50 percent of the Mariel immigrants settled

permanently in Miami. The result of this influx was a 7 percent increase

in the overall population and labor force of Miami, and a 20 percent

increase in the Cuban population and labor force.

    This paper summarizes the effects of the Mariel Boatlift on the Miami

labor market, focusing on the effects on wages and unemployment rates of

less-skilled workers. The analysis is based on individual micro-data for

1979-85 from the merged outgoing rotation group samples of the Current

Population Survey (CPS). Three features of the Mariel incident and the

Census data greatly facilitate the analysis. First, the CPS sample of the

Miami metropolitan area is relatively large: roughly 1200 individuals per

month. Second, a comprehensive picture of the Miami labor market in the

months just before the Mariel Boatlift is available from the 1980 Census.

(The Census was conducted on April 1)       Finally, unlike most other ethnic

groups, Cubans are separately identified in the CPS questionnaire. Thus it

political developments that lead to the Mariel Boatlift.

is possible to estimate wage rates, unemployment rates, and other economic

indicators for both Cubans and non-Cubans in the Miami labor market, and to

measure the effects of the Mariel immigration on the two groups separately.

        Observers in Miami at the time of the Boatlift noted the strain caused

by the Mariel immigration. The homicide rate increased nearly 50 percent

between 1979 and l98O. On the weekend of May 17, 1980 a three day riot

occurred in several black neighborhoods, killing 13. A government-

sponsored committee of inquiry identified other longstanding grievances in

the black community as the cause of the riot, but cited the labor market

competition posed by the Cuban refugees as an important background factor

(Governor of Florida's Dade County Citizen's Committee, 1980, pp. 14-15).

        A more quantitative assessment is provided by the data in Figure 1,

which presents monthly unemployment rates in Miami in the months before and

after the start of the Boatlift.6 The unemployment rate in Miami rose from

5.0 percent in April 1980 to 7.1 percent in July 1980. As the figure makes

clear, however, state and national unemployment rates followed a similar

pattern, suggesting that the changes in Miami were not solely a response to

the Mariel influx. Nevertheless, widespread joblessness of the refugees

throughout the sunmier of 1980 contributed to a perception that labor market

opportunities for less-skilled natives were threatened by the Mariel

immigrants.

Labor Statistics Employment and Earnings Table El (Table Dl after December

Department of Labor Wage and Hours Division official noting the downward

   Despite this perception, the analysis in this paper gives no indication

of any short- or longer-term effect of the Mariel immigration on the wages

or unemployment rates of non-Cubans in Miami. Rather, the analysis

confirms the conclusion of earlier studies that the effect of immigration

is largely confined to members of the immigrant group itself. In the case

of the Mariel incident, most of this effect can probably be explained by

the characteristics of the new immigrants, who substantially lowered the

average skill level of the Cuban labor force in Miami.



I. Overview of the Miami Labor Market Before the Boatlift

    For at least a decade prior to the Mariel Boatlift Miami was the most

immigrant-intensive city in the US. Tabulations from the 1980 Census

indicate that 35.5 percent of residents in the Miami Standard Metropolitan

Statistical Area (SMSA) were foreign born.8 This compares with 22.3

percent in Los Angeles, the major city with the next highest immigrant

fraction, and 6.1 percent nationwide. At the time of the Census 56 percent

of immigrants in Miami were of Cuban origin. The remaining foreign-born

residents, who accounted for 16 percent of the Miami population, included

other hispanic groups and a broad selection of Caribbean and European

nationals.

    Miami also has a significant black population. The fraction of black

residents was 15.0 percent in 1970 and had increased to 17.3 percent at the


pressure on wages and working conditions in the unskilled segment of the
Miami labor market.

     8The Miami SMSA consists of Dade county, and includes Miami City as
well as a number of smaller towns and cities. Throughout this paper, I use
"Miami" to refer to this broader geographic region.

time of the 1980 Census. This dual concentration of immigrants and blacks

makes Miami somewhat unusual among larger US cities, but ideal for studying

the effect of increased immigration on the labor market opportunities of

black natives.9

    Table 1 presents a comparative description of the four major groups in

the Miami labor force in 1979: white non-hispanics; black non-hispanics;

Cubans (foreign-born and native born); and other hispanics. For simplicity

I have restricted attention to individuals age 16-61. This group

represents roughly 60 percent of the Miami population. A total of 1564

observations are available for 16-61 year olds in the 1979 outgoing

rotation group file of the CPS: similar samples are available in subsequent

years.

    The fractions of Cubans and blacks in the 16-61 age group are 27.2 and

26.3 percent, respectively, while white non-hispanics compose 34.4 percent

and non-Cuban hispanics 11.1 percent. Overall, 73 percent of this age

group participated in the labor force, with somewhat higher participation

rates among whites and Cubans, and lower rates among blacks and other

hispanics. Education levels in Miami are somewhat below the national

average: the mean of completed education for 16-61 year olds in 1979 was

11.8 years in Miami, compared with 12.2 years nationwide.

    The occupation distributions in rows 7-17 of Table 1 give some

indication of the degree of labor market competition between the four

groups. Cubans and other hispanics have very similar occupation

distributions, with both groups having a higher representation in craft and


     9Across 121 of the largest cities in the US in 1980 the correlation
between the fraction of immigrants and the fraction of native blacks is
-.16.
                                       6

operative occupations than either whites or blacks. Blacks are more highly

concentrated in laborer and service-related occupations, and are

significantly under-represented in managerial occupations.

    One useful suxnmary measure of the overlap in the occupational

distributions of the different groups is the average percent increase in

labor supply in occupations held by one group that would result front a one

percentage point increase in the overall fraction of workers in a second

group.10 This index has the simple form E. iâ€¢ S21 / S.,, where s1. is the

fraction of workers of group 1 in occupation j ,         is the fraction of
                                                   s2.
workers of group 2 in occupation j , and s. is the fraction of all workers

in occupation j.   Based on the distributions in Table 1, an inflow of

immigrants resulting in a one-point increase in the fraction of Cubans in

Miami would lead to a weighted average increase of .95 percent in the

supply of labor to occupations held by whites. Under the same conditions

the increase would be .99 percent for occupations held by blacks, 1.02

percent for non-Cuban hispanics, and 1.06 percent for Cubans themselves.

These calculations suggest that the overlap between the occupational

distributions of the four groups is relatively high.



II, The Mariel Immigration

    Due to the unauthorized nature of the Boatlift no exact count of the

number of Mariel immigrants is available, and there is little precise

information on the characteristics and/or final destinations of the

immigrants. This section summarizes some of the available information,

including data from the March 1985 Mobility Supplement to the Current


     10This index is derived in Altonji and Card (1989), pp. 15-16.
                                       7

Population Survey, which allows Mariel immigrants to be distinguished from

other Cubans.

   Most sources estimate the number of Mariel immigrants who arrived in

1980 at between 120,000 and 125,000. A recent Census Bureau Current

Population Report states that 126,000 refugees entered the US as "Cuban

Entrants" (the special immigration status awarded to the Mariel refugees)

between April 1980 and June 1981.11 104,000 of these arrived between April

and June 1980.   It is widely assumed that about one-half of these settled

permanently in Miami: for example, this assumption is used by the Census

Bureau in their "Experimental County Population Estimates" file.

Tabulations reported below from the March 1985 CPS confirm this belief.'2

    Table 2 contains estimates of the Miami population for the years 1939

to 1985 from published Census sources and from my own tabulations of the

CPS. Census Bureau estimates of the Dade County population show an

increase of 80,500 from April 1 to July 1 of 1980, and a relatively slow

rate of increase thereafter. Annual counts from the CPS show an increase

of some 200,000 in the population of 16-61 year olds between 1979 and 1981,

and then a slowly decreasing count from 1981 to 1985. About one-half of

this increase was due to an increase in the number of Cubans: their share

of the 16-61 age group increased from 27 percent in 1979 to 33 percent in

1981. A similar increase is registered in CPS-based estimates of the Cuban

share of the 16-61 year old labor force, which moved from 37.2 percent in


     ll Department of Commerce Bureau of the Census Current Population
Reports Series P-25, Number 1022, page 9.

          should be noted that population estimates from the CPS rely on
the accuracy of Census Bureau weighting procedures, which are themselves
based on estimates of local populations.
                                      8

1979 to 44.8 percent in 1981. Assuming that the Cuban shares of the

population and labor force would have remained constant between 1979 and

1981 in the absence of the Boatlift, these figures suggest that the Mariel

immigration added 56,000 individuals to the Miami working age population

and approximately 45,000 to the Miami labor force: increases of 7 percent.

    From the first days of the Boatlift the characteristics of the Mariel

immigrants have been a subject of controversy. Among those who were

permitted to leave Cuba were several hundred inmates of mental hospitals

and jails. Many of these individuals were arrested by immigration

officials upon their arrival into the US, and over 1000 were sent to a

special prison facility in Atlanta to await deportation back to   Cuba)3 A
similar number were arrested for crimes committed in the US and still await

a determination of their ultimate immigration status.14 Contemporary

reports indicate that the Mariel immigrants included a relatively high

fraction of less-skilled workers, and a high fraction of individuals with

low English ability (see the article in Business Week)

     Although the questions in the regular Current Population Survey

provide insufficient information to identify Mariel immigrants from other

foreign and native-born Cubans, the March 1985 Mobility Supplement asks

each respondent where he/she lived in March 1980 (one month before the

start of the Boatlift). Table 3 presents a descriptive summary of the


     L3See Masud-Piloto (1988, pp. 100-103). Under a 1984 agreement a
total of 2700 Mariel immigrants were to be returned to Cuba.

     14Mariel immigrants were blamed for and indeed seem to have committed
a relatively high number of crimes in the first few months after the
boatlift. Wilbanks (1984) reports that 38 of the 574 homicides in Miami in
1980 were committed by Mariel immigrants. Disaffected Mariels were
involved in 6 airline highjacking attempts in August 1980. See Masud-
Piloto (1988, pp. 95-96).
                                      9

Cuban population interviewed in the March 1985 CPS, classified by whether

the respondent claimed to be living abroad or in the US five years earlier.

The sample sizes, particularly of post-1980 entrants, are small)5

Nevertheless, these data confirm the general impression that on average

Mariel immigrants have less education, are somewhat younger, and are more

likely to be male than other Cuban immigrants.

    The figures in Table 3 also suggest that the Mariel immigrants have

lower labor force attachment and lower wage rates than other Cubans. The

occupation distributions in rows 8a-8k suggest that the Mariels are more

heavily concentrated in laborer and service occupations that other Cubans,

and are less likely to hold sales, clerical, and craft jobs. Relative to

other Cubans, the occupations of the Mariel immigrants are therefore more

similar to those of black workers.

    The unadjusted wage gap between Mariels and other Cubans is 34 percent.

Part of this differential is attributable to the lower education levels and

younger ages of the Mariels. A simple linear regression for the logarithm

of average hourly earnings fitted to the sample of Cubans with earnings in

1984 suggests that the Mariels earned 18 percent lower wages than other

Cubans, controlling for education, potential experience, and sex (the

standard error of this estimate is .08). This gap probably reflects the

combination of lower language ability and a shorter assimilation time in

the US among the Mariel immigrants, as well as any permanent differences in

ability and/or motivation between the earlier and later Cuban immigrants.




     15The weighted count of all Cubans in the March 1985 CPS who entered
the US after 1980 is 85,800, which is only 69 percent of the estimated
125,000 Mariel refugees.

III. The Effect of the Mariel Immigration of the Miami Labor Market

   Tables 4 and 5 present simple averages of wage rates and unemployment

rates for whites, blacks, Cubans, and other hispanics in the Miami labor

market between 1979 and 1985. In order to provide a comparative

perspective for evaluating the changes that took place over this period, I

have also assembled similar data for whites, blacks, and hispanics in four

"comparison" cities: Atlanta, Los Angeles, Houston, and Tampa-St.

Petersburg. These four cities were selected to generate relatively large

samples of blacks and hispanics, while at the same time exhibiting a

pattern of economic growth similar to that in Miami over the late 1970's

and early 1980's. A comparison of employment growth rates (based on

establishment-level data) suggests that economic conditions were very

similar in Miami and the average of the four comparison cities between 1976

and 1984.

     The wage data in Table 4 reveal a number of facts. Perhaps most

obvious is that earnings are lower in Miami than in the comparison cities.

The differentials in 1979 ranged from 8 percent for whites to 15 percent

for blacks.   A more surprising result is that real earnings levels of

whites in both Miami and the comparison cities were more-or-less constant

between 1979 and 1985. This is in contrast to the slight decline in real

wages in the overall US economy over this period (see Round and Johnson

(1989), pp. 5-6) and underscores the relatively close correspondence

between economic conditions in Miami and the comparison cities.

     In contrast to the situation for whites, the trends in earnings for

nonwhites and hispanics differ somewhat between Miami and the comparison

cities. Riack wages in Miami were roughly constant from 1979 to 1981, then
                                     11

fell in 1982 and 1983 before recovering to their previous level in 1984.

Black earnings in the comparison cities, on the other hand, show a steady

downward trend between 1979 and 1985. Based on these data there is no

evidence of a negative impact of the Mariel immigration on black wages in

Miami. The data do suggest a relative downturn in black wages in Miami

during 1982-83. It seems likely, however, that this reflects an unusually

severe cyclical effect associated with the 1982-83 recession.   I return to

this issue in Table 7, below.

   Wage rates for non-Cuban hispanics in Miami were relatively stable

between 1979 and 1985, with only a slight dip in 1983. In contrast,

hispanic wage rates in the comparison cities fell about 6 percentage points

over this period. Again, there is no evidence of a negative effect in

Miami, either in the immediate post-Mariel period or over the longer run.

    Table 4 does provide some indication of a decline in Cuban wage rates

relative to other groups in Miami. Relative to whites, for example, Cuban

wages fell by 6-7 percentage points between 1979 and 1981. Assuming that

the wages of earlier Cuban immigrants were constant, this decline is

consistent with the addition of 40,000 Mariel workers to the poo1 of Cubans

in the Miami labor force, and with the 34 percent wage differential between

Mariels and other Cubans noted in Table 3. A more thorough analysis of

Cuban wages is presented in Table 8, below.

    The unemployment rates in Table 5 lead to the same general conclusions

as the wage data in Table 4. There is no strong evidence of an adverse

effect of the Mariel influx on the unemployment rates of either whites or

blacks. The unemployment rates suggest a severe cyclical downturn in the

black labor market in Miami in 1982-83. Black unemployment rates in Miami,
                                     12

which had been 2-4 points lower than those in the comparison cities from

1979 to 1981, equalled or exceeded those in the comparison cities from 1982

to 1984. The 1985 data indicate a return to the pre-1982 pattern, although

the sampling errors are large enough to prevent precise inferences.

    In contrast to the pattern for whites and blacks, there was a sizeable

increase in Cuban unemployment rates in Miami following the Mariel

immigration. This is illustrated in Figure 2, which plots unemployment

rates of Cubans in Miami against those of non-hispanics (white and black)

over the 1979-85 period.   The graph indicates that Cuban unemployment

rates were perhaps 3 percentage points higher during 1980-1981 than would

have been expected on the basis of earlier (and later) patterns.     Assuming

that the unemployment rates of other Cubans were not affected by the Mariel

influx, this effect is consistent with unemployment rates of around 20

percent among the Mariels themselves. While far from conclusive, this

simple calculation suggests that the increase in Cuban unemployment rates

could easily be explained as a result of the addition of the Mariel

refugees to the Cuban population, with little or no effect on earlier

immigrants.

    The simple averages of wages and unemployment rates in Tables 4 and 5,

which combine workers of all ages and education levels, do not directly

address the question of whether the Mariel immigration reduced the earnings

of less-skilled natives in Miami. A more direct answer is provided by the

data in Table 6. In order to identify "less-skilled" workers, I fit a

linear regression equation for the logarithm of hourly earnings to workers

in the comparison cities. The explanatory variables in this regression

included education, potential experience, squared potential experience,
                                      13

indicator variables for each sex and race group, and interactions of the

sex-race indicators with potential experience and squared potential

experience. I then used the estimated coefficients from this equation to

form a predicted wage for each non-Cuban worker in Miami, and sorted the

sample from each year into quartiles on the basis of predicted wage rates.

    This procedure gives a simple way to identify more- and less-skilled

workers in the Miami labor market. Means of actual log wages for each

quartile and year are presented in the first four columns of Table 6. The

difference in mean wages between the first and fourth quartiles, which

provides an index of the spread in the wage distribution, is presented in

the fifth column of the   table.
    If the Mariel inunigration reduced the wages of less-skilled natives,

one would expect to observe a decline in the wage of workers in the lowest

skill quartile, at least relative to workers in the upper quartile. The

actual averages show no evidence of this effect. Apart from a temporary

increase in relative wages of workers in the lowest quartile between 1979

and 1981, the distribution of non-Cubans wages in the Miami labor market

was remarkably stable between 1979 and 1985. Taken together with the data

in Table 4, there is little evidence of a negative effect of the Mariel

influx on the earnings of natives.

   A final check is provided by Table 7, which contains more detailed

information on wages, employment rates, and unemployment rates for blacks

in Miami between 1979 and 1985. I have separately analyzed the set of all

blacks and the set of blacks with less than 12 years of education, to

isolate any differential effect on the less-skilled segment of the black

population. For both groups I have calculated the differential in wages
                                       14


between Miami   and the comparison cities (both the unadjusted difference in
                                                         that controls for
mean log wages, and a regression-adjusted differential

education, sex, marital status, part-time status, private/public

employment, and potential experience), and the differentials in the

employment-population rate and the unemployment rate between Miami and the

comparison cities.

    As indicated in Table 4, the wage differential for blacks in Miami

relative to those in the four comparison cities decreased slightly between

1979 and 1981. The differential increased substantially in 1982, but then

began a steady downward trend after 1983. By 1985, the wage gap was less

than 5 percent for all black workers, and was actually positive for less-

educated blacks. The magnitudes of the regression-adjusted wage

differentials are not significantly different from the unadjusted

differentials, reflecting the similarity of the black populations in Miami

and the comparison cities. Like the unadjusted differentials, the adjusted

wage gaps show no evidence of any effect of the Mariel immigration on black

wages.

    A similar conclusion emerges from the pattern of differentials in

employment-population rates and unemployment rates.16 Among all blacks,

there is some evidence of a relative decline in the employment-to-

population ratio in Miami between 1979 and 1885. This effect seems to have

 started in 1982, but is less pronounced among low-education blacks. The

 series of unemployment rate differentials indicate a worsening of relative



      16i have also computed regression-adjusted employment-population and
 unemployment gaps, using linear probability models. The explanatory power
 of the statistical models is so low, however, that the adjusted
 differentials are almost identical to the unadjusted differentials.

unemployment for blacks in Miami, also starting in 1982, although the

unemployment gap closed in 1985. Given the two year lag between the

arrival of the Mariels and the emergence of this unemployment gap, it seems

more likely a result of the 1982 recession than a reaction to the influx of

less-skilled immigrants.

    The effects of the Mariel immigration on Cuban labor market outcomes

are examined in detail in Table 8. The first column of the table

reproduces the means of log wages in each year from row 3 of Table 4. The

second column gives predicted log wages of Cubans in Miami, using estimated

coefficients from a regression equation fit to hispanics in the four

comparison cities. The gap between actual and predicted wages is presented

in the third column of the table. These series show that the 9 percentage

point decline in Cuban real wage rates in Miami between 1979 and 1985 was a

result of two complementary factors: a 6 percent relative decline in the

"quality" of the Cuban labor force in Miami, as measured by the decline in

their predicted wages; and a 3 percentage point increase in the quality-

adjusted wage gap between Cuban workers in Miami and hispanic workers in

the comparison cities. Two-thirds of the wage decline is therefore

attributed to the changing productivity characteristics of the Cuban labor

force, and only one-third to a decrease in the return to skills for Cubans

in the Miami labor market.

     The next four columns of Table 8 give the means of log wages for Cuban

workers in each quartile of the distribution of predicted wages (using the

same prediction equation as was used to form the means in column 2). These

means suggest that real wage rates of Cubans in the lowest quartile of the

wage distribution declined by 11-12 percentage points between 1979 and
                                      16

1985. The decline is smaller for workers in the higher quartiles, but

there is some variation between 1984 and 1985, and in light of the sampling

errors it is difficult to draw precise inferences. The difference between

the means of the first and fourth quartiles is 9 percentage points higher

in 1984 than 1979, but the relative difference narrows to only 2 points in

1985. These figures are consistent with a larger decline in earnings at

the low end of the Cuban wage distribution after the Mariel immigration, as

might be expected from the addition of a large group of relatively

unskilled workers to the pool of Cubans. The extent of the decline,

however, is not precisely measured.

    An alternative method of assessing the effect of the Mariel immigration

on the earnings of Cubans in the Miami labor market is to compare Cuban

wages in Miami to the wages of Cubans elsewhere in the US. Since the

fractions of Mariels in the Cuban labor force is roughly the same inside

and outside Miami, this comparison controls for any unobservable

differences in skill between the Mariels and other Cubans (due to language

ability, for example).'7 The ninth and tenth columns of Table 8 contain

estimates of the wage differential for Cubans in Miami relative to those

elsewhere in the US, both unadjusted and adjusted for education, sex, part-

time status, private sector/public sector employment, marital status

(interacted with sex) and potential experience.

     The earnings differentials computed in this way are roughly constant

between 1979 and 1984. The 1982 unadjusted wage differential is 10

percentage points larger than earlier or later ones, but the regression-


     17This is strictly true only if the unobservable differences have a
constant proportional effect on all Mariels, independent of the level of
observed skills or location choice.
                                     17

adjusted differential is not significantly different from any of the other

differentials. The 1985 data also indicate a slightly higher Cuban wage

rate outside Miami. In any case, a comparison of Cuban wages inside and

outside the Miami labor market shows no evidence of a widening gap in the

years immediately following the Mariel immigration. On the assumption that

the Mariel influx had no effect on the wage rates of other Cuban outside

Miami, this suggests that the observed downturn in Cuban wages in Miami can

be attributed solely to the "dilution" of the Cuban labor force with less-

skilled Mariel workers.



IV. Interpretation of the Findings

    The data in tables 4-8 point to two conclusions. First, there was

essentially no effect of the Mariel immigration on the wages or employment

outcomes of non-Cuban workers in the Miami labor market. Second, and

perhaps even more surprising, there was no strong effect of the Mariel

immigration on the wages of other Cubans. The observed decline in average

Cuban wage rates in Miami after 1980 is no larger than would be expected by

simply adding the Mariel immigrants to the pooi of Cuban workers, assuming

that the Mariels earned about one-third less than other comparable Cubans

(as the March 1985 data suggest). This conclusion is confirmed by a

comparison of Cuban wage rates inside and outside Miami, which shows no

relative change over the period.

   These conclusions lead naturally to the question of how the Miami labor

market was able to absorb a 7 percent increase in population and labor

force with no adverse effects. One possible answer is that the Mariels

displaced other immigrants and natives who would have moved to Miami in the
                                     18

early 1980's had the Boatlift not occurred. The population data in Table    2


lend some credence to this explanation: 80 percent of the population

growth that occurred between 1979 and 1984 in Miami took place between

April and July 1980.

    A broader perspective on this potential explanation is provided by

comparing population growth rates in Miami and other Florida cities between

1970 and 1986. From 1970 to 1980, Miami population grew at an annual rate

of 2.5 percent per year while the rest of Florida grew at a rate of 3.9

percent. After April 1, 1980 the growth rate in Miami slowed to 1.4

percent per year while that in the rest of the state decreased to 3.4

percent.18 The larger relative slowdown in Miami suggests that the

Boatlift may have actually deterred long-run population growth in Miami.

The population of Dade county in 1986 was about equal to the pre-Boatlift

projection of the University of Florida Bureau of Economic and Business

Research under their "low population growth" scenario.19

     Nevertheless, data from the March 1985 Current Population Survey

suggest that Miami continued to attract new foreign-born immigrants after

1980. A total of 2.7 percent of all non-Cuban immigrants who arrived in

the US after March 1980 were living in Miami in March 1985. By comparison,

only 1.8 percent of all non-Cuban immigrants in the US at the time of the

1980 Census lived in Miami. Therefore, Miami attracted "more than its



     18These figures are obtained from 1970 population counts in US Bureau
of the Census 1970 Census of Population - Number of Inhabitants (PC(l)-Al),

share" of new non-Cuban immigrants to the US in the five-year period after

the Mariel immigration. The implication is that the slow-down in the rate

of growth of the Miami SMSA after June 1980 occurred because of a change in

the net migration rate of natives and older cohorts of immigrants, rather

than because of a change in the inflow rate of new immigrants. This

finding is consistent with the pattern of domestic migration between 1970

and 1980 identified by Filer (1988), who finds a strong negative

correlation across SMSA's between the net in-migration rate of natives and

the in-migration rate of immigrants.

    A second potential explanation for the rapid absorption of the Mariel

immigrants is the expansion of industries that utilize relatively unskilled

labor. Altonji and Card's (1989) tabulations from the 1970 and 1980

Censuses indicate that a small number of industries employ a large fraction

of immigrants, and that these industries expanded more rapidly between 1970

and 1980 in cities with large immigrant populations. The immigrant-

intensive industries identified in their analysis include apparel and

textiles, agriculture, furniture, private household services, hotels and

motels, eating and drinking establishments, and business services. These

are all relatively low-wage industries that employ large numbers of semi-

skilled operatives and laborers.

    Tabulations of the industry distributions of employment in Miami and

the entire US before and after the Mariel Boatlift are presented in Table

9. The "before" tabulations are based on reported industry of the main job

last year for respondents in the March 1979 and March 1980 Current

Population Surveys, while the "after" tabulations are based on similar data
                                     20

from the March 1984 and March 1985 CPS.2Â° The relative importance of each

industry in the Miami labor market is indicated by the ratio of employment

shares in the third and seventh columns of the table. Finally, the

fractions of Cuban workers in each industry in the Miami labor market are

presented in the fourth and eighth columns of the table. In light of the

relatively small sample of Miami workers I have grouped the low-wage

service industries identified by Altonji and Card (1989) (building

services, private household services, hotels and motels, and laundries and

cleaning services) into a single industry category. Nevertheless, the

numbers of workers in individual industries in the Miami labor market are

small, and the sampling errors associated with the Cuban percentages are

relatively large.

    The tabulations for 1978-79 indicate that Miami had relatively high

employment shares in textile and apparel industries, transportation

(notably air transport), wholesale trade, less-skilled service industries,

and other personal service industries. The high employment share of

textiles and apparel is especially remarkable in light of the relatively

low concentration of other manufacturing industries in Miami. The data in

the fourth column of the table show that most of the textile and apparel

workers in Miami, and almost one-half of all other manufacturing workers,

were Cubans. Cubans were also over-represented in wholesale trade and

other personal service industries, but under-represented in transportation,

communication, and utility industries.




     20The Census industry coding scheme used in the CPS was changed in
1983. For most of the industry groups identified in Table 10 there was
little change in the coding scheme.
                                      21

    The employment tabulations from 1983-84 show a similar pattern to the

earlier data, with little evidence of a relative expansion of employment in

textiles, eating and drinking establishments, or less-skilled service

industries. The largest relative change occurred in the employment share

of agriculture, which increased from .83 percent to 2.33 percent in Miami,

while remaining relatively constant in the US as a whole. In view of the

relative stability in the fraction of Cubans in this industry, however, it

seems unlikely that this expansion was driven by the Mariel immigration.

The largest increase in the fraction of Cubans occurred in less-skilled

services, which moved from 14 percent Cuban before the Boatlift to about

one-third after. There is no evidence of a similar expansion in the

fraction of Cubans in textiles and apparel or other manufacturing.

    On balance the data in Table 9 give little indication of a shift in the

industry distribution of employment in Miami between 1978 and 1984. On the

other hand the data suggest that the industry distribution in Miami in the

late 1970's was well-suited to handle an influx of unskilled immigrants.

In 1979 over one-third of the Miami labor force was made up of immigrants:

approximately one-third of these had arrived in the previous decade.21       As

a result, immigrant-intensive industries such as textiles and apparel and

less-skilled service industries were well-established. Many of the Mariel

immigrants may have simply displaced earlier immigrants in these

industries, as older cohorts of immigrants moved to more attractive jobs.




     21Tabulations from the 1980 Census show that of the 578,055 foreign-
born residents of Miami on April 1 1980, 205,887 (35.6 percent) arrived
after 1970. Of 324,976 foreign-born Cubans, 91,514 (28.2 percent) arrived
after 1970.

V. Conclusions
    The experiences of the Miami labor market in the aftermath of the

Mariel Boatlift provide a natural experiment with which to evaluate the

effect of unskilled immigration on the labor market opportunities of native

workers. The Mariel immigrants increased the population and labor force of

the Miami metropolitan area by 7 percent. Most of these immigrants were

relatively unskilled: as a result, the proportional increase in labor

supply to less-skilled occupations and industries was much greater. An

analysis of wage rates for less-skilled non-Cuban workers, however,

suggests that the influx of Mariel immigrants had virtually no   effect.

Likewise, there is no evidence of an increase in unemployment among less-

skilled blacks or other non-Cuban workers. Rather, the data analysis

suggests a remarkably rapid transition of the Mariel immigrants into the

Miami labor force, with negligible effects on other groups. Even among the

Cuban population there is no indication that wages or unemployment rates of

earlier immigrants were substantially effected by the arrival of the

Mariels.

    Despite the clear-cut nature of these findings some caution is required

in their interpretation. The Miami labor market is atypical of other local

labor markets in the US. In the two decades before the Mariel Boatlift

Miami had absorbed a continuing flow of Cubans and other immigrants. The

Mariel immigration can be seen as part of a long-run pattern: one that may

have recently re-emerged with the arrival of Nicaraguans and other Central

Americans.

    Three factors may have been especially important in facilitating the

 absorption of the Mariel immigrants. First, a comparison of population
                                      23

growth rates in Miami and the rest of Florida suggests that the net

migration of natives and earlier cohorts of immigrants into the Miami area

slowed considerably after the Boatlift. To some extent the Mariels

displaced other migrants from within the US who would have moved to Miami

in the early 1980's. Second, the industry structure of the Miami labor

market was well-suited to make use of an influx of relatively unskilled

workers. This structure, and in particular the high concentration of

textile and apparel industries, evolved over the previous two decades in

response to earlier waves of immigration, and may have allowed the Mariel

immigrants to move into unskilled jobs as earlier cohorts of immigrants

moved into better jobs. Finally, because of the high concentration of

Spanish-speakers in Miami, the lack of English-speaking ability among the

Mariels may have had relatively smaller effects than could be expected for

other immigrant groups in other cities.
