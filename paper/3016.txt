                STRATEGIC USE OF ANTIDUMPING LAW TO ENFORCE
                        TACIT INTERNATIONAL COLLUS ION


                                  ABSTRACT


     We consider the impact of domestic antidumping law in a two-country
partial equilibrium model where domestic and foreign firms tacitly cDllude
in the domestic market.   Firms engage in an infinitely repeated game, with
each period composed of a two-stage game.     In the first stage each firm
chooses capacity before stochastic domestic demand is realized.       In the
second stage, after demand is realized, each firm then sets price. We show
that the introduction of domestic antiduaping law typically leads to the
filing of antidumping suits by the domestic industry in low demand states.
and to more successful collusion and greater market share for domestic firms
during periods of low demand as a result. This occurs in spite of the fact
that antidumping duties are never actually imposed. That is, the entire
effect of antidu.mptng law comes in the form of a threat to punish foreign
firma with a duty j they should "misbehave."       Such a threat is made
credible by filing a suit and, because it is credible, never has to be
implemented. We conclude that the trade-restricting effects of antidumping
law may have little to do with whether duties are actually imposed.

                             I. Introduction

    The belief that dumping on foreign markets is closely linked to

cartelization is nearly as old as the issue of dumping in international

trade itself. This view played a critical role in the evolution of

antiduaping laws in the early 20th century. 'liner (1966, p.242) notes,        for


instance, that the first antidumping legislation adopted in the U.S., as

contained in Sections 800-801 of the Revenue Act of 1916, came largely        in


response to the alleged dumping threat from the highly cartelized and

heavily protected German industries. This alleged duiping activity took the

form of unloading excess industrial capacity from the German cartels on to

the noncartelized (and segmented) U.S. market, Inspired by this fear, the

original intent of the law was to provide protection for U.S. firms against

 unfair competition" resulting from the dumping activity of     cartelized firms

abroad.

     While the importance of cartels in the evolution of antidumping law is

widely acknowledged, the impact of such laws on the performance     of cartels

 is less well understood.1   Yet, antidumping law is likely to alter the

 environment within which cartels operate in important ways.      For example.

 in the particular duaping context discussed above, the introduction of

 antidumping law into the domestic country will effect the freedom with which

 cartelized foreign finis can dump   excess   capacity on the noncartelized

 domestic market. This, in turn, may have an important impact on the degree

 of collusion sustainable by the foreign cartel. Moreover, when made

 available to cartel meters, antidumping law may become a tool to enforce


      1  Recent work by Dixit (1988), Ethier (1988), and Prusa (1988) analyze
 the effects of antidumping law on firm interaction in a static setting.

exploited the existence of antidumping law to police the dumping activities

of its own members in cartelized markets. In at least one instance.

antidumping action was used successfully by one member of the International

Steel Cartel against another to enforce the cartels price arrangements.2

     The impact of antidumping laws on collusive behavior thus seems to be a

potentially   fruitful area of research, and one that we begin to explore in

this paper. We do so in the context of an environment where firms collude

tacitly and are limited to self-enforcing arrangements. The general setting

we choose is one of an infinitely repeated game in which firms face

stochastic market demand and must choose each period's capacity before the

market demand for the period is realized. Once market demand for the period

has been observed, and with their capacities for the period now fixed, firms

then simultaneously choose prices. Within this setting, fins attempt to

enforce collusion over capacity and price with the credible (subgame

perfect) threat to forever revert to the static Nash equilibrium in the

event of a defection from the cooperative arrangement.3 The 'lost collusive


     2
        In January 1938, the South African Iron and Steel Corporation filed
an antidumping petition against steel producers in the U.S. for selling
steel in the South African market at prices below those agreed upon by the
International Steel Cartel. Dumping duties were levied and the Cartel's
pricing arrangements restored (see Hexner, 1943).


        Our model can be viewed essentially as either an infinitely repeated
version of Kreps and Scheinkinan (1983) with firms facing stochastic market
demand that is realized only after capacity is set for the period, or as a
variation on Rotewberg and Saloner (1986a) with the introduction of a
capacity-setting stage at the start of each period. Related work on price-
setting supergames with capacity constraints but without stochastic demand
can be found in Brock and Scheinlcman (1985), Benoit and Krishna (1987), and
Davidson and Deneckere (1987), among others. See also Rotenberg and Saloner
(l986b) for an analysis of the impact of import quotas on collusive behavior.

equilibrium will, typically have firms carrying excess       capacity in low demand

states, and it is with respect to this excess capacity        that antidumping tatc


has its effects.

     The observations on antidumping law made at the outset suggest that,          in

the presence of tacit collusive behavior, the introduction        of antidumping

law may have very different effects depending on the competitive

characteristics of the industry to which the law is made available.          In

Staiger and golak (1989), we consider the case in which the domescic

industry is competitive but faces imports from firms behaving collusively in

a segmented market abroad. In that paper, we show that the introduction of

domestic antidumping law is likely to lead to the filing of antidumping

suits and the imposition of antiduniping duties in low demand states, to less

price collusion abroad, and to a lesser quantity duuiped on the domestic

market as a result.

      In the present paper, we consider the impact of the introduction of

 antidumpiug law into the domestic country when domestic and foreign firms

 are tacitly colluding in the domestic market. Here we show that the

 introduction of antidumping law into the domestic country typically leads to

 the filing of antidumping suits by the domestic industry in low demand

 states, and to more successful collusion and greater market share for

 domestic     firms during periods   of low demand as   a result. This occurs in
 spite   of   the fact that antidumping duties are never actually imposed. That

 is, in this setting, and as distinct from the use of antidumping law by

 coapetitive industries analyzed in Statger and ¶Jolak (1989), the entire

 effect of antidumping law comes in the form of a threat to punish foreign

  firms with a duty if    they should "misbehave", Such a threat is made

                                               3
credible by filing the suit and, because it is credible, never has to be

implemented.' The results then follow from the fact chat by filing an

antidumping suit, the domestic industry is able to diminish the incentives

of foreign firms to aggressively pursue domestic market share. i.e. •    defect

from the collusive price arrangement. Hence, with defection now relatively

less attractive fur foreign firms, higher collusive prices in periods of low

demand can be sustained with the filing of an antidumping suit, but only

after appeasing the domestic industrys incentive to defect by giving

domestic firms a larger share of the low-demand market. These results are

developed fornally below.

     The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. In section II we

develop the model in the absence of antiduanping law. Section III introduces

antidumping law into the domestic country and explores the consequences for

collusive behavior. Finally. section IV concludes with a summary of our

results.



                                  II. The Model

     We consider an infinitely repeated model of two firms, home (no *) and

foreign (*),   selling   to the home market where demand is stochastic and

fluctuates between high and low states. At the beginning of any period,

firms first must simultaneously set capacity K and K*. facing per unit

capacity costs r>O. Once capacity choices for the period are made, the

state of demand for the period is revealed. We assume for simplicity that

demand takes the linear form
                                  -




        This prediction is consistent with the large number of antidumping
suits that are filed and then later withdrawn (see Prusa, 1988, and section
III below).

We assume that      high       demand occurs in any period with probability p.

observing the demand realization for the period, the two firms then

simultaneously set prices facing zero marginal costs of production (up to

capacity).



                                     The   Static Nash Eouilibriu
     We first characterize the unique static Nash equilibrium to this game
which will serve as the credible (subgame perfect) punishment in the
 repeated   game to   be studied next. We rely heavily on Kreps and Scheinkrnan

 (1983) and therefore           on   the particular (efficient) rationing rule underlying

 their results, Specifically, consumers buy first from the cheapest

 supplier, and income effects from price changes are absent.3

      Provided that (in a sense to be formalized) the differential between

 high demand and low demand is sufficiently great, there exists a unique Nash

 equilibrium to the static game characterized by symmetric capacity choices


            See Davidson        and Deneckere (1986)       for   results from a static two-
 stage    game under different rationing rules.

                                                       S

and



(4) P—O.


Thus, capacity choices are such that in high demand states, the two firms

sell their capacity at the market clearing price, while in low demand

states, price is set to marginal cost (which equals zero) and there is

excess capacity.

      To show that this is indeed the unique Nash equilibrium to the static

game (under the      condition   of sufficiently large differences between high and

low demand states), we follow Kreps and Scheinkman (1g83) and first define

q1(q) i—L,M as the Cournot duopoly best response functions for firms facing

the linear demand function given in (1) and zero marginal costs. It is

straightforward to check that these best response functions must satisfy the

following sets of inequalities:



(5) q(qC) < D(O)

                                               6
and



(6) q5(qtD(O)) S q11(DjO)) < qfl(O) < D(O)


where the notation q(qax) denotes the value of q(q) for all values of

q t x. Moreover, the symmetric Cournot-Nash equilibrium output choice

facing high demand (and zero marginal costs), q, is given by



              °E
(7)    q——.

Thus, using (2) and (7), and provided p is strictly positive.



       K" <   q.

It thus follows that



(8) K" C      q5(K'); K <   q(qq(K")).

Finally, we assume that     the   differential between high demand and low demand

 is sufficiently great in the sense that

which, using (1) and (2). implies0



(10) K"    DL(O).



Putting (S), (6), (8). and (10) together yields



                     < D,,(O)        K" < q(K') s   q(D(O))   C q,4(O) <   D(O)
(11) 1
      l_   Id' < q(qq(K"))



     With (11) we are now ready to characterize a firm's expected profies in

the static game as a function of its capacity choice facing a capacity

choice K" from its rival. Consider first the range of firm capacity

responses to Id'     satisfying



(12) DL(O)     K




Suppose that the high demand state is realized. Then for all capacity

choices satisfying (12). it must be true that



(13) K s   q5(K");   K" <   q5(K).


The first inequality is a direct consequence of (12) and the second

inequality follows from (11). Appealing to Proposition 1(a) of Kreps and

Scheinkman (1983), we then have that capacity responses satisfying (12)


        Condition (9) is in fact more than enough to yield (10), but will be
needed for uniqueness.

entire capacity at the market clearing price.       Alternatively, if realized

demand is low, then by (U) and (12)



(14) K t DL(O); K" t DL(O).



Under (14), either firm can satisfy the entire market in the low demand

state for any nonnegative price. Hence, capacity constraints do not upset

the standard Bertrand equilibrium in which price equals marginal cost (which

is zero), so that low demand revenues for the firm are zero. With this

information we can now write the firm's expected profits facing      gW   for    K


in the range defined by (12) as



(15) EU(K,K') — PPB(K+1d)K    -   rK   for       KeD(O),qg(KW)].



     Next consider the range of firm capacity responses to

corresponding to



 (16) K t q5(K').



 clearly (14) will still hold over this range. so that low demand states

 continue to yield zero revenues for the firm. Suppose, then, that demand is

 high. together, (11) and (16) imply



      K>K'; Xq5(K'); K <D(O).



                                             9
Appealing to Proposition 1(b) of Kreps and Scheinkman (1983). we then have

that the finns revenues with high demand will be its "Staclcelberg follower'

revenues Pfi(q(K") + K')     q(KN) when (16) holds. Thus, expected profits

for capacity responses to 1(11 in the range given by (16) are



(17) EII(K,K") —   p P(q5(K") + K")q(K") - rK       for,   K q(K")


with (17) equal to (15) when K —   q(IC).      With no, the expression in

(17) is maximized over K in the range given by (16) when K —     q (gN)
Therefore, it will never pay the firm to respond to K" with a K that

violates, the right-hand inequality of (12).

     Finally, consider the range of firm capacity responses to K"

corresponding to



(18) KS DL(O).



Together, (11) and (18) imply that (1.3) continues to hold, so that firm

revenues with high demand will be P5(K+K").K. Suppose, then, that demand

is low. Together, (11) and (18) imply



(19) K" t K; K' > q(K); KS DL(O).



Appealing once more to Proposition 1(b) of Kreps and Scheinkman (1983). we

then have that the firm's revenues with low demand will be no greater than

its rival's staclcelberg follower" revenues P(K+q(K))q(K) when (18)

holds. Thus, expected profits for capacity responses to K" in the range


                                         10
given by (18) are no greater than



(20) ff(K,K1) —   pP5(K+K)K + (l-p)P(K+q(Kflq(K) -             tIC   for




with (20) equal to (15) when K — DL(O).          However, it can be shown that,

given our assumption (9), iiT(K,K") takes its maximum value for K in the

range given by (18) at KDL(O). Thus we have



      EII(KcfO,DL(0)1,KN)     ft(K.[0,D(Ofl,1c')    !fi(K_DL(O),KX) —      Efl(k_DL(O)KN).


Essentially, assumption (9) assures that     high    demand states are of

sufficient importance to the expected profits of the firm that it would

never find profitable a reduction of capacity for the purpose of generating

higher Nash profits in low demand states. Hence, under assumption (9) it

will never pay the firm to respond to x'          with   a K that violates the

left-hand inequality of (12).

      We are thus left with (15) as the portion of the firm's expected profit

function relevant to finding the best response to K'. To find this best

response to K', the first order conditions of (IS) can be solved to yield

(2), with (3) and (4) then following from the preceding discussion. This

establishes that (2), (3) and (4) characterize a Nash equilibrium to the

static   game provided that the difference between high and low demand is
sufficiently   great (in    the sense of (9)). Uniqueness then follows directly
by   using th. preceding arguments to rule out the existence of additional

equilibria characterized by mm (K,K*) t DL(O). and by using (9) and a

sligbt variation on the preceding arguments to rule out the existence of


                                            11
equilibria characterized by mEn (K,K*) c DL(O).'



                                The   Monoocly Solution
       Before tuning to the dynamic game,      we   consider the monopoly solution
to   the static game above. This will provide the collusive ideal toward

which the two firms     will   strive in the repeated setting of the next

subsection.

       The monopolists problem is much simpler than the duopoly examined

above since it does not involve a price setting game subject to capacity

constraints. The problem is simply to choose capacity facing uncertain

demand, and then upon the realization of demand for the period to choose the

profit maximizing quantity to sell subject to the constraint that quantity

delivered   be no   greater than capacity.

       Consider first the choice of output given a low demand realization.

Low demand profits (revenues) as a function of output q are given by



(21)    I4(q) —   P(q)q.

The monopolists unconstrained profit maximizing quantity choice if the
demand realization is low is, from the first-order condition of (21), given
by q—a./2. Because the         monopolist can sell at most its capacity K. the

constrained   quantity choice is characterized by

          The variation involves replacing K' with K" (defined by (24)) in
equation (20) and noting that, with K(1() denoting capacity best-response
functions, K(KM) S K(Ke(O,KMIY S K. The proof then establishes under
condition (9) that K(I)c(DL(0),K"] which, to4ether with the inequalities
above, implies that any capacity choice Ke[0,te] by one's rival will
induce a best capacity response X(K€(O,KM]) e [D(O),K"J. Hence, no
equilibria can exist with min(K.K*) C D(O).

                — min(K,       °12

Thus, expected monopoly profits as a function of capacity choice K are given

by

                             The Dynamic Case



      We are now ready to characterize the dynamic game. We explore an

infinitely repeated version of the static game described above. The two

firms achieve the most collusive (syiimetric) outcome sustainable by the

credible (subgame perfect) threat to revert forever to the static Nash

equilibrium characterized above in the event that either firm defects. In

order to focus on the dynamics of sustaining collusion in a stochastic

environment, we will maintain assumptions which allow the firms to sustain

their most preferred capacity choice. Thus, any difficulties in sustaining

full collusion will occur with regard to the pricing decisions, which by

assumption, are made once demand for the period has been observed. We begin

by deriving the conditions under which the fully collusive capacity and

price choices are sustainable by the threat of Nash reversion.

The Fully Collusive Ecuilibrium
       In   the fully collusive equilibrium, firms make symmetric capacity

choices Kc and pricing decisions           to replicate the monopoly outcome of

the previous subsection, so that

where       "s denote fully collusive magnitudes. If full collusion is

sustainable, then neither firm can have an incentive to unilaterally defect

from the cooperative choices characterized by (27). (28), and (29). Because

both firms are completely symmetric, we characterize the no defection"

condition in the domestic finn notation. A firm may defect from the

cooperative agreement either in its capacity choice or in its price choice.

The former defection can not be conditioned on the state of demand (which is

unknown      at the time), while the latter defection can   be conditioned on the

demand      realization for the period. We consider each    in turn.

        If the domestic firm unilaterally defects from its cooperative capacity

choice I, it will face noncooperative pricing in the second stage of the

current period, followed by infinite repetition of the noncooperative Nash

equilibrium characterized earlier. Denoting the defection capacity as

1(0, assumption (9) rules out defection capacity choices 1(D < DL(O)         in

assumption ruled out   capacity choices K C DL(O) in response to a foreign
capacity choice of K' in the static game analyzed earLier. Suppose, then.

that



(30) K°



Since I t DL(O) is assured by (9), defection capacity choices satisfying

(30) allow either firm to satisfy the entire market in low demand states for

any nonnegative price. Hence, for 1(0      in the range given by (30), the

standard Bertrand equilibrium obtains in low demand states with price equal

to marginal cost and low demand revenues of zero for the defecting firm.

On the other hand, defection capacity choices K° > q(K') in response to

a foreign capacity choice of t can be ruled out as long as r>0 in an

exactly analogous way that capacity choices K > q(K") in response to a

foreign capacity choice of 1(2   were ruled out in the static game. Hence we

also have



       1(0   q1(1(); L(C < q(q(KC))   q(K°)



which (appealing once more to Proposition 1(a) of Kreps and Scheinkman

(1983)) assures that K and 1(0        are such that in high demand states the

two firms will sell all of their capacity at the market clearing price.

Thus, a firms current expected gain from defecting to        1(0   in the relevant

range is given by

The Most Collusive Equilibrium
        If (36) holds, then perfect collusion in capacity and price can be

sustained and (27), (28), and (29) characterize the equilibrium capacity and

pricing policies of the two firms. However, if (36) does not hold, then

perfect collusion in capacity and price cannot be sustained. In this case

we focus on the most collusive agreement sustainable by the threat of Nash

reversion. Such an agreement will have at least one of the incentive

constraints in (36) holding with equality, i.e., binding. While (36 Cc))

will clearly not bind in equilibrium as long as cooperation means anything

 (w(t,P,P) >0), equilibrium could have either (36 (a)) or (36 (b)) bind:

 the toner corresponds to the case where perfectly collusive capacity

 choices are unsustainable, while the latter corresponds to the case in which

 perfectly collusive price, are unsustainable in low demand states. We will

 focus on the latter case, and provide parameter ranges which yield this case

 as an equilibrium.

         Given that we have restricted our attention to cases in which perfectly

 collusive capacity choices are sustainable, the next question is what

 cooperative capacity level represents the most collusive choice. As noted

                                             19
above, if the threat of static Nash reversion is sufficient to sustain

perfect price collusion given any cooperative capacity choice, then the

firms will attempt to sustain the (symmetric) cooperative capacity choices

It'/2 and support the fully collusive, i.e., monopoly, outcome. If, on the

other hand, given capacity choices K41/2 the firms find fully collusive

pricing unsustainable by the threat of static Nash reversion, it must be in

the low demand state that full collusion is unsustainable since, by (34) and

(35), only in this state is the current gain from price defection strictly

positive. In the event that low demand states are associated with less than

fully collusive pricing given capacity RM/2, it is possible that a choice

of cooperative capacity K° < K"/2 will yield higher cooperative profits

for the firms, but only if the smaller capacity choice helps to sustain a

more collusive price in periods of low demand. This, latter condition can

only be true provided that Kc C D(P) in equilibrium. Only then would

the lower capacity choice reduce the current incentive to defect in low

demand states, and thus have the potential for raising the sustainable

cooperattve low-demand price. However, such a reduction in cooperative

capacity below K"/2 will clearly not be optimal provided that, given

cooperative capacity Kc — L&/2, the sustainable low-demand price P is

sufficiently close to the fully collusive price P. Under this condition,

the cost of lower capacity in tents of foregone high-demand profit will

outweigh the benefit in terms of increased profit in the low demand state.

While noting that the   qualitative   nature of our results would be preserved

for any cooperative capacity choice Kc < I'/2 provided only that perfect

price collusion given K" is not sustainable, for ease of exposition We

choose to restrict our attention to the case where          is "close to" Pr


                                           20
in equilibrium. Thus, in deriving the most cooperative equilibrium for the

Linus we set cooperative capacity at      —    K"/2.
    We begin by characterizing the most cooperative price function taking

the present discounted gains from maintaining future cooperation w as

fixed. Recall that, for Kc —    I/2,    the most cooperative price sustainable

in high demand states is the fully collusive price



                   -
               B

                   p



At this price, each finn sells its capacity KC — gM/2       Thus, the only

incentive a finn might have to defect would cone from deviating to a higher

price, which can never be profitable given cooperative capacity      Kc_ KM/2

since finns face positive marginal revenue (and zero marginal cost) in high

demand states. Hence, defection in high demand states is not an issue.

     Consider, then, a firm's current incentive to defect from the

cooperative price P in a period of low demand. If a firm defects, it

will do so by shaving its price below          and capturing the entire market

 (recall that (9) ensures that Kc t DL(P k 0)).        Its current gains from

defection are then given by

        The higfri price satisfying (38) is strictly greater than P (see
(26)). Therefore, the optimal defection price (Fe) would lie below this
price by a discrete amount, and the gains from defection would be higher
than . As such, this price can be eliminated because it is not, in fact,

Hence,   the assumption chat the fully collusive           capacity choice gM,2 is
sustainable in        equilibrium amounts to placing restrictions on S and            p

(given by (46)) which ensure that p is not too large                  Intuitively, the

current incentive for a firm to defect to a higher capacity will be             small
provided    that the likelihood of a high demand realization (p)            is low,

since only in high demand states would this defection pay off. Hence, with

the probability of high demand realizations not too large, the collusive

difficulties of fins will be restricted to their ability to maintain high

prices in low dentand states,

       Finally, putting (45) and (46) together yields the following bounds on

                                 III. Dumping

     In this section we introduce antidumping law into the domestic country

and explore the way in which the tacit collusive equilibrium of the previous

section is affected when the domestic firm is given the opportunity to bring

antidumping suits against its foreign rival. We begin with a brief

description of the relevant aspects of U.S. antidumping law.



                     DescriDtion of 1) S. Antidurfiping Law

     Antidumping law has had a long and complex legislative history in the

U.S. which we do not attempt to review here. Instead, we provide a brief

summary of the steps involved in a dumping case under current U.S.    law,   from

initiating an antidumping duty investigation to the final determination and

assessment of duties.10 We then attempt to distill the key elements of this

process, with the aim of capturing these elements in our subsequent


        It should be reiterated here that we have imposed the condition that
      S     at Kc_Rhl/2 only for ease of exposition. The qualitative nature
of our results will hold for any sustainable cooperative capacity choice so
long as (9) and the condition that     <     are satisfied.

     10   The Trade Agreement Act of 1979 involved a major rewriting of U.S.
 antiduaping law. The Trade and Tariff Act of 1984 contains several
 amendments to the antidumping law of the 1979 Act that, while substantive.
 are not relevant for the particular issues we consider here.

     Once an antidumping petition is filed with the Commerce Department's

International Trade Administration (ITA) and with the International Trade

Commission (ITC), the ITA has 20 days to make a petition determination,'

that is, to decide whether the petition is in order and, if so, to commence

an investigation.'' The ITA must notify the ITC promptly of its petttion

determination. If affirmative, the ITC then has 45 days to make a

'preliminary determination" based on the "best available information"

(typically that supplied by the petitioner) of whether there is reason to

believe that the industry under review is "materially injured' or

'threatened with material injury" or that the establishment of the industry

"is materially retarded" as a result of imports. If the ITC's preliminary

determination is negative, the investigation is terminated. Provided that

the ITC's preliminary determination is affirmative, And within 160 days of

the initial filing of the suit (or within 90 days if all interested parties

agree to a "waiver of verification"), the ITA must make a "preliminary

determinations of whether there is reasonable evidence that merchandise "is
                                                               12   A negative
being sold, or is likely to be sold at less than fair value.

preliminary determination by the ITA does not terminate the investigation.

However, if the preliminary determination of the ITA is affirmative, it must

provide an estimate of the "dumping margin," and is then required to order

the "suspension of liquidation" of the affected imported goods and the


     ''
         Petitions can be either "self-initiated" by the ITA or initiated by
an "interested party" on behalf of the industry. The former is by far the
exception, with the most promirent example being the Trigger Price Mechanism


     12  In "extraordinary complicated" cases, the ITA may postpone making
its preliminary determination until the 210th day after filing.

                                        27
posting by importers of a cash deposit or bond to cover the estimated

dumping duties payable pending the final outcome of the investigation. If

the industry alleges "critical circumstances" and the hA finds evidence of

either a history of dumping in the industry or that importers were or should

have been knowledgeable about ongoing dumping, or if there are "massive"

imports of the relevant product over a "relatively short period." the

dumping duties can be applied retroactively 90 days prior to the "suspension

of liquidation' order.
                                                                           it
     At this point the investigation may be terminated or suspended or

may continue on to the final determination.   Termination occurs if and only

if the petition is withdrawn by the petitioner (the industry)- This usually

comes about as a result of price agreements reached by the domestic industry

and foreign firms named in the suit, Suspension occurs if the foreign firms

that are the subject of the dumping allegation reach an agreement with the

rCA to eliminate sales to the U.S. market at less than fair value or to

cease exporting to the U.S. market completely." In the case of suspension.

any violation of the agreement will result in reinitiation of the

 investigation. If the case is neither terminated nor suspended the     hA
 must within 75 days of its preliminary determination make a "final

 determination" of whether the merchandise under investigation 'is being, or

 is likely to be* sold in the U.S. at less than fair value.1' If the ITAs


      13
          Under "extraordinary circumstances," an agreement by the accused
 foreign firms to eliminate the "injurious effect" of their actions may be
 sufficient to suspend the investigation.


       ' The IT?. may postpone its final determination until the 135th day
 after its preliminary determination if requested to do so by either the
 petitioner or the firms against which the dumping allegations were made.

                                         28
preliminary determination was affirmative, then the TIC must make its final

determination   of injury within 45   days of      the   ITAs final determination (or

within 120 days of   the   hA's preliminary     determination,    whichever is   later).
If   the ITA's preliminary determination was negative, and its final

determination is affirmative, then the TIC has 75 days from the ITA's

affirmative   final determination to make its final determination of injury.
Lastly,   if the final determinations of both the ITh and TIC are affirmative.
the ITA has   1 days within which   to instruct customs officers to assess the
appropriate   antidumping duties. If either the ITC or the ITA determination

is negative, the investigation is terminated.

       As is evident from this brief review, foreign firms have ample

opportunity during the course of the investigation to take actions which

either terminate or suspend the proceedings. The former requires reaching

agreement over price (and quantity) with petitioners, i.e., domestic

producers, while the latter requires reaching agreement with the ITA. A

third option for foreign firms is simply to 'behave,' so that the final

dumping determination is negative. In this regard, Prusa (1988) reports

that over one third of the U.S. antidumping investigations initiated between

1980 and 1985 were eventually withdrawn, with over half of the remaining

suits ultimately rejected by the flC/ITA.'' On the other hand, if the

investigation results in a positive dumping determination, antiduniping

duties can be imposed on imports potentially dating from the time of the

initial filing. Taken together, these two observations suggest that the


     " Agreements between foreign firms and domestic petitioners are
encouraged under the Noerr-Pennington doctrine which exempts such parties
from prosecution under U.S. antitrust law. See Prusa (1988) for a thorough
analysis of this exemption and its implications for the effects of
antidumping law.

                                              29
filing of antidumping suits might be viewed as a mechanism by which domestic

firms can alter the incentives of foreign firms to aggressively pursue

domestic market share. In particular, by filing a petition at the beginning

of a period in which dumping is likely to be a problem, the domestic

industry can assure that dumping by foreign firms wilt be met by antidumping

duties applied to that period's sales.15 This characterization of

antidumping law motivates the modeling approach we pursue below.



                         Modelin antidumoin law

     For the purposes of the formal model, we take dumping by the foreign

firm to be synonymous with a defection from the cooperative price, i.e.

cutting its price to steal market share from the home firm. With the above

discussion as our guide, we model antidumping law as providing the home firm

with the opportunity to change the foreign firm's payoff in the event of a

foreign defection from the cooperative price. Specifically, for the cost of

filing the suit, the home firm is able to assure that a foreign defection

from the cooperative price will be met by an antidumping duty in the period

in which defection takes place.''


     16 We abstract in this characterization from any "noise' in the
IrA/nC decision and assume that an antidumping duty is imposed if and only
if dumping has occurred. Accordingly, we also abstract from the foreign
fin's cost of defending itself during the antidumping proceedings.


     17 If the punishment (antidunping duty) were delayed until the period
after a defection is observed, the basic arguments of this section would
still carry through though in a less transparent way.   Note also that we
have chosen to proceed as if the introduction of domestic antidumping law
would have no impact on the static Nash equilibriun derived earlier. and
thus have assumed that the presence of domestic antidumping law has no
impact on firm payoffs in the punishment phase of the dynamic game. It can
be shown that antiduaping suits will in fact never be filed in the static
Nash equilibrium (and thus that the static Nash payoffs remain unchanged

                                        30
     We now amend the dynamic model studied above and introduce antidumping

law into the home country. The timing of moves in the game is as follows.

As before, at the beginning of any period, firms simultaneously set capacity

K and K* facing per unit capacity costs r>O, after which the state of demand

is revealed. It is at this point that the home firm now has the option of

filing an antidumping suit against the foreign firm at a filing cost F>O.

With the decision of whether or not to file common knowledge the firms then

simultaneously set prices for the period.

     Consider first the high demand state. Since the potential benefits for

the home firm associated with filing a suit stem from relaxing the incentive

constraint of the foreign firm, it is clear that a suit will never be filed

in the high demand state, as long as F>O. This is because in the high

demand state the two firms already collude perfectly (the incentive

constraints don't bind), so that paying a fee F to reduce the foreign firi's

payoff in defecting from the cooperative price would yield no offsetting

benefits to the home firm in the form of larger cooperative high-demand

profits." Thus, the domestic firm will not file a suit in high demand


when domestic antidunping law is introduced) provided that the finding of
"material injury" requires an import surge greater than some fixed e > 0.
and that dumping is deemed "inactionable" (with no duty forthcoming) if this
minimum injury standard is not met. With this assumption, the results of
Kreps and Scheinkman (1983) are unaffected by the introduction of domestic
antidumping law, so that the law would have no impact on static Nash
equilibrium payoffs for the domestic (and foreign) firm.


     ' One might argue that the asywmietric access to antidumping law
enjoyed by the home firm would allow it to force" upon the foreign firm an
asymmetric sharing of the cooperative (market) capacity K" + Kc*, perhaps
with K° > I&. While asymmetric sharing of capacity can not be ruled out
as a cooperative equilibrium, any such sharing agreement that entailed the
filing of suits by the home firm in either or both states of demand would he
Pareto dominated by the same sharing rule without filing (thus avoiding the
filing cost F>O). Hence, one would not expect to see the filing of

                                        31
states for F>O, and cooperation in the high demand state is unchanged frot

its description in the dynaic game of the previous section.   Consider,

then, the low demand state. If a suit is not filed by the home country.

nothing changes from the description of the low demand state given in the

previous section. In particular; the most cooperative price sustainable

with the threat of Nash reversion will be below the optimal collusive price

in the low demand state (given our parameter assumptions). But with

incentive constraints binding in the low demand state absent a suit (see

(38)), filing a suit may. by altering the incentives of the foreign firm to

defect from the cooperative price, relax its incentive constraint at the

preexisting cooperative price and be worth its cost to the domestic firm by

allowing greater collusion on low demand price. However, for this to

happen, the incentive for the domestic firm to detect must be appeased as

the cooperative price is raised, and the only way to accomplish this is to

give the domestic firm greater market share in low demand states. Hence, we

now explore how the filing of a suit changes the incentives to defect from

 the cooperative price and the impact of these changes on cooperative price

 and market shares in the low demand state.

      Defining S as the cooperative market share for the home firm in the

 low demand state and r as the ad valorem antidumping duty to be levied on




 antidumping suits emerge as part of a cooperative capacity sharing
 agreement. Asymmetric access to antidumping law therefore introduces no


 choices Kc —  I
 relevant asymmetry into the determination of the cooperative capacity
 shares. Thus, the logic of focusing on symmetric cooperative capacity
                    is unaffected by the presence or absence of antidumping
 law. Nevertheless, as we show below, asymmetric sharing of the market in
 low demand states (when capacity does not bind) will emerge in the most-
 cooperative equilibrium with the introduction of domestic antidumping law.

                                         32
the (current) domestic sales of a foreign firm found guilty of dumping,: we

can define the current incentive to defect in the low demand state for each

firm, given that an antiduaping suit has been filed by the home firm, as




(48) fl(S,P)   —
                   (lS)PDL(P)

(49) fl*(5 P,v) —       (S-r)PDL(P).

Because of the asymmetry introduced by the existence of antidumping law in

the domestic country, we now need to characterize separately the incentive

constraints for both the domestic and the foreign firms. The no defection

conditions which the cooperative low-demand price and market sharing rule

must satisfy then become



                   Ca




and




     ' For simplicity we take the magnitude of the antidumping duty, if
levied, to be fixed and not necessarily reflective of the true" dumping
margin which would in this case be measured as the difference between
and a 'constructed value" measure. Note also that while U.S. antidumping
law provides for the imposition of antidumping duties on domestic imporcers
rather than foreign exporters, it permits importers to be reimbursed by
foreign exporters for the payment of dumping duties on all imports for which
the agreement to purchase was made prior to the suspension of liquidation
order and where the merchandise is exported before a determination of sales
at less than fair value (see Dale. 1980, pp. 104-103, note 42). Hence, as
embodied in (49), we take the incidence of the antidumping duty to fall on
the foreign exporter rather than the importer of foreign products.

        To analyze the way in which the introduction of antidumping law in the

domestic country effects the tacit collusive equilibrium in the absence of

such law, we note first that the home firm can always choose not to file anc

receive equilibrium expected discounted gains from tacit collusion equal to

.       Thus, the domestic firm will choose to file antidunping suits in low

demand      states    if and only if

discounted gains from tacit collusion (net of filing costs) are greater by

filing    in low demand states than by        not   filing at all. Using (42)       and   (36).

it   is straightforward to check that

Since the domestic firm will choose to file antidumping suits in low demand

states if and only if             > ,,    expressions (59) and (60) together imply
that for small filing costs F there exists a range of antidumping duties

     such that the domestic firm files antidumping suits if and only if the

demand realization for the period is low. Note that the domestic firm files

antiduaping suits in the presence of low demand, even though no antidumping

duties will ever actually be levied in equilibrium. The entire effect of

filing      comes in   the form   of   a threat to punish the   foreign   firm if   it    should

"misbehave         which, because it is credible, never has to be implemented.2°

       Next consider the effect of domestic antidumping law on the foreign

firm. Using (42), (56). and (51). it can be shown that



       20     If   the petitioner is taken to suffer a loss of "good standing" with
 the   ITC whenever it fails (after the initial salesat_lessthanfair.Value
determination) to withdraw a suit which is ultimately rejected in the final
determination, and if prices are set for the period by the time of the
initial sates-at-less-than-fair-value determination, then equilibrium will
have    all
         suits end in withdrawal.

In    words, if (and only if) the underlying parameters of the model are such

that antidumping law is utilized by the domestic firm (i.e.. if (58) holds

so that filing occurs in low demand states), then both domestic and foreign

firms gain from the existence of domestic antidumping law, with the home

finn gaining more (net of filing costs) than the foreign firm.

        Finally, we consider the mechanism through which the home firm gains

more than the foreign firm from the existence of domestic antidumping laws,

despite the fact that it is the home finn that must incur the filing costs

This mechanism is the shifting of cooperative market share to the domestic

fin in low demand states. To show that the domestic finn gains market

share in low demand states as a result of filing the suit, we note that,

using (54) and (5S), and substituting in (48) through (51). expression (62)

 implies that the equilibrium most cooperative market share for the domestic

 firm in low demand states, (r), satisfies

provided only that w1 >   w    (so that filing occurs in low demand states).

Since cooperative market shares are symmetric in high demand states and

symmetric in low demand states in the absence of antidumping law, (64)

implies that the filing of an antidumping suit by the domestic firm in low

demand states is accompanied by an increase in the cooperative market share

of th. domestic firm. Such a shift in market share in the presence of

antidumping suits is required in order to mitigate the incentive of the

domestic firm to defect from price cooperation as the cooperative price is

moved to the more collusive level facilitated by the suit. Hence, by

facilitating both hi&ier collusive (low-demand) prices and greater domestic

(low-demand) market share, antidumping law contains both rent-augmenting and

rent-shifting elements.

     Finally, while we have stressed the positive implications of our

analysis: it is important to note here that the rent-shifting aspect of

antidumping law is not sufficient to make it attractive as a policy for

raising the sum of the expected present discounted value of domestic

producer and consumer surplus in the industry.2' To see that this is true,

note first that the introduction of domestic antidumping law leaves

collusive capacity and collusive high-demand price unaffected, so that only

the surplus in low-demand     states   need be considered. But the introduction



         We ignore here the filing costs born by the domestic firm as well
as any resource costs associated with the ITA/ITC procedures. Such costs
would only strengthen the conclusion.

so that total market surplus (the sum of domestic consumer surplus, domestic

producer surplus, and foreign producer surplus) must decline. Hence, a

sufficient condition for the sum of domestic consumer and producer surplus

in low demand states to fall with the introduction of domestic antidumping

law is that foreign producer surplus not decline. This condition is

guaranteed by (63). Thus, in spite of the domestic rent-shifting effects of

the policy, the sum of expected discounted producer and consumer surplus at

home must decline with the introduction of domestic antidunping law.



                              IV Conclusion

     We have attempted in this paper to model the impact of domestic

antidumping law on the behavior of domestic and foreign firms that are

tacitly colluding in the domestic market. Our major conclusions can be

summarized as follows. The filing of an antidumping suit can become a

useful mechanism with which to enforce price collusion during periods when

collusion is otherwise difficult to sustain. In particular, if firms face

stochastic market demand and must install capacity before the resolution of

this uncertainty, price collusion will be most difficult to sustain in

periods of low demand, and it is in such periods that antidumping suits will

tend to arise. By reducing the incentives of the foreign firm to defect

from any collusive price, the filing of an antidumping suit by the domestic

firm allows a greater degree of collusion (a higher price) to be sustained

in low demand states, but only by shifting cooperative market share toward

the domestic firm to appease its incentive to defect. As a consequence the

introduction of antidumping law into the domestic country will result in the


                                        39
filing of suits in low-demand states, and to higher low-demand prices,

greater market share for the domestic firm in low-demand states, and greater

expected discounted profits for foreign and domestic firms alike,   all


without the imposition of a single antidumping duty. However, once domestic

consumer surplus is also considered, the domestic country must lose from the

introduction of antidumping law.

     While these results are strong and intuitive, they have come from a

model which is highly stylized and special in a number of ways. We have

simplified the analysis greatly by limiting the parameter space and

restricting our attention to i.i.d. shocks to market demand. Future

theoretical work must focus on the degree to which the strong insights whtch

emerge from this model are preserved in more general settings.

     Nevertheless. we feel that the positive predictions of even this simple

model are sufficiently rich to allow meaningful empirical exploration of the

relevance of our ideas for the workings of U.S. antidumping law in practice.

This is especially true given the sharp predictions which emerge from a

comparison of our results here with those in Staiger and Wolak (lg89)

concerning the impact of market structure in the petitioning industry on the

frequency with which antidumping petitions should end in the imposition Of

duties.   While both models predict the filing of antidumping suits in low-

demand states, in Staiger and Wolak (1988) we assume that the petitioning

 industry is perfectly competitive and find that antidumping suits against

 collusive foreign firms always end in duties, while our results here imply

 that when the petitioner is a member of the tacitly collusive

 (international) cartel the filing of antidumping suits serves a

 Eundenta1ly different purpose and antidunping duties are never actually


                                        40
imposed. Taken together, these stylized findings suggest that the frequency

with which antidumping petitions end in the imposition of duties should be

higher for more competitive petitioning industries. We hope to test the

empirical implications of these and other results in future work.
