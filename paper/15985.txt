The Contribution of Trade to Wage Inequality: The Role of Skill, Gender, and Nationality

                                              ABSTRACT

International trade has been cited as a source of widening wage inequality in industrial nations. Consistent
with this claim, we find a significant export wage premium for high-skilled workers in German manufacturing
and an export wage discount for lower skilled workers, using matched employer-employee data. Estimates
suggest that the export wage premium to high-skilled workers represents up to one third of their overall
skill premium. But, while an increase in exports increases wage inequality along the dimension of
skill, it diminishes the wage inequality associated with both gender and nationality. In this way, trade
contributes to narrowing wage gaps and mitigating wage inequality in German manufacturing.

    1. Introduction

         Manufacturing plants that export differ from those that do not along a variety of
dimensions; they are larger, more productive, more capital intensive, and, of particular
interest, pay higher wages. In an influential analysis of United States manufacturing
plants, Bernard and Jensen (1995) found a wage premium of between 7 and 11 percent in
exporting plants, controlling for a number of observable plant-level characteristics.
Subsequent work by these authors (1999, 2004) and Bernard et al. (2007) have confirmed
the exporter wage premium in the United States, while others have found evidence of an
exporter wage premium in other industrial countries, including Denmark (Munch and
Skaksen, 2008), Germany (Bernard and Wagner, 1997, who study the German Federal
State of Lower Saxony, as well as Arnold and Hussinger, 2005, and Schank, Schnabel
and Wagner, 2007), Korea (Hahn 2004), Portugal (Martins and Opromolla, 2009), Spain
(Farinas and Martin-Marcos, 2007), Sweden (Hansson and Lundin, 2004), and the United
Kingdom (Greenaway and Yu, 2004).1
         A key source of the interest in the wage differential between exporters and other
firms is that this could contribute to rising inequality in industrial countries (Krugman,
2008, Helpman, Itskhoki and Redding, 2009). Bernard and Jensen (1997) argue that
much of the rise in wage inequality in United States manufacturing in the 1980s can be
accounted for by an increase in relative labor demand by exporters, who, as compared to
non-exporting firms, employ relatively more highly skilled, non-production-line workers
as compared to lower skilled production-line workers. 2                 This argument turns on the
difference in the demand for skilled labor between exporting plants and those that do not
export, rather than differences in the exporter wage premia across skill levels.3
         These distributional effects are magnified if the export wage premium is more
pronounced for higher-skilled workers than for lower-skilled workers. For example, the
Bernard and Jensen (1997) inequality effect that occurs through an expansion of the

   Schank, Schnabel and Wagner (2007) survey these results. Interestingly, to the best of our knowledge
there is no evidence for an export wage premium in France (see for instance Kramarz, 2008, p. 25).

  Blum (2008) argues that trade played a role in rising United States wage inequality in the 1970s, but not
subsequently.
3
  Bernard and Jensen (1995) find that both production-line workers and non-production-line workers enjoy
a wage premium in plants that export as compared to those that do not export.

export sector is bolstered if the export wage premium for high-skilled workers exceeds
that of their lower skilled co-workers. There are theoretical reasons to believe that this
might, in fact, be the case. 4 Thus, an investigation of the skill structure of the export
wage premium has potentially important implications for the distributional effects of
trade.
         Most existing studies cannot speak to the skill structure of the exporter wage
premium, however, because of data limitations. Studies using plant-level data can, at
best, differentiate production-line workers from non-production-line workers. Some of
these studies find positive and significant wage premia for both non-production-line
workers and production-line workers (e.g. Bernard and Jensen 1995, 1999, 2004, Hahn
2004, Hansson and Lundin 2004 for 1990 observations), while others find a premium for
non-production-line workers only (e.g. Bernard and Wagner 1997, and Hansson and
Lundin 2004, for 1999 observations). Other, more recent, analyses use linked employer-
employee data sets. Munch and Skaksen (2008) use a Danish matched worker-firm
longitudinal data set and find that wages are higher in firms with high export intensity
and highly educated workers, but there is a lower wage premium in high-export-intensity
firms with workers who have lower levels of education. Schank, Schnabel and Wagner
(2007) use the German LIAB data set which links employee statistics to the IAB
Establishment Panel to estimate separate regressions for blue-collar and white-collar
workers while controlling for a range of individual characteristics including age, gender,
level of education, and nationality. In contrast with much of the other literature, they find
a higher export wage premium for blue collar workers than for white collar workers.
         In this paper, we investigate the skill structure of the wage premia (or discounts)
over the period 1993 – 2007 for workers employed by western German manufacturing
plants that export, using the linked employer-employee LIAB data set. This panel data
set provides us with information that enables us to characterize both workers and plants at
a level of detail that contributes importantly to the analysis. The data enables us to
construct four skill categories for workers by using information on their educational
attainment, their occupation, and the manner in which they are classified by the German

social security system. We find that there is a significant export wage premium for
workers in the two highest skill categories, and evidence of an export wage discount for
lower-skilled workers. These results are confirmed when estimating the export wage
premium across the 340 occupations defined in the data set rather than the four skill
categories we have constructed. The export wage premium for higher-skilled workers
combined with the wage discount for lower-skilled workers implies an increase in
manufacturing wage disparities with an expansion in the number of plants that export, or
with an increase in the share of exports relative to total manufacturing output.
       But while an expansion in exporting may widen inequality across skill levels,
another set of results presented in this paper shows that an increase in exports diminishes
manufacturing wage gaps due to gender or nationality. Higher-skilled women, who are
paid less than men with comparable personal characteristics in comparable plants, enjoy a
higher export wage premium than men, and there is no evidence of an export wage
discount for medium-skilled and lower-skilled women.              Likewise, higher-skilled
manufacturing workers who are not German citizens enjoy an export wage premium and
there is not a significant export wage discount for these workers either. One conjecture is
that exporting firms exhibit less wage discrimination than non-exporting firms because
they face stiffer competition, which would be consistent with Becker (1957). Thus, while
an increase in the average export share of the German economy raises wage inequality
along the dimension of skill, it lowers wage inequality along the dimensions of gender
and citizenship, and hence reduces conditional wage inequality.
       The next section of this paper introduces the matched employer-employee data set
we use and provides some statistics on workers’ skill levels and firms’ export status.
Section 3 presents estimates of the skill structure of the export wage premium.
Differences in the skill structure of the export wage premium between men and women,
and between German citizens and workers who are not citizens, are shown by the
estimates in Section 4. Section 5 offers some concluding comments.

2. Skills and Exports

           The matched employee-employer dataset on German establishments used in this
analysis combines the IAB establishment panel from the German Labor Agency with its
LIAB employee panel. 5 The matching of workers with the firms that employ them
enables us to use detailed information on workers’ skills and attributes as well as
information about firms’ international exposure. Our sample is representative for western
German manufacturing plants for the period 1993 – 2007.6 However, plants are drawn
randomly from strata of different drawing probabilities. These strata are formed along the
dimensions of region, industry and plant size class. Hence, all reported means and
estimates in this paper will be inversely weighted by their drawing probabilities. Our
dataset does not comprehensively follow individuals over time, since workers that leave
sampled plants drop out of the dataset. Still, there are a large number of individuals who
switch from one plant in the sample to another also included in the sample in our data set.
A complete data description is given in the appendix.
           In this section we describe these two dimensions of the data, and provide some
statistics for both skill levels and export share. Other variables used in the analysis are
described in Section 3.


2.1 Workers’ Skill Levels
           A worker’s skill is positively associated with educational attainment, and is also
reflected by his or her occupation. The LIAB data set includes employee information
along both of these dimensions. The educational attainment variable for each employee
differentiates among 6 categories: up to 10 years of schooling and no vocational training;
up to 10 years of schooling and vocational training; high-school degree without
vocational training; high-school degree with vocational training; college degree; and
university degree. The LIAB also identifies 340 occupations. The division of this wide
set of occupations into a much smaller set of higher-skilled and lower-skilled jobs is not
straightforward in the absence of other information. Fortunately, there is an official
German government classification system that places each occupation into one of two job
5
    Appendices A2 and A3 provide all variable definitions and includes detailed information on the data set.

    This is the area of the former Federal Republic of Germany.

categories based on the tasks required by that job; the lower-skilled category of Arbeiter
which includes occupations that employ unskilled, blue-collar workers who might have
some vocational training, and the higher-skilled category of Angestellter that includes
occupations employing master craftsmen and white-collar workers.7
        The Figure in Appendix A1 demonstrates the high correspondence between a
worker’s occupation and whether he or she is classified as an Arbeiter or an Angestellter.
For example, more than 90 percent of the workers in more than 200 of the 340
occupations are classified as either Arbeiter or an Angestellter. In contrast, fewer than 20
occupations have no more than two-thirds of their workers in either the Arbeiter or an
Angestellter category. Thus, the Arbeiter / Angestellter distinction is largely, though not
exclusively, a categorization by occupational category.
        We use the Arbeiter / Angestellter distinction, along with educational attainment,
to construct four categories of workplace skill level; low-skilled workers, medium-skilled
workers; high-skilled workers, and workers with college or university degrees (which we
call “university-educated”). The use of four skill categories, rather than the 340
occupations, allows for tractable results concerning the skill interaction with export
status.8 These four categories provide a more accurate indicator of workplace skill level
than one based solely on educational attainment. In particular, the medium-skill and high-
skill categories have the same educational attainment, but different levels of job-related
skills. These categories are also more refined than those based on the production / non-
production distinction typically used in studies based on plant-level data.
        We summarize our categorization in Table 1, and show the proportion of each
group in the sample. Low-skilled workers make up 34 percent of the sample. They have,
at most, 10 years of schooling and no vocational training, and their occupation does not
require more education than this. Workers in the medium-skilled category (35 percent of
the sample) and high-skilled category (24 percent of the sample) have a high school
degree and may have vocational training.

 More information on the Arbeiter and Angestellter categories is included in the data appendix.

 The occupation information is used in the regression analysis, however, by including the 340 occupations
as fixed effects. We also present some corroborating evidence for our skill-based findings by listing
occupations with the lowest and highest estimated conditional export wage premia.

Although workers in the last two categories may have the same level of formal education,
they are distinguished by whether their occupation is listed in the Arbeiter or Angestellter
categories. A chef, for example, could be included in the high-skilled category if his
occupation is in the Angestellter category, while a less-skilled cook would be included in
the Arbeiter category. Also, an occupation in the Angestellter category may require more
supervisory obligations than a somewhat similar occupation listed in the Arbeiter
category. Our highest skill category includes workers with college or university degrees
whose occupation is always in the Angestellter category. This category represents 7
percent of the sample.


To see that the distinctions among the 4 skill groups make sense, we calculate mean daily
gross wages (in constant 2005 euros) for 340 occupation groups, order these occupation
groups according to their mean wage from lowest to highest and plot the share of each
skill group by occupation group. The results are shown in Figure 1. Unsurprisingly, the
occupations with the highest average wages are those that have the largest share in the
two categories with the highest skills, and occupations dominated by low-skilled workers
have lower average wages. Nevertheless, there is substantial wage variation within the
four skill categories, and this justifies the use of occupation-level controls in the
regression estimates.

2.2 Plant Export Share Characteristics of Exporting Firms
Our dataset is representative for manufacturing plants in western Germany and is from
the IAB establishment panel. All fulltime workers at these plants are matched to their
place of employment in the LIAB dataset. The employer data provides information about
the international transactions for each plant, including the share of exports in its total
sales. The proportion of plants by their export share class is presented in Figure 2. This
figure shows that about 75 percent of plants do not export. However, the proportion of
employees in plants that do not export is less than 30 percent, indicating that, on average,
exporting plants have many more employees than non-exporting plants (see Figure 3).
For those 25 percent of plants that export, the export shares for the 25th, 50th, and 75th
percentiles over the sample period are presented in Figure 4. For example, the 75th
percentile export share among all exporting plants was 20 percent in 1993 and rose to
over 50 percent in 2007. The 50th and 25 th percentile export shares grew as well, roughly
doubling their values over this period.

Exporting plants differ from those that do not export along a number of dimensions; they
have more employees, pay higher wages, and have different skill compositions.
Somewhat surprisingly, not only is the share of employees with college or university
degree larger in exporting plants, but so is the share of low-skilled employees.

         Thus, the share of medium skilled employees is smaller in exporting plants than in
non-exporting plants, as shown by the statistics in Table 2.9 The focus of this paper is the
determination of wage differentials by skill category, between plants that export and
those that do not.


The regressions in Part 3 use the wages to determine the export premium, conditional on
a number of factors. Table 3 provides some initial statistics on unconditional wage
differences across categories. The wage variable represents the logarithm of average daily
gross wage of individual fulltime workers in base year 2005 Euros. 10 All worker
categories obtain larger wages on average in exporting plants, albeit the differences
across groups are considerable, ranging from 8% for medium skilled woman to 37% for
high-skilled woman.

   This could indicate that exporting might be related to job polarization, which refers a decrease in relative
demand for medium-skilled jobs (e.g. Goos and Manning, 2007, and Autor et al., 2006). To anticipate one
robustness check, our results on export wage premia are not sensitive to the inclusion of occupational time
trends that can be expected to encompass relative demand-shifts between skill-categories over time.

   The wage data of the most highly compensated employees are censored above a certain value. We follow
the methodology employed by others in imputing these wage values (e.g. Schank et al., 2007, Dustmann et
al., 2009). See the appendix for details.

3. The Skill Structure of the Trade Wage Premium

        The statistics in Table 3 indicate a substantial unconditional export wage premium
for western German manufacturing plants, a result consistent with those presented in the
published research discussed in the introduction. Of course, that research focuses on the
conditional, rather than the unconditional, export wage premium. In this section we
extend that research with our estimates of differences in the conditional wage premium
across skill levels.
        Before turning to the empirical methodology, it is worthwhile to consider the
theoretical predictions concerning the export wage premium. In many models of
international trade, exporters are distinguished from non-exporters because they have
higher levels of exogenous productivity (e.g. Dornbusch, Fischer and Samuelson 1977,
Melitz 2003). Models that seek to explain differences in wages between exporting and
non-exporting firms must also offer reasons for a lack of full labor mobility between
exporting and non-exporting firms, and reasons why exporting (i.e. higher productivity)
firms pay higher wages. Helpman, Itskhoki and Redding (2009) present a model in
which a firms’ production function includes an exogenous productivity indicator, the
number of employed workers, and the average skill level of its workforce. The inclusion
of the average skill level of the workforce in the production function results in
complementarities that are strongest for the most productive firms. Potential employees’
skills can only be gleaned through costly screening. The incentive to screen workers, and
incur the cost of doing so, is strongest among highest productivity firms because
production complementarities rise with the productivity of the firm.                  Thus, more
productive firms, the ones that find it profitable to pay a fixed price in order to export,
have workforces with the highest average ability. These workers are also more costly to
replace than lower-ability workers in less productive firm, so, through strategic
bargaining, there is an export wage premium across firms in this model.
        Extensions of this model allow for different export wage premium for workers in
different occupations within a firm. 11 In one extension of the model that allows for


11
 The export wage premium can be justified by other models that combine Melitz (2003) with some labor
market friction. We can distinguish between two strands: First, search and matching models of

                                                12
different available technologies, more productive firms choose skill-intensive
technologies that would contribute to increasing wage inequality as an economy moves
from autarky to trade. In another extension, the presence of capital that is a complement
to skilled workers, but a substitute for unskilled workers, could lead to an export wage
premium for skilled workers and an export wage discount for unskilled workers. In these
cases, an expansion of trade (in this model, the move from the autarky equilibrium to the
trade equilibrium) affects overall inequality through both changes in within-occupation
inequality and changes in between-occupation inequality. Within-occupation inequality
rises with a move from autarky to trade, while between-occupation inequality may rise or
fall. Thus, within this framework, the overall link between expanding trade and between-
occupation inequality becomes an empirical question.
         Our method for addressing this empirical question using the data set that includes
linked employer-employee data augments a regression specification that estimates the
effect of trade status on wages by distinguishing this effect by skill level. Before
considering estimates based on that approach, it is useful to first consider the simpler
specification that estimates the overall export wage premium,
                                     4
            ln Wi , j ,t   X j ,t           Z   Si   Z ,t   I i ,t        Pj ,t   t   Fi , j    i , j ,t      [1]
                                    Z 2

where the dependent variable is the logarithm of Wi,j,t, which is introduced in Table 3 and
represents the average daily gross wage of worker i who is employed at plant j in year t.
The export wage premium in this specification is , which shows the effect on wages of
the share of exports in total revenue of plant j in year t, X j ,t                             0,1 (X j,t = 0 if plant j does

not export in year t). An individual’s skill level is captured by the dummy variables in
the three element vector Si         Z ,t   , where Z = 2 for medium-skilled, 3 for high-skilled, and 4


unemployment with individual or collective wage bargaining are proposed for instance by Felbermayr, Prat
and Schmerer (2010) and - as discussed above - by Helpman, Itskhoki and Redding (2009). The second
strand of the literature argues that firms are willing to pay higher than market-clearing wages, i.e. efficiency
wages, for one of two reasons. On the one hand, any wage that falls short of being perceived as fair would
reduce a worker’s effort. In this spirit, Amiti and Davis (2008) and Egger and Kreickemeier (2009) explain
the export wage premium with a fair-wage model, whereby the fair wage level depends on firm profitability
and its export status. On the other hand, if a worker has distaste for effort and firms imperfectly monitor
workers’ efforts, higher wages make the threat of being fired when caught shirking more credible. Davis
and Harrigan (2007) offer a shirking model, where the costs of monitoring the workers’ efforts differ across
firms. If a worker’s effort is more valuable to or less perfectly monitored by an exporting firm, this model
will also offer an underlying mechanism for an export wage premium.

                                                                     13
for university educated (low-skilled is the omitted dummy). Other individual
characteristics are represented by the vector Ij,t and include the logarithm of experience,
the logarithm of tenure, and dummy variables for gender and German citizenship. 12
Plant-level characteristics other than export share, represented by the vector Pj,t, include
the logarithm of number of employees as well as further characteristics of the
establishment.13 Time fixed effects are represented by             t   . A list of variable definitions of
firm and employee control variables is given in Appendix A2.
        The regression specification includes other fixed effects as well, as represented by
Fi,j. Tables 4 and 5 offer estimates based on different types of fixed effects specifications.
Plant fixed effects, denoted P in the tables below, control for unobserved, non-time-
varying differences in exporting plants as compared to non-exporting plants (this is
equivalent to including J-1 plant-specific dummy variables if there are J plants).14 These
fixed effects do not control for time-varying differences in occupational composition
between exporting plants and other plants. We can control for occupation fixed effects,
and allow for the possibility that occupations affect wages differently across plants,
through the inclusion of plant-occupation fixed effects (which, with 340 occupation
categories, effectively introduces a possible maximum of [(J×340) – 1] dummy variables,
although the actual number used will be many fewer because each firm does not have the
full set of all possible occupations). This specification is denoted as P×O.15                    A third

12
   Experience is measured as the number of days since the worker’s entry into employment, and tenure is
measured as the number of days since the worker’s entry into his or her current position.
13
   The vector Pj,t includes a number of dummy variables. One indicates the presence of a work council at a
plant; workers at plants with more than 20 employees have the right to establish a work council to represent
their interests, although they are not obliged to do so. Two other dummy variables indicate whether a plant
represents the entire company (Single Plant Company), and another indicating whether the plant belongs to
a Holding Company – thus, the omitted category is a headquarter plant in a multi-plant company. In
addition, some regressions also include a dummy variable that equals 1 if managers self-assess their plant
as operating at the technological frontier for its industry.
14
   Identification of the export wage premium in a regression that includes some type of plant-level fixed
effect is through changes in the export share for individuals across time, including changes in the export
share for workers in a particular plant as well as movements of workers from a plant with one value of the
export share to another plant with a different value. In contrast, in an OLS regression with no plant-level
fixed effects, unobserved plant differences that are associated with both higher productivity and a
propensity to export will appear as an export wage premium. Thus, we would expect a higher estimated
export wage premium in estimates that do not control for unobserved plant-level effects since exporting is
correlated with higher productivity. Likewise, we would expect a higher estimated export wage premium
in regressions using establishment-level data. Results presented below suggest this is, in fact, the case.
15
    The use of 340 narrowly-defined occupations as controls is one way in which this analysis is
distinguished from others who use much broader occupation classifications, such as Munch and Skaksen

                                                    14
option would be to control for individual fixed effects and plant fixed effects. Abowd,
Kramarz and Margolis (1999) show that the failure to control for unobserved individual
and firm heterogeneity can lead to a substantial estimation bias. It is well known that the
underlying assumption – apart from the usual exogeneity of explanatory variables – is
random sorting conditional on time-invariant person and firm effects.16 An even more
general specification is one that includes person-firm spell-effects, which controls
additionally for unobservable match-specific productivity effect.17 This is denoted P×I,
and is equivalent to including a full set of interaction terms between plant and individual
dummy variables. With spell-fixed effects P×I, the export wage premia are identified
exclusively from workers changing their wages over time while staying in one and the
same plant that changes its export share over time. Instead, when controlling for person-
and firm-specific effects such as in Abowd, Kramarz and Margolis (1999), the wage
premia of exporting may additionally be identified through workers switching from
plants with low export share to plants with high export share or vice versa. For example,
if there is self-sorting such that workers who learned a lot in their previous job moved to
firms with larger export share, then the wage premia would be overestimated, picking up
unobservable learning – something that does not affect the estimates if using worker-firm
spell effects P×I. For this reason, we will report results from worker-firm spell effects
rather than firm- and worker-fixed effects.18, 19


(2008) who have 9 occupational dummy variables, and Schank et al. (2007) who include a single dummy
variable to distinguish master craftsmen or foremen from other blue-collar workers.
16
   Solon (1988), Gibbons and Katz (1992), and Winter-Ebmer and Zweimüller (1999), among others, stress
that random sorting conditional on observables and time-invariant fixed effects might be too strong an
assumption and self-selection of workers leads to inconsistent estimates. Frias, Kaplan and Verhoogen
(2009) attempt to control for time-variant individual effects and do not find evidence for sorting on
individual ability playing a significant role in explaining the export wage premium of Mexico (when also
relaxing the assumption that the explanatory variable of interest is exogenous allowing it to be
predetermined).
17
   Woodcock (2008) derives match-specific wage components in a wage regression on employee-employer
matched data from a rent-sharing model with match-specific productivity and discusses the identification
conditions of the spell estimator. Andrews et al. (2008) discussed worker-firm spell-effects before, which
were also applied in Schank, Schnabel, and Wagner (2007) and Munch and Skaksen (2008) in the context
of estimating the average export wage premium.
18
   However, we have also estimated a specification with worker- and firm-fixed effects along the lines of
Abowd, Creecy and Kramarz (2002), where standard errors were calculated by a plant-clustered bootstrap,
and results turned out to be very similar to the estimates with firm- and worker-spell effects. The same is
true for a specification using individual but not plant fixed effects.
19
   Estimates may still be asymptotically biased if there is self-sorting of workers such that worker-specific
unobservable wage components grow faster in firms the export shares of which grow faster. This may be

                                                    15
         Table 4 presents estimates of , as well as the other coefficients in Equation 1, for
four specifications that differ in their treatment of fixed effects. In each case, the export
wage premium coefficient is significant at better than the 99 percent level of confidence.
This coefficient is 0.064 when no fixed effects are included, which yields an export wage
premium of 3.2 percent at the median value of export share of 0.5 (this median is based
only on the set of firms that export). This is less than half the value that has been
reported in work based on plant-level data. One explanation for this discrepancy is that
these regressions, unlike those based on plant-level observations, control for individual
characteristics. This explanation is supported by an estimate from a regression using the
same set of observations but only including the logarithm of plant employment and year
dummy variables as additional regressors (not shown in Table 4). In this regression, the
coefficient on export share is 0.153 (with a standard error of 0.016), so the estimated
export wage premium for a firm with the median level of exports is nearly 8 percent.
This value is within the range reported in Bernard and Jensen (1996).
         The fixed effects estimates of the export wage premium presented in columns 2
through 4 of Table 4 are striking for two reasons. First, they are all much smaller than
the estimate obtained with OLS, with values about one-fourth as big. This is consistent
with an important role played by unobserved plant-level fixed effects linked to both
productivity and exporting. Second, once we control for unobserved plant-level effects,
there is little marginal effect on estimated values of             obtained by controlling for either
unobserved occupational effects or unobserved individual effects.                          Each of the
coefficients in the second through fourth columns of the table is between 0.016 and 0.018.
This suggests that it is unobserved plant level effects, rather than unobserved occupation
effects or unobserved individual effects, which are correlated with characteristics that
affect both the export share of a plant and the overall wage premium to workers in plants
that export.




the case, for example, if workers increase their productivity through learning or inventions, rendering the
firm more competitive internationally, the rents from which are shared with the workers. While we are not
aware of any methodology that allows circumvent this potential source of bias, it may be limited in practice.
To see this, learning effects are monotonically increasing productivity of workers while the export share of
single firms fluctuates considerably over time, such that the correlation between them is probably quite
small.

The overall export wage premia reported in Table 4 could be masking differences in
wage premia across skill levels – indeed, the existence of these differences is the focus of
this paper. To investigate this possibility, we estimate a modified version of Equation [1]




                                                17
that includes interactions between each of the four skill levels and export share, rather
than a single export share variable.20 The specification we use is
                          4                                      4

where all variables are defined as above. The four estimated skill-specific export wage
premium in this equation are                             L    (low-skilled),              M      (medium-skilled),                     H   (high-skilled) and
 U   (university educated). The three skill coefficients,                                                    M,    H       and        U,   represent the skill
premia relative to the low-skilled group that are not associated with exporting. As with
the estimation of Equation [1], we allow for different types of fixed effects estimation of
Equation [2].21 The three panels of Table 5 correspond to estimates using the plant (P),
plant-occupation (P×O), and plant-individual (P×I) fixed effects, respectively.
          Estimates of Equation [2] coefficients                                          L,       M,    H   and       U,   as well as                    M,      H   and     U,

are reported in Table 5. In addition, the table includes tests of the pairwise differences
among all four export wage premium coefficients. These are presented as the difference
of the higher-skilled category minus the lower-skilled category, so a positive value
indicates an increasing wage gap with an expansion of exports. These differences can be
interpreted as export-induced skill premia.
          Results presented in Table 5 show that, with each of the three fixed effects
specifications, each of the three                              coefficients are significant at better than the 99 percent
level of confidence, with values rising with skill level. Three of the four coefficients are
significant with each fixed effects specification at better than the 99 percent level of
confidence, with                H    and         U   significant in all three cases,                              M    significant with plant fixed
effects and plant-occupation fixed effects, and                                                L    significant with plant-individual fixed
effects. Also, in all three sets of estimates,                                        U   >         H   and both are greater than                                 L   and    M,

although        M     >    L    with plant-individual fixed effects only. The right side of each panel
shows that five of the six differences between pairs of the                                                        coefficients are significant at
better than the 95 percent level of confidence. The linear combination                                                                                    U   –       H   is not

   Schank, Schnabel and Wagner (2007) take a different approach and estimate separate regressions for
each of their two categories of workers.

   While results presented in Table 4 may be viewed as indicating the use of occupation or individual fixed
effects is unimportant, given their marginal role in altering estimates of , there could be an important
difference between the effect of occupation and individual fixed effects on estimates of the overall export
premium, in Equation [1], and their effects on the four skill-specific export wage premia in Equation [2].

significant with plant fixed effects, but significant at the 99 and 90 percent level of
confidence for the plant-occupation and plant-individual fixed effects, respectively.

The interpretation of the estimates presented in Table 5 is facilitated by Figure 5. This
figure plots the export wage premium for each of the four groups of workers as a function
of the export share. The intercept of each line represents the respective              coefficients


                                                19
(with      L   = 0 since the low-skill dummy is omitted in this specification). Differences in
the values of the intercept show the skill wage premium, relative to low-skilled workers,
for firms that do not export. The slope of each line represents the respective semi-

                                                                                                     ln Wi , j ,t
elasticity of wages with respect to the export share in total revenue, that is,
                                                                                                       X j ,t       Z

where Z=L, M, H, or U. These semi-elasticities may be positive or negative.
As drawn, the figure presents an export wage discount, rather than an export wage
premium, for medium-skilled workers and low-skilled workers which, as will be shown,
is consistent with most of the estimates presented in this paper.




Table 6 includes five sets of relevant results that can be calculated from the estimates in
Table 5.22 Panel I presents the export wage premium at various values of the export share.
This is represented in Figure 5 as, for example, the vertical distance between the point E
and the line denoted          U   representing the wage premium for university educated workers
in a plant that is in the 75th percentile of the export share distribution. The value
associated with this based on the regression estimates is                U    X 75th .

22
     These estimates are based on the results from the specification with firm-worker spell effects in Table 5.

         Panel I of Table 6 shows that the export wage premium is negative for low-skilled
and medium-skilled workers (although it is not statistically significant for medium-skilled
workers – the statistical significance of the results in Panel I depend upon the statistical
significance of each of the four respective              coefficients). The estimated export wage
premia are positive for high-skilled and university-educated workers. The export wage
premia for university-educated workers, which range from 3.24 percent for workers in
firms at the 25th percentile of export share to 7.02 percent for workers in firms at the 75 th
percentile of export share, are more than double that of high-skilled workers at respective
percentiles of export share.
         Panel II of Table 6 reports the proportion of the overall wage premium for a given
skill group that is due to the export wage premium at the 25th, 50 th, and 75th percentile
values of export share.23 As an example of this from Figure 5, consider the export wage
premium relative to the overall wage premium for university-trained workers in the 75 th
percentile of export shares. This is represented by the vertical distance between the point
E and the line denoted       U   relative to the vertical distance from the horizontal axis to point
E. In terms of the regression coefficients, this is

                                          U    X 75th                        .
                                                         U      U   X 75th
The statistics presented in Panel II show that the export wage premium is an important
component of the overall wage premium. For example, it is a fifth of the wage premium
for university-educated workers in firms at the 50 th percentile of export share, and one-
quarter for these workers who are employed in firms at the 75th percentile of export share.
The comparable values for high-skilled workers are 24.4 percent and 29.6 percent. The
export wage premium mitigates the overall premium for medium-skilled workers,
reducing it by up to 27.2 percent for workers in firms at the 75 th percentile of export share.
         The calculations in the first two panels of Table 6 reflect wage premia relative to
low-skilled workers at firms that do not export. Panels III, IV, and V offer pairwise
differences across all four categories of workers at firms with comparable levels of


23
  These premia are relative to low-skilled workers at firms that do not export. Thus, the only premium for
low-skilled workers is through the export wage premium and, for that reason, the export wage premium
represents 100 percent of their wage premium – for this reason, calculations for low-skilled workers are not
included in this panel.

                                                    22
exports. Panel III presents the pairwise differences in export wage premia at the 25th, 50 th,
and 75th percentile values of export share. 24 These can be illustrated by considering
Figure 5 where, for example, the difference in the export wage premium for university-
educated workers as compared to medium-skilled workers at the 75 th percentile of export
share is ((E –     U)   – (G –   M)).   The corresponding value from the regression coefficients
is    U      M     X 75th . The results in this panel exhibit substantial skill premia within
plants due to exporting. For example, the export wage premium of university-educated
workers relative to low-skilled workers, medium-skilled workers, and high-skilled
workers at a plant at the 75th percentile of export share is 8.4 percent, 7.3 percent, and 3.6
percent, respectively, and high-skilled workers have a premium of 4.8 percent over low-
skilled workers and 3.7 percent over medium-skilled workers.
          Panel IV shows that the values in Panel III, which represent the wage premia
associated with exporting, represent substantial proportions of the pairwise differences in
the respective overall wage premia across skill levels. The results in this panel are
comparable to those in Panel II, although there the comparison group is exclusively low-
skilled workers in firms that do not export and, in Panel IV, comparisons are made across
skill groups in plants with a common level of export share. For example, a representative
statistics in Panel IV is that of high-skilled workers as compared to medium-skilled
workers at the 75 th percentile of export share.                  The difference in the export wage
premium, relative to the difference in the overall wage premium, for this pair is
                                  X 75th
                        U   M                                                         100%
                                             U      M         U      M     X 75 th

As shown in this panel, the differences in the export wage premia represent a substantial
proportion of the pairwise differences in the overall wage premia. At the median value of
export share, the export-induced skill premia represents about one-third of the overall
skill premia of high-skilled workers and university-educated workers relative to medium-
skilled workers, and almost one-quarter of the overall skill premium of university-
educated workers to high-skilled workers.

24
  The statistics in this table are export wage premia of workers of one skill-level versus another where both
skill levels are at a plant with a common export share. Thus, the export wage premium relative to low
skilled workers exceeds that in Panel I since those statistics are for low-skilled workers in a plant that does
not export and there is a negative export wage premium for low-skilled workers.

                                                      23
          The final panel of Table 6 shows how a change in export share affects the wage
gap between workers at two different skill levels. These statistics represent the
percentage point change in export-induced skill premia due to a change in the export
share from the 25th percentile level to the 75 th percentile level. As shown in Panel V, a
change of this magnitude increases the difference between university-educated workers
and low-skilled workers by 4.5 percentage points, and between medium-skilled workers
and low-skilled workers by 4.0 percentage points. The effects are smaller for the
difference in wages between high-skilled workers and medium-skilled workers (2.0
percentage points) or low-skilled workers (2.6 percentage points). Each of the estimates
in Panel V are statistically significant at better than the 95 percent level of confidence but
for that between high-skilled and university-educated workers, which is significant at
better than the 90 percent level of confidence.
          We next provide a further disaggregation of the export wage premia by moving
beyond an analysis based on 4 different skill groups to one in which we interact each of
340 occupation dummies with the export share, obtaining a different estimated export
wage premium for each of these occupations, as shown in
                     340                              4

We observe that workers in the lowest wage centiles have a wage discount. The wage
discount decreases as we move to higher wage centiles, with a switch from a wage
discount to a wage premium at about the 55 th centile.
                             An impression of the type of occupations most affected by exporting is provided
in Table 7. This table reports the ten occupations with the highest export wage premia
and the ten occupations with the largest export wage discounts (among those occupations

25
  The estimates presented here of the conditional effect of exporting on wage inequality may be biased
downwards. Our estimates of the effect of exporting on wage inequality are based on an assumption that
these effects operate only on German manufacturing firms that are expanding their exports. However, it is
reasonable to also assume that the occupational wage structure in firms that do not export, and in firms with
constant levels of exports, are influenced by changes in firms which are expanding exports. If this is the
case, these general equilibrium effects violate the stable unit treatment value assumption under which wage
effects from export expansion are confined to those firms alone. The violation of this assumption means
that our estimates are a lower bound of the actual effect of exporting on wage inequality. Dustmann et al.
(2009) apply the same caveat to their results.

                                                                          25
that have at least 20,000 observations in the population to ensure economic significance
of these effects).    We also report the predominant skill group for each of these
occupations.

 Note: Based on results from Table 5, Panel C, plant-individual fixed effects, at least 20,000
 employees per occupation; all reported coefficients on wage premia/discounts are significant
 at least at the 95 percent confidence level.


The range of export wage premia and discounts is quite considerable, ranging from a
discount of more than 10% for wood preparers to wage premia of up to 20% for
entrepreneurs and managing directors. The occupations with the highest estimated export
wage premium include several engineering disciplines, business and management, and
qualified technicians – all among the two highest skill categories. Those occupations with



                                              26
the highest estimated export wage discount include several types of manual workers and
service personal – all among the two lowest skill categories.
        To sum up, the results in Table 6 and 7 show that differences in the export wage
premium represent an important proportion of the overall difference in wages across skill
levels and can be quite significant for important occupation groups. The manner in
which the export wage premium increases with the skill level suggests that this
contributes to wage inequality across skill groups. But, as will be shown in Section 5,
exporting firms serve to diminish wage inequality along the dimensions of gender and
citizenship.


4. Robustness

        In this section we investigate the robustness of our results with respect to an
alternative hypothesis, that exporting merely serves as a proxy for firm productivity, and
that workers share the rents generated in higher-productivity firms. We first test for the
robustness of the results presented above to this explanation of the skill structure of the
export wage premium by augmenting, in three separate specifications, the estimating
equation used in Panel C of Table 5 with the interaction of each of the 4 skill groups with
three different proxies for productivity; sales, value added, and average labor
productivity.26 Table 8 presents these results, with the three various productivity proxies
in columns 2, 3, and 4 and, for sake of comparison, the benchmark specification from
Panel C of Table 5 in column 1. As shown in this table, the skill-based export wage
discount for low-skilled workers and the export wage premia for high-skilled and
university-educated workers remain significant and largely unchanged with the inclusion
of any of these three other sets of interaction terms.

         Our results are also robust to the inclusion of an interaction of the export share
with a variable that represents the self-assessment by firms of whether they operate at the
technology frontier. These results are presented in column 5 of Table 8, and show that
the export premium for high-skilled workers, and, to a somewhat lesser extent, to
university-educated workers, remains with the inclusion of the additional four interaction
terms (notably, none of which are significant), although the wage discount for low-skilled
workers is no longer significant. An alternative specification interacts the four skill
levels with a dummy variable that equals 1 if a firm has implemented either a new
technology or a new product in the previous two years (Z=tech/prod). These results show
a larger wage premium for high-skilled and university-educated workers than the baseline
case (and again, none of the new interactions are significant). Finally, in the last column
of Table 8, we allow each occupation to have a different linear time trend on top of
person- and firm spell effects. This specification is meant to capture long-run trends in
shifts of relative labor demand by occupation through technological change. The export
wage premium profile is not confined to high-tech firms or firms that introduce new
products or technology and it is not reflecting long-run time trends of occupations.27 The
estimated export skill premia in this case are very close to those in the baseline scenario,
both quantitatively and in terms of significance.


5. Gender, Nationality, and Export Wage Premia

         Economic theory suggests that discrimination is a luxury that is more difficult to
indulge in a competitive environment than in one where firms enjoy greater market power
(Becker 1957).28 Various types of evidence support this prediction. Black and Strahan
(2001) find that female wages declined less than male ones in the aftermath of the U.S.
banking regulation, starting in the mid 1970s and increased product market competition
reduced wage discrimination in this sector. Similarly, Black and Brainard (2004)

27
   The low-skilled wage premium shows up insignificantly when controlling for the technology interactions.
However, these specifications are misspecified by inclusion of irrelevant variables since none of the
technology interactions is significant. It is well known that this leads to efficiency loss of estimates which
may be responsible for the insignificant low-wage export premia in these two specifications.
28
   For a review on the gender wage gap and the theories of wage discrimination see for instance Altonji and
Blank (1999), Blau and Kahn (2000) or Weichselbaumer and Winter-Ebmer (2007).

                                                     29
document that exogenous, comparably-sized increases in trade in United States
manufacturing sectors led to a more rapid narrowing of the gender wage gap in
concentrated industries than in more competitive industries. Oostendorp (2009) analyzes
the impact of globalization on the gender wage gap for large cross-section of countries
and reports that gender wage discrimination decreases with economic development and
trade.29
               Following this reasoning, and given this evidence, we may expect to find less
wage discrimination in German manufacturing firms that export and face keener
competition from abroad than among those firms that are insulated from world markets.
In this section we show that exporting firms indeed pay more to women and workers who
are not German citizens than non-exporting firms. These two groups of workers earn less
than comparably-skilled males or German citizens, conditional on individual and firm
characteristics. Thus, while exporting firms contribute to wage inequality across skill
categories, the results in this section show that these exporting firms narrow wage gaps
across gender, and even eliminate wage gaps across citizenship status.
               These conclusions are based on analyses that modify the specification used in the
previous section to allow for differences in the overall wage premium, as well as the
export wage premium by skill levels, depending upon, in one case, whether an individual
is a woman, or, in another case, if a person is not a German citizen (foreigner, for short).

                     Woman
As shown in the      Z       column of the top panel, there is a large shortfall in conditional
wages for women in plants that do not export, ranging from 17.5 percent for medium-
skilled workers to 30.3 percent for high-skilled workers. This difference is smaller
(though still present) in plants that export. As shown in the second panel, women
working in a plant that exports are estimated to have higher wages than those who work
in non-exporting plants across all four skill groups, and this difference is statistically
significant for low-skilled, high-skilled, and university-educated women. This contrasts
with the wage discounts for low and medium skilled men that is evident from the                                 Z

column of the top panel. High-skilled women have an export wage premium that is
statistically distinct from that of high-skilled men, and more than twice as large (0.077 vs.
0.034). The conditional wage shortfall faced by women is notably smaller in plants with
large export shares than in plants that do not export. The conditional wage shortfall for
university-educated women is 27 percent smaller in plants that have an export share in
the 75 th percentile, and 21 percent smaller in plants with the median export share, as
compared to plants that do not export. Comparable statistics for high-skilled women are
17 percent and 13 percent, and for Low-skilled women the statistics are 20 percent and 15
percent.     Thus, exporting plants mitigate, but do not eliminate, gender-based wage
discounts across skill levels.

Foreigners also face a conditional wage shortfall, although it is not as large as the one
faced by women, and it is not statistically significant across all skill groups (see Table 10).
At plants that do not export, there is a statistically significant wage discount of 2 percent
for medium-skilled workers and high-skilled workers (significant at the 90 percent level
for the latter), and of 3 percent for university-educated workers (also significant at the 90
percent level), but there is no evidence of a significant wage discount for low-skilled
workers. Medium-skilled foreign workers, unlike their German counterparts, do not
suffer an export wage discount, and university-educated foreigners have an export wage
premium 75 percent higher than that of German citizens. High-skilled foreigners have an
export wage premium 88 percent higher than that of German citizens, although in this
case the difference is statistically significant at better than the 90 percent (but less than
the 95 percent) level of confidence.

The statistically significant wage shortfall for foreign workers at plants that do not export
is eliminated for high-Skilled workers and university-educated workers at plants that have
an export share at the 25 th percentile or greater, and medium-skilled workers at plants at
the 75 th percentile or greater. The wage shortfall is actually reversed, and university-
educated foreign workers earn higher conditional wages than their German counterparts,
at plants where the export share is at the 75th percentile or higher.


6. Conclusion

       International competition has been long been cited in debates on the sources of
rising wage inequality. In this paper, we argue that it is important to consider inequality
along several dimensions. Our use of a linked employer-employee data base enables us
to examine how wages in exporting plants differ from wages in plants that do not export
for workers at different skill levels, as well as for workers who are members of groups


                                              33
that have traditionally been the subjects of discrimination. As with other research, we
find evidence of an export wage premium. Our work is distinguished from previous
research, however, by our identification of differences in the export wage premium
across skill groups. Lower skilled workers in German manufacturing are shown to have
an export wage discount while higher skilled workers have an export wage premium.
This is a source of conditional wage inequality within exporting plants, and exacerbates
inequality between exporters and non-exporters. But while the exporting / non-exporting
distinction contributes to conditional wage inequality along the dimension of skill, it
reduces gender-based and nationality-based conditional wage inequality in ways that are
both statistically significant and economically meaningful. Thus, the overall effect of
exporting on inequality is somewhat ambiguous; production complementarities contribute
to skill-based inequality while stronger competition reduces gender or nationality-based
inequality.

Appendix A3: The Matched IAB – LIAB data set.
The IAB establishment panel is a stratified sample of all establishments in the entire
economy over the years 1993 until 2007.31 Strata consist of category cells by region
(Länder), industry and firm size, and each cell has its own drawing probability. Drawing
probabilities vary between 90% for establishments with more than 1000 employees
contributing to the social security system, and about 0.1% for establishments with less
than 5 employees contributing to the social security system. Unless otherwise noted, we
always adjust our statistics and regressions for these different drawing probabilities by
applying inverse probability weighted estimators and means.
        Matching of the IAB establishment data with the LIAB employee data occurs
through the use of an establishment identifier. The LIAB data set is based on obligatory
reporting by employers, and it includes essentially the entire population of the German
workforce. At least once a year, employers report employment, biographical and wage
information on each employee contributing to the social security system (the IAB data
were originally constructed as spell data in the “Beschäftigten-Leistungsempfänger-
Historik-Datei,” on which the German social security system is based). The IAB selects
from the “Beschäftigten-Leistungsempfänger-Historik-Datei” all those employees that
were employed on June 30 of each year in one of the establishments contained in the IAB
establishment panel. There are several observations for a person in one year, if this
person holds several jobs (only one of which needs to be in an IAB establishment panel
plant) or obtains some government support via the social security system besides her
wage. Overall, the IAB identifies 77 different types of spells, including leaving a
company, starting a new job, going on unpaid sabbatical, registering as unemployed and
obtaining unemployment benefits, and taking a second job. An employee disappears
from the data set if he or she becomes unemployed, shifts to an establishment outside of
the IAB establishment panel, or if his or her establishment stops responding to the IAB
establishment panel.
        The dependent variable in our analysis is the logarithm of the employer-reported
average daily gross wage, a value that includes extraordinary allowances. Its value in a
particular year is for the annual reporting spell that includes June 30 of that year, or
aggregated over all sub-annual spells including the one that includes June 30 of that year.
Wages, as well as all other nominal variables, are deflated using the GDP deflator (from
SVR). There is upper censoring of wage data because employees are not obliged to
contribute any share of their income above the censoring level to the public pension
system. Employers report the censoring level of the wage instead of its true value,
however, this is a very high wage. For example, in 2003 the censoring level was €167.5
per day, and only 7.2% of all workers had a wage at this level or higher. We follow the
imputation procedure of Gartner (2005) to correct for censoring by replacing the reported
wage with the predicted value from a tobit estimation that regresses log daily wages on
education level, gender, experience, experience squared, tenure, nationality and a dummy
for West Germany separately for each year. Importantly, imputation does not use
31
  A description of the IAB establishment data is found in Bellmann (2002). The participation is voluntary.
However, the data collection is conducted by professional interviewers and the answer rate is very high (up
to 80%). Whenever the managers of a plant cease to answer the survey, that plant is replaced by a random
draw from the same stratum. If an establishment has not answered and drops out, then it may be drawn
again into a sample after a certain period of years. It obtains a new identifier number in this case.

                                                    38
establishment information such as export status of the establishment. The imputation is
done on LIAB alone (not excluding non-manufacturing employees at this stage to ensure
comparability of our results with those of previous studies).
        Missing values of an employee’s education data is imputed following
Fitzenberger et al. (2005). Specifically, missing values of an employee’s education level
are imputed from the information on the education level in previous or following years of
the same person from age 19 to 28 onwards, depending on the level of education.
Information on vocational training is imputed from a separate question on occupational
position (“Stellung im Beruf”). If there are several observations per worker and year,
wages are added up and the observations are aggregated to one observation per employee
and year.
        When matching establishment and employee data, the IAB is unable to match
about 6% of all establishments (Jacobebbinghaus, 2008). This may be the case if there is
a change in the ownership of a plant. Then IAB establishment panel keeps the old plant
identification number while a new one may be assigned to the LIAB data. Moreover, if
there are several plants at the same address (e.g. holding company headquarter and
production site), the plants are often aggregated to represent one unit in the IAB
establishment panel if it appears economically as one unit to the interviewer and the
separation is only for legal reasons. This would result in a mismatch in the size of the
IAB establishment panel plant and the number of employees from LIAB assigned to it.
For this reason, we exclude all establishments, where the number of reported full time
employees from the IAB establishment panel deviate by more than 30 per cent from the
corresponding number in LIAB for establishments with more than 50 full-time employees
or by more than 10 employees for establishments with less than 50 employees, which is
common practice for this dataset (Jacobebbinghaus, 2008). This eliminates another
roughly 9% of all establishments.
        Then, we exclude all part-time workers, home workers, observations with one-
time income (e.g. contract for work and services “Werkvertrag”), interns, workers during
vocational training or retraining, and all observations with a wage per day of less than €
21.36 (or € 2.67 per hour assuming an 8 hour day), which would be well below the social
security aid if choosing not to work. This excludes roughly 20% of the remaining
observations. We also perform consistency checks and exclude all observations when
either the beginning of the work spell or the beginning of an employee’s employment
occurs after the year of the survey. We also correct information on education when the
education variable and the variable of occupational position (Stellung im Beruf) give
contradictory information on whether a worker is uneducated. In this case, we give
preference to the occupational position information, since it refers to the skill needed for
the current occupation.
        Finally, we select all observations of West-German manufacturing firms. We
exclude East German plants, because they were not surveyed in the first years of the
sample period.
