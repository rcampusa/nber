       We study the dynamics of price indices for major U.S. cities using panel econometric
methods and find that relative price levels among cities mean revert at an exceptionally slow rate.
In a panel of 19 cities from 1918 to 1995, we estimate the half-life of convergence to be
approximately nine years. These estimates provide an upper bound on speed of convergence that
participants in European Monetary Union are likely to experience. The surprisingly slow rate of
convergence can be explained by a combination of the presence of transportation costs, differential
speeds of adjustment to small and large shocks, and the inclusion of non-traded good prices in the
overall price index.

Introduction
    Do prices in major U.S. cities share a common trend, and if so, how quickly do they
revert to that trend following a local shock to the price level? To answer this question, we
study the dynamics of consumer price indices for 19 major U.S. cities over the period from
1918 to 1995. The panel time-series methods we employ are now commonly used for studying
real output growth rates and levels of real exchange rates across countries. We estimate that
price level divergences across U.S. cities are temporary, but surprisingly persistent, with a
half-life of nearly 9 years.
    Our research has two primary motivations. First, we hope to gain a better understanding
of the sources of persistence in the deviations .from purchasing power parity (PPP) found
in studies of national price levels and exchange-rate data. Second, and more importantly,
we see the European Monetary Union as having many similarities to the United States, and
believe that studying the behavior of prices across U.S. cities will help us in understanding
the likely nature of price-level convergence in the Euro area. The European Central Bank's
stated inflation objective is a year-on-year change in the Harmonized Index of Consumer
Prices (HICP) of not more than two percent. But how large might we expect regional
deviations from this Euro-area-wide average to be, and how long are they likely to persist?
    The lack of data prevents us from answering this question directly using European prices
under monetary union. Instead, we look to the United States, a mature common currency
area of similar regional diversity, size and industrial development, to estimate the degree of
relative price dispersion and the rate of convergence that we expect to see within the Euro
area.
    The primary antecedents to our work are to be found in the literature comparing price
movements across international borders. When examined over the post-1973 period of float-
ing exchange rates, pairwise comparisons of countries using univariate methods typically do
not reject of the hypothesis that deviations from PPP contain a unit root, implying that
some portion of their variation is driven by a random walk.' This result implies that inflation
diffetEentials between countries, measured in terms of a common currency, can persist indefi-

   'For excellent surveys on the literature up through the early 1990s, see Bruer (1994) and Froot and
Rogoff (1995).

                                                  1
nitely or, equivalently, that the common currency price level in one country can deviate from
that in another by an arbitrarily large amount. Recently, researchers employing multivariate
tests that combine numerous countries in panel unit-root testing procedures have rejected
the unit-root hypothesis, implying that relative prices revert to a common mean. However,
the rate at which this mean reversion occurs is evidently quite slow. Consensus estimates of
the half-life of a deviation from PPP range between 4 and 5 years [Abuaf and Jorion (1990),
Frankel and Rose (1986), Wu (1986), MacDonald (1996), Papell (1997), Lothian (1997) and

Wei and Parsley (1995)]. This finding leads us to our first question: To what extent do these
international results hold for regions within a common currency area? Our prior expectation
is that we would observe more rapid price convergence across regions withhi a single coun-
try than across countries, since withinâ€”country markets for products, labor, and capital are
presumably better integrated.
   International PPP researchers have suggested a number of explanations for incomplete
relative price-level adjustment. These include: i) trade barriers, such as tariffs and quotas;
ii) non-tariff barriers, including the bureaucratic difficulties of establishing foreign distribu-
tion systems for traded goods; iii) the failure of nominal exchange rates to adjust to relative
price-level shocks; iv) firms exercising local monopoly power through differential pricing to
segmented markets; v) sticky nominal price-level adjustment arising from imperfectly com-
petitive product markets where price changes are costly; vi) transportation costs associated
with moving goods from one region to another; and, vii) the presence of non-traded goods in
the general price level and the potential for differential growth in the level and efficiency of
factors used in their production.2 Some combination all of these factors is likely to impede
adjustment toward PPP, as it seems improbable that any one factor in isolation is sufficiently
important to explain the slow convergence.3

   2Wei and Parsley (1995) find that deviations from PPP are positively related to nominal exchange-rate
volatility (item iii), Engel and Rogers (1995) and Betts and Devereux (1997) study the implications of pricing
to market (item iv), Mussa (1986) and Engel (1993) attribute the higher volatility of real exchange-rate
changes during the float to sticky price adjustment (item v), Wei and Parsley (1996), Engel and Rogers (1995)
O'Connell and Wei (1997), Papell and Theodoridis (1997) study the role of transportation costs using distance
as a proxy measure (item vi). Chum (1997), Kakkar and Ogaki (1994) and Canzoneri et. a! (1996) examine
the implications of the Balassa-Samuelson hypothesis.
   3For example, the effect of sticky nominal price adjustment as suggested by Dornbusch (1976) or Tay-
lor (1977) should result in half-lives of a year or so, not the four to five year consensus estimate from


                                                     2
    We can think of each of these factors as creating permanent deviations from PPP, influ-
encing transitional dynamics, or both. For example, tariffs will drive a wedge between prices
in different regions. But in the absence of any other factos, and assuming that the tariff does
not change, the relative price of goods in the regions will not change. The presence of non-
traded goods, on the other hand, may generate deviations from PPP that are long-lasting,
as differential improvements in the technology of producing traded and non-traded goods
will lead to real exchange-rate movements that can only be erased by movements in labor
and capital from one region to another. By analogy, transportation costs will both allow
relative prices to differ and affect the rate at which they are observed to converge. Adjacent
regions, with low costs of moving goods between them, will be more likely to adjust quickly
to a given relative price disturbance than regions that are far apart.
    Attempts to disentangle the marginal effects of each of the seven broad explanations for
deviations from PPP have posed a challenge. Studying the relative price levels of cities in a
common currency and trade area provides us with a type of natural experiment in which the
impact of a number of these explanations are attenuated. Specifically, when examining the
movements in relative prices say between Chicago and Detroit, tariff, non-tariff, and nominal
exchange-rate effects are surely minimized as explanations for persistence. The remaining
factors are more difficult to rule out: the role of pricing-to-market remains to the extent
that transportation costs prohibit effective arbitrage across regions, sticky price adjustment
can be important if adjustment speeds vary across regions, and biased technological growth
combined with the presence of non-traded goods may also slow convergence.
    Our work is closest to Parsley and Wei (1996) and Engel and Rogers (1997). Both
examine violations of the law of one price within the U.S. using consumer price data. There
are, however, significant differences between their studies and ours. First, while Parsley
and Wei do examine the dynamic convergence of prices among cities, their data spans the
relatively short period from 1975 to 1992, whereas our data spans a long historical period
that begins in 1918. Engel and Rogers use data from 1986 to 1994, they do not study its
dynamic properties. A second major difference is our focus on the behavior of aggregate price
indices, which contain a broader coverage of goods and services sold in various locations. It is

international data.


                                               3
this aspect of our work that makes the results applicable to the problems faced by monetary
policy makers, whose attention is generally focused on measures of aggregate inflation and
not on the behavior of the price of individual commodities. This is surely the case of the set
of countries that target consumer price inflation measures explicitly, as well as the European
Central Bank, with its emphasis on the HICP.4
    To summarize our main results, we find price-level divergences across U.S. cities to be
fairly large and surprisingly persistent. Annual inflation rates measured over 10-year intervals
can differ by as much as 1.6 percentagepoints. While differentials of this size may not seem
large by current international standards, the real interest rate differentials they create within
a common currency zone could have a substantial impact on resource allocations.
   As in the international literature, it is no surprise that standard univariate testing pro-
cedures generally are unable to reject the hypothesis that the log real exchange rate between
pairs of U.S. cities is characterized by a process with a unit root. This result is reversed
when we employ panel data procedures, as we find that relative prices do converge to a
common trend, and we are able to reject the presence of a unit root. Using the full 78-year
sample from 1918 to 1995, and assuming that relative prices contain no deterministic trend,
we estimate the half-life of convergence to be approximately 9 years. One might expect that
this result could be a consequence of relatively low factor mobility in the pre-World War II
period, suggesting that the convergence rate should be more rapid in the more recent sample,
but we find no indication that the convergence rate has changed over time.
   What is responsible for the slow convergence? We examine three hypotheses: transporta-
tion costs, nonlinearities leading to slower adjustment to small shocks than to large ones,
and the inclusion of non-traded goods prices in the general price index. As for transportation
costs, our point estimates suggest that convergence is faster between cities that are closer
together, but the effects are both small in magnitude and statistically insignificant. We
also find evidence that adjustment is faster when shocks are large. As for the presence of
non-traded goods prices in the general price index, we study their role by looking at price
behavior of commodities and services separately. Using thirty years of available data on

   4Our focus on U.S. data has the added advantage that, in the spirit of the methods used to construct
the HICP, the consumer price measures are based on the same basket of goods across regions. This is in
contrast to international comparisons of national consumer price data.

                                                  4
fourteen of the nineteen cities, we find that commodities and services prices converge to the
cross-sectional average. As we expect, shocks affecting service prices die out more slowly
than those hitting commodity prices, suggesting that the slow convergence in overall price
indices is a consequence of the difficulty in trading some goods.
    The remainder of the paper is divided into four sections. Section 1 describes the data and
presents some descriptive statistics. Section 2 reports the main empirical findings, including
univariate and multivariate time-series results based on unit-root tests, as well as estimates
of the convergence rates. In Section 3 we examine the importance of transportation costs and
the presence of non-traded goods. Section 4 concludes with a discussion of the implications
of our findings for the European Central Bank.


1 The Data and Descriptive Statistics
    Our primary dataset is a panel of annual observations on the consumer price index (CPI)
for 19 cities over the period l918â€”l995. These data were obtained from the Bureau of Labor
Statistics and are the basis for the construction of the national consumer price index.
   We begin with a very preliminary and coarse examination of these data, The results in
Table 1 are based on annualized inflation rates calculated for seven non-overlapping ten-year
periods, beginning in 1926, computed for each of the 19 cities. We report the highest and
lowest average annual inflation for each ten-year interval, as well as the differential. For
example, from 1986 to 1995, New York City's inflation of 4.00 percent per year on average
was the highest in the sample, while Houston's average annual inflation of 2.87 percent was
the lowest. The differential was 1.13 percentage points per year on average. As one might
expect, these differentials become smaller when we lengthen the horizon from ten to twenty
years.
   We draw several conclusions from these results. First, inflation differentials of one per-
centage point per year can persist over ten-year periods â€” a seemingly long period of time.

   5The cities in the sample are, Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Detroit,
Houston, Kansas City Los Angeles, Minneapolis, New York City, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Portland, San
Francisco, Seattle, St. Louis, and Washington D.C.. The regular publication of the CPI began in 1921.
Observations for preceding years were estimated by the BLS.

Notes: Highest and lowest average inflation during each sample period.

But even this very crude look at the data suggests that these differences reverse themselves,
as New York City's high inflation from 1986 to 1995 is preceded by relatively low inflation in
the previous decade. These reversals suggest that the differentials die out, but on a decadal
time scale. Second, on average the difference between the city with the highest and the low-
est inflation is 1.11 percentage points, with relatively little variation from the 1920s to the
1990s. This is the first indication that there may have been little change in the dynamics of
adjustment over the seventy plus years of the sample. Increasing the time span from ten to
twenty years, and looking at three non-overlapping intervals, the average differential drops
nearly in half to 0.57 percentage points annually, again suggesting very slow adjustment.
   These inter-city inflation differentials, which are analogous to international real exchange-
rate changes, are of the same order of magnitude as real exchange-rate adjustments within
Europe. For example, Canzoneri et. at (1998) report that annual changes of real exchange
rates relative to the German deutschemark between 1973 and 1991 range from 0.1 percentage
points per year for Belgium to -2.0 percentage points per year for Italy whereas over this
same period, the maximum average inflation differential across U.S. cities was 0.52 percentage
points per year. Furthermore, as noted in the October 1999 ECB Bulletin, the size of inflation
differentials across the Euro area during 1999 was 'around 2 percentage points between the
highest and lowest rate of HICP increase. (pg. 36)'

                Figure 1: Log Price Levels, Relative to Cross-Sectional Average

      Next, we plot the data to give a graphical impression of the convergence in relative prices.
To do this, we need some sort of base. To foreshadow the more detailed work in the next
section, we compute the log price in each city relative to the cross-sectional mean. Figure 1
displays the deviations from this mean of the log price in Chicago, San Francisco, Atlanta,
and New York, respectively.
      The impression one gets from the figure is that deviations from PPP between U.S. cities
are at least as persistent as those observed between nations. Beginning with Chicago and
New York City, cumulative deviations in excess of five percentage points are common, and
appear to occur in cycles lasting on the order of ten years. San Francisco's experience
suggests the possibility of cycles around an upward trend, as its log price level shows no
tendency to revert to the common mean.
      This preliminary examination of the data suggests that U.S. inter-city real exchange rates
exhibit significant movements that persist for many years. We now proceed with a detailed
examination of their timeâ€”series properties.




                                                 7
2 Econometric Analysis
     The purpose of the analysis of this section is to study two properties of the city price data.
First we are interested in whether or not real prices between cities are unit root processes.
That is to say, we ask whether the real exchange rates between cities contain a stochastic
trend, or unit root, and so they diverge from one another. The alternative hypothesis in our
statistic tests is that the level of prices in various cities converge to a steady-state value in
the long run.
    In our panel econometric analysis we account for a common time effect (the cross-sectional
mean), and so our results are invariant to the choice of a numeraire city. If the level of prices
in San Francisco relative to the cross-sectional mean contains a unit root, it would mean
that relative prices would wander apart indefinitely â€” the real exchange rate could become
arbitrarily high or low. This result would be very troubling, as it would imply extreme factor
immobility.
   Univariate unit-root tests, of the type pioneered by Dickey and Fuller, have notoriously
low power â€” it is difficult to reject the unit root null when it is in fact false. One way that
researchers have confronted this problem has been to exploit the panel dimension of data
available in certain applications. We employ two separate procedures: one due to Levin and
Lin (1993) (LL) and the second derived by Tm, Pesaran and Shill (1996) (IPS).6
    We examine the following characterization of the data:

                                  = cv + B + f3q_i +              zXq_ + i,t                             (1)
                                                           j=1

where q is the log-price level of city i at time 1, a is a city-specific constant to control for
non-time-dependent heterogeneity across cities, and 8 is a common time effect. The 'yjs
are lag coefficients in the process characterizing qit, 3j   â€” 1, and pi                          'yij. The
approximate half-life of a shock to q is computed as â€” ln(2)/ ln(p) .

   6See  the Appendix for a description of both procedures.
    7Estimation of (1) requires a choice for k, which we determine by Campbell and Perron's (1991) top-down
t-test approach. We start with k = 6, estimate equation (2), and then if the absolute value of the t-ratio for
    is less than 1.96, we ret k = 5 and reestimate the equation. The process is repeated until the t-ratio
of the estimated coefficient with the longest lag exceeds 1.96.


                                                     8
    It is important to include fixed effects in a panel setting. The variation of cx across cities
allows us to account for possible heterogeneity, such as differing income levels and sales
taxes, which can lead to permanent differences in relative prices across cities. The common
time effects, O, which we cannot estimate in a univariate setting, capture the influence of
macroeconomic shocks that induce cross-sectional dependence in real exchange rates. It is
straightforward to account for these fixed effects by subtracting the cross-sectional mean of
the real exchange rate each period and basing the tests on the transformed data. Computa-
tionally, this is identical to including common time dummy variables in the regression (1).
We also note that the panel analysis makes it unnecessary for us to select a numeraire city
since any movements in a numeraire price level are absorbed into the common time effect.
This is potentially an advantage of the panel analysis since univariate results may not be
robust to the choice of the numeraire.5
    Our interest is in the parameters on the lagged log of the price level, qj. These are the
3's. The closer the estimates are to zero, the longer the estimated half-life of a shock and
the more likely it is that the price data are nonstationary. The null hypothesis in both of the
test procedures we employ are formulated such that each series contains a unit root. That
is, H0 : j3 = j3 = U for all i. Where the LL and IPS tests differ is in their treatment of /3
under the alternative hypothesis. In the LL test, the alternative is Ha = /3 < 0, whereas
in the IPS test the alternative permits heterogeneity across the individuals, with Ha j3 < 0
for some i. Bowman (1998) and Maddala and Wu (1997) find that the IPS test has more
power than LL. The LL procedure, on the other hand, has the advantage of providing us
th a panel estimator of p, while the IPS procedure does not. In addition, the low power
of the LL test allows us to err on the side of caution since it is unlikely that the behavior of
only one or two outlier series will cause the unit-root null to be rejected.
    The asymptotic distributions derived by LL and IPS for their test statistics assume that
the error term is independent across individuals and time. Our strategy of including common
time effects can account for the cross-sectional dependence only asymptotically, as the off-

   8Panel analyses of international PPP cannot get away from the numeraire problem because national
real exchange rates all require the use of the nominal exchange rate in their construction. Papell and
Theodiridis (1997) show how international tests of PPP are dependent on the choice of the numeraire
currency.


                                                 9
diagonal elements of the residual covariance matrix of the panel system, that is the E(ce)
for i  j, are of O(N'). To control for residual dependence across cities, we calculate
p-values of the LL and IPS test statistics from a parametric bootstrap consisting of 2000
replications using the estimated error-covariance matrix in the data-generating process.9
    The LL procedure is computationally equivalent to estimating (1), allowing for differential
degrees of serial correlation across individuals (different k), while constraining j3 = = iâ€”p
to be identical. Their procedure also controls for heteroskedasticity across individuals and
provides us with a panel estimate of persistence, p. LL suggest two tests statistics: one
based on the panel estimate of 3 and the other on the studentized coefficient of 3, which we
label '7W. LL go on to show that the sampling properties of T are superior to those of 3, and

so we base our inferences only on r.
   To do the IPS test, we run the augmented Dickeyâ€”Fuller (ADF) regression for each i
individually and let i be the studentized coefficient from the ith ADF regression. Since the
6it are assumed to be independent across individuals, the i are also independent. IPS show
that the cross-sectional average F = (1/N)        is asymptotically normally distributed.
However, as in the LL test, our tests are based on a parametric bootstrap distribution of t)Â°
    Table 2 displays the results of the LL and IPS tests. We examine both the full sample
and a number of subsamples. We omit a deterministic trend as being inconsistent with the
PPP hypothesis we wish to examine.11 Overall, the tests allow us to reject the unit-root null
in a vast majority of the cases. That is to say, regardless of the procedure or the sample
period, there is very little evidence of a stochastic trend in the city price data.
    Having obtained evidence that relative prices converge across cities, we are now interested
in the speed of convergence based on the persistence parameters: the p. Since the LL model
is based on restricting Pi to be equal across all cities, we simply report the estimated value.

   90'Connell (1997) suggests a generalized least squares estimator by adopting a parametric model of
the cross-sectional dependence. That procedure also requires the serial correlation across individuals to be
homogeneous (k = k) for all i, which is not true in our data.
  'Â°The LL and IFS procedures and our parametric bootstrap are described in detail in the Appendix.
  1tWe replicated the results in Table 2 for the case in which a deterministic trend was included in the
specification. As one would expect, allowing for a trend in the real exchange rates between cities reduces
the estimated half-lives substantially. When the trend is included, the estimates fall by more than half, to
between 2 and 4 years. The problem with these results is that there is no economic basis for expecting real
exchange rates to trend over long periods.

For the IPS model, p differs across cities, and so we report results based on the average
across i. Since the estimated serial correlation coefficient is biased down in small samples,
we bias-adjust the panel estimates of p using the formula suggested by Nickell (1981).12 We
label the resulting estimate as 'adjusted 1b'. For the IPS procedure, we compute the average
of the bias-adjusted j5's, which we denote 'adjusted '.
    From the adjusted ,3 and the adjusted 0 we compute the adjusted half-life of divergences
from PPP for cities in our sample. The results are reported in the far right column of
Table 2. Beginning with the full-sample estimates, we find that the half-life to convergence
is estimated to be in the neighborhood of 9 years â€” 8.5 years using LL and 9.7 years using
'PS.
    In our sub-sample analysis, we examine 20-year subperiods extending from 1936â€”1955,
1956â€”1975, and 1976â€”1995. We continue to be able to reject the unit-root null in most cases.
The pattern of the adjusted half-life estimates is somewhat puzzling, however. One would
expect that convergence rates would be faster in more recent years than in the pre-WWII
period, but the data do not show a clear pattern â€” the estimated adjusted half-lives do
not decline as the sample moves closer to the present. Point estimates of p are quite large
during 1956â€”1975. The implied half-life of convergence for the most recent period is between
8 and 9 years, approximately the same as both the full sample and the earlier period. This
last period corresponds roughly to the period studied in international PPP studies and the
Parsley and Wei study, where estimated half-lives of two to four are the norm.
   To summarize our results, regardless of the econometric method, we strongly reject the
hypothesis that all real exchange rates between the U.S. cities in our sample contain a unit
root. While relative price levels are stationary, their deviations are very persistent. We
estimate half-lives to convergence of approximately 9 years. It is interesting to ask why
these estimates are so large. In the next section we pursue this line of inquiry.

  12Nickell's formula is, plimN(P â€” p) = (ATBT)/CT, where AT = â€”(1 + p)/(T â€”1), ET = 1â€” (1/T) (1â€”
         p), and CT = I
       â€”                  â€”
                             2p(l â€” BT)/[(1 â€” p)(T â€”1)]. Canzoneri et. at. (1996) perform a small Monte
Carlo experiment from which they determined that Nickel's adjustment is reasonably accurate.

3 Additional Characteristics of the Data
   In this section, we explore other features of these price-indices in an attempt to gain
additional perspective into why convergence is so slow. In section 3.1 we examine the role of
distance between two cities as a determinant not only of the size of the real exchange rate,
bnt also of the persistence in the deviation from PPP. Section 3.2 examines the data for
possible nonlinearities in the reversion towards the long-run real exchange-rate mean. Here,
we explore the possibility that most of the time we are looking at slow responses to small
deviations, and that, if and when large disturbances occur, responses would be more rapid.


3.1 Distance
   We follow Engel (1993), Engel and Rogers (1996) and Parsley and Wei (1996) by using
distance to proxy for unobservable transportation costs. Table 3 reports the results of sev-
eral cross-sectional regressions in which the independent variable is either the logarithm of
distance between city 'i' and the numeraire city of Chicago or the double log of distance.
   The dependent variable in the first regression is the volatility of the log real exchange
rate, denoted V(q), which is measured as the time-series sample standard deviation of q.
As in Engelâ€”Rogers and Parsleyâ€”Wei, we find that locations that are farther apart exhibit
statistically significantly higher volatility in the log of their relative price levels. The point
estimates of the slope coefficient in regressions of the volatility of the log relative price on
our measures of distance are positive and statistically significantly different from zero (at the
5% level). The point estimate implies that the New Yorkâ€”Chicago real exchange rate will be
approximately 0.65 percentage points more volatile per annum than the St.Louisâ€”Chicago
real exchange rate because New York is approximately 2.718 times farther from Chicago
than is St. Louis, and ln(2.7l8) = 1.
   Is there any evidence that real exchange-rate adjustment is impeded by distance? To
examine this question, we regress alternative measures of real exchange-rate persistenceâ€”
our univariate estimates of the persistence parameter (p), the t-ratio associated with the
persistence parameter (r), and the implied half-lives toward convergence-on the measures
of distance. The estimated slope coefficients from these regressions indicate that conver-

    The evidence from this section is consistent with the hypothesis that proportional trans-
portation costs induce a neutral band within which the log relative price between two loca-
tions can fluctuate without generating unexploited arbitrage opportunities. We pursue this
issue further in the next subsection.


3.2 Differential Adjustment Following Small and Large Deviations
   Do the data suggest nonlinear reversion of log real exchange rates towards their means?
In the presence of proportional transactions costs, the log real exchange rate behaves as a
regulated Brownian motion within a neutral band created by the transportation costs. We
expect that the exploitation of arbitrage opportunities, created when deviations from PPP
are sufficiently large to move outside of the neutral band, cause these large deviations to be
relatively short-lived.

Notes: Panel estimates of differential response of relative prices to large and small deviations from
PPP, using the Levin and Lin procedure. Large deviations are defined as the largest 25 observations,
in absolute value.

    To investigate these issues, we employ a modified LL panel regression in which the lagged
level of the real exchange rate (the regressor) is stratified by size into two groupsâ€”small and
large.'3 We consider the deviation from PPP to be large if it is among the largest 25 percent
of observations in absolute value. The LL regression is then estimated on these 'small' and
'large' observations. The results are reported in table 4.
   As can be seen, we estimate j3 to be 0.896 on large deviations and Ã§3. = 0.955 on small
deviations. The p-value for the Wald test of the hypothesis = A = 0.955 is 0.110, and
so there is moderately strong evidence that large deviations are shorter-lived than small
deviations, which is consistent with the hypothesis that convergence occurs up to a zero-
arbitrage opportunity neutral band,


4 Non-traded Goods in the Price Index
    The most natural explanation for our finding of slow inter-city relative price adjustment
is the presence of non-traded-goods prices in the price indices we employ. If the price level
of city i is represented as a geometrically weighted average of the price of traded goods and

  '3Our method is admittedly ad hoc, and it might be preferable to let the data inform us as to whether a
particular deviation is large or small. This is done in O'Connell and Wei (1997) and Taylor and Peel (1998)
who apply threshol.d autoregression models in their investigations of nonlinearities in real exchange-rate
adjustment.

where   Pf i's city i's price of traded goods, I is city is price of non-traded goods, and Ã§5
is the share of non-traded goods in the overall price level, which for simplicity is assumed
to be homogeneous across cities. The empirical analysis controls for a common time effect,
equivalent to G in equation (1), and so again we are not required to specify a numeraire city
per se.
    If PPP holds for traded goods, the first term in (2) is 1(0). Nonstationarity, or high
persistence in the relative price of non-tradables across cities, causes similar behavior in the
log real exchange rate.
    In order to analyze the role of non-traded-goods prices in the price level we examine the
components of the real exchange rate in equation (2) using a BLS price series on services
as our measure of non-traded-goods prices, and a similar price series on commodities as our
measure of traded-goods prices. Unfortunately, these are only available for fourteen cities
beginning in 1966, and so we restrict the remainder of our analysisto this reduced sample'4
    As we did in Sections 1 and 2, we present both descriptive information on the infla-
tion divergence within our sample and statistical evidence on the stationarity and speed of
convergence for the various price series. Table 5 presents information analogous to that in
Table 1 for the all-items CPI, traded and non-traded goods inflation, and the traded/non-
traded goods relative price. We note several key features of the data. First, as was the case
with the longer time-series, the inflation differences are again quite large. Even for traded
goods, inflation differences are as high as an average one percentage point per year for a
decade. For non-traded-goods prices, the differences are even larger, rising to as high as
2 percentage points per year on average for ten years. Given the presumed high degree of
labor and capital mobility in the U.S., these divergences strike us as extremely large.
    The data are, however, generally consistent with the hypothesis that inflation is converg-

ing, albeit slowly. The 29-year samples show maximum differences of one-half to one-third
those during the 10 year periods. Looking further, we see that non-traded-goods price in-
flation has larger divergences than both traded-goods price inflation and the all-items CPI.
This is as we would expect. The only anomaly in the table is that the full-sample maximum
difference for traded-goods price inflation exceeds that for the overall index. Over the 1967
to 1995 sample the maximum divergence for the all-items CPI an average of 0.34 percentage
points per year between Cleveland and St. Louis. For traded-goods prices, the maximum is
0.42 percentage points.
    Moving to the formal statistical tests, Table 6 reports a set of results for the aggregate
price index (CPI), the price of tradables (PT), and the price of non-tradables (P). We are
able to reject the presence of a unit root in nearly all of the price series using both the LL
and the IPS procedures.t5
   One mystery emerges from these results. We expect that traded-goods prices should
adjust more rapidly than both non-traded-goods prices and the overall index. Here the
evidence is decidedly mixed. If one takes the results of the IPS test, then the theory is

trend, the half-lives are reduced significantly.

validated. Using the results from the LL procedure, however, the deviations from PPP are
more persistent for the component parts of the index than for the CPI as a whole.
    We simply note that data availability hampered our ability to examine whether these
results could be explained by either real wage or productivity differentials. Real wage data
is only available by state, and no regional productivity data is collected.16 As a result, we
are unable to test the extent to which either productivity or income differentials can account
for test results.
    To summarize the results of this section, we find that there is long-run adjustment toward
PPP for both traded (commodities) and norttraded goods (services). The slow adjustment
of the overall consumer price index is induced by the behavior of the prices of nontraded
goods.

  t6Recent work by Alberola-Ila and TyrvÃ£inen (1999) on European data suggests that one needs both wage
aud productivity data to provide an adequate test of the Balassa-Samuelson hypothesis.

5 Lessons for the European Central Bank
    Our analysis of priceâ€”level behavior across cities within the U.S. has raised a number of
puzzles. While we find persuasive evidence to reject the hypothesis that the real exchange
rate between two cities contains a unit root, the deviations from city PPP are substantially
more persistent than deviations from international PPP. Our estimated inter-city PPP con-
vergence rates are approximately 9 years, or roughly 3 times the cross-national estimates.
Moreover, the deviations from city PPP are substantially more persistent than estimates of
the deviation from the law of one price found by other researchers.
   We examined three possible explanations for the slowness of the movements in inter-city
relative prices: transportation costs, nonlinearities leading to slower adjustment to small
shocks than to large ones, and the presence of non-traded goods. We find evidence suggesting
that all of these explanations play some role: distance slows adjustment, adjustment is faster
when shocks are large, and non-traded goods prices converge more slowly than those of traded
goods do.
   What does this all mean for the European Central Bank? One issue that confronts the
ECB is the impact and persistence of regional inflation divergence. As noted by Walton and
DÃ©o (1999a, 1999b), large inflation differentials among regions cause a number of difficulties.
First, they create real interest-rate differences. Given that under normal circumstances, the
real interest rate fluctuates in a range of between zero and eight percent or so, inflation
differentials of one to two percentage points are quite large.'7 Furthermore, such persis-
tent differentials in inflation mount up, resulting in price levels that differ by ten to fifteen
percentage points      a sizeable amount.
  Second, monetary policy operates by fixing nominal interest rates throughout the com-
mon currency area. This has several implications. Since third party arbitrageurs operating
outside of the monetary union will ensure equalization of nominal interest rates on debt
(e.g., sovereign debt) of identical default risk, heterogeneity of inflation rates will imply
vastly different real interest rates across nations, affecting their ability to service their debts.
   Beyond this, areas that are doing well, with high levels of aggregate demand, will tend to

 1tSee Chart 5 of King (1999) for information on the post-WWIJ U.S., for example.


                                                 19
have higher levels of inflation than regions with low levels of activity. Higher local demand
leads to higher inflation and lower real interest rates, driving demand up even more. As a
result, the policy that fixes nomiral rates has the potential to be procyclical.
    The U.S. Federal Reserve generally ignores these regional inflation differences. It is nearly
impossible to find evidence in the deliberations of the Federal Open Market Committee of
any consideration being given to such issues.
    The ECB is likely to ignore these differences as well. To see why, consider the fact that
the ECB's stated inflation objective is a year-on-year change in the HICP of not more than
two percent. If inflation in the Euro area is near the two percent maximum, then how big
would a change in inflation in an individual country have to be to trigger ECB action? The
answer clearly depends on the size of the country. An increase in German inflation of 0.3
percent will increase the HICP by 0.1 percent. But it takes an increase in Irish inflation
of 11.1 percent to lead to the same 0.1 percent rise in the HICP.18 In other words, since
Ireland's economy is less than one percent of the Euro area total, it's inflation can diverge
from the average by a factor of 100 before anything would be done. This range is a bit wider
than that implied by population weights for the U.S. cities, where a rise of 0.1 percent in
the U.S. CPI, all other cities equal, would require a rise of about 2 percent in prices in Los
Angeles, but about 15 percent if the increase were limited to the Cincinnati area.19
    Given that monetary policy will not be able to react to the imbalances that result from
inflation differences across countries of the Euro area, what will? First, factors will move,
but gradually. Capital will flow in response to differences in real interest rates, and labor will
move in response to differences in the cost of living. Casual observation certainly leaves the
impression that both labor and capital is more mobile within the U.S. than they are within
Europe. While these factor market characteristics may be changing in Europe following the
implementation of monetary union, for the time being, the apparently higher degree of mo-
bility in the U.S. leads us to view our estimates of the speed of price-level convergence across
American cities as an upper bound on the rates that members of the European currency
union are likely to experience.

 18See Walton and DÃ©o (1999a) Table 2.
 19These estimates are based on the 1996 population levels, as the BLS does not publish city expenditure
weights that would be the exact analog to the HICPs county weights that are based on GDP.

                                                  20
   Second, the U.S. has a centralized fiscal authority that is better equipped than its Euro-
pean counterpart to offset such shocks through regional transfers. For example, the American
unemployment insurance system is primarily a federal program that serves to redistribute
income from relatively more to relatively less prosperous regions of the country. The U.S.
federal fiscal system reduces the pressure on domestic monetary policy to resolve conflicting
demands arising from regional differences. While the mechanism does exist for redistribu-
tion of resources across European national boundaries, at this point the amounts involved
continue to be very small.
   We close by noting that the countries of the Euro area face an additional challenge in the
transition following monetary union. Initially, there may be wide inflation differences across
conntries that are justified by fundamentals. In particular, the conversion rates chosen for
the fixing of exchange rates at the inception of the euro, as well as changes in local regulation
and taxation, will create a need for one-time changes in price levels. Our results suggest that
these adjustments may occur very slowly.

A. Appendix
Al. The Levin and Lin Test
    The LL test proceeds as follows:

   1. Eliminate the common time effect 9 by snbtracting the cross-sectional mean from the
      data. The basic unit of analysis is = â€” (1/N) L1 q.
   2. For each city,

         (a) Regress &j on a constant, (possibly) a trend, and k lagged values of &j where
             the lag lengths k are determined by Campbell and Perron's (1991) procedure as
             discussed in footnote 6. Let   denote the residuals from the regression.
         (b) Regress ,t_-i on the same variables in part (2a) above and let       denote the
             residuals from this regression.
         (c) Regress     on      (no constant). Denote the residuals from this third regression
             by ,t. Use the standard error of this regression, & = /(T â€” â€” 1)â€”i >t k+2
             to normalize Ãª and           Denote the normalized values by = Ãªi,t/&ei and
                   =
   3.   Run the panel OLS regression        = /3i3,t_-i + u. In our analysis of nonlinear adjust-
        ment, it is the values of      that we stratify into groups in estimating the adjustment
        following 'large' and 'small' deviations from PPP.
  4. The LL test statistic, r, is the studentized coefficient from the panel OLS regression
     (the reported t-statistic). The asymptotic distribution of is nonstandard and LL pro-
     vide adjustments to r that result in an asymptotically standard normal variate under
     the null hypothesis and under the assumption that the errors are contemporaneously
     uncorrelated. We do not use their adjustment since we allow for contemporaneous cor-
     relation across individual cities and bootstrap r directly. The bootstrap is described
        below.

A2. The In, Pesaran and Shin F Test
    To conduct the IPS I test, first remove the common time effect by performing step 1 of
the LL test. For each city, run the augmented Dickeyâ€”Fuller regression of a4 on
a constant, (possibly) a trend, and /c lagged values of         with lag lengths k determined
by Campbell and Perron's (1991) procedure. Let t denote the studentized coefficient (the
ft-statistic' for the coefficient on i,t_l) from the univariate ADF test. The IPS test statistic
is I = (1/N)         t.
    Under the null hypothesis that each of the series contains a unit root and that they are
cross-sectionally independent, IPS show that the asymptotic distributions of the LR-bar and

                                                22
t-bar statistics are nonstandard and do not have analytic expressions. IPS has tabulated
critical values by Monte Carlo simulation assuming that the cross-sectional correlation of
the errors are zero. We rely on the parametric bootstrap distribution of the Estatistic which
we built by allowing for cross-sectional dependence.

A3. The Parametric Bootstrap
    We generate our parametric bootstrap distributions for the unit-root test statistics with
the data generating process (DGP),

                                     =j   +        Aqt_ + cj.                           (Al)
                                              3i
Each    is modeled as a unit root process in which its first difference follows a univariate
autoregression. Ideally, one might prefer to specify the DGP as an unrestricted vector
autoregression for all 19 cities, but estimating such a large system turns out not to be
feasible.
    The individual equations of the DGP are fitted by least squares with k determined by the
Campbellâ€”Perron rule. When linear trends are included in the test equations, constants are
included hi eq.(A.1). We account for dependence across cross-sectional units by estimating
the joint error covariance matrix E = E(câ‚¬) where e = (Cu, . . . , cN) from the OLS residuals.
    The bootstrap distribution for r and f is built as follows.
   1. Draw a sequence of length T + 100 innovation vectors from       r'.'   N(0, E).
   2. Generate pseudoâ€”observations           = 1,... ,N,t   = 1,... ,T+100 according to (Al)
      using estimated values of the coefficients.

   3. Drop the first 100 pseudo-observations, then run the LL or the IPS test on the pseudo-
      data. This yields a realization of r and
  4. Repeat 2000 times and the collection of realized r and F statistics form the bootstrap
     distribution of these statistics under the null hypothesis.
