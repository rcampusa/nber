     Alternatives to the Current Maximum Tax on Earned Income

                             ABSTRACT




     The Maximum Tax on Personal Service Income was intended to reduce
the maximum marginal tax rate on earned income to 50 percent. In
general it did not achieve this result, although it did lower marginal
tax rates on both earned and unearned income.

     This paper considers the effect of different tax rate structures
on the total tax revenue collected from high income taxpayers. The
sensitivity of tax avoidance practices to marginal tax rates is
estimated using four different specifications. These estimates are
then combined with plausible parameter values for income and substi-

tution effects in the supply of labor to produce a range of elastic-
ities of taxable income with respect to tax rates. The NBER Taxsim
model is then used to estimate the effects of different rate structures
on tax revenue.

        The t'hximum 'Ix on Personal Service Income, passed as a part of the Ix

Reform Act of 1969, provides a tax reduction to taxpayers with substantial

earned income. However it does not, as is widely assumed, place a 50 percent

limit on the rat,e at which earned income is taxed. In an earlier paper1 I

shoved that the 'vast majority of high income taxpayers still face marginal tax

rates on earned income in excess of 50 percent.

       This   paper considers alternatives to the current Maximum Thx   rules   which
would    be   more effective at setting a 50 percent ceiling on the rate at which

earned income is taxed. Particular attention is paid to the behavioral response

of taxpayers faced with a change in the tax rules.

       The simulations contained in this paper are made with the National Bureau

of' Economic Research TAXSIM model. This model bases its calculations on the 1917

Tax kde1 file provided by the Internal Revenue Service. This data file con-

tains a stratified random sample of individual tax returns; a random sample of'

7703 of these returns was used for this paper.

       The data have been aged to reflect 1981 dollar amounts. TAXSIM does this

automatically by increasing all dollar items by the percent increase in personal

service income between the two years. A further adjustment is made to the

number of returns in each income class. The TAXSIM estimates of total revenue

are within 2 per:cent of Department of Treasury revenue estimates for any given

tax year.

       Four alterntives to the present law are considered. Two of these involve
a   rewriting of the existing Maximum Thx rules to more effectively limit the top

earned   income tax rate to 50 percent. These alterations as well as existing law

create complicated non—linearities in the tax schedule. The TAXSIM model is
                                        —2—

designed to generate predise marginal tax rates for both earned and unearned

income to take account of these complexities. The third alternative involves a

change in the existing statutory rate schedule to make the top tax rate 50 per-

cent on all inccpme. The fourth alternative considered is abolition of the

existing ximurn Thx altogether and application of' the current rate schedule to

all income regardless of source.

     The methothhogical emphasis of this paper is on simulating the behavioral

response of taxpayers to changes in the tax law. Two types of behavior are

considered: changes in effort and change in tax avoidance. Although a well

established litrature exists on the effect of tax rates on labor supply, most

of the studies do not include the affluent, the people affected by the reforms

considered in this paper. Therefore a range of' parameter values for the effects

of' price and income on effort has been used. The literature on tax avoidance

behavior is not.well established. I present an empirical estimation of this

behavior and amconducting further researchon this topic. I use this estimated

value as well as a value half as great as estimated and a parameter implying no

avoidance behavior. The reader is free to make judgements based upon his or her

expectations ofthe actual parameters.

     Section 1 examines the current Maximum Thx law and the reasons for its

failure to set a top rate on earned income of 50 percent. Section 2 considers

alternative tax rules and their revenue cost in the absence of a behavioral

response. The excess burden placed on earned income by the different rules is

also presented in this section. Section 3 discusses the techniques used in

simulating taxpayer response to alternative tax rules. Section 14 presents the

results based on a range of paramater values for the behavioral model.

1.   The ESdsting Maximum Pax Provision


        Under existing law a taxpayer qualifying2 for the maximum tax provision is

allowed to subtract from what his or her tax liability otherwise would have been

the difference between the ordinary tax liability on Famed xable Income and

what that liability would have been if a 50 percent top rate were imposed.

Figure 1 illustrates the provision. Without the Maximum Tax the taxpayer's

liability would have been the sum of areas X, Y, and Z. The taxpayer is allowed

to subtract thedifference between the ordinary liability on Famed Taxable

Income (areas Xand Y) and what the liability would have been if a 50 percent

rate were imposed (area x).     In short, the taxpayer receives a tax reduction

equal to area Yand pays tax equal to areas X and Z. The tax due on unearned

income (area z) is unaffected by this rule.

        However, this is not equivalent to a maximum rate on earned income of 50

percent. Consider what happens if the taxpayer earns another dollar of taxable

income. Without the Maximum Tax provision he or she would pay B percent on this

dollar. The Maximum Tax provision reduces the tax rate by the difference bet-

ween what it would have been if the taxpayer had only earned income, A percent,

and 50 percent, or a tax rate reduction of (A—50) percent. Therefore even with

the Maximum Tax, the tax rate on earned income is (B—A+50) percent. This rate

will exceed 50 percent unless B percent equals A percent. Only taxpayers with

very large earned income, so that both B and A equal the statutory limit of TO

percent, and taxpayers with little or no unearned income are in this situation.

      A second complication in the Maximum Tax law which increases the marginal

tax rate on earned income above 50 percent is that only a fraction of earned

income is treated as Famed Taxable Income for tax purposes. The remainder is

taxed   at the unearned income rate. If we define "F" as the fraction of earned

income treated as Erned Thxable Income by the Maximum x provision, the margi-

nal tax rate on' earned income becomes:


                 Fx(B — A + 50) percent + (1 — F) x B percent


It is clear that this rate is in excess of 50 percent as B > A > 50.

     Under existing law "F" can be computed as:


                        TAXINC + PSINC — TAXINC x PSINC
                         AGI      AGI      AGI     AGI



where TAXINC is' taxable income

      PSINC is Personal Service Income

      AGI is Adjusted Gross Income


The reason for this fraction is that deductions must be apportioned between

earned and unearned income. The current law apportions deductions to earned

income according to the share of earned income in total income. The fraction of

each dollar treated as earned income rises as deductions decline as a share of

AGI (taxable income rises as a share of AGI) and also rises as earned income

becomes a greater share of AGI.

     In summary, the current Maximum Tax law fails to establish a maximum rate

on earned income for two reasons. First, the tax rate on Earned Taxable Income

(B—A+5o) percent depends upon the tax rate levied on the total amount of income

received (B) percent. Second, only a fraction of earned income is treated as

earned for tax purposes. In order to achieve a maximum tax rate of' 50 percent,

the tax rate on Earned Taxable Income must be independent of B and thus indepen-

dent of the total amount of income received and the fraction of earned income

treated as Earned Taxable Income must be set at unity.

 2 Alternative Thx Rules'

      As noted in the preceding section an effective 50 percent ceiling on the

 tax rate on earned income requires two features: a tax rate on earned income

 independent of total income received and full treatment of earned income as

 Earned Thxable Income. Figures 2 and 3 show how the first feature may be

achieved.
     Figure 2 iilustrates a taxpayer with unearned income in excess of the 50

percent bracket;amount. His or her tax liability (shown by the shaded area)

would equal to what would ordinarily be owed on unearned income if that were all

the income received plus 50 percent of earned income. Note that the tax rate on

earned income (o percent) would be independent of the amount of earned or

unearned income received, unlike present law.

     Figure 3 i1lustrates a taxpayer with unearned income less than the 50 per-

cent bracket amdunt. The shaded region shows the tax liability would be equal

to what would be owed if a 50 percent top bracket were in effect. Again the tax

rate on earned income would be 50 percent regardless of the amount of earned or

unearned income :received.

     The change in tax rules represented by Figures 2 and 3 might be termed a

reversal   of the "stacking" order. In Figure 1, unearned income was stacked on
top of earned income for the xirnum Thx provision. In Figures 2 and 3 earned
income is stacked on top     of unearned income. It   is essential that the   type of
income subject to a maximum rate be stacked on top if the top rate is to be

effective. Otherwise the tax rate on the favored income source is dependent on

the total amount of income received.

     It should b noted that the reversal of the stacking order also lowers the

marginal tax rate on   unearned income. This is because the unearned tax rate is

                                        —6--


also   independent of the total amount of income received. Reductions in both the

earned and unearned rates must be considered when evaluating the behavioral

effects of a change in the law.

       The secondfeature which must be changed in order to have an effective 50

percent maximum:tax rate is the allocation of deductions from adjusted gross

income. The current apportionment based on the share of AGI which is earned

causes only a portion of additional earned income to be treated as earned for

tax purposes.3 In order for all earned income to be treated as earned for tax

purposes, deductions must be subtracted either entirely from earned income or

entirely for unearned income. Of course the alternative chosen will affect the

after tax cost of the deduction since the earned and unearned rates may 'be

different. Applying all deductions to unearned income reduces their cost by the

rate applicable to unearned income. As this rate is at least as great as the

rate applied toearned income the cost of this option in revenue is greater.

Similarly, the behavioral response to such a change would be different. If any

tax avoidance takes place it will reduce the tax liability by the higher

unearned income:tax rate for each dollar of taxable income avoided. This will

be considered in Section 3.

       The alternaLive of applying all deductions to earned income effectively

levies a tax equal to the difference between the unearned and earned rates on

all deductions made. While it is clear that this will cost less in revenue it

also raises theprice of many "merit" goods to Maximum Th.x payers.

       The option of applying deductions to earned income (REFORM — E) and

applying deductions to unearned income (REFORM — U) are compared with abolishing

the Maximum Ix and lowering the maximum rate to 50 percent on all income in the

charts below.
                                       —7—


      ble 2.1 shows the distribution of marginal tax rates on earned income

under the five different sets of tax rules. The percentages shown are of the

estimated 2,720,000 taxpayers who would have faced marginal tax rates on earned

income of 50 percent or greater had there been no Maximum Thx. Note that the

current MaximumThx provision lowers the earned income rate to 50 percent or

less for only 7percent of these taxpayers. One third of these taxpayers has a

marginal tax rate on earned income greater than 514 percent. On the other hand,

reducing the top bracket to 50 percent will lower all marginal rates to under 52

percent; the sarie will be accomplished for 95 percent of these taxpayers by

implementing REFORM—U. REFORM—E will lower the tax rate on earned income to 52

percent or lessfor 92 percent of these taxayers.

     The reason that tax rates may be above 50 percent even if that is the top

tax bracket invOlves some of the income constraints of the tax code. For

example, the medical deduction is allowed only for expenses in excess of 3 per-

cent of Adjusted Gross Income. As earning another dollar will lower deductions

by three cents, taxable income will rise by $1.03. At a 50 percent marginal tax

rate, the extradollar earned will increase tax liabilities by 51.5 cents. The

marginal tax rates on earned income may be lower than 50 percent due to the

personal income constraint on retirement contributions.

     Table 2.2 hows the distribution of the changes in revenue resulting from

a change in theMaximum Thx provision. The current Maximum Thx rule gives about

60 percent of the tax reduction to taxpayers with Adjusted Gross Income above

$200,000. ThiS;coinpares with 62 percent for a complete reduction in rates to 50

percent, 149 percent for REFORM—U, and 36 percent for REFORM—E.

    Table 2.3 compares the excess burden imposed by different tax regimes. The

excess burden measure I use is explained in Yitzhaki(l975). This measure

contrasts the taxes actu'ally collected by a labor income tax with what could

have been collected with a lump sum tax and left the taxpayer at the same level

of utility. The result takes the familiar form:


excess burden =    l   ej ti2 Wj


where e1 represents the individual elasticity of labor supply, t1 his or her

marginal tax rate on earned income and Wj labor income. The excess burden is an

increasing quadratic function of tax revenue collected. If contrasted with the

revenue collected this measure provides a relative efficiency cost of various

tax rules.    This measure also takes no account of any excess burden placed on

capital income.• The W1 term reflects only Personal Service income.

     The calculations assume a labor supply elasticity of 0.1 for all

individuals. The reader may chose to substitute a different elasticity for this

estimate of "ei" to get a measure of the efficiency of any one tax regime.

However, the relative efficiencies of each of the tax changes is unaffected by

the choice of elasticity.

     As the calculation is a function of the square of the tax rate, a 70 per-

cent rate will level twice the excess burden of a 50 percent rate. Abolishing

the maximum tax, would involve an increase in revenue with twice the efficiency

cost of the next highest alternative. REF0R1—E involves a reduction in tax

revenue of 1.651 billion, but would be the most efficient reduction from the

view of the excess burden on labor income. As a reduction to 50 percent of the

top bracket would apply in large part to capital income, the efficiency loss is

relatively low.'

3.   Simulation Methods

       This paper concentrates on simulating two different kinds of responses by

taxpayers to changes in the Maximum x      rules:   changes in the degree of   sacri-
fice   made to work and save and changes in the avoidance of income tax. Well
established parameter values for these responses do not exist. The taxpayer
makes his or her decisions based upon a number of separate yet interrelated

margins: work and leisure, savings and consumption, and receipt of taxable

income and avoidance of taxable income.


A.The Effect of Thx Rules on Effort

       The effect of a change in tax rules on work   effort is the combined result
of   a substitution or compensated price effect and an income effect. A reduction

in marginal tax' rates induces greater effort by raising the after tax wage.

However, the resulting tax reduction increases the taxpayer's disposable income

producing a countervailing income effect.

       Using the Slutsky equation, this may be expressed as




                          6w

where h represents labor effort, w the after tax wage and y income. The compen-

sated price effect, s is constrained to be non—negative. 6h/6y is presumed

to be negative.

       The labor supply function for individual i can be expressed as:


h1 =   k wyj
where a represents the uncompensated wage elasticity of labor supply and          the

income elasticity of labor supply. kj represents the individual's tastes.
                                           —13—

The constant elasticity formulation may be defended for changes of the magnitude

concerned here, although this specification is not plausible for extreme values.

      The Slutsky relationship may be expressed in terms of elasticities:




Further manipulation produces an expression in terms of the compensated wage

elasticity, 6c
                                  wh
                                  y

     The taxpayers subject to the options considered in this paper often have

substantial non—labor income. The compensated elasticity therefore varies

substantially across the sample. wh/y represents the share of labor income in

total income. This has a mean value of roughly 0.15 for current Maximum

Taxpayers.

     Non—labor income affects the labor supply decision by altering the budget

constraint bet.ieen consumption and leisure:

                               (l—t)L + M =   c + (l—t)(L—h)
L represents the taxpayer's endowment and is enumerated in before tax consurnp—

tion units.   C represents consumption and L—h       leisure.   M is a lump   sum term
which includes both capital income and the lump sum payment implied by the

progressive income tax. Hausman has termed this latter component "virtual

income".

     Figure 14 illustrates how a progressive tax system yields a lump sum          term.
A worker sacrificing i hours of leisure works l tax free and pays a tax t1 on

all labor in excess of 10. The taxpayer's marginal decision is based on a price

of leisure of (i—t1) but not the full income reduction this would imply if he

paid tax on the total labor supplied. He receives an income transfer of

Ml=t10 aside fxom the tax paid tll1. The income transfer M2
                                                                    represents

(t2.-tl)(12—lO) +   t2ll;   this is the difference between the tax rate paid on the

last unit of labor supplied and the tax rate actually paid on infra—marginal

units. Note that if the tax rate schedule is known, the income term M is uni-

quely defined by the taxpayer's last dollar marginal tax rate. Variations of

labor supply along any segment, or between any two kinks, does not alter the

income term M.

     The Maximum Thx creates a further complication. The marginal tax rates on

earned and uneaned income are different, and are altered by different amounts

in each of the ptions considered in this paper. The taxpayer faces a

consumption— savings choice as well as a consumption—leisure tradeoff. The

change in the tax rate on capital income might well alter this decision.

However, the combined price and income effects of the change produce an ambi-

guous result on'a priori grounds. I assume that aggregate capital income is

unaffected bythe change in the tax rate on either labor or non—labor income.

However, the reduction in the tax rate on capital income does increase the

taxpayer's virtiial income. This will tend to depress the supply of labor by the

household.

     With the exception of abolishing the existing Maximum   Thx, all of the
options considered here have a greater effect on the return to capital income

than on the return to labor income. The assumption of zero elasticity of capi-

tal income to changes in the tax rate is probably an understatement of the

response of taxpayers to lower rates and was chosen to minimize predicted reve-

nue changes. Similarly, values which suggest a highly inelastic supply of labor

have been chosen for this simulation. Four sets of values have been used: the

implied compensated elasticity for a typical Maximum ¶Ixpayer has been computed

and is indicated by ble 3.1.

     Empirical studies of the labor supply of prime age males suggest wage

elasticities of zero. The households studied in this paper are overwhelmingly
married couples and therefore are likely to have labor supplies which are

substantially     more elastic than this. The parameter values used here imply an

elasticity of labor supply only slightly more elastic than that for prime age

males.


B. The Effect of Thx Avoidance

       In the aboie discussion it, was    assumed that all income was    actually   subject

to tax. In fact, much income received is not taxed. Tax avoidance may involve

donation of income to charitable organizations. It may involve taking advantage

of the exclusions available to some forms of capital income.            Avoidance also

includes tax preferences granted to particular uses of capital or to the

purchase of state and local bonds. Much farm, rent, and small business income

may be avoided by taking advantage of the separately taxed entity for consump—

tl.on purposes. A formal model of all these avoidance decisions is beyond the

scope of this paper.      It remains a topic of continuing research, however.

       For this paper the avoidance decision is approached at the margin. A uti-

lity maximizing taxpayer would allocate his or her resources in order to equate

the marginal after tax benefits from each purchase. The marginal dollar

expended on avoidance brings benefits equal to the marginal dollar less tax used

for ordinary consumption purposes. As a result, the price "p" used above to

compute effort is unaffected by the level of tax         avoidance.    The marginal cost

of   avoidance also is   "p".
                                          —16—


     Due   to   the ?'aximum Tax, taxpayers face different prices for avoiding labor

and non—labor income. Die price of some forms of avoidance, preference items,

Is also increased by the xirnum Tax. This is due to the "poisoning" provision

of the hximuni Tax law which treats one dollar of labor income as capital income

for each dollar of preference income received. In effect the preferences are

taxed at the difference between the unearned income and earned income marginal

tax rates, a difference which may be as high as 20 percent. However, preference

income comprises only a small portion of income which avoids tax.       I therefore

have taken the rice of avoidance as a simple weighted average of the earned

(te) and unearned (ta) marginal tax rates where the weight depends on the share

of labor income in total income, T.


                              p =   t(1_te) +   (i—r)(it1)


     It   is also possible that infra--marginal dollars of avoidance cost less than
marginal dollars. This would affect the virtual income of the taxpayer in the
same way as the: non—linear tax schedule affected it. A reduction in marginal

tax rates would lower the infra—marginal income taxpayers receive from low—cost

avoidance items and therefore raise labor supply. In order to err on the side

of conservatism I have ignored the infra—marginal transfer on untaxed income by

assuming that a1 avoidance costs the marginal price.

     While the marginal price of avoidance is known, the quantity of income

which avoids ta is unknown. I have considered the following relation:


                         Avodiance =   A(Price,Income,Tastes)

I used a sample of 7703 returns from the 1971 Individual Tax del file, the

same sample used in the simulations reported on in Section I.       The taxpayer's

total income was estimated as his      or her potentially taxable income reported in
the file. Potential income was calculated by adding retirement contributions,
                                                  —17—

capital gains deductions, the dividend exclusion, and reported preference income

to Adjusted Gross Income. If the taxpayer reported any Schedule E loss, it was

excluded. Schedule E gains were unaffected. The standard deduction and per-

sonal exemptions for the 1977 tax year were then subtracted as they involve no

avoidance behavior by the taxpayer.

        Avoidance is calculated as the difference between potentially taxable

income and income which is actually taxed. Neither the author nor any

reader should consider this a definitive measure. The definition of what should

constitute taxable income has concerned such noted economists as Musgrave and

Pechman. I do not wish to enter the debate. If anything this estimate probably

understates    "true" potential income. Interest from state and local bonds is
excluded as areunrealized capital gains, imputed rental income and the imputed
value   of househQld services. No effort has been made to estimate tax evasion.

On the other hand, some might argue that the inclusion of state and local taxes

and charitable èontributions is inappropriate. As the taxpayers in this study

are liable to have substantial capital assets which are not observed, the rela-

tionship I estimate probably understates the true effect of price on avoidance.

      However, some might argue that much of the estimated avoidance is actually

the realization of long term capital gains. I have therefore defined an alter-

native income concept which excludes the capital gains deduction from both the

income and the avoidance term. Four relationships were estimated:


i) RATIO1 = a      +8 FDARAT +

2) RATIO1 =   cx   + 8 FDARAT1 +   A     ln(INCOME)1 +   Ej
3) RATIO1 = a + B FDARAT*1           +       ci
)   RATIO1 = a +      8 FDARAT*1 +       A   ln(INCOME*)j + C.
                                                 —18—




RATIO1 is    the   share of potential income which avoids tax, FDARATj is the

taxpayer's weighted average of first dollar tax rates on earned and unearned

income and INC0fE1 is the taxpayer's potential income. The * denotes the

alternative concept of avoidance which excludes the capital gains deduction. A

first dollar rate was used to minimize possible simultaneity problernz. That is,

the rate used was the rate which would have applied had the taxpayer avoided tax

on only one dollar of income.

     There seems no a priori reason why the share of income which avoids tax

should vary systematically with income. Inclusion of an income term in

equations 2 and:14 is done to test for possible scale economies in avoidance or

for the possibility that tax avoidance behavior is associated with being rich

aside from the }igher marginal tax rates. The results suggest that income is

not an important factor.


i) RATIO =       —o.c86 + 0.7142 FDARAT
                 (0.006) (0.012)

2) RATIO =       —o.o814+ 0.7148 FDARAT — o.ooo14 ln(INCOME)
                 (0.009) (0.026)         (o.ooi6)

     Standard errors are reported below the coefficient. The income coefficient

is both small and insignficant. The price term has a highly significant t sta-

tistic and all four equations are signicant to the 0.9999 level using an F test.

The R—square terms range from 0.329 to 0.3141 which is quite reasonable for

cross section data. The exclusion of long term capital gains deductions has

little effect on the coefficient.
                                                —19—

           The usual co1linearty of income and the tax rate is substantially reduced

    by the Maximum x. xpayers earning from $60,000 to $10,000,000 may have

    marginal tax rates of 50 percent while taxpayers within this range may have

    rates as high as 70%.         In fact, the marginal tax rate on earned income falls as

    earned income rises for Maximum Thxpayers and the rate on unearned income may

    also fall as unearned income rises. (see Lindsey(198l)). The Maximum Thx provi-

    sion therefore permits substantial enough variation between rate and income to

    make estimation possible.

           This estimated response of taxpayers to changes in marginal tax rates

    suggests that 0.7 percent less income will avoid tax for each 1 percent reduc-

    tion in the marginal tax rate. This paper also presents estimates using a simu-

    lated response only half as great, that is an additional 0.35 percent of poten-

    tial   income is subject to tax for each 1 percent     reduction in the tax rate.

           As   an example of this effect, consider a married couple with   potential

    income      of   $100,000 of which $20,000 is capital income. Their current avoidance

    price is l1i cents on the dollar ( an average marginal tax rate on earned and

    unearned income of 56 percent). They avoid taxes on roughly 31 percent of their

    income. A tax rate reduction to 50 percent would mean an increase in their

    taxable income •of $14200, from $69,000 to $73,200. This is certainly a plausible

    order of magnitude. The actual simulation procedure uses the taxpayer's actual

    ratio of taxable income to potential income and adjusts the ratio by the
"
    avoidance pararrèter value times the change in the marginal tax rate.



    C. Combining Behavioral Effects


           This behavioral model assumes the taxpayer responds simultaneously to prices

    on two margins. The share of the taxpayer's income which is avoided is deter—
                                        —20—

mined by a first dollar ;rice based upon his or her potential income. The

amount of potential income is determined by a constant elasticity type of

response of labor income to the last dollar tax rate on earned income and

its corresponding virtual income. But these terms are determined by the share

of potential income which avoids tax.

     The simultaneous optimizatation of potential income and share which avoids

tax is in the following manner: first, the taxpayer's current first and last

dollar prices are computed by TAXSIM. Then the first and last dollar prices

are computed given the alternative set of Maximum Thx rules assuming no

behavioral response by the taxpayer. The difference between the first dollar

prices under current law and the alternative law is used to compute a new per-

centage of potential income which avoids tax.

     This new prcentage of avoidance is applied to an unchanged level of pot en—

tial income to generate a measure of taxable income assuming only the avoidance

response. This measure of taxable income is equivalent to assuming that the

taxpayer has a zero price and income elasticity of labor supply. Marginal tax

rates on earned and unearned income are computed given this new level of taxable

income. If these tax rates are the same as the tax rates under current law, no

increase in labor supply can be expected.

     If these new tax rates are different from current law, a new level of

virtual income is computed and a new level of effort results. This new

level of effort or potential income may lead to a new level of avoidance if the

higher potential income produces a new first dollar tax rate. If not, the old

level of avoidance is retained.

     The new avoidance measure is used with the new potential income to produce

a new level of taxable income. If the marginal tax rates at this level of
                                      —21—

taxable income equal the' earlier tax rates, a stable preference decision has

been reached. If not, the iteration procedure continues until the new set of

tax rates equals an old set of tax rates.

     A possibleproblem with this iterative procedure is the kinked nature of

the budget set. Iteration may produce a result alternatively at a high and a

low price. Figure 5 shows such a possibility. The true utility maximizing

value for the ttxpayer is 'to be on the kink. But, the iterative procedure eva-

luated at P1 will place the taxpayer at 12 on the P2 segment and evaluation at

P2 will palce the taxpayer at l on the P1 segment. If this result occurs, the

kink between the two segements is automatically chosen. The price and virtual

income corresponding to the higher segment, in effect a "next" dollar price, is

used for evaluation.


D. Simulation Procedure Differences Among the Options


     The two relevant prices, one applying to extra sacrifice, the other to

avoidance behavior, depend upon the option considered. For example, the aboli-

tion of' the maximum tax, or the alternative option of cutting the maximum statu-

tory rate to 50 percent involve equal tax rates on earned and capital income.

On the other hand, the existing ximum Thx and the two reform options may

involve different marginal tax rates on earned and unearned income. For these

latter two options a weighted average of the earned and unearned tax rates is

used to estimate the last dollar price.

     The first dollar price, the price of avoidance, is different for the two

reform options than for the former options mentioned.   If' all deductions are

applied to earned income, than the price of' avoiding a dollar of taxable income

is determined by the earned income tax rate. If the deductions are applied to

unearned income, then th price is determined by the unearned income tax rate.

The present price of avoidance is a weighted average of the first dollar earned

and unearned tax rates.

     If deductions are applied to unearned income, then some taxpayers may see a

decrease in the price of avoidance. This will lower the share of income which

is reported and reduce tax revenue.   If on the other hand, deductions are

applied to earned income an unambiguous increase in the price of avoidance will

result. This will lower the share of potential income which avoids tax and will

tend to produce higher revenues.

     Lowering the maximum rate to 50 percent on all income also unambiguously

increases the price of avoidance thereby increasing taxable income. On the other

hand, increases in avoidance will occur among taxpayers currently benefitting

from the ?v.xirnurn Thx if it is abolished. The next section examines the effect

of these behavioral changes on Income Thx Revenues.

4.   Results

       The resu1t of' the simulations are presented in 'Ibles 14.1 through 14.14.

The surprising conclusion one can draw is that it is possible to reduce marginal

tax rates and still increase tax revenue. ble 14.1 suggests that the existing

Maximum Thx provisions are probably a revenue raiser in that abolishing the

Maximum Thx will lead to a decrease in tax revenue. Even at half the estimated

value of the avoidance response tax revenues are simulated as decreasing when

the rates are increased. Thble 14.1 gives the best picture of a labor supply

response as the. current Maximum Thx yielded a reduction in the marginal tax rate

on earned income far greater than any of the other options considered. The

greatest response simulated yielded 14.7 billion more in tax revenues from the

labor supply effect alone while even the most modest labor supply response

yielded nearly 2 billion more in revenue than the no response case.

      Even in thIs case the avoidance response is likely to dominate the labor

supply response. If no labor supply response is assumed, 6.6 billion more in

revenues was raised by establishing the Maximum Thx. The avoidance response is

not the usual "supply side" response commonly discussed today. No additional

factors of production are brought forth. Father it reflects a transfer of

resources from favored activities to the taxpayer and the government. The

actual welfare change is ambiguous.

      Table 14.2 shows that a further reduction of tax rates to a statutory limit

of 50 percent will be a revenue raiser if the full avoidance repsonse occurs.

The labor supply response is relatively small. In the no—avoidance case an

additional 600 million may be raised, or $1.2 billion additional earned. The

reduction in the top rate to 50 percent will largely affect non—labor income. A

negative income effect on labor supply will therefore substantially offset the

extra effort produced by the reduction in the earned income rate. If a capital

 income response is also Included an additional revenue increase of roughly one

third the order'of magnitude of the current 1aximwn ¶Ix will result. The reve-

nue cost of a 5Ô percent maximum rate is therefore overstated by this simulation

by 1 to 2 billion if one assumes that capital income will respond in a similar

fashion as labor income.

     Applying deductions to unearned income is likely to be a revenue loser. As

the unearned tax rate may well be higher than the current average of earned and

unearned rates,avoidance may well be even more attractive under this reform for

many taxpayers. Even the maximum avoidance response will produce only 750

million as a revenue offset.

     Applying deductions to earned income has two benefits from a revenue point

of view. First,, it is a less costly option even assuming no response. This is

because current avoidance partially offsets non—labor income under current

rules. Under this option avoidance would reduce the tax liability by only the

earned income marginal rate. Second, the behavioral response to avoidance would

be greatest as the price of avoidance has been increase to 50 cents on the

dollar. This will mean that a higher fraction of income will be subject to tax.

     In conclusion, it is likely that a reduction or reform of the upper

brackets of the tax rate schedule would be relatively costless or might even

increase tax revenues. However, a majority of the revenue offset from a beha-

vioral response does not come from an increase in factor supply. Rather it is

a pecuniary gain to the government and taxpayers as a result of less expenditure

on tax avoidance. The high labor supply elasticities used in many supply side

models of the econonr may exaggerate the benefits of a tax rate reduction.

However, the neglect of the avoidance response by any model produces a serious

overestimate of the revenue cost of' marginal rate reductions.
