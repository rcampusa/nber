                                            ABSTRACT

       How will countries handle idiosyncratic national macroeconomic shocks under the European

single currency? The ways in which European countries now react to internally asymmetric shocks

provide a better forecast than do the regional response patterns of the United States. In this paper

we compare the US with Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, and also with Canada, which is closer

to Europe than the US is in its labor market and fiscal institutions. Europe’s (and to some extent

Canada’s) model of regional response differs from that of the US. Changes in relative regional real

exchange rates are generally small. Outside of the US, however, there is more reliance on

interregional transfer payments, less on labor migration, and the pace of regional adjustment appears

slower. The regional adjustment patterns currently prevailing within European currency unions--

characterized by limited labor mobility and price inflexibility--seem likely to prevail at the national

level under the single currency. If EMU aims to attain the economic and social cohesion of its

constituent nations, it therefore may be hard to resist the eventual extension of existing EU

mechanisms of income redistribution--a transfer union. We propose an alternative strategy based on

a relaxed stability pact, further strictures against central EU borrowing, labor market and fiscal

reform, and the issuance by individual member states of debt indexed to nominal GDP.
