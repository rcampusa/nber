                                          ABSTRACT

We use the responses of a representative sample of Dutch households to survey questions that ask
how much their consumption would change in response to unexpected, permanent, positive or
negative shocks to their home value. The average MPC is in the 2.1-4.7% range, in line with
econometric estimates that use housing wealth and consumption realizations. However, our
analysis uncovers significant sample heterogeneity, with over 90% of the sample reporting no
consumption adjustment to positive or negative wealth shocks. The relation between the MPC
from wealth shocks and cash-on-hand is negative, consistent with models with precautionary
saving and liquidity constraints.

1. Introduction

           Housing is by far the most important asset most households own. Hence, the

considerable volatility in house prices that many economies have recently experienced should

have important implications for household spending. Notably, such responses in spending are

likely heterogeneous across households and might differ between housing booms and busts.

           Recent literature uses direct survey questions to elicit information about the

consumption responses to scenarios involving positive and negative transitory income shocks

(see, e.g., Christelis et al., 2019; Fuster et al., 2018). The approach is useful, as it provides

household-specific estimates of the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) out of possible

income changes. This allows associating MPCs with observables such as household

resources, and comparing MPC responses of each household to different income shocks.

           The present paper builds on this literature by estimating the impact of housing wealth

shocks on households' expenditures. It makes three contributions. First, it takes advantage of

the first (to the best of our knowledge) population-representative household survey providing

consumption responses to alternative scenarios of idiosyncratic housing wealth shocks. Most

of the literature so far has focused on the consumption effect of transitory income shocks and

ignored wealth shocks.1 Housing not only represents the largest asset in household portfolios,

but it is also illiquid and infrequently traded, and has both a consumption and an investment

component. Thus, it is instructive to directly measure homeowners' consumption response to

possible shocks to the value of their own house by explicitly asking about it. This can be

useful, as it may, for example, help estimating the consumer spending drop due to a housing

bust, an important policy exercise in light of the recent Great Recession.

(2019a); Fuster et al. (2018). 


                                                               1
     The second contribution regards the analysis of consumption responses to both positive

and negative housing price shocks. As is the case with income shocks, it is important to

investigate whether consumption responds asymmetrically to positive versus negative wealth

shocks, as this asymmetry can have important implications about economic measures

affecting house values (such as changes in the maximum allowed LTV ratio or property

taxes).

     Finally, the paper relates household heterogeneity in responses to a housing wealth

shock to cash-on-hand, LTV ratio, age and other demographic variables, and examines

whether these associations are consistent with existing models of consumption behavior.

     We design a special module for a representative survey of Dutch households. The

module includes questions on how respondents would change their consumption in response

to an unexpected and permanent increase or decrease in their housing wealth corresponding to

10% of their house value. The survey shows that among homeowners the average MPC for

positive shocks is 4.7%, and 2.1% for negative shocks. These values are broadly in line with

econometric estimates that use actual housing wealth and consumption data. However, our

approach uncovers significant heterogeneity in MPC responses, as over 90% of homeowners

report no reaction to either positive or negative shocks. For those who do react, an important

question is how they finance the change in consumption, given that housing wealth is illiquid

and indivisible. We find that reducing savings or using current income (in the case of a

positive shock), or increasing saving (in the case of a negative shock) are the typical strategies

followed by households.

     In line with predictions of models with precautionary saving and liquidity constraints,

we find a negative association between MPC and cash-on-hand. This is supported both by

descriptive and by more formal regression analyses. We also examine whether households




                                                2
with different levels of indebtedness differ in their consumption response to housing wealth

shocks. We find evidence that homeowners with high LTV ratios are particularly responsive

to negative shocks. This is, as we shall discuss, consistent with the institutional environment

of the Netherlands, where underwater households are limited in their residential mobility

choices and may face difficulties in getting additional credit.

     The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the economic motivation and

empirical evidence on the microeconomic estimates of the MPC out of wealth shocks. Section

3 describes the data and discusses advantages and limitations of the questions used in our

survey to elicit the MPC out of wealth shocks. Section 4 discusses the descriptive analysis and

the regression results relating the MPC to household socio-economic characteristics, along

with some robustness checks. Section 5 concludes.



2. Motivation and micro evidence

     Most literature estimating the consumption effect of a change in house prices relies on

two implicit assumptions. First, consumers don't anticipate these wealth shocks. Second,

current house prices are the best predictors of future ones; hence, consumers view any change

in them as highly persistent.

     Under these assumptions, the life-cycle permanent income model suggests that

unexpected and permanent changes in housing wealth affect the consumption of homeowners

by an amount equivalent to the annuity value of the shock. In addition to this wealth effect, a

change in house prices can affect consumption through a liquidity effect, since housing wealth

can be used as collateral. A drop in house prices reduces the ability to borrow, and increases

the need for precautionary saving due to a reduced future ability to borrow (needed if, e.g.,

there is a negative future income shock). Both effects should reduce current consumption.




                                                3
Conversely, a positive shock on housing wealth attenuates liquidity constraints and the need

for precautionary saving, stimulating consumption.

     Note that there is a possible asymmetry between the effect of positive and negative

wealth shocks. In the case of a negative shock, households with low cash-on-hand are more

likely to reduce consumption than those with high cash-on-hand, given that the latter can

draw on accumulated savings. Moreover, a drop in the house value should make it more

difficult to borrow to smooth consumption using the house as collateral, thus aggravating the

liquidity problem of those with low cash-on-hand. One should therefore expect a negative

correlation between cash-on-hand and the MPC from a negative wealth shock.

     In the case of a positive shock, however, consumers with high cash-on-hand can

increase consumption by drawing on existing savings, while cash-poor consumers will be able

to increase consumption only by borrowing using the appreciated house as collateral or by

selling the house outright to lock-in their capital gain. In other words, the positive wealth

shock likely alleviates borrowing constraints of cash-poor households. This should in turn

favor pent-up consumption, as it can enable these households to increase their spending by an

amount large enough to match what they would have spent under no liquidity constraints.

Hence, the relation between MPC and cash-on-hand from positive wealth shocks is

ambiguous, and depends on whether the positive shock allows households with low cash-on-

hand to borrow or sell the house.

     From an empirical point of view, there is considerable disagreement over the magnitude

of the wealth effect on consumption. There are also important differences between wealth

shocks arising from changes in real estate value (which may be hard to monetize due to the

illiquidity and indivisibility of the asset) and those arising from changes in the values of

financial asset prices (which are more easily converted into cash).




                                               4
           Many empirical studies that estimate the wealth effect rely on aggregate measures of

house price changes (at national, regional, or county level), ignoring that house price risk has

a significant idiosyncratic component, and that house price changes affect differently owners

and renters. Studies using micro data find a wealth effect on consumption in the 1-4% range,

and larger for financial wealth than real estate wealth shocks.2 When trying to estimate the

wealth effect, applied research should address the issue that movements in house and stock

prices are likely to be correlated with other economic events that may have an impact on

income expectations. They should also distinguish carefully between anticipated and

unanticipated changes in wealth, see Jappelli and Pistaferri (2011; 2017) for a survey of the

literature.

           The two studies that are most closely related to the present one distinguish between

three characteristics of wealth changes: predictability, persistence, and sign. Christelis et al.

(2015) examine the effects of the recent crises in the US housing market and stock market on

household spending, using micro data from the 2009 Internet survey of the Health and

Retirement Study. They focus on negative and exogenous wealth changes, and find that the

MPCs with respect to housing wealth and financial wealth losses are 1% and 3.3%,

respectively. They also find, in line with standard models of intertemporal choice, that

consumption responds more strongly to permanent shocks than to shocks perceived as

transitory.

           Paiella and Pistaferri (2017) use the Italian Survey of Household Income and Wealth

which contains data on subjective interest rate expectations to isolate exogenous changes in

wealth (due only to asset price shocks) from anticipated changes (due to, for example,

planned portfolio rebalancing). They estimate an overall wealth effect of about 3 cents per

                                                            
2
    Ji et al. (2019) and Zhang (2019) use Dutch micro data to study the wealth effect on consumption.


                                                               5
(unexpected) euro increase in wealth, primarily driven by changes in housing prices. Contrary

to the predictions from the theory, they find that the consumption response to anticipated

changes in wealth is also large and significant, of the same magnitude as the response to

unanticipated changes. They also find evidence that the MPC from negative wealth shocks is

larger than that from positive shocks, consistent with the presence of liquidity constraints.

     One limitation of these studies is that the estimated MPC is an average of individual

responses, and hence there is an implicit assumption that the wealth effect is the same across

individuals. However, the MPC can be heterogeneous for several reasons, ranging from

access to credit, differences in portfolio composition and liquidity, presence of a bequest

motive, etc. In this paper we address this and other shortcomings of the literature by using

direct survey questions on consumption responses to scenarios involving a 10% increase or

decrease in one's home value. We are thus able to elicit an individual-specific MPC out of

positive and negative wealth shocks, which can then be compared with aggregate estimates,

and related to household resources, indebtedness and demographic variables. Of course, the

credibility of our estimates relies on the quality of the survey and on the assumption that

reactions to shock scenarios are correlated with actual behavior.

     Our research design builds on the contributions by Shapiro and Slemrod (1995, 2003)

who pioneered the use of subjective expectations to elicit qualitative responses to income

shocks. Jappelli and Pistaferri (2014) refined the approach, considering quantitative responses

to income shock scenarios, and providing quantitative estimates of the MPC from income

shocks. In some recent contributions, Christelis et al. (2019) and Fuster et al. (2018)

distinguish between positive and negative income shocks of different size. More generally,

the paper fits in the literature using subjective measures of expectations in macroeconomics

(for a survey, see Manski, 2017).

3. The data

           We use data from the CentER Internet panel, a project sponsored by the Dutch National

Bank and maintained by CentERdata at Tilburg University. The baseline survey, known as

the DNB Household Survey (DHS), is conducted once a year via the Internet and collects

detailed information on a range of demographics and asset holdings for a representative

sample of Dutch-speaking households in the Netherlands.3 In addition to the baseline survey,

households may be asked, during the year, to participate in special purpose surveys.

           To compare our analysis with previous literature, we first use our sample to replicate a

typical regression estimating the MPC out of wealth shocks. For this purpose, we regress the

growth rate of consumption on the growth rate of own home value in the last 12 months and

quartiles of lagged cash-on-hand.4 The estimated coefficient (assumed to be the same for all

households) is 0.17 with a standard error of 0.08. Evaluated at the sample mean (median) of

the ratio of home value to consumption, the implied MPC out of house price changes is 1.3%

(1%). These values are at the low-end of the range of MPC estimates obtained with macro and

micro data for the U.S; for example, Aladangady (2017) estimates an MPC of 4.7% (see also

Contreras and Nichols, 2010, for a comprehensive survey of the literature).

           Based on these results, researchers may conclude that, on average, the MPC out of

housing wealth shocks is about 1.3%. As we show below, the average of individual MPCs

from the direct survey questions is indeed similar. However, eliciting individual-specific

MPCs out of wealth shocks has a number of advantages. First, we can test whether responses

differ across households. Second, we can relate individual responses to cash-on-hand and

other variables. Finally, we can distinguish between positive and negative shocks and test for

  To ensure representativeness of the CentER panel, households selected to participate are provided with an
Internet connection if they fail to have one.

  We recover the lagged value of cash-on-hand from the 2017 baseline DHS survey.  


                                                               7
asymmetric responses. To these purposes, we designed a special module that included

questions aimed at measuring the MPC from housing wealth changes. We focus on housing,

as it is the largest component of wealth for most households. Moreover, direct survey

questions do not easily distinguish changes in financial wealth due to market prices from

changes due to active saving.5

           Besides the possibility to design questions in a population representative survey, there

are additional reasons that make the Netherlands a suitable country for our analysis. First,

about two-thirds of the adult population are homeowners and thus can more easily

conceptualize scenarios of appreciation or depreciation in housing values.6 Furthermore,

homeowners likely have fairly accurate knowledge about changes in their own house value.

           Every year, municipalities assess the value of all houses falling under their property tax

jurisdiction. Subsequently, municipalities send a notice of the assessed value to the

homeowner for calculating the property tax. Importantly, this administrative value is updated

every year based on housing transactions in the same area, giving most weight to nearby

transactions.7 Additionally, households must report the assessed home value in their income

tax form in order to calculate the imputed rent tax.

           We administered the survey in September 2018 to all adult members of the CentER

Internet panel. The survey first asks homeowners to provide an estimate of the current value

of their house. It then asks them to report how they would change their consumption of

durable and non-durable goods in the next 12 months in response to an unexpected change in


                                                            
5
   Household financial portfolios are also quite heterogeneous, implying that a change in stock prices might affect
considerably stockholders, but leave non-stockholders indifferent. Moreover, the same stock market portfolio
may itself being differently diversified across households. 
6
    This is partly due to the large volatility in house prices of the last decade: a housing bust in 2008-13 (when
house prices declined by more than 20%) was followed by a (still ongoing) housing boom.
7
    Likewise, mortgagors are typically aware of their outstanding mortgage amount, not only due to bank
statements but also by having to report the outstanding mortgage amount in their tax declaration. 


                                                               8
the value of their house. The question explicitly refers to a one-off, permanent increase (or

decrease) in this value. Given the significant heterogeneity of the home value (due to

geography, type of unit, and other idiosyncratic factors), we present respondents with wealth

changes (expressed in euro) that correspond to 10% of their (self-assessed) home value. By

tailoring the shock to household-specific home values, we avoid biasing responses by the size

of the shock.8 Moreover, framing the question in a realistic context should increase the

reliability of the consumption response. Finally, as the consumers provide a consumption

change in euro, we can readily calculate an MPC estimate.

           In more detail, we used the following question to elicit consumption responses to a

positive wealth shock:



Suppose that the value of your house increases unexpectedly by YYY euro and that this
increase in value of your house is permanent (that is, it lasts forever). In the next 12 months,
how would you use this increase in the value of your house? (You can add a euro amount to
item 1, item 2, or both).
    1. Purchase non-durable goods and services (food, clothes, travel, vacation, 
        entertainment, cosmetics, etc.) that you otherwise would not have purchased, namely
        an amount of XXX euro;
    2. Purchase durable goods (cars, home improvement, furniture, jewelry, etc.) that you
        otherwise would not have purchased or that you would have purchased later, namely
        an amount of XXX euro;
    3. Would not spend more on durable and non-durable goods and services than you
        otherwise would do.
    4. I don't know.

The question for a negative wealth shock has been phrased symmetrically:

Imagine that the value of your house declines unexpectedly by YYY euro and that this
reduction in value of your house is permanent (that is, it lasts forever). In the next 12 months,
how would you react to this decrease in the value of your house?
   1. Reduce spending on non-durable goods and services (food, clothes, travel, vacation,
       entertainment, cosmetics, etc.), namely an amount of XXX euro;


                                                            
8
 Presenting, instead, respondents with a fixed euro change in wealth would imply a very large (small) shock for
households with relatively low (high) house value. 


                                                               9
       2. Cancel or postpone for later the purchase of durable goods (cars, home improvement,
          furniture, jewelry, etc.) that you otherwise would have purchased, namely an amount
          of XXX euro;
       3. Would not spend less on durable and non-durable goods and services than you
          otherwise would do.
       4. I don't know.

An advantage of our survey is that the same respondent replies to the questions on positive

and negative shocks. To minimize framing problems, we randomly split the homeowner

sample into two, and ask the first (second) group the positive (negative) shock question. Two

weeks later, we ask the first group the negative shock question and vice versa.

           In addition, we ask follow up questions to people reporting that they would adjust

consumption in response to a positive or negative shock. This allows distinguishing between

the various possible channels through which housing wealth shocks might affect

consumption.9 Although the questions ask about consumption of non-durables and durables

separately, for most of the analysis we combine the two answers into a single one.

           The survey is a cross-section of 1,264 homeowners. It also collects information on a

number of background characteristics (demographics, consumption, income, house value,

financial wealth and indebtedness) that are useful for our analysis.

           Several features of the survey questions are noteworthy. First, consumers report by how

much they would increase or cut spending "in the next 12 months". A specific timeframe is

important because it allows us to rule out that differences in the MPC arise from differences

in the timing of planned spending. Of course, different adjustments in subsequent years




                                                            
9
  In the case of a positive shock, respondents are asked to indicate how they would finance the reported increase
in spending by choosing at least one of the following options: (a) drawing from savings or using current income;
(b) selling the house, to cash in the capital gain; (c) drawing funds from a (mortgage or home equity) loan, using
the house as collateral; (d) other means. In case of a negative shock, respondents are asked to indicate how they
would use the money that they subtract from spending by choosing at least one of the following options: (a) add
to savings; (b) invest in home improvements; (c) pay-off some of their debts; (d) other uses. 


                                                               10
cannot be ruled out.10 In principle, it would be useful to ask similar questions with other time

horizons (e.g., how would consumption change in the second or later years after the shock)

but this would considerably increase the questionnaire complexity.

           Second, the questions provide quantitative metrics for the proposed scenarios, as

opposed to questions eliciting qualitative information ("mostly save/ mostly spend") on how

people spend a windfall, such as tax rebates. Although business cycle effects can never be

ruled out, the period in which the survey was administered (September 2018) was a "normal"

one, with GDP growing steadily at about 2.5% on an annual basis. Furthermore, as discussed

below, our results are not affected by respondents' expectations or uncertainty about future

house prices.

           Given that in the Netherlands the cadastral value of the house is used for tax purposes,

the housing shock scenarios also imply a tax change. Typically, the implied change in tax

burden is small (in the order of about 100 euro per year), and hence it is unlikely to change

behavior much relative to a case without tax implications.11 Hence, in our MPC calculations

we assume that households ignore tax changes when responding.

           Finally, note that a 10% permanent price change in the home value is non-trivial. In our

sample, the mean (median) home value, among homeowners, is about 306,000 euro (250,000

euro). Our questions hence maximize the chance of observing a consumption response, as,

due to possible adjustment costs, such a response is more likely to be observed when shocks

are large. Indeed, it is possible that previous work has been unable to tightly estimate the

MPC out of wealth shocks precisely because most shocks are small.


                                                            
10
   Carroll et al. (2011) show that the long-term effect of housing losses on consumption could be larger than the
short-term one. 
11
   The amount is calculated using the median reported house value (250,000 euro) and the average rates on three
real estate-related taxes (i.e., the municipality tax, the flood management, and the tax on imputed rents). 


                                                               11
4. Empirical results

4.1. Descriptive analysis

     Table 1 reports descriptive statistics on the respondents with non-missing data for

consumption changes due to positive and negative wealth shocks. Other statistics refer to the

whole sample. The fraction of households reporting that they would increase consumption in

response to a positive shock is 8.4%, while the fraction reporting that they would reduce

consumption in response to a negative shock is 9.4%.

     One reason why most respondents report no consumption response may be that a home

price change affects in the same direction also the value of housing services consumption

(i.e., imputed rent). Hence, they may think that the shock has not materially changed their

intertemporal budget constraint, which would imply no change in non-imputed rent spending

(which is what they are asked about in the survey). On the other hand, when the shock is

positive, liquidity-constrained households could still choose to increase their spending to

approach their desired non-constrained spending. Another reason for consumption inertia

could be adjustment costs affecting durables. Finally, the illiquidity of the house could make

it difficult to translate a capital gain into actual spending through borrowing or selling.

     Using information on the house price change, one can compute the MPC for each

homeowner for both positive and negative shocks. The sample averages of these MPCs are

4.7% for positive shocks, and 2.1% for negative shocks. As discussed in Section 2, these

MPC estimates are in line with existing ones derived from microeconomic and aggregate data.

Nevertheless, they hide a vast heterogeneity of responses, with the majority of homeowners

reporting that they would not react to house price changes, and a minority reporting both an

extensive margin and a substantial intensive margin response.




                                                12
     This reported MPC heterogeneity implies that for those who adjust consumption, the

adjustment is considerable (their mean MPC is 56% for positive shocks, 21% for negative

ones), even when we exclude those reporting unit MPC (34% and 14%, respectively).

Furthermore, most of the adjustment refers to durable goods that people plan to buy in case of

positive shocks, or postpone purchasing in case of negative shocks.

     Financial market frictions (for example, inability to access products like home equity

loans) may induce asymmetries in the consumption response to positive and negative shocks.

As already discussed, when households cannot borrow to increase their consumption and have

little liquid wealth, they will not respond to house price increases. In contrast, they may still

reduce consumption when a negative permanent wealth shock occurs. This implies that in

principle one should expect the MPC from negative shocks to be larger than the MPC from

positive shocks.

     In practice, a statistical test for the equality of the two sample estimates reveals that one

cannot reject the hypothesis that the proportion of respondents who would react to the wealth

shock is the same for positive and negative shocks at the 5% significance level. Looking at

the magnitude of the response, while the sample estimate of the MPC from positive shocks

exceeds that of negative shocks at the 1% confidence level, the difference becomes

statistically insignificant once we drop observations for which the MPC is equal to 1. Given

the prevalence of zeros, we do not put too much confidence in such differences.

     It is interesting to shed light on the mechanism through which unanticipated changes in

housing wealth might increase consumption (e.g., take-up of additional mortgage debt). The

survey contains follow up questions helping to distinguish between the various channels

through which wealth effects might affect consumption. Of those reporting a positive

consumption change, the majority (65%) report that they would draw from their savings or




                                               13
use current income; 26% that they would top-up their mortgage, using their house as

collateral; and only 20% that they would sell the house to cash the increase in home value

(note that the survey allows for multiple answers, so the fractions do not sum to 1). Of those

reporting that they would reduce consumption in response to a negative shock, 55% mentions

that they would increase savings; 51% that they would pay off some of their debts; and 21%

that they would use the money that is not spent on consumption to invest in home

improvements.

           The upper-left panel of Figure 1 shows the relation between log cash-on-hand (grouped

into 20 equally sized bins) and the MPC out of positive shocks. We define cash-on-hand as

the sum of household net income and financial wealth, net of consumer debt. An additional

reason for adopting this definition is that households likely face high transaction costs from

selling illiquid assets.12

           The figure suggests a negative association between the MPC from positive shocks and

cash-on-hand. While below median cash-on-hand the MPC is between 5 and 10%, in the top

percentiles it is close to zero, with almost no household adjusting consumption in response to

the shock. Instead, looking at the top right panel, we find no clear pattern between the MPC

from negative shocks and cash-on-hand.

           The two other panels of Figure 1 refer to the distribution of MPC with respect to age,

again grouped in 20 equally sized bins. For positive shocks, the correlation between age and

MPC is positive, so that moving from the youngest to the oldest cohorts, the MPC increases

from about 2 to 6%. Again, for negative shocks we find essentially no relation between age

and the MPC.

                                                            
12
  Therefore, low cash-on-hand households in our data include both those who have low net worth as well as
those who are "wealthy hand-to-mouth", as defined by Kaplan and Violante (2014). Households of the latter
type might have a large amount of illiquid assets (such as a house) but low levels of (liquid) financial assets.  


                                                               14
4.2. Regression results

           Table 2 reports average marginal effects from probit models for the probability of

making a consumption adjustment following positive and negative shocks equal to 10% of the

home value. The specification in column (1) includes quartiles of cash-on-hand, as well as

age, gender, family size, and dummies for high school and college education.

           The probability of reporting a positive MPC declines quite significantly with cash-on-

hand, particularly at low levels of cash-on-hand. A move from the first quartile (the excluded

category) to the third quartile of the cash-on-hand distribution is associated with a reduction

of the probability of 3.9 percentage points, while a move to the fourth quartile reduces the

probability by 10 percentage points. One explanation for the negative correlation between the

MPC and cash-on-hand is that low cash-on-hand households are much more likely to sell the

house after the positive shock (26%) compared to those with cash-on-hand above the median

(10%). The negative correlation also suggests that credit markets are an important channel

linking wealth shocks to consumption. Indeed, 32% of households with cash-on-hand below

the median report that they would top up the mortgage after the positive shock, against 20%

among those with cash-on-hand above the median.

           Next, we check whether indebtedness affects the probability of increasing consumption

(column 2). To this end, we use a dummy for households with a loan-to-value ratio (LTV)

greater than 100%.13 In fact, a 100% LTV is an important focal value for several reasons.

First, in the Netherlands, applications for new mortgage debt are subject to a legal LTV cap of

100%; many first-time homebuyers take out mortgages at or close to this capped value.

Second, when households with high mortgage debt go underwater (due to declining house


                                                            
13
   To keep the LTV dummy predetermined, we drop few observations for which the LTV would have been
higher (lower) than 100% in the case of negative (positive) shock scenario.


                                                               15
prices), the cost of their debt increases when moving house or refinancing the mortgage. This

is partly because the tax code does not allow mortgage interest rate deductions for the part of

the mortgage loan exceeding the home value, and partly because mortgage interest rates on

loans with an LTV higher than 100% have a surcharge. Moreover, higher mortgage payments

reduce access to consumer credit.

     Accounting for cash-on-hand, we do not find a significant association between LTV and

the probability of reporting a consumption adjustment due to a positive shock. Columns 3 and

4 of Table 2 report the counterpart specifications for negative shocks. The MPC is again

higher in the lower quartiles of cash-on-hand, showing that a move from the first to the third

quartile of cash-on-hand increases the probability of a negative consumption adjustment by

7.0 percentage points (9.5 percentage points for a move to the fourth quartile). Given that a

high LTV ratio denotes a high debt burden and thus a likely reduced ability to borrow more, it

is not surprising that a high LTV reduces spending and that its effect is large and precisely

estimated. In particular, we find that, in case of a negative shock, the probability of a

consumption adjustment is 10.0 percentage points higher for highly indebted households.

     We also estimate tobit regressions modeling the response of the MPC (which is

censored at 0 and 1) to the two shocks, controlling for the socio-economic characteristics used

above. In Table 3 we report the corresponding average marginal effects, conditional on the

MPC being uncensored. Results are similar to those discussed for the probit estimates,

suggesting that a similar set of factors contributes to both the intensive and extensive margin

response of consumption to the two shocks.




                                              16
4.3. Robustness checks

           Cash-on-hand is defined as current net household income plus net financial wealth. In

additional regressions we check whether income and cash-on-hand have a different effect on

the probability of making a consumption adjustment and on the MPC from wealth shocks. For

this purpose, we use separate dummies for household net income and net financial wealth

quartiles. Arguably, the consumption response to house price shocks might depend on the size

of the shock itself, which by construction is proportional to the value of the house. Thus, in

additional specifications, we also check whether the house value matters by controlling for

housing wealth quartiles. The results suggest that the main driver of MPC is net financial

wealth. Net income plays essentially no role, as the income quartile dummies are never

statistically significant. Coefficients of the dummies for real assets are also mostly

insignificant. These additional results are reported in the online Appendix, Tables A1 and A2.

           Responses to the survey questions may be sensitive to the omission of variables

reflecting individuals' general optimism or understanding of the survey questions or

expectations and uncertainty about future housing prices. In view of this, we exploit the

richness of our data and add to our baseline specifications indicators of the above factors.

           First, we construct an indicator of optimism by taking the difference between subjective

life expectancy (i.e., self-reported probability to survive upon age 65, 80 or 90, depending on

the current age) and objective life expectancy (by gender and age) from official mortality

tables.14 Second, since responses to our questions may be affected by financial sophistication,

we control explicitly for respondents' financial literacy.15 Further, we check if expectations



                                                            
14
   Puri and Robinson (2007) use a similar measure of optimism. 
15
   We proxy financial literacy by the number of correct answers out of the three basic questions measuring
financial knowledge developed by Lusardi and Mitchell (2011).  


                                                               17
about future house prices affect the MPC, relying on a special set of questions that elicit, for

each respondent, the first and second moments of the expected distribution of house prices.16

           We find that our baseline estimates are insensitive to proxies for optimism, financial

sophistication as well as expectations about future house prices and underlying uncertainty. In

particular, the fact that respondents with different confidence about future house prices do not

report, on average, different MPCs is consistent with the circumstances of the wealth shock

questions, which refer to a 10% permanent increase or decrease in the home value (i.e., they

do not involve any uncertainty).

           We also check whether the MPC is related to bequest motives by constructing a variable

that takes into account both the probability of making a bequest as well as the planned

amount.17 We find that the coefficient of planned bequests (standardized by total cash-on-

hand) is negative, but statistically insignificant.

           We also find that results are unaffected if we control for a dummy denoting planning to

move. Further, results are similar if we replace cash-on-hand quartile dummies with log cash-

on-hand or the deciles (or ventiles) of the cash-on-hand distribution.



5. Summary

           We use the responses of a representative sample of Dutch households to survey

questions that ask how much their consumption would change in response to unexpected,



                                                            
16
   Respondents report the minimum and maximum values in the following question: "Imagine you own an
apartment worth 100,000 in the neighborhood you currently live in. What do you think will be the value of this
apartment in 12 months, if you decide to sell it?" Using a simple triangular distribution, we calculate the mean
and variance for each respondent. Guiso et al. (2002) first used this method to elicit individual-specific
expectations and uncertainty about future income. 
17
   We ask households to report the probabilities that they will leave an inheritance of: (i) 10,000 or more; (ii)
100,000 or more; and (iii) 500,000 or more. Based on reported probabilities to these questions we deduce a
measure of planned bequest for each respondent.  


                                                               18
permanent shocks (positive or negative) to their house value. The average MPC is in the 2.1-

4.7% range, in line with econometric estimates that use wealth and consumption realizations.

     Importantly, the survey questions elicit in a simple and effective way respondent-

specific MPCs, and uncover significant sample heterogeneity. In particular, more than 90% of

the sample does not respond to positive or negative housing wealth shocks. The few

households who do, however, report significant consumption adjustments. The relation

between the MPC from wealth shocks and cash-on-hand is negative, consistent with models

with precautionary saving and liquidity constraints. In a related vein, homeowners that are

underwater reduce consumption significantly when hit by a negative housing wealth shock.
